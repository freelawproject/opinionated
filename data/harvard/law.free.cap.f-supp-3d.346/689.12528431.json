INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an action arising from inappropriate sexual touching between two mentally challenged high school students. Elaine and Victor Swanger, parents of Plaintiff Bobbie Jo Swanger, sued Defendant Duane Mattison, a student in Bobbie Jo's special education class for inappropriately touching their daughter in her private areas; his school district and school officials and teachers; and a nonprofit organization that provided psychiatric treatment to Mattison as well as a staff member of that organization who treated Mattison. Presently before the Court is a renewed Motion for Summary Judgment by Defendants Warrior Run School District, Patricia Cross, Douglas Bertanzetti, Tammy Osenga, and Cynthia Del Gotto (collectively \"School Defendants\"), Doc. 202. Defendants Diversified Treatment Alternatives (\"DTA\") and Alvin Weaver (collectively \"Mental Health Defendants\") also moved for summary judgment, Doc. 198, which will be addressed in a separate opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The operative Complaint in this case is the Second Amended Complaint, which sets forth nine counts: (1) violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (2) violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, (3) violation of substantive due process rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (4) breach of fiduciary duty, all against the School Defendants; (5) assault, (6) battery, and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress, all against Mattison; and (8) negligence and (9) violation of substantive due process rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against the Mental Health Defendants. Doc. 77. The relevant issues in this motion were first briefed in School Defendants' original motion for summary judgment, Docs. 156, 161, which this Court granted on September 30, 2015, Doc. 169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, the Third Circuit vacated the Court's judgment without reaching the merits of the summary judgment opinions, and instead instructed the Court to assess \"whether federal courts should recognize the [Pennsylvania's Mental Health Procedures Act] broader protections as a federal privilege,\" and whether, in light of such assessment, the Court should allow the disclosure of DTA's psychiatric treatment records of Mattison before adjudicating any further dispositive motions.\n   <em>\n    Swanger v. Warrior Run Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126076\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/120/#p125\">\n    659 F. App'x 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125 (3d Cir. 2016). However, the Third Circuit's instruction was largely rendered moot on remand, as Defendant Mattison waived his privilege to his psychiatric records. The disclosure of these documents supplemented the parties' original record, and the Defendants, with the exception of Mattison, filed renewed motions for summary judgment, arguing that none of the new evidence should prevent the Court from granting summary judgment again in their favor. Thus, the task before the Court is to determine to what extent, if any, its previous summary judgment opinions are impacted by the newly available evidence. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that no new evidence has been placed of record to change our original analysis with respect to the School Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will therefore grant the School Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In accordance with Local Rule 56.1, the School Defendants have submitted a Statement of Material Facts in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment as to which they submit there is no genuine issue or dispute for trial. Doc. 204. Plaintiffs have submitted their response. Doc. 216. The following facts are not reasonably in dispute except as otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Elaine Swanger and Victor Swanger are parents of Plaintiff Bobbie Jo Swanger, who was a mentally challenged student in Warrior Run School District's special education and life skills program. Doc. 204 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. Defendant Duane Mattison was also a student in the special education and life skills program, and under the legal and physical custody of the Tioga County, Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Defendant Patricia Cross was the principal at Warrior Run High School, while Defendant Douglas Bertanzetti was the assistant principal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5. Defendant Cynthia Del Gotto was a learning support teacher at the high school, and Defendant Tammy Osenga was a language arts and math teacher to students in the life skills program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7. Defendant DTA is a Pennsylvania non-profit organization that provides individualized psychiatric treatment programs for at-risk adolescent males.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Alvin Weaver is a mental health professional in DTA's Community Residential Rehabilitation program where he is \"part of a treatment team that provides counseling to post-traumatized individuals.\" Doc. 215-2 (First Weaver Dep.) at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2007, Tioga County's Court of Common Pleas adjudged Mattison as a \"Dependent Child\" in need of treatment, supervision, and/or rehabilitation pursuant to Pennsylvania's Juvenile Act, and ordered that Mattison be placed in the custody of the Tioga County Human Services Agency. Doc. 204 \u00b6 13. The Court also ordered the Laurel Youth Services Diagnostic\n   Unit to conduct a diagnostic evaluation, which concluded that Mattison was in need of treatment and recommended that he be enrolled in DTA's residential treatment program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Mattison was then transferred to DTA's second home at the Montour Learning Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Kristen Powell, Mattison's caseworker at DTA, and Michael Jones, DTA's administrative coordinator at the Montour Learning Center, both testified that they were unaware of any sexual incidents or misconduct by Mattison while he was at DTA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2009, Mattison graduated from the Learning Center and was placed in the foster home of Pat and Bob Baier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Soon thereafter, Mattison began attending Warrior Run High School in its life skills program for the rest of his tenth grade, and a portion of his eleventh grade and twelfth grade school years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During Mattison's deposition, he testified that when he first arrived at Warrior Run in tenth grade, he talked to assistant principal Bertanzetti about a \"rumor\" about his \"history about [his] sexual issues\" prior to his arrival at Warrior Run. Doc. 215-3 at 28. He testified that Bertanzetti told him that \"he's going to take care of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mattison did not remember anything else about this conversation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiffs' counsel returned to the subject later in Mattison's deposition, asking several times if, during this conversation, Mattison informed Bertanzetti that the \"rumor was actually true,\" to which Mattison displayed confusion before ultimately answering: \"[y]eah, because [Bertanzetti] questioned me about it and I trusted him enough to let him know my background,\" without expounding further on what he meant by \"my background.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-89. Bertanzetti does not recall having such a conversation with Mattison. Doc. 215-6 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the beginning of Mattison's eleventh grade year, Warrior Run conducted an investigation after a female student, Sara Swartz, accused Mattison of asking her \"if he could touch her breasts.\" Doc. 215-6 (Bertanzetti Dep.) at 7. After interviewing both Mattison and Swartz, as well as other students who had been in the room at the time, Bertanzetti concluded that Mattison \"had not done that. He hadn't asked to touch her inappropriately ... he was talking with other boys and ... he wasn't talking about Sara at all. And that was backed up by one of the other boys in the classroom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Nevertheless, Bertanzetti implemented preventative measures to keep Swartz and Mattison separated after that incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 25, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Less than two months later, in November 2009, DTA removed Mattison from Warrior Run High School and placed him back in alternative education \"after he had sexual contact with a chicken at the Host Home.\" Doc. 215-9 (October 25, 2010 DTA Psychological Evaluation) at 4. However, Warrior Run was not made aware of this incident, because it did not involve any persons at school:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. When Duane Mattison was removed from school as a result of the chicken incident, was the school told anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. That he was recommended to be in an alternative education program for a period of time to work on his issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. So and correct me if I'm wrong, they were not told anything in regard to his removal having anything to do with him presenting a danger to other students?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. Correct. Because at that point, it was an animal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Doc. 215-15 (Weaver Dep.) at 138-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After completing eleventh grade in the alternative education program, and because\n   Mattison \"did not exhibit any additional sexual acting out behaviors after [November 2009]\", DTA suggested Mattison be \"given the opportunity to attend public school for his 12th grade year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mattison was thereafter re-enrolled at Warrior Run High School for his twelfth grade year. Shortly after Mattison was re-enrolled, Weaver was called to Warrior Run for a meeting because Mattison had been \"talking to a male peer about a girl and made a comment about touching her breasts.\" Doc. 215-15 at 201. Both Bertanzetti and Weaver talked to Mattison about the wrongful nature of his comment, telling him that it was \"sexually inappropriate and offensive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 14, 2011, during Mattison's twelfth grade year, Mattison, while seated directly behind Bobbie Jo, touched her private areas during Del Gotto's English class. According to Mattison, he \"asked [Bobbie Jo] if [he] could put [his] hand up her shirt and feel her breast and she had shook her head yes ... and asked her if [he] could put [his] finger in her vagina, she shook her head yes.\" Doc. 215-3 at 57-58. He also asked Bobbie Jo \"to suck [his] penis\" on this occasion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. Mattison testified that this incident occurred while Del Gotto was helping another student in the classroom. Doc. 204 \u00b6 48. Additionally, Mattison admitted that he \"touched [Bobbie Jo] underneath her bra and ... put [his] hand down her pants\" two or three times in Del Gotto's classroom during his senior year prior to the March 14 incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44. After class on March 14, 2011, Nathan Neidig, another student seated immediately behind Mattison, reported to Del Gotto that he had seen Mattison put his hand down Bobbie Jo's pants. Doc. 204 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26. Del Gotto testified that she and Trish Marino, another teacher at Warrior Run High School, asked Bobbie Jo to show them what happened between her and Mattison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The incident was then reported to Bertanzetti, who met with Mattison to discuss the allegations, and Mattison admitted that he put his hand up Bobbie Jo's shirt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. Mattison was removed from Warrior Run High School that afternoon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to a report created after Warrior Run's investigation of the March 14, 2011 incident, titled the \"Manifestation Determination\" report, the school decided to remove Mattison from school and ask him to return to the Montour Learning Center at DTA, noting that \"Duane admittedly knows what he did was wrong\" and that he \"has been in treatment/counseling for similar behaviors\" without expounding further on what such behaviors were. Doc. 215-8 (Manifestation Determination) at 5. The report also summarized Mattison's history at school as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to this incident Duane has been reported by his teachers to have had issues of inappropriateness with another female in his class. Duane has been under the watchful eye of administration and teachers. DTA staff members have been made aware of issues with Duane in school and they have been working with him .... During the current school year, Mr. Weaver has been invited to the school on more than one occasion to discuss issues and concerns with Duane, specifically his inappropriate sexual tendencies .... Due to a series of concerns over the course of the school year, Duane's teachers have been more closely observing his behavior, especially when he is in close proximity to female students in his class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. It is unclear what these \"issues of inappropriateness\" or \"series of concerns\" refer to, though they likely include the incidents summarized above, where Mattison was accused of talking about Swartz in eleventh grade, and when he was verbally disciplined in twelfth grade\n   for making a comment to a male peer about a female student's breasts. Doc. 210-6 at 7; Doc. 215-15 at 201. The school stated in the Manifestation Determination that it \"will not proceed with disciplinary action since Duane will return to DTA.\" Doc. 215-8 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the day Bertanzetti learned about the Bobbie Jo incident, he contacted Ms. Swanger and informed her that Mattison had inappropriately touched Bobbie Jo's breast and genital region. Doc. 204 \u00b6 33. Ms. Swanger testified that during that telephone call, Bertanzetti referenced past sexual misconduct by Mattison, telling her \"that Duane had had a similar incident with another girl in the classroom,\" and that \"[h]e said that Duane had been removed from the school [in eleventh grade] because of that incident, but that he had been allowed to come back. And he said that they wanted to get Duane out of the school district and keep him out of the school district and if I would bring charges against him that would make it easier for them to do that. And he said that if I would bring charges against Duane, I could prevent it from happening to another girl.\" Doc. 215-7 (Swanger Dep.) at 17. After learning of the incident, Ms. Swanger contacted the Pennsylvania State Police to report the incident and pursue criminal charges against Mattison. Doc. 204 \u00b6 34. On May 17, 2011, a criminal complaint was filed in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, charging Mattison with aggravated indecent assault, indecent assault, and indecent exposure based on the March 14, 2011 incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Mattison thereafter pled guilty to the charges of indecent assault and\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to the charge of indecent exposure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is undisputed that before March 14, 2011, Bobbie Jo never told anyone that Mattison had acted inappropriately towards her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. While the Swangers did not notice or recognize any signs of sexual abuse in their daughter, according to Ms. Swanger, approximately one month before the March 2011 incident, Bobbie Jo \"got quieter\" and would spend more time in her room reading by herself, instead of with the family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. However, the Swangers have not consulted a doctor for any issues that may arise from the incident between Bobbie Jo and Mattison. According to Ms. Swanger, Bobbie Jo \"chose not to talk to anyone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43; Doc. 215 \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In their briefs, both the School Defendants and Plaintiffs focus primarily on the extent of the individual school defendants' - and specifically Bertanzetti's - knowledge of Mattison's sexual history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants aver that Principal Cross was unaware of any prior sexual history involving Mattison. Doc. 204 \u00b6 54. Though Plaintiffs purport to \"deny\" this fact, they do not point to any portions of the record that involve Cross, must less parts of the record that show Cross was aware of Mattison's sexual history. Doc. 216 \u00b6 54 (containing no original statement of denial and instead incorporating by reference paragraphs 45 and 50, neither of which cite to\n   portions of the record involving Cross). To the extent Plaintiffs attempt to deny statements of facts by\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   without citing to any relevant evidence in the record, such statements of facts are deemed as admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs also deny that prior to the alleged incident, Defendants Osenga and Del Gotto were unaware that Mattison had any history of sexual misconduct, or that he had acted sexually inappropriately at school. Doc. 204 \u00b6\u00b6 50-53. However, the only evidence relied upon by Plaintiffs is that at some point, Del Gotto had been told by another teacher, Ms. Marino, that Mattison and Sara Swartz should not be seated next to each other. Doc. 216 \u00b6 50. But it is undisputed that Del Gotto was not told of the reason for this arrangement, nor was she aware of Swartz's accusation against Mattison. Doc. 215-13 at 9-10. Instead, Del Gotto assumed that Swartz should not be seated next to Mattison because \"Sara [Swartz] could be a little forward and that maybe, you know, something was going on between them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Del Gotto was not aware of any time when Mattison had acted inappropriately prior to the Bobbie Jo incident in March, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. On the day of the Bobbie Jo incident, two students had asked Del Gotto for help on their newspaper project when Neidig went up to Del Gotto and told her about what he witnessed between Mattison and Bobbie Jo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Del Gotto immediately informed another teacher, Ms. Marino, and asked \"if this could possibly be true[, b]ecause [she] had never seen any signs from Duane or anything.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Both teachers then asked Bobbie Jo what happened before taking Bobbie Jo to Bertanzetti's office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As for Defendant Osenga, she testified that though she was vaguely aware that \"there was an issue with another girl [i.e. Swartz]\" prior to the Bobbie Jo incident, all she knew was that Bertanzetti had conducted an investigation, during which Swartz admitted \"nothing happened.\" Doc. 215-17 at 14, 19. Osanga was not involved in the Swartz investigation, nor was she told by anyone that Mattison should be separated from any student. Doc. 215-17 at 19-20. With respect to Mattison's sexual history, Osenga was only aware that Mattison was himself \"sexually abused as a child by his parents and his siblings, and that's why he was in foster care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. She never heard any \"rumors\" about Mattison's sexual conduct, nor was she aware that Mattison had a prior history of sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to statements in the Manifestation Determination that prior to the Bobbie Jo incident, \"Duane has been under the watchful eye of administration and teachers\"; that \"Duane's teachers have been more closely observing his behavior, especially when he is in close proximity to female students in his class\"; and that Weaver had been \"invited to the school on more than one occasion to discuss issues and concerns with Duane, specifically his inappropriate sexual tendencies ....\" Doc. 216 \u00b6 50. However, the Manifestation Determination did not name which teachers were keeping a \"watchful eye\" on Mattison, and the only incident on the record of a meeting between school employees and Weaver is in Fall of 2010, when Bertanzetti met with Weaver to discuss a comment Mattison made to a male peer about wanting to touch a female student's breasts. Doc. 215-6 (Bertanzetti Dep.) at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As noted above, at the time of the parties' filings of their previous summary judgment briefs, Defendants had not disclosed all of Mattison's psychiatric records from DTA, which this Court deemed as privileged, Doc. 149. On appeal, the Third Circuit declined to \"address the substantive merits\" of the Court's summary\n   judgment rulings, and instead found that on remand, this Court should conduct a further assessment as to whether Pennsylvania's Mental Health Procedures Act's confidentiality protections should be recognized as a federal common law privilege, and noted that if the Court \"declines to recognize the MHPA as a federal common law privilege, it should review the DTA documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   to determine the extent to which they are protected under the narrower\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   psychotherapist-patient privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Swanger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126076\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/120/#p125\">\n    659 F. App'x at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). However, the parties resolved their privilege disputes upon remand, as \"Mattison signed an Authorization to Disclose Health Information which provided for the disclosure of his entire record from [DTA].\" Doc. 210 \u00b6 76 (Plaintiffs' admission with respect to the Mental Health Defendants' statement of facts). After the disclosure of these records, Defendant Alvin Weaver submitted to a second deposition on June 19, 2017, during which time he was asked to expound upon various case notes and records from the newly disclosed file. Doc. 215-15. Both his deposition and the DTA records referenced in the deposition were submitted for the present summary judgment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The newly available evidence is discussed in more detail in this Court's accompanying memorandum opinion addressing the Mental Health Defendants' motion for summary judgment. However, the Court need not delve greatly into the evidence here, as it is undisputed that such information was not shared with anyone at Warrior Run. In particular, Weaver testified at his second deposition that he is not aware of anyone at DTA sharing \"any treatment notes, plans, records of any kind with anyone from the Warrior Run School District or the teachers,\" nor did anyone from DTA \"discuss[ ] with anyone from Warrior Run School District - teachers, principals ... anything having to do with Mr. Mattison's care, treatment, and/or psychiatric/sexual history.\" Doc. 215-15 at 178-80.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126076\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/120/#p125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126076\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/120/#p125\">\n    at 138-39, 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Weaver testifying no teacher or representatives of Warrior Run ever asked him why Mattison was removed from school in eleventh grade, nor did DTA inform anyone at Warrior Run why Mattison left in eleventh grade); Doc. 215-6 at 21 (Bertanzetti testifying that on the day the Bobbie Jo incident came to light, Weaver came to Warrior Run to remove Mattison from the school, and Weaver did not \"share any information about whether Duane had done anything like this in the past\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (Bertanzetti testifying that he was unaware that Mattison had been receiving weekly counseling treatment at DTA during his time at Warrior Run High School).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Here, there is sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact as to whether Bertanzetti was capable of taking corrective action on the school's behalf. According to Bertanzetti, his duties included overseeing the faculty and student body as well as student discipline, and \"just\n   about anything else that goes on during the day.\" Doc. 215-6 (Bertanzetti Dep.) at 5. He also investigated incidents and complaints to determine whether a school policy had been violated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Bertanzetti's responsibilities, including investigating incidents relevant to the instant case, and his apparent authority to address these situations, create a factual question regarding his status as an \"appropriate person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because there is sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact as to whether Cross, and in particular Bertanzetti, constitute an \"appropriate person(s),\" the issue becomes whether Cross and/or Bertanzetti had actual knowledge of Mattison's harassment of Bobbie Jo or other female students at Warrior Run or that Mattison posed a \"substantial danger\" to other students at Warrior Run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Assuming that Cross was an \"appropriate person\" pursuant to Title IX, no actual knowledge or notice can be attributed to her. As discussed above, Plaintiffs do not properly controvert the fact that Cross was unaware of any of Mattison's prior sexual history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 216 \u00b6 54 (Plaintiffs denying Defendants' statement of facts regarding Cross' lack of knowledge by incorporating by reference two other paragraphs in Plaintiffs' counterstatement of facts, neither of which cite to any portion of the record involving Cross). As this Court found in its previous memorandum opinion, nothing in the record contradicts Cross' deposition testimony that she was unaware of Mattison's sexual history. In fact, the parties appear to concede the issue by concentrating solely on Bertanzetti's knowledge in their respective briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the only remaining issues in Plaintiffs' Title IX claim are whether Bertanzetti had actual knowledge of any peer-on-peer sexual harassment by Mattison, and if so, whether his actions, or lack of action, in addressing such harassment evinced a level of deliberate indifference on the part of the school district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, there is some evidence in the record that may give rise to an inference that Bertanzetti was aware of certain parts of Mattison's sexual history. According to Mattison, when he \"first started\" at Warrior Run (in 10th grade), he informed Bertanzetti that there were rumors circulating at school about his \"history,\" specifically his sexual history in prior schools. Doc. 215-3 (Mattison Dep.) at 27-29. Mattison testified that Bertanzetti told him that he would \"take care of it\" and that the rumors subsequently stopped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30. Bertanzetti, however, denied having such a conversation with Mattison. Doc. 215-6 (Bertanzetti Dep.) at 6-8. The only other evidence as to Bertanzetti's knowledge involved an allegation of sexual misconduct between Mattison and another student, Sara Swartz, which occurred a year before the Bobbie Jo incident. In that instance, the mother of Swartz reported to Bertanzetti that Mattison asked Swartz if he could touch her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Bertanzetti investigated the report, determined that Mattison \"had not done that ... and that he wasn't talking about Sara at all\"; he also determined that there was no evidence that Mattison had physically touched Swartz.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 26. Bertanzetti did, however, take preventative measures to keep the two students separated because they \"were both getting too close to each other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. This investigation is consistent with the Manifestation Determination Review, which referenced the fact that \"Duane has been under the watchful eye of administration and teachers,\" that \"DTA staff members have been made aware of issues with Duane in school\" and that \"[d]uring the current school year, Mr. Weaver has been invited to the school on more than one occasion to discuss issues\n   and concerns with Duane, specifically his inappropriate sexual tendencies.\" Doc. 215-8 at 2.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 215-15 at 201 (Weaver's notes showing that he met with Bertanzetti at the beginning of Mattison's twelfth grade to discuss a remark he made to a male peer about a female student's breasts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Despite these incidents, Bertanzetti also testified that prior to March 14, 2011, no teacher \"knew of anything happening\" between Mattison and Bobbie Jo; that other than what Bobbie Jo told him, he had no knowledge of any other inappropriate touching by Mattison of Bobbie Jo; and that he did not know why Mattison had previously left Warrior Run during his 11th grade year. Doc. 215-6 (Bertanzetti Dep.) at 11, 15, 18, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nonetheless, drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, and assuming that Bertanzetti was an appropriate person with actual knowledge, Plaintiffs have fail to establish a genuine dispute of material fact as to the deliberate indifference element of their Title IX claim. For Plaintiffs to succeed on their Title IX claim and establish that the school was deliberately indifferent, there would have to be evidence in the record to demonstrate that Bertanzetti either knew that Mattison was a substantial danger to the other female students or knew that Mattison was sexual harassing Bobbie Jo or other students at Warrior Run, and took insufficient, or no, measures to attempt to remedy the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, while there are differing accounts by Bertanzetti and Mattison about their conversation regarding the \"rumor,\" there is nothing to suggest that Bertanzetti's actions in response to that conversation can sufficiently amount to deliberate indifference. As set forth in the facts section, Mattison did not recall telling Bertanzetti anything about his sexual history during this conversation. Doc. 215-3 (Mattison Dep.) at 29. However, Plaintiffs' counsel kept returning to this conversation during deposition. Over the objections of his counsel, Mattison gave additional, vague responses to Plaintiffs' counsel's questioning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Q. And when you spoke with Mr. Bertanzetti about the rumor, he was aware of your prior instances of sexual touching; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A.

Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-89. Mattison's testimony about what he told Bertanzetti was, at best, vague and unsupported by any other record evidence. At this point of the deposition, Mattison had already testified that he\n   did not recall anything else about the conversation besides the fact that he told Bertanzetti about the rumor and that Bertanzetti said \"he's going to take care of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. But only after repeated leading questions by counsel, Mattison agreed that Bertanzetti must have known the rumor was true because \"I trusted [Bertanzetti] enough to let him know my background,\" without expounding on what he meant by \"my background.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-89. The Court is constrained to note that Mattison is mentally challenged. Doc. 204 \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 215-11 (June 12, 2007 Psychiatric Report of Mattison, averring that he has an IQ of 66 and \"observed to be very concrete, easily led, and an insecure individual\"). Thus, counsel's insistent pressing regarding a conversation that occurred years prior, about which Mattison had already testified that he did not recall, is a highly questionable litigation tactic that does not appear to be designed to elicit any accurate evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Further, assuming the conversation about the \"rumor\" indeed occurred, this discussion alone could not have obligated Bertanzetti to take any action with Mattison, such that his failure to respond \"is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p650\">\n    526 U.S. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p650\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the purported conversation occurred at least two years prior to the Bobbie Jo incident. Second, the conversation arose in the context of discussing a high school rumor about Mattison's \"background\". It did not put Bertanzetti on notice that Mattison engaged in any misconduct at Warrior Run. Nor can Mattison's testimony about the \"rumor\" support an argument that Bertanzetti acted with deliberate indifference by failing to determine, based on this purported conversation alone, that as Plaintiffs argue \"Mattison was a serial sex offender who was harassing females in his special needs class well prior to the March 14, 2011 incident\", Doc. 215 at 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In addition to the conversation between Mattison and Bertanzetti about the \"rumor\", the only other evidence relating to Bertanzetti's knowledge are (1) the accusation by Swartz during Mattison's eleventh grade year, and (2) an incident in twelfth grade where Mattison made a remark to a male peer about a female student's breasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   With respect to Swartz's accusation, it is undisputed that Bertanzetti conducted an investigation into this incident, the only previously reported incident of sexual misconduct against another student by Mattison at Warrior Run. Although Bertanzetti concluded that there was no proof that Mattison had inappropriately touched Swartz, Bertanzetti did conduct an investigation into the report, including talking to Mattison and Swartz, the classroom teacher and aid who were in the room, and \"anybody else who was in the room that may have been there at the time\", and ultimately implemented preventative measures to keep Swartz and Mattison separated.

Doc. 215-15 at 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   While Bertanzetti's remedial measures did not ultimately prevent Mattison's harassment of Bobbie Jo, the fact that the appropriate person's initial response does not remedy or prevent the harassment, cannot provide sufficient grounds for liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baynard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1949991\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/228/#p236\">\n    268 F.3d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, Plaintiffs have failed to point to any causal relationship between Bobbie Jo's disability and Mattison's misconduct towards her or shown that her disability affected the decisions of Warrior Run School District. Even assuming that one or more of the school defendants did know about Mattison's sexual misconduct history or his sexual propensities, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how this knowledge in itself led to discrimination based on Bobbie Jo's disability. According to Mattison, his special education classes were held in three separate classrooms. Doc. 215-3 (Mattison Dep.) at 31-32. Mattison also testified that he had gym, drivers' education, and art with the \"regular\" students. Doc. 215-3 at 30. As the Court found in its previous opinion, there is no evidence that Mattison was not permitted to sit next to female students in his \"regular\" classes or that the school took extra precautions to protect students in regular classes but not students in special education classes. Similarly, there is no evidence that Mattison touched any other student in his special education classes (other than the accusation by Swartz found to be without basis) or that any of the teachers or administrators were aware of his sexual advances towards Bobbie Jo or any other student in the special education classrooms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 215-13 at 9-13 (Del Gotto testifying that she was not aware of any time when Mattison had acted inappropriately prior to the Bobbie Jo incident); Doc. 215-17 at 10, 21 (Osenga testifying that she had never heard any \"rumors\" about Mattison's sexual conduct, nor was she aware that Mattison had a prior history of sexual misconduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Thus, there is no record evidence that the School District discriminated against female students in special education classes in any way, nor is there evidence that the School took any actions based on the special education students' disabilities that rendered them more vulnerable to Mattison's potential sexual misconduct. There is no evidence to suggest that Bobbie Jo was treated differently than any other student, disabled or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant School Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Section 504 Rehabilitation Act claim due to Plaintiffs' failure to present any evidence to create a factual dispute as to whether Bobbie Jo was discriminated against due to her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

To establish such knowledge, they point to the \"Manifestation Determination, Mattison's testimony concerning his informing Bertanzetti of his sexually deviant past\n   towards females, Weaver's testimony concerning interventions at the school regarding sexual abuse by Mattison and the content of the conversations involving Mattison's ongoing sexual deviancy to which Bertanzetti was privy, and even Bertanzetti's testimony concerning his knowledge of the allegations of abuse of [Swartz].\" Doc. 215 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Once again, Plaintiffs make no specific argument as to Cross' knowledge of Mattison's sexual history or any risk he may have posed to other students. At best, as previously discussed, Cross admitted knowing about an investigation by Bertanzetti into the Swartz accusation, which did not find any misconduct on Mattison's part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 215-5 at 12 (Cross testifying that she was aware of the accusation regarding Mattison and Swartz, that it was investigated by Bertanzetti, and that it was \"founded [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] untrue\"). Furthermore, Cross did not even know that Mattison was associated with DTA or received psychiatric treatment from them prior to March 14, 2011, an assertion that has not been contradicted by any other deposition testimony or documentary evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 27. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to point to any evidence that could reasonably impute any knowledge to Cross that Mattison posed foreseeable harm to Bobbie Jo, or any other student at Warrior Run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In addition, regardless of the extent of Cross' knowledge, Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence demonstrating that Cross took any affirmative actions in a way that put Warrior Run students in danger or made them more vulnerable to danger. In their brief in opposition to summary judgment, Plaintiffs make an off-handed reference that \"Cross and Bertenzetti [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] plac[ed] Mattison in the special needs classrooms with [Bobbie Jo].\" Doc. 215 at 22. However, Plaintiffs fail to support such a statement with any citations to the record. Moreover, the Court's independent review of the record has not uncovered any evidence that either Cross or Bertanzetti had any personal involvement in, or influence over, the decision to place Bobbie Jo in special education classes with Mattison. In fact, Plaintiffs admit that Bobbie Jo was placed in Warrior Run's special education and life skills program because \"[Bobbie Jo] identified as having mental retardation,\" not because any school official affirmatively made a decision to place her there. Doc. 204 \u00b6 2. The record further does not provide any evidence to support an assertion that Cross or Bertanzetti made the affirmative decision to place Mattison in certain special education classes. In addition, it is undisputed that Mattison also suffers from mental retardation, rendering it necessary for him to attend certain special education courses. Summary judgment will therefore be granted to Cross on Plaintiffs' Section 1983 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Similarly, as discussed above with respect to the Title IX claim's analysis, Plaintiffs have not come forward with sufficient evidence to establish knowledge, and therefore foreseeability, on the part of either Osenga or Del Gotto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 215-13 at 9-13 (Del Gotto testifying that she was not aware of any time when Mattison had acted inappropriately prior to the Bobbie Jo incident; and that while she was told by another teacher that Mattison and Sara Swartz should not be seated next to each other, she was not told of the reason for this arrangement, and she simply assumed that it was because \"Sara [Swartz] could be a little forward and that maybe, you know, something was going on between them.\"); Doc. 215-17 at 14, 19 (Osenga testifying that though she was vaguely aware \"there was an issue with another girl [i.e. Swartz]\" prior to the Bobbie Jo incident, all she knew was that\n   Bertanzetti had led the investigation, during which Swartz admitted \"nothing happened.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 21 (Osenga testifying that she has never heard any \"rumors\" about Mattison's sexual conduct, nor was she aware that Mattison had prior history of sexual misconduct). Furthermore, Plaintiffs' reliance on the Manifestation Determination report cannot support an argument that Del Gotto and Osenga knew about Mattison's sexual misconduct. The report states that \"Duane has been under the watchful eye of administration and teachers\" and that \"[d]uring the current school year, Mr. Weaver has been invited to the school on more than one occasion to discuss issues and concerns with Duane, specifically his inappropriate sexual tendencies.\" Doc. 215-8 at 2. However, the report's language is far too general to create an issue of fact as to Del Gotto and Osenga's knowledge. There is no indication that either teacher was involved in any of the meetings, investigations, or disciplinary decisions regarding Mattison. Further, the Manifestation Determination report does not state which teachers were told to watch Mattison, which teachers or administrators had concerns regarding Mattison's sexual tendencies, or even what these \"sexual tendencies\" consisted of,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   whether they consisted solely of sexually inappropriate comments or of more serious misconduct. There is also no evidence that Del Gotto or Osenga attended any meetings where Mattison's \"inappropriate sexual tendencies\" were discussed. Finally, it is undisputed that Bobbie Jo never told anyone, let alone Del Gotto or Osenga, of any sexual harassment by Mattison prior to March 14, 2011. Doc. 204 \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence that would impute knowledge of Mattison's sexual history to Del Gotto or Osenga, or any evidence that would controvert their testimony that they had no such knowledge. Instead, Plaintiffs merely assert - without citation to the record - that \"[a]s indicated in great depth in the Counterstatement of Facts and the 'Disputed Facts' Section of this Brief, Plaintiffs have produced evidence indicating that the District, Cross, Bertanzetti, Marino, Frantz-Fry, Del Gotto, and Osenga were all aware of her limitations, and of Mattison's compulsion to sexually assault his female classmates.\" Doc. 215 at 12. Plaintiffs' counterstatement of facts and \"disputed facts\" section of the brief, however, rely heavily on newly disclosed DTA therapist notes and Weaver's second deposition regarding these notes. As previously discussed, none of the School Defendants, let alone Osenga and Del Gotto, had any access to, or knowledge of, the contents of Mattison's DTA therapy notes. Absent this knowledge, it would not be foreseeable to these defendants that seating Mattison near Bobbie Jo would create a risk for sexual misconduct. In other words, it cannot be said that the simple placement of students next to each other could cause foreseeable harm that a student would in fact inappropriately touch another, especially since neither Osenga nor Del Gotto had reason to believe that Mattison had a history of sexual misconduct. In short, there can be no liability on the part of Mattison's teachers when the evidence does not create a genuine dispute as to whether they had \"actual knowledge or an awareness of risk that is sufficiently concrete to put [them] on notice\" of potential harm to Bobbie Jo.\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645156\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/224/#p238\">\n    515 F.3d at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   However, as noted in the analysis of the Title IX claim, there is a factual issue as to Bertanzetti's knowledge of Mattison's sexual history. Though the Swartz investigation concluded that the accusation against Mattison was unfounded, and though DTA did not share any treatment information with Bertanzetti, there remains an issue of\n   fact as to what Mattison told Bertanzetti during their conversation about the \"rumor\" when Mattison first arrived at Warrior Run in tenth grade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, drawing all inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, and thus taking as true that Bertanzetti had some knowledge of Mattison's sexual history, the Court must determine whether a material factual dispute exists as to whether Bertanzetti affirmatively used his authority in a way that created a danger to Bobbie Jo, or rendered her more vulnerable to danger, and if so, whether his affirmative action(s) amounted to deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The line between where state action ends and inaction begins is a blurry one:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   We do not want to pretend that the line between action and inaction, between inflicting and failing to prevent the infliction of harm, is clearer than it is.

In determining if a factual dispute existed with respect to whether one or more defendants in this case exercised his or her authority to take affirmative action that was the \"but for\" cause of the Bobbie Jo's injury, this Court's previous summary judgment opinion analyzed several Third Circuit cases that expounded upon the state created danger theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    D.R.\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit found no liability in the absence of affirmative actions by school defendants.

Doc. 215 at 18. This is especially true where, as here, the record shows that Bertanzetti promptly acted to investigate, remedy, and protect students against sexual harassment whenever an accusation or problem involving Mattison arose. In other words, the only evidence of Bertanzetti's knowledge of Mattison's sexual misconduct is that (1) he had a vague conversation with Mattison about a \"rumor\" about Mattison in tenth grade; (2) he had investigated an accusation by Swartz in Mattison's eleventh grade year; and (3) there was an incident where Mattison talked to a male peer about a female student's breasts at the beginning of his twelfth grade year. It is undisputed that Bertanzetti took immediate action in investigating the latter two incidents. With respect to the Swartz accusation, after an investigation, Bertanzetti determined the accusation to be unfounded. Nevertheless, after learning from a teacher that Swartz and Mattison were \"both getting too close to each other,\" Bertanzetti implemented \"protective measures to keep them separated.\" Doc. 215-6 at 25. With respect to the comment Mattison made in twelfth grade, Bertanzetti arranged a same day meeting with Mattison and Weaver wherein Mattison was verbally reprimanded for his behavior.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 215-15 at 201 (Weaver's notes reflecting that Bertanzetti called him for a meeting because Mattison had been \"talking to a male peer about a girl and made a comment about touching her breasts\" and that Mattison was reprimanded for the comment). Bertanzetti also took immediate action after learning of the Bobbie Jo incident, including informing DTA and removing Mattison from school the same afternoon. Doc. 204 \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37 (noting that the first time Bertanzetti, or any other teacher or administrator, was made aware of Mattison's harassment of Bobbie Jo was March 14, 2011, the day that Mattison was expelled). In sum, the record does not support Plaintiffs' assertion\n   that Bertanzetti \"took no action to protect the other females in the classroom whatever, including [Bobbie Jo].\" Doc. 215 at 18. Instead, the evidence reveals that Bertanzetti took reasonable actions to address such incidents every time he was made aware of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As for the conversation about the \"rumor\" regarding Mattison, as stated in the Title IX analysis, it is undisputed that the conversation about the rumor primarily revolved around Mattison's frustration upon learning about an unsavory rumor about\n   <em>\n    himself\n   </em>\n   ; there is no evidence that the conversation revealed any sexual misconduct by Mattison at Warrior Run that would have warranted investigation by Bertanzetti. In any case, any affirmative, enhanced \"monitoring\" efforts that Plaintiffs believe should have been taken but were not, would at most constitute a failure to act by Bertanzetti, not an affirmative action on his part. Plaintiffs' argument in opposition to summary judgment is only an accusation that Bertanzetti\n   <em>\n    failed\n   </em>\n   to monitor Mattison more closely because the conversation about the \"rumor\" approximately two years earlier should have in some way put Bertanzetti on notice that Mattison was a substantial risk to female students. Putting aside the attenuated causal connection of such an argument, this \"failure to act\" on the part of Bertanzetti cannot be used to show an affirmative misuse of state authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Further, neither Bertanzetti nor any other school defendant did anything to restrict either Bobbie Jo's freedom or her parents' freedom. The Court in\n   <em>\n    D.R. by L.R.\n   </em>\n   determined there was insufficient evidence that \"the school defendants either impermissibly limited the freedom of the plaintiffs to act on their own behalf, or barred their access to outside support.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1871019\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/972/1364/#p1374\">\n    972 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1376 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The same applies to the situation here. Plaintiffs do not contend that Bobbie Jo was prohibited from moving seats or that she ever asked to move seats and there is no evidence that Bobbie Jo ever told anyone of any sexual misconduct by Mattison prior to March 14, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Finally, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs could establish that the School Defendants took any affirmative action that created a danger to Bobbie Jo or rendered her more vulnerable to danger, and assuming that the resulting harm to Bobbie Jo was foreseeable and fairly direct, no reasonable factfinder could find that the School Defendants' actions were so \"deliberately indifferent\" that they would shock the conscience. As the Court noted in its previous summary judgment opinion, the Third Circuit adopts a sliding scale approach for the conscience-shocking element of the state created danger theory, explaining that \"the state actor's behavior must always shock the conscience. But what is required to meet the conscience-shocking level will depend upon the circumstances of each case, particularly the extent to which deliberation is possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

As set forth in the analysis of the Title IX claim, the only defendant who arguably had any knowledge of Mattison's \"propensity\" for sexual misconduct was Bertanzetti, who took some action to remedy and address every specific situation each time he was made aware of an issue with Mattison. Furthermore, it is undisputed that Bertanzetti did not know of any inappropriate sexual contact between Mattison and any student at Warrior Run prior to the Bobbie Jo incident in March, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   None of the individual school defendants' conduct, in light of the circumstances known to them, can be reasonably found to be conscience shocking, nor do their\n   <em>\n    affirmative\n   </em>\n   actions, if any, bear \"a direct causal relationship\" to \"foreseeable and fairly direct\" harm suffered by Bobbie Jo, such that she was rendered \"more vulnerable to danger than had the [School Defendants] not acted at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 431-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Therefore, the Court will grant the individual school defendants' motion for summary judgment because Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a triable issue of fact with respect to their state-created danger claim under the difficult and stringent standard which must be met to show a violation of an individual's substantive due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Bertanzetti also testified that prior to March 14, 2011, no teacher \"knew of anything happening\" between Mattison and Bobbie Jo; that he had no knowledge of other inappropriate touching by Mattison of Bobbie Jo; and that he did not know why Mattison had previously left Warrior Run during his eleventh grade year.

Nonetheless, the Court reiterates its analysis in the prior summary judgment opinion:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    The only affirmative action that can be said to be at issue here is the seating placement of Mattison by Del Gotto and Osenga in the classrooms. Osenga did not seat Mattison next to Bobbie Jo, and any affirmative action on her part, even if she did have knowledge of Mattison's sexual history, can therefore not be said to have made Bobbie Jo more vulnerable to the harm Mattison may have caused.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    While Bobbie Jo and Mattison were seated near each other in Del Gotto's class, this is insufficient in itself to establish that Del Gotto created a dangerous situation for Bobbie Jo or made her more vulnerable to danger than had these two students not been seated near each other. The fact that Mattison was seated directly behind Bobbie Jo cannot be said on the record evidence to be the catalyst for Mattison's sexual touching of her or that \"but for\" this proximity of seating, he would not have acted on his sexual impulse to do so. According to Ms. Swanger, Bobbie Jo informed her that Mattison had once touched her in Osenga's class (Dep. of Elaine Swanger, at 39), a class in which Mattison and Bobbie Jo were not seated near each other, thereby indicating that Mattison's seat placement did not necessarily play a role in his decision to touch Bobbie Jo. Nor is there any other evidence that Mattison chose to act sexually inappropriately towards Bobbie Jo simply because she was the person sitting near him. The only other allegation against Del Gotto merely amounts to a failure on her part to act, specifically, to \"[ ]effectively monitor him\" (Doc. 163, at 13).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n    Thus, an examination of the facts in evidence produced during discovery shows that at most, Del Gotto did nothing to prevent Bobbie Jo's injuries from occurring. The only arguably affirmative action that took place was Del Gotto's placement of Bobbie Jo near Mattison in her class. Though Del Gotto's presumed placement of Bobbie Jo near Mattison may be deemed to meet an expansive definition of an affirmative act, Del Gotto can just as easily be characterized as having engaged in a failure to use her authority to seat Mattison elsewhere in the classroom, a failure that does not constitute the requisite affirmative act for the imposition of liability under a state created danger theory.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n    With respect to Del Gotto's alleged failure to constantly monitor Mattison, this amounts to negligence at best and cannot be said to constitute an affirmative action that led to Mattison's sexual misconduct.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown v. Sch. Dist. of Philadelphia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=456%20Fed.%20Appx.%2088\">\n     456 Fed.Appx. 88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 91 (3d Cir. 2011) (the\n    <em>\n     failure\n    </em>\n    of a school to provide supervision of a mentally handicapped student after she had previously allegedly been propositioned by another student and hit in the head, even after promising the parents that it would do so, does not constitute an affirmative act by the school or its employees for purposes of establishing \u00a7 1983 liability).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    Doc. 168 at 42-44.
