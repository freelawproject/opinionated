(\"BComm\"), have filed a class action complaint against BComm and thirteen other defendants on behalf of themselves and other investors who acquired BComm shares between March 18, 2015, and September 6, 2017. As relevant here, Plaintiffs allege that BComm violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and a related Securities and Exchange Commission regulation, Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5, by misleading investors about the activities of a telecommunications company in which BComm holds a controlling interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BComm has moved to dismiss the claims against it or, in the alternative, to stay this action pending resolution of related criminal proceedings in Israel. (Dkt. No. 33.) For the reasons that follow, BComm's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part, and its motion to stay is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiffs' Amended Class Action Complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of resolving BComm's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BComm is an Israeli holding company that owns a controlling interest in Bezeq The Israeli Telecommunication Corporation (\"Bezeq\"), Israel's largest telecommunications operator. (Dkt. No. 17 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 16.) Plaintiffs' allegations against BComm arise in connection with Bezeq's 2015 acquisition of the controlling interest in satellite-television provider D.B.S. Satellite Services (1998) Ltd. (\"Yes\") from Israeli private-holding group Eurocom Communications Ltd. (\"Eurocom\"). (Compl. \u00b6 39.) As described further below, Plaintiffs claim, in essence, that this transaction resulted in Eurocom's enrichment at Bezeq's expense and that BComm, either knowing of or turning a blind eye to this result, nonetheless lured its own investors into thinking that all was well. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 170.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Bezeq Purchases Eurocom's Controlling Interest in Yes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to the events of this case, the controlling interest in Yes rested with Eurocom, which owned 50.22% of the company's shares. (Compl. \u00b6 39.) At that time, Bezeq owned the remainder of Yes's shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early 2015, as a first step toward an anticipated merger with Yes, Bezeq negotiated an agreement to purchase the entirety of Eurocom's holdings in Yes. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39, 72.) As part of this agreement, Bezeq promised to pay Eurocom 680 million Israeli new shekels (\"NIS\") as soon as they closed the sale, plus up to NIS 170 million in \"Additional Contingent Consideration\" depending on how successfully Yes performed thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) For example, if Yes managed to pull in NIS 1.058 billion in cumulative free cash flow-that is, net cash from operating activities minus (or plus) net cash spent on (or derived from) investment activities-between 2015 and 2017, Bezeq would pay Eurocom the maximum Additional Contingent Consideration of NIS 170 million. (Compl. \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bezeq's agreement with Eurocom also allowed Eurocom to collect annual advances-with interest-on any Additional Contingent Consideration it might ultimately be entitled to, provided that, at the end of each year, Yes remained on track toward meeting the 2015-2017 cumulative free cash flow total that would ultimately entitle Eurocom to payment. (Compl. \u00b6 41.) If, for example, Yes had reached a benchmark of NIS 228 million in free cash flow by the end of 2015, Bezeq would advance one-third of the NIS 170 million to which Eurocom would be entitled if Yes ultimately hit the NIS 1.058 billion target by the end of 2017. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.) And if Yes had by the end of 2016 added at least an additional NIS 417 million to the NIS 228 million it had accumulated in 2015, then Bezeq would advance an additional one-third of the NIS 170 million maximum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before Bezeq closed the sale with Eurocom, it sought to address a fact that had potential to arouse the suspicion of self-dealing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Eurocom was almost fully owned and controlled by the family of Shaul Elovitch, the very same man who was at that time both the controlling shareholder and board-of-directors chairman of BComm (which in turn controls Bezeq), as well as the chairman of Bezeq's board of directors. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 32.) To satisfy minority shareholders that Bezeq had negotiated the Eurocom deal with its own-rather than Elovitch's-best interests in mind, Bezeq's board of directors formed a purportedly independent subcommittee to evaluate the deal. (Compl. \u00b6 72.) On February 10, 2015, this subcommittee recommended approving the deal, and Bezeq's shareholders approved the deal the following month. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72, 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Bezeq-Eurocom Deal Enriches Eurocom at Bezeq's Expense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bezeq's purchase of Eurocom's Yes shares turned out to be a very bad deal for Bezeq and a very good one for Eurocom and Elovitch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From the outset, the terms of the deal were never subject to truly independent review within Bezeq. Rather, the purportedly independent subcommittee of Bezeq's board of directors that signed off on the deal was allegedly plagued by \"ongoing and systematic leaks of confidential, material, and sensitive details and documents\" that left it susceptible to Eurocom's influence. (Compl. \u00b6 42.) In particular, Bezeq's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), Stella Handler, and the secretary of Bezeq's board of directors, Linor Yochelman, are alleged to have provided Elovitch and his family confidential information from within the subcommittee and to have acted at the behest of Elovitch and other Eurocom executives to steer the subcommittee's activities in a way that would promote Eurocom and Elovitch's interests. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 29, 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   What is more, Eurocom and Elovitch continued to manipulate Bezeq even after Bezeq had approved the Eurocom-friendly sales terms. Following the sale's close, Eurocom allegedly conspired with officers at Yes to artificially inflate Yes's 2015 and 2016 free cash flow figures so that they exceeded the annual benchmark values that triggered Bezeq's obligation to make advance Additional Contingent Consideration payments. (Compl. \u00b6 43.) For example, acting at Eurocom's direction, Yes's CEO, Ron Eilon, allegedly froze or delayed Yes's payments to suppliers, thus increasing Yes's cash holdings in a way that did not accurately reflect the company's underlying finances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of this artificial inflation, Bezeq paid out a total of roughly NIS 114 million in Additional Contingent Consideration on the basis of Yes's 2015 and 2016 performance. (Compl. \u00b6 50). Had Yes not manipulated its free cash flows, Plaintiffs contend, Eurocom would have received at most half that amount. (Compl. \u00b6 51.) Although Yes did begin accurately reporting its free cash flow in 2017 (Compl. \u00b6 46), it remains unclear whether Bezeq will be able to secure a refund of any of the advances it has already paid out (Compl. \u00b6 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   And the negative consequences Bezeq suffered as a result of its dealings with Eurocom did not end there. In June 2017, the Israeli press revealed that the Israel Securities Authority (\"ISA\"), suspecting criminal violations of Israel's securities laws, had opened an investigation into the Bezeq-Eurocom deal and had consequently raided BComm, Bezeq, and Yes's offices and detained certain company figures, including Elovitch, for questioning. (Compl. \u00b6 105.) As a result of this investigation, the ISA has since recommended criminal indictments against, among others, Elovitch; his son, Or; Yes's CEO, Ron Eilon, and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), Micky\n   Neiman; and Bezeq's CEO, Stella Handler. (Compl. \u00b6 130.) These developments have caused Bezeq's share prices to drop, damaged investor confidence, and delayed or perhaps even stymied altogether Bezeq's hoped-for merger with Yes. (Compl. \u00b6 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. BComm's Allegedly False or Misleading Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Due to the close relationship between the two companies, bad news for Bezeq is bad news for BComm. Throughout a string of revelations regarding Yes's true financial status and the ongoing ISA investigation, the price of BComm's shares fell from $21.50 on June 19, 2017, to $14.49 on September 7, 2017. (Compl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, this revaluation was late in coming. They contend that BComm was well aware from the outset that the Bezeq-Eurocom deal was a hornet's nest but that BComm, in an effort to keep its stock prices afloat, made a series of false or misleading statements throughout 2015, 2016, and 2017 that were designed to hide the true nature of the transaction-and its likely consequences-from would-be investors. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 166-67.) As described below, these allegedly false or misleading statements fall broadly into four categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Statements Regarding BComm's Free Cash Flow\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a foreign company whose shares trade on a U.S. stock exchange (Compl. \u00b6 16), BComm must submit periodic, publicly available reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Plaintiffs identify seven of these filings, submitted between June 5, 2015, and April 20, 2017, that contain figures purporting to represent BComm's free cash flow during all or part of 2015 and 2016. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-71.) These figures, though, incorporated Bezeq's free cash flow figures, which in turn incorporated Yes's free cash flow figures, which in turn were alleged to have been fraudulently inflated during 2015 and 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 54.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs maintain, BComm's representations regarding its free cash flow (and Bezeq and Yes's free cash flows) for those years were false and misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Statements Regarding the Bezeq Subcommittee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs identify five SEC filings BComm submitted between March 18, 2015, and April 19, 2016, that describe the subcommittee of Bezeq directors that recommended approval of the Bezeq-Eurocom deal. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-77, 82-83, 88-89.) For example, an exhibit attached to the March 18, 2015 filing describes the subcommittee as \"composed of members who are all outside or independent directors\" and reports that the subcommittee, \"[a]fter reviewing the ... alternatives,\" concluded that going through with the purchase of Eurocom's Yes shares was \"in the best interest of [Bezeq].\" (Compl. \u00b6 72 (formatting omitted) ). And an exhibit attached to an April 24, 2015 filing reports that the subcommittee \"conducted a due diligence of [Yes] with the help of external consultants.\" (Compl. \u00b6 74.) But because the subcommittee was in fact being improperly influenced by Eurocom and Elovitch, Plaintiffs contend, these representations regarding the independent rigor with which the subcommittee assessed the Bezeq-Eurocom deal were false and misleading. (Compl. \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. BComm's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs identify three of BComm's SEC filings that incorporate BComm's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (\"Code of Ethics\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, 90-91, 99-100.) That Code assures investors that BComm employees \"must comply with all applicable laws and regulations\" and \"are expected to observe high standards\n   of business and personal ethics\" by \"practic[ing] ... honesty and integrity in every aspect of dealing with other employees, the public, the business community, shareholders, customers, suppliers and governmental and regulatory authorities.\" (Compl. \u00b6 37.) It goes on to provide that BComm employees \"are expected to make or participate in business decisions and actions in the course of their employment ... based on the best interests of [BComm] as a whole, and not based on personal relationships or benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the Bezeq-Eurocom deal, however, was driven by Elovitch's unethical pursuit of private gain, Plaintiffs contend, BComm's avowals that it adhered to its Code of Ethics were false and misleading. (Compl. \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Statements Regarding Disclosure and Reporting Controls\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs identify four SEC filings BComm submitted between April 5, 2016, and April 26, 2017, containing certifications that BComm had evaluated its internal disclosure controls and found them sufficient to ensure that information about the company was being reliably disclosed to management for inclusion in public-facing reports. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-85, 92, 96, 101.) These certifications similarly state that BComm had assessed its internal financial-reporting controls and found them sufficient to \"provide reasonable assurance\" that the company's finances were being accurately calculated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, several of these certifications are accompanied by signed statements attesting to their truth and comprehensiveness, \"[b]ased on [the] knowledge\" of the signatory. (Compl. \u00b6 86;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, 97, 102-03.) But because BComm's internal controls were insufficient to ensure that Elovitch's fraudulent activities were disclosed or that BComm's free cash flow reporting was accurate, Plaintiffs argue, BComm's certification as to the adequacy of those controls was false and misleading. (Compl. \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Ensuing Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Bezeq-Eurocom transaction prompted litigation in both Israel and the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Israeli Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At least five putative civil class actions or derivative actions related to Bezeq's purchase of Eurocom's Yes shares have been filed in the Israeli courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 34 \u00b6 3.) One of the actions was set to proceed as of mid-August 2017 (Dkt. No. 51-13), one of the actions has been dismissed, and the remaining three actions have been stayed at the request of the ISA or the Attorney General of Israel (\"AGI\"), which is currently deciding whether to pursue criminal charges against Elovitch or any other Yes or Bezeq personnel based on the ISA's investigation and recommendations (Dkt. No. 34 \u00b6\u00b6 3-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In successfully arguing for a stay of the Israeli civil litigation, the ISA and AGI have taken the position that such litigation might prove disruptive to the AGI's pursuit of potential criminal charges. (Dkt. No. 34-2 at 2; Dkt. No. 34-6 at 2.) In particular, the Israeli authorities have expressed concern that \"if an indictment is filed in the criminal proceedings against any of those involved in the civil proceedings, the questioning of this involved party within the framework of the [civil proceedings]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   before being questioned as a defendant in the criminal proceedings and before other witnesses testify in a matter where the version of that involved party is likely to be relevant to their versions[ ] is likely to harm the criminal proceedings.\" (Dkt. No. 34-6 at 7.) Moreover, because Israeli law provides that \"[a] person is not obligated to deliver evidence if it constitutes a confession of a fact that is a fundamental element of an offense which they are charged with, or are likely to be charged with\" (Dkt. No. 34-10), the prospect of criminal proceedings might prompt witnesses in the civil actions to withhold testimony that could be helpful to those actions. Conversely, as the AGI has explained, \"conducting the [criminal] investigation\" first \"may lead to results that will aid the civil proceedings and significantly influence their management.\" (Dkt. No. 34-6 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Present Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In parallel with the Israeli proceedings, BComm investor Lynne P. Maleeff initiated this putative class action in this Court on June 29, 2017. (Dkt. No. 1.) Three months later, this Court granted the request of three other BComm investors-Rex and Roberta Ling Living Trust u/a December 6, 1990, as Amended; John Taylor Jones; and David Thomas Jones-to be appointed lead plaintiffs. (Dkt. No. 11.) The newly appointed lead plaintiffs filed a two-count, amended complaint on December 8, 2017, on behalf of themselves and a class of other investors who acquired BComm shares between March 18, 2015, and September 6, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 1.) In addition to BComm, the amended complaint names as defendants Eurocom, Elovitch, and Elovitch's son, Or; BComm's present or former CEO, Doron Turgeman, and CFOs, Itzik Tadmor and Ehud Yahalom; Bezeq's present or former CEO, Stella Handler, CFOs, David Mizrahi and Allon Raveh, and board-of-directors secretary, Linor Yochelman; and Yes, along with its present or former CEO, Ron Eilon, and CFO, Micky Neiman. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Count One of the operative complaint alleges that eleven of the fourteen defendants, including BComm, violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and related SEC Rule 10b-5 by engaging in a fraudulent scheme designed to induce investors to buy BComm shares at artificially inflated prices and by making false or misleading statements or omissions in connection with that fraud. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 165-68.) Count Two alleges that every defendant other than BComm violated Sections 20(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78t(a) - (b), by exercising control over BComm and thereby facilitating the fraud BComm is alleged to have perpetrated. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 178-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Presently before the Court is BComm's February 20, 2018 motion to dismiss the single count asserted against it or, alternatively, to stay the action pending the completion of the ongoing criminal proceedings in Israel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

For example, one statement simply reported that \"[a] sub-committee of the Board of Directors that was set up to deal with the topic [of the Bezeq-Eurocom deal] ... approved the transaction between [Bezeq] and Eurocom ... to acquire all the holdings of Eurocom ... in [Yes].\" (Compl \u00b6 82.) This accurate statement contains no latent implications regarding the integrity of the subcommittee's decision-making process or the independence of its conclusions. Similarly, another statement informed investors that the subcommittee \"selected\" external consultants that helped Bezeq \"review the feasibility of the merger\" and \"conduct[ ] a due diligence of [Yes].\" (Compl. \u00b6 74.) This statement, too, sends no particular signal about the subcommittee. And although it might fairly be read to imply that the consultants selected by the subcommittee were untainted, the complaint never alleges that they were anything different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   But one of BComm's statements about the Bezeq subcommittee was not so anodyne. An exhibit attached to BComm's March 18, 2015 SEC filing reports that the subcommittee was \"composed of members who [were] all outside or independent directors\" in order to assuage concern that the Bezeq-Eurocom transaction \"would involve a transaction with [Bezeq's] controlling shareholder.\" (Compl. \u00b6 72.) The exhibit goes on to inform the investor that the subcommittee's resolution to recommend approval of the Bezeq-Yes transaction was based on its considered conclusion that the transaction was \"in the best interest of [Bezeq].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (formatting omitted) ). The clear implication of this report is that the subcommittee took an objective, arms-length view of the proposed transaction. But that implication is wholly inconsistent with the omitted fact that subcommittee members were in fact taking their marching orders from self-interested participants in the very deal the subcommittee was meant to assess.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re VEON\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 Civ. 8672,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204162342\">\n    2017 WL 4162342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (company's statement that its increased subscriber numbers and revenues were attributable to its \"sales and marketing efforts\" in Uzbekistan placed \"the reasons for growth in Uzbekistan [sufficiently] at issue\" that the statement was rendered misleading by the company's failure to mention that its payment of\n   bribes was another contributor to its success there).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs have therefore adequately alleged that the report BComm submitted about the Bezeq subcommittee along with its March 18, 2015 SEC filing was materially false or misleading.

The Code of Ethics states that BComm employees \"must comply with all applicable laws and regulations\" and \"are expected to observe high standards of business and personal ethics\" and \"to avoid allowing their private interests to interfere, or appear to interfere, with the interests of [BComm] as a whole.\" (Compl. \u00b6 37.)

None of these three BComm officers is alleged to have participated in compromising the supposedly independent Bezeq board-of-directors subcommittee (Compl. \u00b6 42) or in manipulating Yes's free cash flow figures (Compl. \u00b6 43), nor is the ISA's investigation alleged to have implicated any of them in misconduct (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124-30, 140-46).

To the extent that these allegations seek to imply that Turgeman, Tadmor, or Yahalom had actual knowledge of the true nature of the Bezeq-Eurocom transaction, they are insufficiently specific to render that inference more compelling than the \"opposing inference[s]\" that the BComm officers were merely careless or that Elovitch took deliberate steps to hide his self-enrichment scheme from these officers.\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p314\">\n    551 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p314\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Beyond Turgeman, Tadmor, and Yahalom, the complaint identifies only two individuals who are alleged to have held any position at BComm during the relevant period: Elovitch himself, who was BComm's controlling shareholder and chairman of BComm's board of directors, and Elovitch's son, Or, whom the complaint describes as having been \"a director of BComm.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As for Or, the complaint offers no elaboration on his role within BComm. And beyond a fleeting and nonspecific allegation that he received confidential information from the purportedly independent Bezeq subcommittee (Compl. \u00b6 42), the\n   complaint contains no particular factual allegations about Or's involvement in or knowledge of any of the events underlying Plaintiffs' fraud claims. The complaint therefore neither creates a strong inference that Or acted with scienter nor establishes that his intent could be imputed to BComm even had he done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Elovitch himself, though, is another story entirely. Not only is he alleged to have been aware of the true nature of the Bezeq-Eurocom deal, but he is in fact alleged to have facilitated the deal so as to enrich himself. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 136-39.) Moreover, the complaint contains specific allegations that, if true, establish Elovitch's active participation in the underlying scheme. In particular, Elovitch is alleged to have deliberately wielded improper influence over the Bezeq subcommittee and to have instructed officers at Yes to inflate their free cash flow figures. (Compl. \u00b6 148.) In other words, to the extent that BComm's SEC filings were misleading for failing to disclose the facts surrounding Bezeq's purchase of Eurocom's Yes shares, the complaint adequately alleges that Elovitch \"knew facts or had access to information suggesting that [BComm's] public statements were not accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    Novak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209912\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/300/#p308\">\n    216 F.3d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   BComm never argues otherwise.

Perhaps Elovitch acted outside the scope of his authority and adversely to BComm when he took steps to push through a deal that he knew was not in BComm's best interests. But Plaintiffs do not assert that BComm is liable under the securities laws merely because Bezeq cut a bad deal. Rather, the basis for BComm's liability is its failure to disclose to investors just how bad a deal Bezeq had cut, despite knowing as much, and thereby lulling investors into purchasing BComm shares at prices that overstated the company's actual value.

Indeed, the complaint alleges that, before news of the facts surrounding the Bezeq-Eurocom deal went public, one of Elovitch's companies sold vast quantities of BComm stock at an artificially inflated price. (Compl. \u00b6 139.) It requires no great inferential leap to surmise that Elovitch, despite not having himself drafted the allegedly misleading statements at issue, deliberately stood idly by despite being well aware that BComm's investors were being taken for a ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs have pleaded facts sufficient to create a strong inference that Elovitch acted with scienter and that his scienter can be imputed to BComm, the company he controlled.

(Dkt. No. 36 at 25-35.) As explained above, whether and to what extent a stay of a civil case is warranted to accommodate parallel criminal proceedings requires \"a particularized inquiry into the circumstances of, and the competing interests in, the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Louis Vuitton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757542\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/83/#p97\">\n    676 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091067\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/144/272/#p275\">\n    144 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   275 ).

According to the complaint, as well as to statements submitted by the AGI in the Israeli litigation, the ongoing criminal investigation in Israel focuses on the very Bezeq-Eurocom transaction that takes center stage in this civil suit. (Compl. \u00b6 124; Dkt. No. 34-6 at 3.) Indeed, Plaintiffs never dispute that there is likely to be\n   substantial overlap between the civil and criminal proceedings here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   But the extent to which application of the first factor supports a stay is undercut by the fact that no criminal indictments have yet been issued. \"Absent indictment, the scope and nature of the criminal investigation is unknown,\" leaving this Court unable to \"determine the extent to which an indefinite criminal case\" will eventually \"overlap[ ] with a pending civil action.\"\n   <em>\n    JHW Greentree Capital, L.P. v.

Almost a year has passed since the ISA recommended criminal indictments in connection with the Bezeq-Eurocom transaction (Compl. \u00b6 124), and yet nothing indicates that indictments are forthcoming. \"Courts in this district have generally refused to stay a civil proceeding where the defendant has not been indicted but is under criminal investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Worldcom, Inc.

But BComm points to no authoritative support for its claim that indictments are imminent, and regardless of the position the Israeli authorities have taken in other cases, they have made no representations to\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   Court in connection with\n   <em>\n    these\n   </em>\n   proceedings.

BComm expresses concern that Israeli law might prevent witnesses who are under investigation from providing testimony and that those witnesses might in any event choose to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination rather than testify. (Dkt. No. 36 at 29-31.) This concern, though, is premature. As a corporation, BComm itself has no constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ironbridge Corp. v.

So BComm's claim of prejudice instead rests on its fear that the inability of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   witnesses to testify will hamper its ability to prove its case. But at this juncture, before discovery has even begun, it is speculative to think that BComm will be deprived of critical evidence if this litigation proceeds. Thus, although this factor may well ultimately weigh in BComm's favor, the extent to which it does is as yet unclear.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sterling Nat'l Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457750\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/175/573/#p577\">\n    175 F.Supp.2d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]ince depositions have not yet taken place, there is no way of measuring with any precision what questions [witnesses] may refuse to answer, or what damage may be done to [defendant's] position in the civil case by any assertions of privilege they might choose to make.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Fifth, the Court considers \"its own well-recognized interest in disposing 'of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort.' \"\n   <em>\n    Louis Vuitton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757542\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/83/#p97\">\n    676 F.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Landis v.

Again, though, the Israeli authorities have not chosen to take any role in this litigation, and the judicial economies that BComm anticipates will materialize only if there ever is indeed a criminal prosecution. At present, the Court has no interest in imposing certain delay in the hopes of securing uncertain efficiencies down the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Sixth and finally, granting a stay here would not serve the public interest. After all, \"parties who claim to have been victimized by frauds or other crimes are entitled to pursue their civil remedies, and it would be perverse if plaintiffs who claim to be the victims of criminal activity were to receive slower justice than other plaintiffs because the behavior they allege is sufficiently egregious to have attracted the attention of the criminal authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Sterling Nat'l Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457750\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/175/573/#p577\">\n    175 F.Supp.2d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Dkt. No. 36 at 25.) As BComm explains it, the complaint alleges that Plaintiffs purchased BComm's American Depository Receipts at artificially inflated prices-but BComm has never issued any American Depository Receipts, and so BComm can have committed no wrongdoing in connection with their sale. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Plaintiffs, though, have since clarified that they intended to refer to BComm's ordinary shares (Dkt. No. 50 at 14 n.22), and Defendants have offered no reason why this Court should decline to allow Plaintiffs to correct this straightforward, if regrettable, mislabeling.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Fed.

P. 15(a)(2) (directing the court to allow a party to amend a pleading \"when justice so requires\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    BComm also argues that Plaintiffs have inadequately alleged BComm's scienter with respect to these figures. (Dkt. No. 36 at 17-18.) As explained\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , however, the facts alleged here establish that Elovitch's scienter can be imputed to BComm, and there can be no question that Elovitch is properly alleged to have known that Yes's, and therefore BComm's, free cash flow figures were artificially inflated. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 149.) Relatedly, BComm insists that its free cash flow figures could not have been materially false because they \"did nothing more than report financial information which Bezeq presented as truthful and accurate.\" (Dkt. No. 54 at 13.) But this argument, too, is just another way of professing a lack of scienter: While BComm's decision to incorporate Bezeq's inaccurate figures into its own might not give rise to liability under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 if BComm had neither knowledge of nor reason to know of their inaccuracy, the figures themselves would nevertheless remain false or misleading.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Again, BComm also claims a lack of scienter with respect to these statements. (Dkt. No. 36 at 19.) Here too, though, Elovitch-whose scienter can be imputed to BComm-is clearly alleged to have known that the Bezeq subcommittee was compromised. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 42.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    In an apparent effort to cast doubt on whether the independence of the Bezeq subcommittee was material, BComm looks outside the complaint and claims that other, truly independent parties outside the compromised subcommittee viewed the Bezeq-Eurocom transaction favorably. (Dkt. No. 54 at 8.) Perhaps it will emerge in discovery that the transaction's pitfalls were so subtle that no reasonable investor would have looked askance at the deal even with the knowledge that Eurocom and Elovitch were active in securing Bezeq's approval. But the Court is unprepared at this stage to deem immaterial as a matter of law the fact that the Bezeq subcommittee was tainted by conflicts of interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    To the extent Plaintiffs argue that the SEC filings' signed certifications attesting in general to the filings' truth and comprehensiveness are themselves false or misleading statements that form an independent basis for liability, those certifications \"contained an important qualification that the certifying officer's statements are true 'based on [his] knowledge.' \"\n    <em>\n     Menaldi\n    </em>\n    , 277 F.Supp.3d at 517. As discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the specific officers who signed the SEC filings on behalf of BComm had any knowledge of the facts that rendered those filings inaccurate.
