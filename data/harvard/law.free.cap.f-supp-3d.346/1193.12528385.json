PALLMEYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Brian Strauss owns valuable real estate in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood. Until recently, the ground floor of his building at 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue was occupied by an iconic rock club known as the Double Door. In 2015, however, Strauss initiated legal action against Double Door's owners for various lease violations. This action did not sit well with the local alderman, Defendant Proco Joe Moreno, who responded by proposing changes to the property's zoning restrictions. Strauss filed suit in this court, alleging a host of state and federal claims, and then amended the complaint after the Chicago City Council later adopted a variation of Moreno's proposed ordinance. Defendants now move to dismiss. For the reasons explained below, Defendants' motion [35] is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Brian J. Strauss is a resident of Illinois and the president of 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue Building Corporation. (Second Am. Compl. (hereafter \"SAC\") [32] \u00b6 5.) That Corporation's sole asset is real property it owns and operates at 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Resp. Br. [42], at 10.) The property consists of a four-story, mixed-use building near the intersection of Milwaukee Avenue, North Avenue, and Damen Avenue, the heart of a thriving commercial district on Chicago's near-northwest side. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The property shares its southeast wall with another mixed-use building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54.) The property's southwest wall abuts elevated rail tracks operated by the Chicago Transit Authority. (Ex. 5 to Pl.'s Resp. Br.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Strauss family's involvement with the property stretches back more than forty years. (SAC \u00b6 10.) Brian's father, Harry Strauss, began leasing commercial space there in 1977, and purchased the entire building \"a few years later.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) At some point, Harry transferred ownership of the property to the Corporation of which Brian is now the president. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) By the mid-2010s, when the events giving rise to this lawsuit are alleged to have occurred, the building at 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue had become \"attractive to business tenants and prospective purchasers.\" (SAC \u00b6 14.) In Brian's estimation, the market value of the building \"was approximately 10 million dollars\" at the time the parties' dispute arose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That market value was affected by the municipal zoning regulations to which the property and its neighbors were subject. From 1974 until 2017, Chicago's zoning ordinance classified 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue as \"B3-2.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) At all times relevant to this suit, \"all other buildings\n   along the Milwaukee-North-Damen corridor ha[d] B3-2 or greater zoning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) The \"B3-2\" classification meant that the upper floors of the properties could be used as residential apartments while the ground floors could be used as taverns, restaurants, and, among other things, entertainment venues with a maximum occupancy of up to 999 persons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MUN. CODE OF CHICAGO \u00a7 17-3-0207. As of 2017, the upper floors of 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue were divided into eleven apartments, and its ground floor featured 10,000 square feet of commercial space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to 2016, Plaintiff leased some or all of this commercial space to an entity called Double Door Liquors, Inc. (hereafter \"Double Door\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff's Amended Complaint provides no details about the identity of his former commercial tenant, the court takes judicial notice of the fact that Double Door was a well-known bar and live-music performance venue. FED. R. EVID. 201(b)(1) ; WIKIPEDIA ,\n   <em>\n    Double Door\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Door\n   </em>\n   (last visited Sept. 28, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Plaintiff, \"[n]umerous problems existed during the landlord-tenant relationship between [Brian Strauss] and Double Door.\" (SAC \u00b6 19.) These problems included \"constantly high noise levels,\" \"drug and alcohol abuse by [Double Door's] customers,\" and \"extensive ... damage to the property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At some point, Double Door \"fail[ed] to pay percentage rent\" and \"fail[ed] to properly exercise\" an option to renew its lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late 2015, Plaintiff filed a forcible entry and detainer lawsuit against Double Door in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois-presumably due to one or more of the problems cited above, though the pleadings are not explicit on this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) The lawsuit attracted the attention of the local alderman, Defendant Proco Joe Moreno, who Plaintiff alleges \"had a personal and financial relationship with the owners of Double Door.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Plaintiff does not offer any details about the nature of this \"personal and financial relationship,\" though he alleges that Alderman Moreno told Plaintiff years ago, at some point in 2012, that \"only Double Door would be allowed in Strauss' building.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2016, \"just before\" Plaintiff's forcible entry lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial, Defendant Moreno introduced an ordinance to the Chicago City Council's Zoning Committee, a body comprised of Moreno himself, Alderman Daniel Solis (the Committee's chairman), and 16 other members of the City Council. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 23-24.) This ordinance would have changed the zoning classification of the property at 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue from B3-2 to B1-1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) A B1-1 classification \"allows for fewer options for the type of commercial or retail tenants\" than a B3-2 classification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The B1-1 classification, for example, would bar Plaintiff from using the property's commercial space for \"general restaurants, medium and large entertainment venues, and hotels or motels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The proposed change would not have applied to any other neighborhood properties. (SAC \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Zoning Committee never sent Moreno's April 2016 downzoning proposal to the full City Council for a vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) But the Committee did not reject the proposal, either. Instead, it \"held Moreno's downzoning proposal in committee,\" thereby\n   \"making it available to be called for a vote at any time in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At some point in the summer of 2016, both Moreno and a co-owner of Double Door (an individual by the name of Sean Mulroney, who is not a party here) told Plaintiff that Moreno had \"introduced the downzoning ordinance to protect Double Door by making the property less appealing to future renters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.) On or around July 19, 2016, Plaintiff met with Moreno at Moreno's office, and Moreno repeated his earlier assertion that \"only Double Door would be allowed in Strauss' building.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 15, 2016, the Circuit Court of Cook County found that Double Door had indeed breached the terms of its lease with Plaintiff, and ordered Double Door to vacate the premises by December 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.) It is not clear exactly what happened next, but Double Door apparently did not vacate the property until February 6, 2017, more than a month after the deadline set by the Circuit Court of Cook County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) Two days later, on February 8, Plaintiff and Defendant Moreno attended a private meeting at Chicago's City Hall, which was convened by the City's Commissioner of Planning and Development, David L. Reifman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) Also present at this meeting were Double Door's co-owners, Zoning Committee Chairman Daniel Solis, Zoning Administrator Patricia A. Scudiero, and an assistant to Mayor Rahm Emanuel named Claudia E. Chavez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Reifman began the meeting by advising the parties that he did not want to discuss Moreno's April 2016 downzoning proposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.) Reifman then \"tried to broker a sale of [the property at 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue] between Strauss and Double Door for a purchase price far less than what the building was worth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both Plaintiff and Double Door rejected Reifman's proposal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The meeting's participants then began to discuss Moreno's April 2016 downzoning proposal, even though Reifman had suggested that they avoid this topic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.) Moreno \"warned Strauss that if Double Door wasn't allowed back into the building, Moreno would make the zoning process a very lengthy and expensive one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) None of the other participants at the meeting commented on Moreno's warning, but Zoning Committee Chairman Solis \"nodded quietly at times and passively expressed approval.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 25, 2017, Moreno spoke with Strauss on the sidewalk in front of 1572 North Milwaukee Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47.) During this conversation, Moreno warned Strauss that \"you're not gonna have a tenant in here for three years.... It's gonna be an empty building with no income for you or your family.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreno also told Strauss that \"I'm gonna have inspectors in here on a daily basis, you watch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about May 10, 2017, an unidentified individual agreed in writing to purchase the property for $9.6 million, on the condition that Strauss \"inform\" the individual \"of any pending zoning change.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49.) The individual subsequently \"cancel[led]\" the contract with Strauss on June 8, 2017, two days after Moreno unveiled a second proposal to downzone the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unlike Moreno's earlier proposal, which would have changed the property's classification from B3-2 to B1-1, this new proposal would change the classification of the property to RS-3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) That classification \"is intended to accommodate the development of single-unit detached houses on individual lots.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.) All\n   other parcels on both Milwaukee and Damen Avenues \"for at least a half-mile on either side of Strauss' property\" are \"solidly zoned for commercial/business\" uses, and they would continue to be so zoned under Moreno's second proposal to reclassify Plaintiff's property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.) On June 22, 2017, the Zoning Committee \"deferred\" Moreno's second proposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.) As with Moreno's first proposal, this action made the ordinance \"available to be called for a vote at any time in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently attempted to lease the commercial space formerly occupied by Double Door to other commercial lessees. Although he \"received several written letters of intent from restaurants to rent that space at market rates\"-approximately $35,000 per month-\"these potential tenants refused to sign a lease\" due to concerns that the property's zoning classification would not \"remain at B3-2.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 20, 2017, Plaintiff filed suit in this court, alleging that Moreno and the City of Chicago violated his constitutional rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64.) The following day, a different individual (also unidentified in the Second Amended Complaint) offered to purchase Plaintiff's building, this time for $9.1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.) Plaintiff alleges that this individual \"knew of the pending downzoning amendments,\" though he does not specify when or how this individual became aware of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.) On August 7, 2017, after meeting with Defendant Moreno, the individual \"cancelled\" the purchase agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later that month, Moreno introduced a third proposal directed at Plaintiff's property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70.) This ordinance would reclassify Plaintiff's property (and no others) as B2-2, a classification \"intended to spur development in commercial corridors with low demand for retail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.) The B2-2 classification would permit \"permit fewer options for the types of commercial or retail tenants\" than the existing B3-2 classification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff suggests that several city officials \"worked with [Moreno] to devise this third proposal,\" including Zoning Administrator Patricia Scudiero, Alderman Solis, and unidentified \"members of the Department of Law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.) But Plaintiff also alleges that, during a subsequent hearing on the proposal, Scudiero told the Zoning Committee that neither the City's Department of Planning nor its Department of Law could \"recommend the actions of Moreno.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.) It is not clear to which of Moreno's \"actions\" Scudiero was referring, or what she or anyone else who allegedly \"worked with\" Moreno actually said to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 11, 2017, the Zoning Committee voted to approve the proposed ordinance-apparently in the same form Moreno had proposed in late August, though the Amended Complaint is not entirely clear on this point. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.) In doing so, the Committee acted pursuant to an \"unwritten tradition of 'Aldermanic Prerogative,' \" whereby city council members \"defer[ ] local matters to the alderman of the affected ward\" and \"blindly support\" that alderman's position on such matters, \"knowing full well that they will get the support they need from that colleague, should they want to pass zoning legislation in their ward in the future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At some point that same day, Moreno made the following remark to his Chief of Staff, Raymond Valadez, while the two men were speaking in City Hall Chambers: \"Fuck with them, it makes their lawsuit weaker.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81.) It is not obvious to whom the word \"them\" refers in this sentence, or what exactly Moreno believed would make \"their\" lawsuit weaker. Plaintiff implies-and the court assumes, for\n   purposes of this motion-that Moreno was referring to Plaintiff and the downzoning ordinance, respectively. Plaintiff alleges that this comment \"was recorded,\" though he does not explain who recorded it or how he or she did so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 21, the unidentified individual who had previously offered to purchase Plaintiff's building for $9.1 million reduced his or her offer to $6.5 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 11, 2017-more than a year after Plaintiff prevailed in his state-court lawsuit against Double Door-the full City Council enacted the third iteration of Moreno's proposal into law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff filed his original Complaint in this matter on July 20, 2017, before Defendant Moreno introduced the third and final iteration of his proposal to rezone Plaintiff's property. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint [21] shortly after the City Council enacted that proposal into law, and a Second Amended Complaint [32] on November 30, 2017. The Second Amended Complaint includes eighteen counts alleging deprivations of various rights under the Illinois and United States constitutions, as well as claims for conspiracy, tortious interference with contract, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 108-213.) Plaintiff names only Alderman Moreno and the City of Chicago as Defendants, and they now move to dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims under Rule 12(b)(1) and/or Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing, that Plaintiff's federal claims are unripe, that Alderman Moreno is entitled to absolute and/or qualified immunity from suit in his individual capacity, and that each of Plaintiff's individual claims fails on the merits. The court considers these arguments in turn. In doing so, it accepts well-pleaded facts as true and draws all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

In that case, a county legislature in Tennessee reduced the permissible residential density of an area where a developer had already obtained preliminary approval to build a residential subdivision. Although the county's planning commission permitted part of the subdivision to be constructed under the standard that existed when the developer first sought approval, it imposed the new standard on the remainder of the developer's property. The developer then sued for damages in federal court, characterizing the planning commission's action as a regulatory taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For two reasons, the Supreme Court concluded that the dispute was not yet ripe. First, the developer had not requested a \"variance\"-that is, an individualized exemption from otherwise generally applicable rules-from the county's Board of Zoning Appeals, which had the authority to grant such variances. Because there had been no \"final decision that no variances would be granted,\" the Court explained, the plaintiff had not yet suffered a legally cognizable injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197836\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/172/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the plaintiff's application was pending, the local alderman introduced (and the City Council subsequently enacted) an ordinance rezoning the property in a way that prevented its use as a church, even with a special use permit. The plaintiff then sued the alderman in federal court, alleging violations of its rights under the First and Fourteenth amendments. The district court rejected the alderman's assertion of absolute legislative immunity, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. The act of \"rezoning a single parcel\" qualified as \"legitimately legislative\" activity, the court explained, because the new zoning classification created \"neutral, prospective rules that apply to all current and future owners of the property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11899181\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/899/#p903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11899181\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/899/#p903\">\n    at 904-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff makes no attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Biblia Abierta\n   </em>\n   in his response.

Indeed, he strongly implies the opposite when he alleges that Alderman Moreno's proposals either scared off prospective purchasers or led them to reduce their offering price. This is a problem for his claims against Moreno.

But Plaintiff does not say why Moreno's acts were not legislative; Moreno's alleged threats described the potential financial impact of proposed legislation.

Plaintiff argues that \"aldermanic privilege existed and allowed the constitutional harm to happen\" in this case. (Pl.'s Resp. Br. 19.) But \"allow[ing] the constitutional harm to happen\" is not enough. Even if the court assumes that the practice of aldermanic privilege was sufficiently widespread, entrenched, and well-known to constitute a municipal custom for purposes of a Section 1983 claim, none of Plaintiff's allegations suggest that this custom was \"the moving force\" behind Alderman Moreno's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   retaliatory actions, which this court has already found to be the only plausible basis for a constitutional claim here.

Conspiracy claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In counts V and VI of the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges a conspiracy to violate his civil rights among Alderman Moreno and the various city officials who attended the February 8, 2017 meeting in the office of David Reifman, the City's Commissioner of Planning and Development. According to Plaintiff, these officials \"knew or should have known\" from Moreno's comments at that meeting that his proposals to rezone Plaintiff's property were motivated solely by his \"personal agenda to get revenge on behalf of Double Door.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 134, 137.) The other officials at the meeting therefore \"should have instructed\" Moreno and/or the Zoning\n   Committee to withdraw Moreno's proposed ordinances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 139.) Instead, Plaintiff continues, the officials \"worked with [Moreno] to come up with a downzoning proposal, post lawsuit, that was more defensible and consistent with maintaining the status quo of 'Aldermanic Prerogative.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   These allegations are insufficient to state a claim for multiple reasons. Even if the court assumes that the various city officials who participated in the February 8 meeting did, in fact, agree to violate Plaintiff's rights-a generous assumption, in light of Plaintiff's own allegation that several of the attendees at the meeting were members of the same city agencies that later refused to \"recommend\" Moreno's proposals to the Zoning Committee-Plaintiff's claims are still barred by the so-called intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine. Under that doctrine, the agents of a corporation \"jointly pursuing its lawful business do not become 'conspirators' when acts within the scope of their employment are said to be discriminatory or retaliatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Ill. March 15, 2005) (Pallmeyer, J.) (citing cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the doctrine does not apply here for one or more of the following reasons: (1) because individuals unaffiliated with the City also participated in the February 8 meeting, thereby broadening the conspiracy beyond the City's own employees; (2) because the conspiracy they hatched at that meeting was \"unlawful,\" in that it was aimed at depriving Plaintiff of his civil rights; or (3) because the conspiracy was motivated solely by \"personal bias\" against Plaintiff, and thus was not undertaken within the course of the various co-conspirators' employment with the City. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. Br. 28.) None of these arguments are persuasive. The mere presence of Double Door's co-owners at the February 8 meeting-which was convened for the purpose of brokering their purchase of Plaintiff's building-does not make them co-conspirators in city officials' later efforts to \"work with\" Moreno to make his proposal more \"defensible.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20643334\">\n    2005 WL 643334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 n.23. And Plaintiff's suggestion that the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine is categorically inapplicable to conspiracies aimed at the deprivation of civil rights is untenable in light of clear Seventh Circuit authority holding that the doctrine\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   applicable to conspiracy claims under Section 1985.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532480\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/1492/#p1508\">\n    40 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1508 ;\n   <em>\n    Hartman v.

Plaintiff has not alleged that anyone besides Moreno was motivated by \"personal bias\" against Plaintiff. Instead, his allegation that other city officials sought to amend Moreno's proposals to make them \"more defensible\" suggests that their actions fall squarely within the scope of their employment by the City. Their attempt to improve proposed legislation served the interests of the City, not themselves. It represents precisely the type of \"routine, collaborative business decision\" that the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine is intended to protect.\n   <em>\n    Stenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20643334\">\n    2005 WL 643334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Even if the court were to overlook the applicability of the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine here, Plaintiff's allegations still would not state a claim for municipal liability. As previously noted, Plaintiff does not allege any facts suggesting an official municipal policy or an entrenched, widespread practice of conspiring against property owners who go to court to evict their tenants. Nor does he allege that the purported co-conspirators had final policymaking authority in any domain that is relevant to the alleged conspiracy. As a result, his conspiracy claims against the City must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Failure-to-intervene claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, the court considers Plaintiff's claim in Count VII: that the City neglected its duty to prevent a conspiracy to violate Plaintiff's rights, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201986\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statute provides a cause of action for the failure to prevent only those \"wrongs conspired to be done, and mentioned in section 1985 [.]\" Because the court has already held that Plaintiff has not stated a claim under Section 1985, he has no claim under Section 1986, either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.
