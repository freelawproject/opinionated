(collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Baxter\n   </strong>\n   \") that the proposed generic esmolol hydrochloride products of Defendants Mylan Laboratories Ltd., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (hereinafter, \"\n   <strong>\n    Mylan\n   </strong>\n   \"), and Sagent Pharmaceuticals Inc. (hereinafter, \"\n   <strong>\n    Sagent\n   </strong>\n   \" and collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Defendants\n   </strong>\n   \")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   infringe the various patents covering Baxter's esmolol hydrochloride product, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,310,094 (hereinafter, \"'094 Patent\") and 6,528,540 (hereinafter, \" '540 Patent\" and collectively, the \"patents-in-suit\" or \"Patents\"), a \"continuation-in-part\" of the '094 Patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following factual and claims construction discovery, the parties now request that the Court construe the following three claim terms:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. \"\n   <strong>\n    Sterile\n   </strong>\n   ,\" as it appears in asserted claims 4 through 9 of the '094 Patent, and claims 6, and 12 through 16 of the '540 Patent ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. \"\n   <strong>\n    Aqueous\n   </strong>\n   ,\" as it appears in asserted claims 1 through 9 of the '094 Patent, and claims 6, and 12 through 16 of the '540 Patent ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   3. \"\n   <strong>\n    Injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\n   </strong>\n   ,\" as it appears in asserted claims 1 through 9 of the '094 Patent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In seeking construction, Baxter takes the position, on essentially each disputed claim term, that the intrinsic record discloses a specific definition, and/or reflects the patentee's intention that the term be defined by reference to the \"ordinary\" meaning advanced in its extrinsic sources (namely, expert testimony and dictionary definitions). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Baxter's Opening Br. at 8-23; Baxter's Responsive Br. at 2-20.) More specifically, though, Baxter claims (1) that the inventors acted as their own lexicographer in reciting the term \"sterile,\" (2) intended to incorporate their view on the \"ordinary mean\" of the term \"aqueous,\" and (3) limited the scope of the phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" through reference, in the specification, to the characteristics that form the \"heart\" of Baxter's claimed invention (namely, a stable, ready-to-use composition, capable of being autoclaved). (Baxter's Opening Br. at 8-23; Baxter's Responsive Br. at 2-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants, by contrast, largely eschew the need for formal claim construction and submit, in each instance, that the claim terms involve little more than the application of widely accepted meanings to commonly understood words. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs' Opening Br. at 5-7, 11, 15-16; Defs.' Responsive Br. at 1, 4, 10, 13.) In other words, Defendants claim that the disputed terms have \"self-evident\" or \"readily apparent\" meanings, and argue that Baxter's narrow definitions result from a litigation-driven effort to avoid relevant prior art. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20271\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) In the event this Court deems construction necessary (as it does), Defendants alternatively advance specific constructions consonant with their view of the intrinsic record of the patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Opening Br. at 7-10, 12-14, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Despite any nuances in the disclosures of the patents-in-suit, the claim terms at issue here constitute obviously commonplace terms. The primary issue relative to the construction of \"sterile\" and \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" concerns whether the patentees ascribed a specific scope to these claim terms, or whether the more general ordinary meaning should prevail. Resolution of the term \"aqueous,\" by contrast, turns, more simply, upon how to characterize the plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In considering the claim terms, the Court has benefited from extensive briefing and attorney argument at a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court construes the disputed claim terms as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-38\"><strong>Term</strong> <strong>Court's Construction</strong> <strong>\"sterile\" and \"state of</strong> a composition that has been <strong>sterility\"</strong> brought to a state of sterility and has not been subsequently exposed to microbiological contamination (i.e. the container holding the sterile composition has not been compromised) <strong>-and-</strong> sterility is freedom from live bacteria or other microorganisms \"<strong>aqueous\" pharmaceutical</strong> an \"aqueous\" pharmaceutical <strong>composition</strong> composition is a solution in which water is the solvent \"<strong>Injectable, aqueous</strong> a stable, ready-to-use aqueous <strong>pharmaceutical composition</strong>\" parenteral solution</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background to Esmolol Hydrochloride and Baxter's Innovative Esmolol Research\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Esmolol hydrochloride constitutes one type of \"beta-blocker,\" a class of drugs that block the \"beta\" receptor of heart muscles, arteries, and certain other tissue. ( '094 Patent at 1:13-23.) Within this large class of drugs, however, esmolol proves unique because of its \"short-acting\" nature, making it \"often desirable in the critical care setting to quickly reduce heart work or improve rhythmicity during a cardiac crisis.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Baxter, a trailblazer in the esmolol industry, has \" 'successfully commercialized various esmolol products under its BREVIBLOC\n   <sup>\n    \u00ae\n   </sup>\n   trademark' \" for over thirty years.\n   <em>\n    Baxter Healthcare Corp v. HQ Specialty Pharma Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326774\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/157/407/#p413\">\n    157 F.Supp.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413-14, No. 13-6228,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20344888\">\n    2016 WL 344888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.N.J. Jan. 26, 2016) (citations omitted). Early esmolol formulations, however, suffered from \"extreme susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation,\" limited (if any) resilience to sterilization by autoclaving,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and dilution errors by the ultimate users (often resulting in patients receiving an excess dosage of the formulation). ( '540 Patent at 1:30-40.) In other words, the prior art esmolol compositions readily broke down in the presence of water, and proved incapable of effective terminal sterilization (requiring that the formulations instead be sterilized aseptically in a \"clean\" environment). ( '094 Patent at 1:40-49; '540 Patent at 2:1-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Baxter's Innovative Esmolol Hydrochloride Product, BREVIBLOC\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    \u00ae\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Through the patents-in-suit, Baxter claims to have solved these problems, and developed a ready-to-use, stable aqueous esmolol formulation capable of sterilization\n   by autoclaving. ( '094 Patent at 2:1-14; '540 Patent at 2:1-14.) Indeed, in contrast to the prior art, the claimed formulations prove \"stable against hydrolytic degradation and other adverse chemical reactions,\" and possess \"a pharmaceutically-acceptable shelf-life.\" ( '094 Patent at 2:3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Taken together, Baxter's Patents purport to provide a stable, ready-to-use parenteral solution containing esmolol hydrochloride, a buffering agent, an osmotic-adjusting agent, and methods for preparing the solution in a premixed and injectable form. More specifically, though, the '094 Patent, titled \"\n   <strong>\n    READY-TO-USE ESMOLOL SOLUTION\n   </strong>\n   ,\" discloses a ready-to-use injectable, aqueous form of Baxter's esmolol formulation, in a flexible plastic container or intravenous bag (generally identified in the '094 Patent as an IntraVia\n   <sup>\n    \u2122\n   </sup>\n   flexible plastic container). ( '094 Patent at Title Page, 1:4-10, 62-65.) The claims of the '094 Patent, in turn, disclose an esmolol composition and a method for preparing that composition. ( '094 Patent at Title Page, 5:1-6:24.) Asserted claim 1, for example, speaks in terms of an esmolol composition, and specifically claims (with emphasis for the disputed claim terms):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   An\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for the treatment of cardiac conditions, having a pH between 3.5 and 6.5 and comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   a. 0.1-100 mg/ml methyl-3-[4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino) propoxy] phenylpropionate hydrochloride (esmolol hydrochloride),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   b. 0.1-5.0 mg/ml buffering agent, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   c. 1-100 mg/ml osmotic-adjusting agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ( '094 Patent at 5:9-16 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Asserted claim 4, by contrast, recites a method for preparing the composition, and specifically provides (again, with emphasis for the disputed claim terms):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A method for preparing a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     sterile\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     injectable aqueous pharmaceutical composition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for the treatment of cardiac conditions, comprising forming an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     aqueous\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   composition having a pH between 3.5 and 6.5 comprising methyl-3-[4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino) propoxy] phenylpropionate hydrochloride (esmolol hydrochloride), a buffering agent, and an osmotic-adjusting agent in a sealed container, and autoclaving for a period of time sufficient to render the composition sterile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   ( '094 Patent at 6:1-9 (emphases added).) The '540 Patent then incorporates the disclosures associated with the '094 Patent, and builds upon them, by teaching the ready-to-use bag form of the esmolol formulation, as well as a concentrated esmolol form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Asserted claim 6 of the '540 Patent, for example, teaches an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     aqueous\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     sterile\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   pharmaceutical composition comprised of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   a. 0.1-100 mg/ml esmolol hydrochloride;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   b. 0.01-.5 M buffering agent, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   c. 1-100 mg/ml osmotic-adjusting agent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ( '540 Patent at 6:45-50.) Claim 13, in turn, provides (with emphasis for the disputed claim terms):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A method for preparing an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     aqueous, sterile\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration for the treatment of cardiac conditions, comprising forming an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     aqueous\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   composition having a pH between 3.5 and 6.5 comprising 0.1-500 mg/ml methyl-3-[4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino) propoxy] phenylpropionate hydrochloride (esmolol hydrochloride), 0.01-2 M buffering\n   agent, and 1-500 mg/ml osmotic-adjusting agent in a sealed container and autoclaving for a period of time sufficient to render the composition sterile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   ( '540 Patent at 7:7-13 (emphases added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Following the issuance of these Patents, the United States Food and Drug Administration (hereinafter, the \"FDA\"), approved Baxter's New Drug Application (hereinafter, \"NDA\") No. 19-386/S-018 (an supplemental NDA No. 19-386/S-020) for BREVIBLOC \u00ae Premixed Injection in 2500mg/250ml IntaVia Containers\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   BREVIBLOC \u00ae Double Strength Premixed Injection 20 mg/mL in 100 mL Containers (together, \"the BREVIBLOC \u00ae Premixed Injection Products\"), and listed the patents-in-suit in its listing of approved drug products (i.e., the so-called Orange Book).

More specifically, the Court rejects, at the outset, the notion that the disputed claim terms require no construction, or can be construed simply by reference, without explanation, to the \"plain and ordinary meaning.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Opening Br. at 5, 11, &amp; 15; Defs.' Responsive Br. at 1.)

Indeed, the parties devoted ample attention in their briefing to the appropriate definitions, and the claim terms themselves form, at least in part, the fundamental fabric of Baxter's claimed invention. In that way, reliance upon the phrase \"plain and ordinary meaning,\" or a determination that the claim terms require \"no construction,\" would offer little in terms of facilitating a resolution of these related actions. Stated differently, a blanket resort to the \" 'ordinary' \" meaning of the disputed claim terms would leave unresolved the parties' disputes, and would largely negate the importance of the claims construction process-a phase of patent litigation specifically directed at determining claim scope in view of the patents-in-suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736972\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1351/#p1362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that \"[a] determination that a claim term 'needs no construction' or has the 'plain and ordinary meaning' may be inadequate when a term has more than one 'ordinary' meaning or when reliance on a term's 'ordinary' meaning [would] not resolve the parties' dispute\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As a result, the Court concludes that the terms at issue here, though ordinary, require meaningful construction, irrespective of the simplicity of this Court's ultimate constructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736972\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1351/#p1362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that courts routinely construe \" 'ordinary' words,\" and remanding the case for consideration, in the first instance, of the appropriate construction of the term \"only if\");\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ActiveVideo Networks v.

From this \"express definition,\" though, Baxter then asks the Court to determine that the phrase \"state of sterility\" connotes, in the ordinary sense, a composition free \"of live bacteria or other micoorganisms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants argue, by contrast, that Baxter's proposed construction finds no footing in the specification of the '094 Patent, and that no case law supports the notion that a \"selective quote\" from the later-in-time '540 Patent can be applied to the construction of the earlier-issued '094 Patent. (Defs.' Responsive Br. at 6-8.) Even more, Defendants argue that Baxter's construction needlessly creates ambiguity by interweaving concepts without \"basis in the intrinsic record of either patent-in-suit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) As a result, Defendants urge the Court to adopt their narrow construction, which they claim better represents the aspects of the specification directed at the concept of \"sterile.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Patentees Acted as their own Lexicographers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court begins with the essentially unremarkable observation that the '094 Patent provides, standing alone, no information from which to divine the meaning of the term \"sterile.\" Indeed, \"sterile\" appears only in asserted claim 4, and the specification sheds no contextual light on the patentees' intention relative to the disputed term. ( '094 Patent at 6:1-9 (describing a \"method of preparing a sterile, injectable aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" that has, among other things, been \"autoclave[ed] for a period of time sufficient to render the composition sterile\").) The asserted claims of the '540 Patent similarly add little to the story, and provide no point of reference for the concept of \"sterile.\" (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   '540 Patent at 5:55-8:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The specification of the '540 Patent, though, which Baxter built upon the '094 Patent, explains in unequivocal terms that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A \"sterile\" composition, as used in the context of this application, means a composition that has been brought to a state of sterility and has not been subsequently exposed to microbiological contamination, i.e. the container holding the sterile composition has not been compromised\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   Sterile compositions are generally prepared by pharmaceutical manufacturers in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (\"cGMP\") regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   ( '540 Patent at 2:20-29 (emphasis added).) The issue therefore becomes whether the patentees expressly defined the concept of \"sterile\" through this portion of the specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In order to act as a lexicographer (a position Baxter advances here), the patentee must, as explained above, \"clearly set forth a definition of the disputed claim term\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   express a clear intention \"to define the term.\"\n   <em>\n    Thorner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722950\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/1362/#p1365\">\n    669 F.3d at 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relevant provisions of the specification here, though, prove remarkably clear, and squarely demonstrate lexicography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Indeed, the syntax of the specification alone supports the view that the patentees intended to express a definition, because it breaks off the term \"sterile\" with quotes, and does so only in this instance. ( '540 Patent at 2:20.) The substance of the specification, in turn, completes the definitional picture, by indicating that \" 'sterile' ...\n   <em>\n    as used in the context of th[e] application, means\n   </em>\n   ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:20-21 (emphasis added).)

In other words, the language of the specification-the \"present invention\" together with an expressly limited definition of \"sterile\" as \"used in the context of\" the '540 Patent -discloses a clear intention that the patentees intended, and indeed did, provide a special definition for the term \"sterile.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   This lexicography, in\n   turn, \"must govern the claim construction analysis,\"\n   <em>\n    Braintree Labs., Inc. v.

Defining \"State of Sterility\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On this issue, too, the parties stake out different positions, with Baxter claiming that sterility implies \"freedom from live bacteria or other microorganisms\" (Baxter's Responsive Br. at 6-9), while Defendants argue that sterility requires only a \"reduced microbial burden.\" (Defs.' Responsive Br. at 4-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The '540 Patent and its predecessor the '094 Patent, generally teach a pharmaceutically safe, or \"sterile,\" esmolol formulation, as compared to the more contaminant-prone prior art formulations (due to the necessary dilution and aseptic handling). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '540 patent at 1:54-55, 2:6-11, 34-35.) The specification of the '540 Patent, however, fails to convey a uniform understanding of the concept of \"sterility.\" Indeed, the disclosure begins by referring to the concept of \"terminal sterilization ... as a way of\n   <em>\n    reducing\n   </em>\n   microbiological burden\" and ensuring \"the safety of the finished product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:55-58 (emphasis added).) The patentee then reinforces this interpretation of sterility in the detailed description by stating that the claimed composition can be \"subjected to terminal sterilization via autoclaving to\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   the microbiological burden of the formulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:7-9 (emphasis added).) In that way, the specification, at least in these provisions, creates the arguable impression that the prescribed sterilization technique (autoclaving or otherwise) serves only to reduce the potential microbiological presence\n   (and not to free it, entirely, from any live bacteria).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Latter portions of the detailed description, however, explain that the preferred terminal sterilization method \"\n   <em>\n    eliminates\n   </em>\n   the risk of microbiological contamination during aseptic handling\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:34-35 (emphasis added)), and reflect that sterilization should be used \"to destroy all microorganisms within the final, sealed package containing the esmolol formulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:53-54.) These disclosures, by contrast, suggest that the claimed composition will be sterilized in a way that reduces the product to a state free from microbiological contaminants (as opposed to a state of reduced microbiological presence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In other words, the written disclosure lends some credence to the view that sterility could refer to a freedom from microbiological contamination\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   simply to reduced microbiological contamination. Given the ambiguity in the intrinsic record, the Court turns, as it must, to extrinsic sources in order to determine the ordinary meaning of the concept of sterility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Power Integrations, Inc. v.

The array of identified extrinsic authorities uniformly embrace Baxter's view that sterility means freedom from live bacteria or other microorganisms. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 7-9 to Goldberg Opening Dec.) Indeed, the chapter of \"Sterilization\" from\n   <em>\n    Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n   </em>\n   defines sterility as \"[t]he absence of viable microogranisms,\" and explains that sterilization aims \"to destroy or eliminate microorganisms.\" (Ex. 7 to Goldberg Opening Dec. at 753.) The\n   <em>\n    United States Pharmacopeia\n   </em>\n   , the sole extrinsic source cited by Defendants, similarly describes \"the strictest definition of sterility ... [as a] complete absence of viable microorganisms...\" (Ex. B to Devine Responsive Dec. at 1976.)\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    American Heritage College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   then consistently define sterile as \"free\" from live bacteria or other microorganisms. (Ex. 8 to Goldberg Opening Dec. at 2238; Ex. 9 to Goldberg Opening Dec. at 1332.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Aside from these technical sources, Baxter's expert, Dr. Bannister, convincingly explains that a \"sterile, injectable pharmaceutical product,\" as claimed in the patents-in-suit, must have \"a\n   <em>\n    zero\n   </em>\n   microbiological burden,\" because \"any microbiological contamination of an injected product would introduce a risk of infection to the patient.\" (Bannister Opening Dec. at \u00b6 60 (emphasis in original).)

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Capital Machine Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit determined that the patentee's \"disclaimer of [claim] scope during prosecution of some of the [later-issued] patents-in-suit\" applied \"equally to limit the [claim term] in the other patents-in-suit,\" including those that issued earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9067489\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1340/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Capital Machine Co.\n   </em>\n   addressed itself to portions of the prosecution history, its essential premise-that portions of the intrinsic record in a later-issued patent can be used to interpret the same term in the earlier-issued, related patent-applies equally here, particularly because the '094 Patent includes essentially identical teachings on the importance of contaminant-free esmolol solutions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Covidien LP v.

Indeed, the '094 Patent issued on October 30, 2001, and the patentees filed their application for what ultimately became the '540 Patent on the very same day. This temporal proximity, in turn, diminishes any suggestion that the cross-application of the Patents' disclosures might somehow allow Baxter to benefit from any deficiency in the earlier disclosures of the '094 Patent. Indeed, common sense suggests that identical inventors, as here, may choose to augment or further clarify their disclosures in connection with a continuation-in-part patent, particularly where, as here, the patents contain essentially identical relevant teachings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Finally, as a continuation-in-part of the '094 Patent, the '540 Patent has \"the same effect, as to such invention, as though filed on the date of the prior application.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20120\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This circumstance, in turn, provides additional support for a common interpretation across the patents-in-suit, despite the fact that the Court's construction derives from the definition expressed in the technically later-filed '540 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Against that backdrop, the Court finds it entirely appropriate, and perhaps necessary, to look to the intrinsic evidence of a later issued, related patent in order to interpret a common term used in both patents. The express definition embodied in the '540 Patent therefore governs the Court's construction of the term \"sterile\" across the related patents-in-suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    For all of these reasons, for purposes of the '094 and '540 Patents, the Court construes the term \"sterile\" to mean \"a composition that has been brought to a state of sterility and has not been subsequently exposed to microbiological contamination (i.e. the container holding the sterile composition has not been compromised)\" and the term \" state of sterility\" to mean \"freedom from live bacteria or other microorganisms.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    C. \"Aqueous\" pharmaceutical composition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   With respect to the claim term \"aqueous,\" the parties agree that this commonly-understood\n   term should be construed in accordance with its ordinary meaning, but diverge on the actual plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   More specifically, in terms of defining \"aqueous,\" the parties advance the following closely-matched constructions:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-110\"><strong>Baxter's Proposed</strong> <strong>Defendants' Proposed Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> an \"aqueous\" composition is <s>Plain and ordinary meaning</s> a solution in which water is the solvent <strong>-or-</strong> containing water</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Despite their varied construction, Defendants substantively agree that the ordinary meaning of \"aqueous,\" as recited in the patents-in-suit, includes, at a minimum, the concept of a solution containing water, or an aqueous solution. More simply, despite their claims construction position, Defendants do not genuinely dispute that the claimed compositions are best characterized as solutions (either in a diluted or concentrated form).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Indeed, Defendants describe the patents-in-suit as providing \"a stable, ready-to-use parenteral\n   <em>\n    solution\n   </em>\n   containing esmolol hydrochloride, and methods for preparing\n   <em>\n    those solutions\n   </em>\n   ,\" (Defs.' Opening Br. at 2 (emphases added)), and then cite to extrinsic technical authorities (from the relevant period) that uniformly define \"aqueous\" as a \"[w]ater solution\" or \"solution[ ] containing water.\" (Defs.'

In other words, the specifications plainly disclose that Baxter's esmolol compositions consist of a solution containing, among other ingredients, water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Against that backdrop, resolution of the parties' disagreement on the term \"aqueous\" ultimately hinges upon whether the term \"aqueous\" pharmaceutical composition means a solution in which water serves as a solvent (as advanced by Baxter), or simply one containing some amount of water for an undefined purpose (as advanced by Defendants). (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Baxter's Responsive Br. at 12-16,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Responsive Br. at 10-13.) More specifically, Baxter urges the Court to define the term by reference to its purported purpose in the overall esmolol formulation; while, Defendants argue that the term should be construed more simply as referring to a solution containing water. On this issue, though, the Court finds Baxter's position better aligned with the relevant intrinsic record and extrinsic authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court begins, again, by noting that the asserted claims themselves provide little guidance on the intended construction of the term \"aqueous\" pharmaceutical composition for purposes of the patents-in-suit. Rather, the asserted claims 1 and 4 of the '094 Patent merely disclose an \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cardiac conditions\" ( '094 Patent at 5:9-11), and a \"method for preparing a sterile, injectable aqueous pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cardiac conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:1-3.) The asserted claims of the '540 Patent, in turn, teach only an \"aqueous, sterile pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration for the treatment of cardiac conditions.\" ( '540 Patent at 5:61-63, 6:65-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The specifications, though, create the clear impression that the claimed solution consists of one in which water acts as a solvent, or the liquid into which the inventions' other ingredients have been dissolved. More specifically, the disclosures of the patents-in-suit describe formulations comprised of (1) esmolol hydrochloride, (2) a buffering agent, (3) an osmotic-adjusting agent, and (4) a pH adjuster. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '094 Patent at 1:4-10; '540 Patent at 2:3-6.) The three exemplary compositions in the specifications, in turn, list preparations consisting of specific quantities of (1) esmolol hydrochloride, (2) sodium chloride and/or dextrose (as two of the claimed osmotic-adjusting agents), (3) sodium acetate trihydrate and/or glacial acetic acid (as two of the possible buffering agents), (4) sodium hydroxide/hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), and (5) water for injection. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '094 Patent at 1:4-10; '540 Patent at 2:3-6.)

In other words, in its proposed construction, Baxter urges the Court to look to the teachings of the specification, and to incorporate the \"clearly and unequivocally\" described characteristics into the construction of the claim phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition.\" (Baxter's Opening Br. at 15-19.)

With that guidance, this Court must determine whether the three characteristics identified by Baxter limit claim scope (as Baxter argues), or simply serve as limitations distinct from the \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" (as Defendants claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   With respect to the \"stable\" and \"ready-to-use\" aspects of the claimed invention, however, the specification readily supports the inclusion of these features within the construction of the claim phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition.\" Indeed, the patentees entitled the '094 Patent\"\n   <strong>\n    READY-TO-USE ESMOLOL SOLUTION\n   </strong>\n   \" ( '094 Patent at Title (emphasis in original)), and then defined that solution by reference to its stable and ready-to-use aspects throughout the following sequential portions of the specification:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-131\">explaining that the '094 Patent claims \"a <em>ready-to-use</em> injectable, aqueous <strong><em>Abstract</em></strong> pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cardiac conditions\" (<em>id.</em> at Abstract (emphasis added)) describing the instability and dilution errors associated with prior art esmolol formulations (<em>see id.</em> at 1:31-55) <strong><em>Background of the Invention</em></strong> explaining that the prior art left open \"a need for a <em>ready-to-use</em> large volume parenteral esmolol hydrochloride that is microbiologically safe and <em>stable</em> in vitro during storage\" (<em>id.</em> at 1:56-58 (emphases added)) \"The <em>present invention</em> relates to a <em>ready-to-use</em> injectable, <strong><em>Summary of the Invention</em></strong> aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" (<em>id.</em> at 1:5-7 (emphases added)) \"The <em>present invention</em> provides a <em>stable, ready-to-use</em> parenteral solution containing esmolol hydrochloride...\" (<em>id.</em> at <strong><em>Detailed Description of the</em></strong> 1:62-65 (emphases added)) <strong><em>Invention</em></strong> \"The <em>present invention</em> is <em>stable</em> against hydrolytic degradation...\" (<em>id.</em> at 2:2-3 (emphases added)) \"The <em>product</em> is a <em>ready-to-use</em> infusion which can be used directly...\" (<em>id.</em> at 2:5-7 (emphases added)) describing \"the preparation of <em>ready-to-use</em> infusion bags of the <em>present invention</em> <strong><em>Examples</em></strong> containing 10 mg/ml esmolol HCl solution\" (<em>id.</em> at 2:64-66) (emphases added))</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In that way, the specification contains ample indications that the patentee intended the \"stable\" and \"ready-to-use\" aspects of the claimed invention to be limiting. Indeed, the language of the specification squarely matches the circumstances identified by the Federal Circuit as limiting claim scope, because the disclosure repeatedly defines the \"present invention\" or \"product\" as stable and ready-to-use,\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   disparages the instability and dilution requirement (or, non-ready-to-use preparation) of prior art esmolol compositions. This Court can scarcely imagine disclosures more concise and unequivocal than expressed in the specification of the '094 Patent. For that reason, will incorporate \"stable\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"ready-to-use\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   into the construction of the claim phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   With respect to the notion that the claimed invention be \"subjected to autoclaving,\" however, the Court reaches a different conclusion. The Court recognizes, at the outset, that the '094 Patent touts the amenability of its esmolol solution to terminal sterilization via autoclaving. Indeed, as with its description of the terms \"stable\" and \"ready-to-use,\" the specification states that prior art formulations could not survive autoclaving, and therefore required aseptic sterilization. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '094 Patent at 1:40-47, 2:1-2.) By contrast, \"[t]he present invention provides a stable, ready-to-use parenteral solution ... [that]\n   <strong>\n    can be\n   </strong>\n   packaged in a sealed container and subjected to terminal sterilization via autoclaving to reduce the microbiological burden of the formulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:66-2:1 (emphasis added).) The specification then states that \"[t]he esmolol hydrochloride composition[s] of the present invention\n   <strong>\n    can be\n   </strong>\n   autoclaved at a temperature ranging from 115 to 130\u00b0C. for a period of time ranging from 5 to 40 minutes with acceptable stability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:53-56 (emphasis added).) This sterilization process, in turn, results in a microbiologically safer, and pharmaceutically acceptable, esmolol composition than could ordinarily be obtained through aseptic handling. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:60-2:58.) In other words, the novelty of the\n   invention claimed by the '094 Patent hinges, in large part, upon the ability of the esmolol formulation to withstand terminal sterilization by autoclaving. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Based upon that understanding, and these references in the specification, Baxter argues that the phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" should be construed to include the requirement that the composition be \" 'subjected to autoclaving.' \" (Baxter's Responsive Br. at 20-22.) The statement in the specification that the composition \"\n   <strong>\n    can be\n   </strong>\n   autoclaved,\" however, less closely resembles the language the Federal Circuit looks for in finding specification language limiting for claims construction purposes, and unlike the references to \"stable\" and \"ready-to-use,\" the specification does not incorporate the autoclaving references into the clear expression (or, definition) of the \"present invention.\" Thus, although the written disclosure endorses the notion that the novelty of the '094 Patent flows, at least in part, from the suitability of the claimed composition to autoclaving, the language of the specification lends itself equally to the premise that autoclaving constitutes the preference among other available sterilization techniques.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated differently, the Court cannot conclude that the specification contains an explicit statement that the claimed composition must be subjected to autoclaving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Further, such a construction ultimately proves irreconcilable with claim 4 of the '094 Patent. Claim 4 is specifically directed at a \"method for preparing a sterile,\n   <em>\n    injectable aqueous pharmaceutical composition\n   </em>\n   ... [that has been] autoclav[ed] for a period of time sufficient to render the composition sterile.\" ( '094 Patent at 6:1-9 (emphasis added).) Composition claim 1, by contrast, claims an \"\n   <em>\n    injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\"\n   </em>\n   with specified ranges of the component ingredients, but with no provision for sterilization by autoclaving. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:8-17 (emphasis added).) Baxter's proposal to incorporate \"subjected to autoclaving\" into claim 1 would, in turn, fail to give proper effect to claim 4. Indeed, such a construction would render the latter portions of claim 4 redundant and superfluous, and would require reliance upon a strongly disfavored approach to claims construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Atlas IP, LLC v.

Against that backdrop,\n   the Court cannot find the \"subjected to autoclaving\" feature limiting for purposes of claim construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Beyond the intrinsic realities of the '094 Patent, Baxter's own expert, Dr. Bannister, acknowledged that the words \"injectable[,] aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" do not, by themselves, imply \"autoclaving\" to a person of ordinary skill. (Bannister Dep. at 130:24-131:3.) In other words, Dr. Bannister essentially admitted that any importation of \"autoclaving\" would be inconsistent with the relevant ordinary understanding of the claim language. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Bannister's statement, in turn, lends further support to the notion that the claim phrase should not be construed to include the \"autoclaving\" feature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    For all of these reasons, the Court construes the phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" as \"a stable, ready-to-use aqueous parenteral solution.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The opinions of Dr. Bannister at issue here, though, prove entirely consistent with the intrinsic record, and help establish the meaning of the term \"aqueous\" in the particular pharmaceutical field.

Nevertheless, the specifications reflect, as stated below, that these excipients perform distinct, non-solvent functions in the claimed inventions (as either a buffering agent or an osmotic-adjusting agent), and so the Court finds Defendants' position unconvincing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    This can be contrasted to a prior art reference to the '540 Patent,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C017%2C609\">\n     U.S. Patent No. 5,017,609\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (mistakenly referred as\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C107%2C609\">\n     U.S. Patent No. 5,107,609\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) (hereinafter, the \"'609 Patent\", which the patentees describe as \"disclos[ing] a concentrated formulation ... containing esmolol in an aqueous buffer solution, with propylene glycol and ethanol added to increase solubility of the esmolol.\" ('540 Patent at 1:45-48.) In other words, because the '609 Patent formulation used propylene glycol and ethanol to increase the solubility of the composition, the patentees characterized the formulation as an \"an aqueous buffer solution,\" rather than an \"aqueous\" composition, as claimed by the patents-in-suit. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) This contrast, in turn, supports the view that \"aqueous\" pharmaceutical compositions does not, in the ordinary sense, refer to compositions that use co-solvents in addition to water. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bannister Responsive Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Defendants argue against any construction of water as \" '\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    ' sole solvent,\" based upon their belief that glacial acetic acids acts as a co-solvent in at least some of the exemplary formulations, and because such a construction purportedly \"obfuscates, rather than clarifies the meaning of the claim term.\" (Defs.' Opening Br. at 14 (emphasis in original).) More specifically, as to their position on the claimed formulations containing solvents other than water, Defendants point to the claim language that identifies glacial acetic acid (or, acetate) as a buffering agent, then to the claims that describe the aqueous pharmaceutical composition as being comprised, in part, of 0.1-5.0 mg/mL buffering agent (in the '094 Patent ) and 0.01-2M buffering agent (in the '540 Patent ), and finally to the admission of Dr. Bannister that glacial acetic acid can be used, under certain circumstances, as a solvent. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bannister Responsive Dec. at \u00b6 22.) Defendants, however, cite no expert or other evidence to buttress their assertion that glacial acetic acid serves as a co-solvent in connection with the patents-in-suit. Nor have they explained away the fact that\n    <em>\n     each\n    </em>\n    exemplar embodiment in the specifications of the patents-in-suit include glacial acetic acid in an amount too insignificant for it to function as a co-solvent. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , '094 Patent at 3:3-4:67; Bannister Responsive Dec. at \u00b6 22 (explaining that although glacial acetic acid \"can be used as a solvent in certain synthetic-and analytical-chemistry applications,\" the \"Examples of the patents-in-suit\" claim \"simply too little [glacial] acetic acid for it to act as a co-solvent\").) Beyond this initial deficiency, Defendants' position proves inconsistent with the specifications' own description of \"glacial acetic acid\" as a \"buffering agent.\" ('094 Patent at 3:20; '540 Patent at 4:25.) Indeed, the to specification of the '540 Patent states, on its face, that the \"combination of sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid\" works as a \"buffering agent,\" i.e., the excipient that stabilizes the pH balance of the aqueous solution. ('540 Patent at 3:8-10.) As a result, the Court finds no convincing support for Defendants' position that glacial acetic acid serves as a co-solvent in the claimed esmolol formulations. Nor does the Court conclude that Baxter's proposed construction-the one that will be adopted by this Court-creates any \"unnecessary ambiguity or confusion.\" (Defs.' Opening Br. at 14.) To the contrary, the construction relies upon the commonplace concept of a solvent, and would require, at least to the ordinary artisan, no additional elaboration. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Bannister Opening Dec. at \u00b6 65 n.8 (explaining, in a footnote, the commonplace concept of a solvent).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    During the\n    <em>\n     Markman\n    </em>\n    hearing, Baxter walked the Court through the various sections of\n    <em>\n     Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n    </em>\n    that equally reflect that understanding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    During the\n    <em>\n     Markman\n    </em>\n    hearing, Defendants restated their reliance upon the more general definition of \"aqueous,\" as contained within the extrinsic sources identified by Baxter.

Nevertheless, because these sources fail to narrow in on the concept relevant here-an aqueous solution-neither resource (at least in the way relied upon by Defendants) proves particularly instructive for purposes of claim construction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    By letter dated March 9, 2016, Baxter advised this Court of the Federal Circuit's recent, and instructive, decision in\n    <em>\n     UltimatePointer\n    </em>\n    .

Based upon their view that the specification \"present[s] various and differing discussions of stability,\" Defendants claim \"that such a limitation should not be read into the claims.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18 (citation and emphasis omitted).) Defendants' position, however, rests upon an overly narrow reading of the written disclosure. Indeed, a cursory inspection of the specification makes plain that it refers\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    to the instability of the esmolol hydrochloride molecule \"in an aqueous environment because of [its] extreme susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation,\" and not in three distinct contexts. ('094 Patent at 1:31-33.) Stated differently, the specification uniformly refers to the concept of \"stability\" in terms of highlighting the stability of the claimed formulations in water-based environments (and by contrast to the prior art).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    During the\n    <em>\n     Markman\n    </em>\n    hearing, and briefly in their\n    <em>\n     Markman\n    </em>\n    submissions, Defendants argued that the phrase \"injectable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition\" cannot be construed to include a \"ready-to-use\" limitation, because the specification, at certain points, uses the terms \"injectable\" and \"ready-to-use\" in the same sentence. (Defs.' Opening Br. at 18;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Responsive Br. at 15.) In other words, Defendants take the position that \"injectable\" and \"ready-to-use\" cannot be read in tandem, because the \"ready-to-use\" aspect of the claimed invention is necessarily imbedded within the claim limitation \"injectable.\" Nevertheless, the specification, as illustrated above, reflects that the ready-to-use nature of the compositions constitutes a distinct feature of the \"present invention\" (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , '094 Patent at 2:5-7), and never uses the term \"injectable\" to describe the \"present invention\" of the '094 Patent.
