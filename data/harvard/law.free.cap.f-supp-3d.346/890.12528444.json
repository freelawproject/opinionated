Defendants have presented competent summary judgment evidence, consisting of the declaration testimony of Kenric McNeal, Helix's Director of Human Resources, excerpts from plaintiffs' deposition testimony, plaintiffs' pay statements, and plaintiffs' offers of employment, showing that material fact issues are in dispute concerning whether plaintiffs were paid on a salary basis, including but not limited to, whether plaintiffs were guaranteed a minimum of at least $455 per week for the weeks that they worked, and whether plaintiffs were paid their full rate and did not have their wages reduced based on the quantity of work when they did not work full weeks. Because the question of whether plaintiffs were paid on a salary basis remains in dispute, they cannot prevail on their motion for partial summary judgment on their contentions that they were not exempt executive, administrative, combination, or highly compensated employees. Accordingly, plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
