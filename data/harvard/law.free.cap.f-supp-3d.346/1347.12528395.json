Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his five-count Complaint, Sprouse, who is Jewish, alleged violations of his rights under the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc et seq., and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. (Doc. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Count I, Sprouse alleged that Ryan does not provide the daily caloric count of the kosher meals and that the kosher diet is nutritionally inadequate and violates his rights under the First Amendment and RLUIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In Count II, Sprouse alleged it is his sincerely held religious belief that fruits and vegetables be washed and eaten whole, and ADC cuts and minces his vegetables thereby violating his rights under the First Amendment and RLUIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Count III, Sprouse claimed that Ryan and Hetmer prohibit Sprouse from growing out his beard in accordance with his religious beliefs in violation of the First Amendment and RLUIPA. Sprouse further claimed that Defendants have permitted a Muslim inmate to grow his beard-for religious reasons-beyond the length permitted under ADC policy, thereby violating Sprouse's right to equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Count IV, Sprouse alleged that beef in a kosher diet is a necessary part of Passover, yet Ryan and Fizer eliminated beef from the kosher diet plan in violation of the First Amendment and RLUIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   And in Count V, Sprouse claimed that Ryan and Hetmer refuse to provide Sprouse disposable utensils in order to conform to his kosher dietary practices and they put Sprouse's kosher food on reusable trays that are used for regular meals, which violates his rights under the First Amendment and RLUIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Sprouse's religious beliefs have not been substantially burdened, (2) Defendants did not act in a discriminatory manner toward Sprouse, and (3) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the First Amendment claims.

Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Kosher Diet and Meal Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April 2007, ADC authorized Sprouse to receive the kosher diet pursuant to his declared religious preference and beliefs that require observance of kosher dietary restrictions. (Doc. 69, Defs.' Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ADC contracts with Trinity Services Groups, Inc. (Trinity), which provides food services to ADC inmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Trinity's kosher diet meal plans are prepared by a dietician to meet the nutritional standards and guidelines established by the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) ADC pastoral staff and a volunteer Rabbi review and approve the menus after confirming that all the items listed meet kosher dietary standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With the exception of eggs, fresh fruit and vegetables, and other items considered inherently kosher, only foods certified by a recognized Orthodox Kosher standard with symbols such as \"OU\" (Orthodox Union), \"K\" (Kosher), or \"CRC\" (Chicago Rabbinical Council) are served in the kosher meal plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Some prepacked single service items such as sugar, cookies, and salad dressings are served in packets without a kosher symbol because they are delivered in bulk packaging that bears an appropriate kosher certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also, cold cuts and cheeses served with the Kosher Passover Meal Plan are purchased from a vendor that pre-slices the items and then delivers them in bulk packaging that bears an appropriate kosher certification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The kosher TV-dinner style meals are purchased from a certified kosher purveyor and are certified as kosher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The kosher diet menu provides, in part, for 3/4 cup lettuce and cabbage, 1/2 cup of fresh vegetables, and one serving of fruit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The tools used to cut fruit and vegetables are designated as kosher-only tools and are cleaned and stored separately from other tools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The sink in which kosher-designated tools are cleaned is cleaned and sanitized and then used to wash only the kosher-designated tools, which are then stored separately from other tools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants state that the kosher diet menu includes a kosher beef meal twice a week, and that this meal has always been on the menu. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) The kosher beef meal is not 100% beef; it contains some beef and is considered a beef-flavored entr\u00e9e from the kosher manufacturer, and it satisfies the nutritional and kosher dietary standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although the kosher diet meals used to be served on Styrofoam or cardboard disposable trays, in recent years, a volunteer Rabbi advised that disposable containers are not required to meet kosher standards and that ADC's cleaning process for the trays was sufficient for serving kosher meals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Defendants state that ADC instructed Trinity to wrap the kosher meals in cellophane before placing the meals on the trays and to wrap a layer of cellophane around the trays before placing the wrapped meals on the trays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sprouse states that the trays are not wrapped; rather, the wrapped kosher meals are placed right onto the trays. (Doc. 71 at 14 &amp; Ex. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Beard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In April 2007, ADC granted Sprouse a religious shaving waiver allowing him to maintain a beard up to 1/4 inch in length. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In February 2014, Sprouse initiated the prison's grievance system to complain that the 1/4-inch limit causes him to violate his sincerely held religious belief to maintain a longer beard and that another inmate who is Muslim was allowed to maintain a beard longer than 1/4 inch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Sprouse's requests to grow out his beard were denied by Hetmer and Ryan on the ground that ADC policy did not allow beards longer than 1/4 inch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-23.) In April 2014, Sprouse's final appeal was denied by Ryan on the ground that Sprouse failed to establish a religious reason for growing his beard longer than 1/4 inch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In July 2015, ADC policy was modified to allow all inmates to maintain beards up to 1 inch in length. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Kosher Diet and Meal Service\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Sprouse alleged that the kosher diet he receives has insufficient calories for him to maintain his health. (Doc. 1 at 3.) Defendants submit copies of the \"Statements of Nutritional Adequacy\" for the kosher diet meal plans from 2012 and 2016. (Doc. 69, Ex. 1, Attach. J (Doc. 69-3 at 49-55).) These Statements are signed by Trinity's dietician and certify that the kosher diet meal plans provide an average calorie count of approximately 2800 calories per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Sprouse disputes that the kosher diet meal plans provide this many calories, and he notes that Defendants do not provide any information of the calorie count for the daily kosher meals. (Doc. 71 at 5.) Sprouse had previously requested this information from Defendants, to no avail; therefore, he began to keep a record of the meals he received during various weeks in 2015 and, using a calorie counter guide, he calculated the caloric count for the items in each meal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6; Doc. 71, Ex. 3 &amp; Attach. A (Doc. 71-4 at 1-17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Sprouse provides two caloric counts for each day: one based on premium brands and grade of food (which yield higher calories), and one based on lower brands and grade of food (which yield lower calories). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants do not dispute Sprouse's record of meals or his calorie calculations in their Reply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 75.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants nonetheless make the general assertion that Sprouse fails to provide evidence that contradicts the \"Statements of Nutritional Adequacy,\" which purport to show that the kosher diet meal plans provide an average of 2800 calories per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court has reviewed Sprouse's meal records and calorie counts for four weeks from July-October 2015. (Doc. 71, Ex. 3 (Doc. 71-4 at 1-17).) When taking the average of the two calorie counts for each day, the average daily calories for these weeks were approximately 2133 (week of July 6, 2015); 2207 (week of Aug. 10, 2015); 2210 (week of Sept. 7, 2015); and 2226 (week of Oct. 12, 2015). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 71-4 at 1-17).) Although these calorie calculations are not exact, the evidence is sufficient to support that the kosher diet meal plans provide a calorie count closer to 2150-2200 calories per day, not 2800 calories per day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nonetheless, Sprouse fails to present specific facts or evidence to show that receiving just 2150-2200 calories a day is inadequate, thereby forcing him to forgo or significantly alter his religious practice to maintain proper nutrition. According to his own evidence, the estimated calorie requirement for a male his age-over 50\n   years old-with a sedentary lifestyle is 2000-2200 calories a day. (Doc. 71, Ex. 3 (Doc. 71-4 at 39).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sprouse does not allege that he lost weight or suffered other health effects as result of eating just 2150-2200 calories a day. More importantly, he does not allege that he had to supplement his diet with non-kosher items from the commissary or non-kosher bartered foods, or that he had to take any other action that effectively forced him to violate his religious practice in order to get sufficient calories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064625\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/984/#p1011\">\n    723 F.3d at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (substantial burden exists where the plaintiff is pressured to modify his behavior and violate his beliefs).

The Court has already determined that Sprouse fails to present any facts or evidence to show that a kosher diet meal plan providing an average of 2150-2200 calories per day substantially burdens the exercise of his religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, the Court does not reach the \"compelling governmental interest\" test, and summary judgment will be granted as to the RLUIPA claim in Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Count II-Mincing of Vegetables\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In his Response, Sprouse clarifies that this Count is limited to the mincing of his cabbage. (Doc. 71 at 8.) Sprouse argues that mincing the cabbage increases the likelihood of contamination with non-kosher items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He maintains that his religious practice is substantially burdened because the probability of a piece of minced cabbage becoming contaminated is higher than a wedge of cabbage becoming contaminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants contend that Sprouse's speculation about potential contamination does not support a claim rooted in religious belief and that his claim is \"a purely secular philosophical concern\" that does not\n   satisfy the initial showing in the First Amendment analysis. (Doc. 75 at 5.) Defendants further contend that Sprouse's speculation that minced cabbage could be contaminated does not constitute a substantial burden. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Assuming, arguendo, that Sprouse's desire to eat a non-contaminated kosher diet could be considered a sincerely held belief rooted in religious faith, Sprouse fails to satisfy the substantial burden prong. Sprouse must show that the government action burdened his religious practice; yet, Sprouse does not allege that he has ever received contaminated cabbage. Defendants' evidence establishes that measures are taken to ensure that contamination does not occur in the preparation of kosher meals. (Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) Sprouse's response to this evidence-that \"it does not matter about the kosher tools\" or how they are cleaned-is insufficient to create a material factual dispute as to whether contamination occurs. (Doc. 71 at 9.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. List\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537540\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/880/1040/#p1045\">\n    880 F.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1045 (9th Cir. 1989) (conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data are insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion). Moreover, Sprouse does not allege that the fear of contamination has affected his kosher dietary practice or caused him to modify his behavior in any way such that he must violate his religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In short, Sprouse fails to satisfy his burden of showing that the mincing of cabbage in the kosher diet meals burdens his exercise of religion. That ends the analysis under both the First Amendment and RLUIPA, and summary judgment will be granted as to both these claims in Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Count IV-Beef in Kosher Meals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants do not challenge that Sprouse has a sincerely held belief that eating beef is an important part of his religious diet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 68 at 7.) In their Reply, however, they question Sprouse's belief that he must eat beef and suggest that relevant scripture only states that eating beef is permitted, not mandated. (Doc. 75 at 9.) But the right to religious practice \"is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 &amp; Ex. 22 (Doc. 71-6 at 15).) These food labels do not include the ingredients; however, they identify the manufacturer as the\n   <em>\n    Gourmet Kosher\n   </em>\n   company and bear the \"OU\" symbol.

Defendants argue that Sprouse's religious beliefs are not substantially burdened by the substitution of a beef meal with a non-beef meal and that even if he receives no beef, Sprouse's\n   rights are not violated because he receives food that sustains his health and satisfies the dietary laws of his religion.

Although the amount of actual beef within the kosher beef meals is not known, there is no dispute that the beef meals Sprouse receives are kosher and otherwise nutritionally adequate. Sprouse does allege that that the lack of 100% beef meals has forced him to engage in behavior that interferes with or violates his beliefs. On this record, Sprouse fails to meet his burden to show a substantial burden on his religious beliefs.

The record establishes that the kosher meals are wrapped in cellophane, but the trays on which they are placed are not wrapped. (Doc. 71 at 14 &amp; Ex. 26.) Sprouse asserts that using reusable, non-kosher trays \"interferes with his spirituality and beliefs\" and that a disposable tray is necessary to ensure that there is no contamination that would compromise the kosher integrity of the meals. (Doc. 71 at 14.) But Sprouse does not explain how the reusable trays interfere with his spirituality, nor does he allege that any of his wrapped kosher meals have ever been contaminated. Also, Sprouse does not allege that the meals are not securely wrapped such that food ever directly touches the tray, and he does not claim that he has ever been unable to eat a kosher meal because it appeared to have been compromised due the tray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Like his claim regarding minced cabbage, Sprouse demonstrates only a fear of contamination but presents no evidence that actual contamination has taken place or that this fear has affected his kosher dietary practice or caused him to modify his behavior in any way such that he must violate his religious beliefs.

First Amendment Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As to the initial prong in the First Amendment analysis-whether Sprouse's belief in growing out his beard is sincerely held and rooted in religious belief-Defendants assert that Sprouse's vague reliance on unidentified portions of the Torah is insufficient to support that he is commanded to grow out his beard longer than one inch.

But the question is not whether the Jewish religion commands Sprouse to grow out his beard-such an inquiry\n   amounts to the centrality test, which, as mentioned, the Supreme Court has disavowed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shakur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048111\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/514/878/#p884\">\n    514 F.3d at 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the plaintiff need not show that the religious practice at issue is required as a central tenet of the religion, only that he believes that the practice is consistent with his faith). Rather, the sincerity test determines whether the First Amendment applies, and there is nothing in the record that challenges Sprouse's sincere belief that he is personally required to grow out his beard beyond 1 inch to maintain his Jewish faith. In his Complaint, Sprouse averred that he believes Jewish males should not cut their beards. (Doc. 1 at 5.) In his grievances, Sprouse complained that the prison's policy limiting beard length denies him the ability to follow God's law in the Torah and thereby violates his religious practice. (Doc. 69, Ex. 2, Attach. A (Doc. 69-4 at 8, 13, 18).)

(Doc. 71, Ex. 15 (Doc. 71-5 at 22).) This demonstrates that there are a group of inmates who seek to grow out their beards for religious reasons, and Sprouse is similarly situated with this group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Inmate Grievance Appeal Response also establishes that some inmates within this group are in fact granted shaving waivers and allowed to grow out their beards beyond 1 inch for religious reasons. Sprouse's evidence includes the copy of a 2012 settlement agreement between the ADC and a Muslim inmate, Seymour J. Abdullah, which permits Abdullah \"to\n   maintain a 5-inch beard to practice Islam as long as\" he is in ADC custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, there can be no dispute that some inmates who seek to grow their beards beyond 1 inch for religious reasons are permitted to do so. But not Sprouse; despite grievance requests to Hetmer and Ryan and the filing of a lawsuit, Sprouse has been denied a shaving waiver to grow out his beard for religious reasons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 69, Ex. 2, Attachs. E-H (Doc. 69-4 at 18-26).) From this evidence, the inference can be made that the denial of a shaving waiver was not an accident or oversight, but that Sprouse has intentionally been treated differently than other similarly situated individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants argue that there is no evidence that the difference in treatment is not based on a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. (Doc. 68 at 14; Doc. 75 at 9.) However, Defendants do not state what the legitimate state purpose is or how the difference in treatment serves that purpose. As discussed above, Defendants fail to present any argument that denial of a shaving waiver is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. Sprouse argues that because inmates are permitted shaving waivers for religious reasons and inmates are allowed to grow long hair-facts that Defendants do not dispute-there is no legitimate penological interest in refusing Sprouse's request to grow out his beard in accordance with his faith.
