For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is granted in part and denied in part and Defendant's Motion to Strike is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Michael Knotts, a citizen of Minnesota, alleges that in approximately October 2012, he purchased a new Nissan Versa from Morrie's Nissan, an authorized Nissan dealership located in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. (Compl. \u00b6 13 [Doc. No. 1].) Defendant NNA is a California corporation with its principal business office in Sacramento, California, and its North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) It markets, sells, and warrants vehicles, including 2012 Nissan Versas, through an established network of licensed dealers and distributors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The subject vehicle that Plaintiff purchased was built with a continuously variable automatic transmission (\"CVT\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A CVT is a \"modified automatic transmission that employs a single, adaptable belt and a dual-pulley mechanism.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) It is designed such that the \" 'drive pulley' and 'driven pulley' work opposite one another, constantly creating different gear ratios, allowing for smooth acceleration and deceleration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Knotts alleges that NNA advertised and continues to advertise the CVT as a \"next-generation\" transmission, designed to \"provide smoother performance, quicker acceleration, and better fuel economy than ever before.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   NNA provides its customers with a three-year, 36,000-mile limited vehicle warranty and a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   warranty on all of its vehicles (the \"Warranty\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The Warranty \" 'covers any repairs needed to correct defects in materials or workmanship of all parts and components of each new Nissan vehicle supplied by Nissan,' \" including the engine, transmission, drivetrain, and restraint system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Knotts alleges that unbeknownst to him and the putative class members, the subject vehicles' CVTs were \"defective,\" and routinely failed during and shortly after the expiration of the Warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) The alleged defect causes the vehicle to lose most, if not all, of its ability to accelerate, putting the vehicle's occupants at serious risk of harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of this defect, Plaintiff alleges that NNA's CVTs fail after \"an unreasonably low number of miles have been driven\"-frequently just after the expiration of the Warranty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Knotts contends that on one occasion, he was stopped at a red light, and when he\n   attempted to accelerate across the intersection after the light turned green, his vehicle \"would not accelerate beyond a crawl, causing him to block and delay traffic behind him and rendering him barely able to move the car into the shoulder of the road so that he could avoid the danger of moving so slowly at a traffic-heavy intersection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After this incident, Plaintiff alleges that his \"acceleration problems were pervasive,\" and in or about March 2017-approximately four and a half years after he purchased his Versa-he took his vehicle to Victory Auto Service &amp; Glass in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) At that time, the mechanic diagnosed a \"fuel injection issue\" as the cause of the Versa's problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The following month, when Knotts' vehicle again failed to accelerate, it was again towed to Victory Auto Service &amp; Glass. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) This time, the shop identified a transmission problem, and replaced the transmission and the transmission fluid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff paid more than $3,300 for this work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the end of April 2017, Plaintiff contacted NNA about his allegedly defective CVT, describing the acceleration problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) He alleges that NNA refused to cover the cost of the repairs because the issue arose outside of the Warranty period and the repairs had been performed by non-Nissan service providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Knotts alleges that he and other putative class members relied on NNA's representations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) He states that had they known about the alleged defect when they leased or purchased the vehicles, they would have not purchased or leased them, or they would have paid less. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also contends that he, along with the putative class members, \"reasonably expected that the CVTs in the Subject Vehicles would not be defective,\" and that \"if they were defective, Nissan would repair the defect pursuant to the terms of the Warranty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff maintains that the CVT defect, related safety concerns, and the lack of a pre-failure fix are \"material facts to a reasonable consumer\" in deciding whether to purchase or lease a Nissan and how much to pay for it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) He asserts that \"Nissan should have disclosed these material facts to the public, but failed to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Knotts imputes knowledge of the CVTs' alleged defects to NNA, including the knowledge that the CVTs were \"not fit for their intended purpose, and unsafe when used as intended.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) According to Plaintiff, \"any type of meaningful pre-production testing conducted by Nissan would have provided Nissan with knowledge of the defect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) In addition, Knotts alleges that NNA's knowledge of the alleged defect further increased once the subject vehicles were on the market:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Nissan was further put on notice regarding the existence of the defect shortly after the Vehicles were brought to market (and prior to many Subject Vehicles being sold) as a result of receiving customer complaints (1) directly, (2) through its authorized dealers, (3) through complaints made to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\"), and (4) through the public dissemination of complaints publicly posted on online forums.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Complaint, Knotts quotes 18 complaints filed with the NHTSA involving acceleration failures in 2012 Nissan Versas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 (a)-(r).) For example, in one such complaint, the driver reported that on two occasions, his 2012 Nissan Versa stalled when he was driving at approximately 55 miles per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22(a).) The driver further stated that this required two repairs, including transmission replacement, but the failure recurred after each repair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition to the\n   NHTSA complaints, Plaintiff also alleges that the Internet is rife with similar complaints, and provides six examples in his pleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24(a)-(f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Knotts asserts that despite these consumer complaints, NNA \"failed to disclose the defective CVT to Plaintiff and the Class members, both before and after purchase.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff asserts that \"[a]t all relevant times, Nissan had exclusive possession of the information regarding the defective CVT and its propensity to fail and malfunction based upon, inter alia, Nissan's own testing, industry testing, and the numerous consumer complaints it received.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Moreover, Plaintiff further alleges that NNA has \"no viable fix for the CVT defect,\" other than transmission replacement, after the failure manifests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The cost of the defect, Knotts asserts, \"has been borne by Plaintiff and Class members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this putative class action on November 7, 2017, \"on behalf of all current and former owners and lessees of model year[ ] 2012 ... Nissan Versas that are equipped with a continuously variable automatic transmission.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff proposes the following classes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    National Class\n   </strong>\n   : All current and former owners and lessees of the Subject Vehicles purchased or leased in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Minnesota Class\n   </strong>\n   : All current and former owners and lessees of the Subject Vehicles purchased or leased in the State of Minnesota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Knotts asserts three Minnesota statutory claims on behalf of a putative Minnesota Class. In Counts I and II, Knotts asserts deceptive trade practices claims under the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"MDTPA\"), Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325D.44,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-63), and \u00a7 325F.68. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-74.) In Count III, he asserts violations of the Minnesota False Statement in Advertising Act (\"MFSAA\"), Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325F.67. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In Counts IV through VII, Knotts asserts common law claims on behalf of the both the putative national and Minnesota classes. In Count IV, he asserts a claim for breach of express warranty, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-92), in Count V, he asserts a claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-101), in Count VI, he asserts a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and failure to disclose, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-09), and in Count VII, Knotts pleads an alternative claim of unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In its Motion to Dismiss, NNA argues that Plaintiff's claims fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for several reasons, including the following: (1) the express warranty claim fails because Knotts does not allege that his vehicle was defective in materials or workmanship; (2) the implied warranty claim fails because Knotts' 2012 Versa successfully performed its ordinary function for the duration of the express warranty; (3) there can be no claim for unjust enrichment because there is an express contract between the parties; (4) Plaintiff's common law fraudulent misrepresentation claim does not allege an actionable misrepresentation that Knotts relied upon, nor does he allege that NNA had fiduciary obligations to him or was otherwise obliged to make disclosures to\n   him under Minnesota law; (5) the MFSAA claim fails because Knotts does not identify any advertisement that he saw, heard, or relied upon; (6) the MDTPA claim in Count I fails because Knotts pleads no facts that would support injunctive relief; and (7) Knotts' statutory claims in Counts I through III fail because he alleges no public benefit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Def.'s Dismiss Mem.\") at 2-3 [Doc. No. 18].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its Motion to Strike, NNA moves to strike, or in the alternative, to dismiss, the nationwide-class definition and accompanying allegations set forth in paragraphs 44-51 of the Complaint. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Strike (\"Def.'s Strike Mem.\") at 1 [Doc. No. 24].) NNA argues that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it \"as to the claims of absent members of the putative class who did not purchase their automobiles in Minnesota and whose claims lack a sufficient connection with Minnesota to allow them to be adjudicated in a court of this state.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Breach of Express Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim for breach of express warranty should be dismissed for the following reasons: (1) Knotts fails to plead a defect in materials and workmanship, (Def.'s Dismiss Mem. at 7-8); (2) he does not show that NNA breached its repair promise, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9); (3) the warranty limitations are not unconscionable, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11); and (4) NNA was not required to pay for third-party repairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) NNA contends that its Warranty does not promise that its vehicles or any of the components are free of defects, but rather provides only that it \"will repair or replace components that are defective in materials or workmanship within the applicable time and mileage limitations\"-that is, five years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first-and requires consumers to take their vehicles to an authorized dealer for repairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7) Therefore, according to Defendant, to plead a breach of this express warranty, Plaintiff must show that \"(1) the vehicle had a defect in materials and workmanship; (2) he sought a repair from a Nissan dealer while the warranty was in effect; and (3) the dealer failed or refused to perform the repair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff's claim does not sufficiently assert these allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under Minnesota law, a claim for breach of an express warranty must contain the following elements: (1) the existence of a warranty; (2) a breach; and (3) a causal link between the breach and the alleged harm.\n   <em>\n    Sipe v. Workhorse Custom Chassis, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670696\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/525/#p530\">\n    572 F.3d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (8th Cir. 2009) (citing\n   <em>\n    Peterson v. Bendix Home Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10675394\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/318/50/#p52\">\n    318 N.W.2d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52-53 (Minn. 1982) ). There appears to be no dispute that a warranty between Knotts and NNA existed for some period of time, although the parties dispute whether Knotts complied with its terms, whether it remained in effect at the relevant time, and whether it was unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As noted, the Warranty provides basic coverage for 36 months or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first, and powertrain coverage for 60 months or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first. (Wittie Decl., Ex. A (Nissan 2012 Warranty Info. Booklet at 6).) The powertrain coverage specifically states that it applies to the transmission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As to both the general and powertrain-specific warranties, coverage is provided for \"any repairs needed to correct defects in materials or workmanship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the Warranty covers certain repairs at no charge to the vehicle owner, it expressly provides that \"[y]ou must take the vehicle to an authorized Nissan dealer in the United States during regular business hours at your expense in order to obtain warranty service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The Warranty contains no language that refers to reimbursement for third-party repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court first considers NNA's argument concerning Knotts' failure to allege that he sought repair from NNA or an authorized Nissan dealer. (Def.'s Dismiss Mem. at 8-9.) Plaintiff asserts that the Warranty's limitations regarding place of service, time, and mileage are unconscionable in light of \"Defendant's knowledge of the defective CVT, the lack of any solution to the problem, the fact that the defect tends to manifest just barely outside the Warranty period, and Defendant's refusal to honor the Warranty when Plaintiff or class members had any prior repair work completed at a non-Nissan repair shop.\" (Compl. \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court agrees that if NNA had knowledge of the alleged defect and its\n   delayed manifestation, the Warranty's timing and mileage limitations could plausibly be considered unconscionable, but the same is not true of the requirement that service be provided by an authorized Nissan dealer. Unlike timing-related limitations, the requirement that Nissan-authorized dealers perform repairs under the Warranty lacks a relationship to NNA's alleged knowledge of a delayed manifestation of defect. The Court thus finds the allegation of unconscionability as to the place-of-service requirement to be implausible. Accordingly, Plaintiff's breach of warranty claim must allege compliance with the terms of the Warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Knotts, however, does not allege that he presented his vehicle to an authorized Nissan dealer for repair and that the dealer refused to comply with the warranty. To the contrary, he asserts that he took his vehicle to Victory Auto Service &amp; Glass, which is unaffiliated with NNA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) Knotts alleges that when he contacted NNA after the repairs had been performed by Victory Auto Service &amp; Glass, NNA informed him that the cost of repairs was not covered by the Warranty because the issues arose outside of the Warranty period and the repairs were performed \"by service providers other than Nissan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   NNA cannot have breached the Warranty if Knotts did not submit his vehicle to a Nissan-authorized dealer for repair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kearney v. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

Aug. 29, 2018) (granting motion to dismiss breach of express warranty claim where plaintiffs did not allege that they presented their vehicles to BMW for repair, as required by the warranty). NNA's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's breach of express warranty claim (Count IV) is therefore granted on this basis. Because Knotts did not take his vehicle to a Nissan-authorized dealer, re-pleading would be futile. Accordingly this claim is dismissed with prejudice. Because the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for breach of express warranty on this basis, it does not address Defendant's additional arguments for dismissal of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Breach of Implied Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that NNA impliedly warranted that its CVTs were not inherently defective, were of good and merchantable quality, and were fit for the ordinary purposes for which they were sold. (Compl. \u00b6 95.) He asserts that NNA breached the warranty because the vehicles were \"prone to substantial failure and malfunction, pose serious safety concerns,\" and have \"substantially failed and malfunctioned.\" (Id. \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claim for breach of implied warranty fails for two reasons. First, it contends that the claim does not allege a defect that manifested within the time and mileage limits of the express warranty. (Def.'s Dismiss Mem. at 12.) Second, NNA asserts that Plaintiff's vehicle was merchantable as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   An implied warranty of merchantability requires that goods be \"fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\"\n   <em>\n    Daigle v.

Ct. App. 2010) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Under Minnesota law, a written implied warranty of merchantability may be excluded or modified by using language that\n   mentions merchantability and is conspicuous.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20336.2-316\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 336.2-316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Here, the Warranty mentions merchantability in all capital letters, stating, \"ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THIS WRITTEN WARRANTY.\" (Wittie Decl., Ex. A (Nissan 2012 Warranty Info. Booklet at 6).) This language is found within a rectangular box under the heading \"LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES AND OTHER WARRANTY TERMS AND STATE LAW RIGHTS,\" and precedes the express warranty terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In light of this language, Defendant asserts that for Knotts to sufficiently plead a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, he must plead that his vehicle was not merchantable before it reached the 60,000 mile limit of the express warranty. (Def.'s Dismiss Mem. at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, NNA argues that the out-of-warranty mileage of Plaintiff's vehicle affirmatively renders it merchantable as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) NNA contends that \"where the facts show that the vehicle was driven for a substantial period of time or for a substantial number of miles without serious problems, courts have concluded that the vehicle is merchantable as a matter of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13) (citing\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiff identifies NNA's website as the source of an advertisement, noting that there, NNA \"advertised and continues to advertise CVTs on its website as a 'next-generation' transmission, designed to 'provide smoother performance, quicker acceleration, and better fuel economy than ever before.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 3) (citing Nissan, Performance, https://www.nissanusa.com/cars/versa-sedan/versionsspecs/version.1-6-s-plus.html).

And while the reference to NNA's website appears in the third paragraph of the Complaint, in the Count III-specific allegations, Plaintiff does not identify any specific statements.

Here, as noted, Knotts does not allege that he viewed the advertisement, much less whether he viewed it prior to purchasing his car, and whether a causal link existed between the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, NNA argues that Plaintiff fails to allege that the advertisement occurred in Minnesota. (Def.'s Dismiss Mem. at 22.) Under the MFSAA, the alleged false statement must occur \"in this state.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325F.67. Because the Complaint fails to allege that the false statement occurred in Minnesota, the claim fails for this additional reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In short, the Court finds that Plaintiff's claim for relief under the MFSAA fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. However, because these deficiencies may be cured through re-pleading, the Court dismisses this claim without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that NNA continues to market and advertise the subject vehicles and CVTs to the public despite NNA's knowledge of the known defects.

Plaintiff further argues that it is highly likely that current and future lessees and owners will need to repair the vehicles' transmissions in the future, and cannot rely on NNA's statements regarding the vehicles' safety. (Pl.'s Opp'n to Dismiss at 35.) As for Knotts himself, he asserts that he is likely to be harmed in the future because he has no way of knowing if NNA has fixed the defective transmissions, whether his CVT will fail again, and whether NNA would replace it with another defective transmission.
