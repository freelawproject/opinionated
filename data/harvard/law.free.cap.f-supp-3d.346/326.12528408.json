Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case concerns supervised release and substance use, issues that were discussed in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Trotter\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   , the trial court dealt with the issue of whether and how to punish supervisees for their marijuana addictions. The conclusion was that it is appropriate to \"avoid violations of supervised release and punishment by incarceration merely for habitual marijuana use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526304\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526304\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/337/\">\n    at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The policy was designed to aid reintegration into the community.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526304\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/337/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The instant memorandum considers another important issue in supervised release: what to do with a supervisee who habitually uses alcohol in socially acceptable amounts and conditions violating the terms of his supervised release. The marijuana holding in\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   is followed and extended to habitual use of alcohol socially: it avoids violations of supervised release and punishment by incarceration merely for alcohol use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court will not find violations of supervised release and punishment by incarceration merely for habitual, socially acceptable use of alcohol except in unusual cases. When a supervisee appears to be reintegrated into society but uses alcohol socially, the supervisee shows no interest in stopping alcohol use, and alcohol played no part in the underlying offense, the court will consider terminating supervision, releasing defendant as unimproved with respect to this habit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The purpose of federal supervised release is to assist individuals convicted of crimes rehabilitate by provision of monitoring and other services. The United States Probation Department (\"Probation\") monitors individuals on supervised release and can help a supervisee with his or her reintegration into lawful society by providing drug and alcohol treatment, mental health counseling, vocational training, and many other services to help reduce risks of recidivism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following a term of incarceration, successful reintegration into the community is paramount. Reconnections with family and employment are vital.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mark T. Berg &amp; Beth M. Huebner,\n   <em>\n    Reentry and the Ties That Bind: An Examination of Social Ties, Employment, and Recidivism\n   </em>\n   , 28 Just. Q. 382 (2011). \"Every time a connection\n   is broken with the world outside of prison, by unnecessary incarceration following violations of supervised release, it probably becomes more difficult to reconnect.\"\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526304\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/337/\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Violations of supervised release may result in-and in certain instances must result in-incarceration. This situation traps some defendants in a cycle of supervised release and prison. Like many Americans, Tyrone Thomas drinks alcohol socially, mainly in the form of beer. He has done so for more than a decade. Since leaving prison where he was incarcerated on a federal drug distribution charge, his only violations of supervised release conditions have been for relatively minor alcohol use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thomas is employed and has a stable home life. But his alcohol use, Probation believes, should mean incarceration for violation of one of the conditions of his supervised release. Supervised release, thus, has become a hindrance to this defendant's full reintegration into society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Using Probation's limited resources on a supervisee whose only violation is that he imbibes and enjoys alcohol on occasion-a legal and widely used substance-is a waste of resources.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   U.S. Courts,\n   <em>\n    Probation Offices Look to Technology to Offset Budget, Staffing Reductions\n   </em>\n   (Apr. 18, 2012) (discussing innovative measures taken by Probation to offset budgetary concerns). \"Probation ... should be focused on assisting those defendants with the potential for success, not on those doomed to fail\" because they use a substance widely approved and used in society at all socioeconomic levels.\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526304\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/337/\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II.

He has completed treatment for opioid addiction and no longer uses illegal substances. His involvement in the underlying criminal scheme funded his own drug and opioid addiction-one connected to medical treatment. His alcohol use is and was unrelated to his opioid addiction and his role in any criminal scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Thomas has demonstrated that he probably will continue to use alcohol socially. He is fully employed and appears to have a stable home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Continued supervision will probably interfere with his reintegration into society. He may needlessly be placed in prison. Extended supervision is unlikely to have any deterrent effect on him personally or on the public generally. His family and community, including consistent and stable employment, will probably help him avoid criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   B. Conduct of Defendant and Interests of Justice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Since his release from jail, Thomas has not committed any crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 7:22-8:1, Oct. 17, 2018.

With support of friends and family, he is likely to lead a productive, law-abiding life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Continued supervision is unlikely to assist in the rehabilitation of Thomas. He began using alcohol more than a decade ago. He appears to be unable to stop using alcohol socially. This habit has led to, and will necessarily lead to, conflict between Thomas and his supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The government seeks to punish the defendant for something that is legal, and of which an overwhelming majority of Americans approve. This would be unfair, since he is employed and has been otherwise compliant with the terms of his supervised release. The court will not incarcerate him for violating the conditions of supervised release when those violations are for habitual, social or approved alcohol use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The court should avoid a cycle of supervised release, use of alcohol, and prison. Thomas has been unable or unwilling to comply with the conditions relating to alcohol for nearly a year, so he would be likely to remain in future violations of supervision conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   C.
