INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2000, Olga Paule Perrier-Bilbo (\"Perrier-Bilbo\") emigrated from France and settled in Scituate, Massachusetts. In due course, she applied to become a United States citizen. Having completed all the necessary requirements, she is fully eligible for United States citizenship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   She balks, however, at the words \"so help me God\" which conclude the oath of allegiance administered at United States naturalization ceremonies. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") offered her a private induction which would omit the words she finds offensive. Not surprisingly, she wishes to\n   participate in the public ceremony with other new citizens and their families and friends. USCIS welcomed her at such a ceremony, assuring her she need not herself say those four words and her oath of allegiance and United States citizenship would nonetheless be fully valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Perrier-Bilbo will have none of it. Evidently, she seeks a ceremony where neither the official administering the oath nor the new citizens will conclude by uttering the phrase \"so help me God.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Perrier-Bilbo alleges that the phrase's inclusion in the oath violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 153-70, ECF No. 1; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb - 2000bb-4, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 171-82; and her rights to equal protection and procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 183-97. Perrier-Bilbo seeks a declaration that these provisions have been violated and an injunction permanently enjoining the government \"from placing 'so help me God' in future naturalization oath ceremonies,\" as well as reimbursement of the cost of her second naturalization application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States and Francis Cissna, the Director of USCIS (collectively, the \"Defendants\"), move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim and lack of standing.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 2, 2017, Perrier-Bilbo filed a complaint against the Defendants in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. The complaint includes claims for violations of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb - 2000bb-4 ; and the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on February 22, 2018. Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 10. On May 8, 2018, this Court heard oral argument on the motion, during which it advised the parties that it would treat the motion as cross-motions for summary judgment and took the motion under advisement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Perrier-Bilbo is a citizen of France who moved to Scituate, Massachusetts in 2000. Compl. \u00b6 56. In 2002, she became a permanent resident of the United States, and in 2004, she was issued a green card.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. In 2008, she applied for naturalization, fulfilling the necessary paperwork and interview requirements, and her application was approved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-66. She then received a form indicating that she was to take the oath of citizenship on March 4, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2009, Perrier-Bilbo wrote to USCIS requesting that she be permitted to take the oath without the phrase \"so help me God.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. USCIS informed her that she could either participate in the oath ceremony and omit the \"so help me God\" language, or schedule a private oath ceremony in which the government would omit the phrase in administering the oath.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. A few months later, Perrier-Bilbo received a letter from USCIS stating that she had fifteen days to notify USCIS of her decision, and that if she declined to respond or choose one of the two options, USCIS would reopen her application and deny it for lack of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Perrier-Bilbo retained counsel, who informed USCIS that neither of the two options provided were satisfactory to Perrier-Bilbo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Further attempts to negotiate were unsuccessful, and USCIS eventually denied Perrier-Bilbo's application as abandoned, informing her that she could file a new application in the future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. After years of trying and failing to obtain a waiver of the application fee, Perrier-Bilbo filed a second application in December 2014, which was granted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, 103, 108. She was again sent a form indicating that she was scheduled for a naturalization oath ceremony to be held on April 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   That day, Perrier-Bilbo arrived at the United States District Court in Boston, where the ceremony was to take place, and attempted to explain her objection to an individual at the courthouse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-25. That person told her that she didn't \"have to say anything.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125. Perrier-Bilbo further objected, and was eventually told to forgo the ceremony that day and contact USCIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After speaking to someone at USCIS, Perrier-Bilbo was sent a letter in August 2017, notifying her that she was scheduled to participate in a naturalization oath ceremony taking place on September 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132. The letter stated that due to her religious objections, she may take a modified oath in which she may decline to recite the portion of the oath to which she objects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133. \"[H]owever,\" the letter continued, \"please note that the full oath of allegiance will be administered on this day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter informed her that the court could instead schedule a \"private naturalization ceremony to take the modified oath of allegiance as you have requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. Perrier-Bilbo did not attend the ceremony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Defendants move to dismiss Perrier-Bilbo's complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Defs.' Mot. 1.

As the Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\" -- an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.' \" Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of -- the injury has to be \"fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\" Third, it must be \"likely,\" as opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (first quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitmore\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arkansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p155\">\n    495 U.S. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p155\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633773\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/149/#p155\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), then quoting\n   <em>\n    Simon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eastern Ky.

When the question is whether a government action was or was not legal, and the plaintiff is herself the object of the action, \"there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused [her] injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    at 561-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perrier-Bilbo correctly argues that she has a \"concrete and particularized\" interest in becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States as provided by federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 59 ; Pl.'s Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\") 2, ECF No. 18. Here, Perrier-Bilbo also sufficiently alleges an \"actual\" invasion of her protected interest. Because of her unwillingness to speak the phrase \"so help me God\" as part of her oath of citizenship, she was afforded two different options: (i) to participate in the ceremony and omit the words; or (ii) to participate in a private ceremony, at which the words would not be included in the oath. Compl. \u00b6 70. Perrier-Bilbo alleges that neither of these options satisfies her constitutional right to participate in a public ceremony without having to take part in a religion-imbued oath. Pl.'s Opp'n 3. Because of her objection, she claims, the ceremony was rescheduled twice and Perrier-Bilbo was forced to apply for naturalization (and pay the attendant fees) twice. Thus, Perrier-Bilbo has sufficiently alleged injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the Constitution requires a \"causal connection\" between the action complained of and the injury that the plaintiff has suffered.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Defendants argue that there is no causation because the alleged harm is either attributable to Perrier-Bilbo's own actions, or to those of the court administrating the naturalization ceremony. Defs.' Mot. 1, 8 (\"[I]t was a third party -- this district court -- that ultimately decided how it would accommodate [Perrier-Bilbo's] request.\"). This Court disagrees. Perrier-Bilbo challenges the federal regulation providing for the inclusion of the phrase to which she objects in the oath of citizenship. She has properly named as a defendant USCIS, which is the federal government agency responsible for, among other duties, \"establish[ing] national immigration services policies and priorities.\" Homeland Security Act of 2002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(D). Her alleged injury is thus fairly traceable to the Defendants' actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third and finally, Perrier-Bilbo must demonstrate that it is \" 'likely' ... that the injury will be 'redressed by a favorable decision.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Simon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p41\">\n    426 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174426\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/26/#p41\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Here, Perrier-Bilbo seeks a declaration that the inclusion of the phrase \"so help me God\" in the naturalization oath violates the Constitution; an injunction permanently enjoining the government \"from placing 'so help me God' in future naturalization oath ceremonies\"; and reimbursement for the cost of her second naturalization application. Compl. 41. A decision by this Court declaring the inclusion of the phrase \"so help me God\" in the official oath of citizenship to be unconstitutional would likely redress Perrier-Bilbo's alleged injury. Perrier-Bilbo consequently has the requisite standing to bring her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
