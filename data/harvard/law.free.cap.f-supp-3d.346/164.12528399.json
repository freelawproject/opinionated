The Plan is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    ERISA\n   </strong>\n   \"). This matter comes before me on cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record filed by the Plaintiffs (ECF No. 50) and by Defendant MaineGeneral Health (\"\n   <strong>\n    MaineGeneral\n   </strong>\n   \" or the \"\n   <strong>\n    administrator\n   </strong>\n   \") (ECF No. 48).

Plaintiff Roibas is an assignee of True's rights to reimbursement of medical expenses for services covered by the Plan. AR 327, 339.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant MaineGeneral is the Plan administrator, responsible for selecting the terms of the Plan and interpreting them. AR 93. Defendant EBPA is the third party administrator of the Plan and conducts the administrative, \"ministerial,\" operations, such as processing claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 93, 102.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August of 2014, Melissa True entered into a \"Gestational Carrier Agreement\" (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Agreement\n   </strong>\n   \") with intended parents Anxo Cereijo Roibas and Szczepan Wojciech (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Intended Parents\n   </strong>\n   \"). AR 329. The Agreement provided that True would \"carry and deliver the child(ren) of the Intended Parents ... through medical procedures using assisted reproductive technology.\" AR 329-30. True was to be compensated for serving as a gestational carrier. AR 341-42. The Intended Parents also committed to \"pay all medical expenses which are reasonably and directly related to the pregnancy and birth\n   <em>\n    which are not covered by\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    True's\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    health insurance.\n   </em>\n   \" AR 339 (emphasis added). True agreed to submit claims for all pregnancy-related medical expenses to her health insurer and to assist the Intended Parents in seeking to have the expenses covered, including through \"all available administrative and legal remedies\" if the insurer denied the claims. AR 331-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a section titled, \"Medical Covered Expenses,\" the Plan lists,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [c]harges for maternity care including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care as well as charges arising from complications that may occur during maternity and delivery. Comprehensive lactation support and counseling, by a trained provider during pregnancy and/or in the postpartum period are payable at 100% at the applicable benefit level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   AR 027. The next section of the Plan is titled, \"General Medical Exclusions and Limitations,\" and lists, \"[e]xpenses for surrogacy.\" AR 032.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   True became pregnant and gave birth, in accordance with the Agreement. Medical expenses from the pregnancy and delivery were submitted to EBPA. AR 110-84; 299. EBPA initially approved, and paid for, some expenses related to True's pregnancy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 110-21, 127-29, 134-36, 146-52, 299. Upon review of True's claims and medical records, a utilization review nurse employed by EBPA identified that True was a surrogate mother and that, accordingly, her claims should be denied because they were not covered by the Plan. AR 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   True appealed the denial of her claims in a letter to EBPA dated January 20, 2016. She stated that the \"main[ ]\" basis of her appeal was that she \"was informed there would not be any issues related to claims for prenatal care\" during a call to EBPA in January 2015, in which she inquired \"to determine if EBPA had maternity coverage for surrogacy related pregnancies.\" AR 301. True claimed in the letter that she was informed on that call that \"there was no exclusion, [and] that pregnancy was a covered diagnosis.\" AR 301. After communicating with MaineGeneral, EBPA denied\n   True's appeal, claiming that it had no record of the phone call that she referenced. AR 302. EBPA further informed her that \"[v]erification can only be documented in your file when you had actual medical coverage\" and that \"a verification of benefits is not a guarantee of coverage.\" AR 302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   True, with the assistance of counsel, filed a second administrative appeal in April of 2016, arguing that \"[t]he Plan does not distinguish between pregnancies based upon why the woman became pregnant.\" AR 304. True also argued that she served as a gestational carrier, rather than a surrogate, that \"[t]he Plan does not state that expenses for a 'gestational carrier' are excluded,\" and that any ambiguity in the Plan should be construed in favor of coverage. AR 305. EBPA denied this appeal in a letter dated May 4, 2016. AR 318-19. The basis for the denial was that \"True's denied claims fall under the surrogacy exclusion as outlined in the [Plan],\" and that, to the extent that True was a gestational carrier and not a surrogate, the Plan excludes \"[e]xpenses for any service, procedure or supply not listed as a covered service in the [P]lan.\" AR 318.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Roibas filed a Complaint in this court on January 19, 2017. Roibas claimed standing to challenge the administrator's denial of claims as True's assignee. Compl. (ECF No. 1). True was added as a plaintiff to the action on August 3, 2017. Second Am. Compl. (ECF No. 35).

Mot. 4. According to the Plaintiffs, a plan participant who retains a surrogate cannot be reimbursed for the cost of retaining a surrogate under the \"expenses for surrogacy\" exclusion, but the expenses of a pregnancy that results when a plan participant serves as a gestational carrier are not excluded. Pls.' Mot. 4. The Plaintiffs point out that the Plan does not make any distinctions between pregnancies based on the purpose of the pregnancy or on who the intended parents are to be. Pls.' Mot. 4. Because the Plaintiffs view the costs related to the pregnancy of a plan participant as distinct from expenses related to surrogacy, they argue that the Plan unambiguously covers True's pregnancy expenses and that the administrator's decision to deny True benefits was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Defendants contend that the surrogacy exclusion unambiguously bars expenses relating to the pregnancy and childbirth of a surrogate mother. Though they concede that the term \"surrogacy\" is not defined in the Plan, the Defendants argue that \"[t]he plain meaning of 'surrogacy,' as gleaned from common dictionary definitions, is broad and commonly understood to encompass the entire process of carrying and delivering a child for another person.\" Def.'s Mot. 6 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1674 (10th ed. 2014) ).

Whether the Plan Administrator's Interpretation is Unreasonable.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the First Circuit has not settled definitively on guiding principles for when a Plan administrator's interpretation is unreasonable, the text of the Plan and the plain meaning of the Plan's terms are a logical starting point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659993\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/58/#p65\">\n    705 F.3d at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Defendants' conclusion that \"expenses for surrogacy\" can be read to mean\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   expenses associated with a pregnancy by means of a surrogate-from the costs of preparing a surrogacy agreement, to in vitro fertilization, to pre-natal care, to delivery, and to post-birth care for the mother and child-is grounded in the common understanding of surrogacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 1674 (defining \"surrogacy\" as \"[t]he process of carrying and delivering a child for another person\"). The Plaintiffs argue that True served as a gestational carrier, and not a surrogate, because a \"surrogate mother provides her own egg to be fertilized, while a gestational carrier hosts the fertilized egg of another individual and carries it to term.\" Pls.' Mot. 8. Because \"[n]owhere does the Plan reference gestational carriers or otherwise exclude a gestational carrier's pregnancy from the Plan's benefits provided relative to prenatal care,\" the Plaintiffs conclude that the surrogacy exclusion\n   cannot apply. Pls.' Mot. 8. But the plain meaning of \"surrogacy\" encompasses carrying a child for another couple. While there may be another more narrow reading possible, the Plan Administrator's interpretation does not contravene the plain meaning of the term \"surrogacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Some Circuits consider whether the Administrator's interpretation is in keeping with the purpose of the Plan. Here, the Administrator's construction is more closely aligned with the Plan's purpose of \"provid[ing] medical benefits for all covered employees.\" AR 002. Read in its entirety, the Plan is consistent in its broad exclusion of artificial means of achieving a pregnancy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 034-035 (excluding treatments and procedures related to infertility and \"expenses for surrogacy\"). Under the Plaintiffs' reading of the Plan a \"gestational carrier\" would receive benefits for pregnancy expenses but a \"surrogate mother\" would not be entitled to those benefits. While it seems possible that the drafters of the Plan would carve out all carriers regardless of whether they used their own or a donor egg, it is hard to believe that they would have intended to cover the pregnancy expenses of a Plan participant who served as a gestational carrier but deny pregnancy benefits to a Plan participant who was a biological mother acting as a surrogate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Courts also look to whether an interpretation is internally consistent within a plan in order to determine whether the administrator has abused its discretion. The Plaintiffs argue that the administrator's interpretation \"does not attempt to reconcile the exclusion [of the expenses for surrogacy with] the covered benefit of pregnancy care,\" and so is not internally consistent. Pls.' Mot. 7. The administrator's interpretation of \"expenses for surrogacy\" as preventing the Plan from reimbursing for otherwise-covered pregnancy expenses does not render the Plan internally inconsistent. A policy may cover a broad category of treatment, subject to specific exclusions. The Florida District Court, addressing a similar argument, found that, \"[a]lthough the Plan covers an insured's pregnancy costs and the costs associated with pregnancy complications, that certain exceptions apply to this does not make the Plan inconsistent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla. Health Sci. Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203201873\">\n    2006 WL 3201873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8. Just as it would not be inconsistent for a plan to cover surgical expenses but exclude expenses for cosmetic surgery, so it is not inconsistent for the Plan to cover pregnancy costs, while excluding costs for a certain type of pregnancy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does reading the phrase to prohibit coverage of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   expenses of a surrogate pregnancy render the provision about covering all expenses in a non-surrogate pregnancy meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Some courts also consider whether the administrator inconsistently applied the provision. Plaintiffs argue that the policy was inconsistently applied to True. They contend that when she was hired at MaineGeneral, she contacted EBPA and was informed that the Plan covered expenses for \"surrogacy related pregnancies\" and that she initially received benefits for some of her pregnancy expenses only to find out later that her claims were denied. AR 301. The Defendants respond that EBPA had no record of her contacting them because she was not an active member on the date that she called. The record further suggests that EBPA informed True that \"a verification of benefits is not a guarantee of coverage.\" AR 302. The Plaintiffs have\n   not produced any other documentation supporting this claim, nor any other evidence that the administrator, MaineGeneral, has interpreted or applied the Plan inconsistently to different Plan participants. The Plaintiffs' argument that they relied on the erroneous advice of an EBPA representative is made only to show that the Plan was inconsistently applied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although this is some evidence of inconsistency, the Plaintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that incorrect information given to a Plan participant on one occasion or a reversal of a decision on coverage rises to the level of an abuse of discretion by the Plan Administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Administrator's interpretation of the Plan is supported by the plain meaning of \"surrogacy.\" It is also consistent with the overall language and the purpose of the Plan. Finally, although there exists some inconsistent application of the Plan to Plaintiff True, the inconsistency was limited. The standard of review is worth reemphasizing: I do not review the interpretation of the provision\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , but rather for whether the administrator's interpretation is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Shea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122073\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/67/#p73\">\n    837 F.3d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
