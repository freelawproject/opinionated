Upon their arrival at his home, Yannai restricted their contact with the outside world and abused them sexually. When law enforcement arrived to arrest him, he overdosed on benzodiazepine, later admitting that he had attempted suicide to avoid jail. Hr'g Tr. 5, 39-43, ECF No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Yannai was represented by the Federal Defenders of New York, namely Michael K. Schneider, Heidi C. Cesare, and Ben Silverman. Trial began on May 23, 2011. The evidence established that, between approximately 2003 and 2009, Yannai induced young women to travel to work as \"personal assistants\" at his home in Pound Ridge, New York. Yannai's home-in a rural area far from public transportation-made it difficult for his victims to escape. Trial Tr. 155, 322, 597, ECF Nos. 149-156. Yannai targeted young women from abroad, posing as a former female employee of his to lure women into agreeing to work for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-60, 132-33, 268-69, 440, 570. He promised the victims a \"green card\" visa, a $20,000 bonus, and payment for college in the United States-none of which any victim ever received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55, 59-60, 65, 70, 131-33, 135, 149, 183, 272-76, 426, 442-45, 576-77, 587-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Part of Yannai's scheme was his instruction to his victims to lie to immigration\n   authorities upon arriving in the United States, saying that their trips were for tourism rather than work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-72, 143-44, 289, 451-53, 586-88. By ensuring that his victims entered the United States illegally, he was able to threaten them with deportation if they refused to yield to his demands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-59, 137, 152, 178, 449, 460, 593. Yannai encouraged his victims to arrive with no money, phone, credit card, or return ticket home, assuring them that he would pay for everything.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55, 135, 273, 296, 434-35, 445, 573-74, 592, 598. When the victims arrived, he lied to prevent his victims from contacting the outside world, falsely claiming that any emails would cause computer viruses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77, 166, 280. Once they were in his home, Yannai subjected his victims to physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 539, 605-08. This abuse included forcing a victim to perform oral sex on him, and forcibly digitally penetrating another victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After summations concluded on May 26, 2011, the parties returned to court for the jury charge and deliberations on June 1. That morning, the defense reported that Yannai had collapsed while driving to court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1165. I initially declined to proceed in his absence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1170. Medical staff at the hospital where Yannai was being treated reported that he remained unconscious and that his condition appeared to be caused by a drug overdose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1177-78. I inquired into the circumstances of his collapse, questioning the emergency room treating physicians on the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1185-90. After speaking with the doctors, I concluded that he had voluntarily absented himself and proceeded in his absence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1191-93. At the request of Yannai's attorneys, I informed the jury that he was hospitalized before giving the jury charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1207.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After approximately three days in his overdose-induced coma, Yannai regained consciousness. His attorneys reported that while he acknowledged taking Valium the night before the incident, he denied intentionally overdosing, and they therefore moved for a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1345-47. I denied the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1347. Shortly thereafter, the jury reached a verdict and, with Yannai listening via speakerphone, the jury convicted him on all counts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1350-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his conviction, Yannai requested reassignment of counsel, and I appointed Georgia Hinde and Neil Checkman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CJA 20, ECF Nos. 170, 186. Yannai moved for a new trial on the sole ground that jury charging and deliberation should not have proceeded in his absence. I conducted a full evidentiary hearing on his motion, at which a court-appointed toxicologist testified. Even though Yannai was in the best position to provide important details of the second overdose, he declined to do so. Hr'g Tr. 5-6, 10, ECF No. 209. Instead, he submitted an affidavit that provided only a vague and incomplete account of the second overdose, claiming that the overdose was accidental.

I concluded that the second overdose had been voluntary and deliberate, and reaffirmed my prior finding that Yannai had purposefully absented himself from the trial. Sent. Hr'g Tr. 28-29, ECF No. 242. Moreover, because the issues that arose during the jury charge and deliberations were entirely legal and Yannai could not have contributed to their resolution, his presence would have made no difference. Accordingly, I rejected his far-fetched claim that his presence post-closing would have affected the trial's outcome and held that, even if proceeding in his absence was error, it was entirely harmless.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17. I ultimately\n   imposed a below-Guidelines sentence of 132 months' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Yannai appealed. After explaining that his absence was properly deemed \"voluntary and deliberate,\" the Second Circuit ruled that there existed \"no error of law in the district court's refusal to adjourn the trial for more than one day or in its denial of Yannai's motion for a mistrial.\"\n   <em>\n    Yannai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275833\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/226/\">\n    791 F.3d at 243-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Br. 17. Contrary to Yannai's assertions, defense counsel never directed any epithets at Yannai or his conduct. She never actually called Yannai a \"dirty old man,\" let alone admitted that Yannai was guilty of the crimes charged.

Moreover, defense counsel did not merely note that the prosecution would paint Yannai as a \"dirty old man\" and then sit down. Both during her opening and throughout the trial, counsel reminded the jury that \"this courtroom ... is a court of law. It's not a court of moral opinion.\" Trial Tr. 24. Counsel's opening reasonably addressed the prosecutor's attempts to \"tell[ ] [the jury] what a bad man Joseph Yannai is\" and promptly refocused the jury's attention on the \"important legal issues in this case\"-Yannai's intent and actual conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. The same theme carried through into closing arguments-which Yannai does not contend were ineffective-when counsel explained that \"you're not here to decide whether Mr. Yannai's a jerk or not,\" \"an egotistical over-the-top womanizer,\" or \"whether his home was a hostile sexist work environment .... You're here to decide simply whether the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Joseph Yannai committed the crimes they accused him of.\" Trial Tr. 1084-85. Such arguments turned on a tactical decision of how best to focus the jury on the issues that presented the best chance of acquittal. The Federal Defenders of New York regularly make these kinds of challenging decisions and consistently do extraordinary work despite the numerous obstacles they face. Yannai's attorneys were no exception to the Federal Defenders' usual high caliber performance, and their actions here were certainly not \"deficient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nor does Yannai point to any prejudice that flowed from this purportedly ineffective tactic. Yannai does not explain precisely how this opening impacted the outcome of the trial nor does he offer an alternative opening that would have been more effective, particularly given the uncontroverted and overwhelming evidence offered by the prosecution. Yannai makes no attempt to explain what effect this opening might have had on the jury's thinking or why he found it unpalatable, especially given the relatively anodyne nature of Cesare's opening statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet.

My own experience presiding over decades of trials accords with Schneider's sworn statement. The Federal Defenders of New York invariably\n   pause at the end of a cross-examination to confer with their clients. That pause may not always appear on the record-sometimes defense counsel asks for my indulgence before speaking with their client, sometimes they do not-but the conversation occurs even when not apparent from a transcript, and it occurred during Yannai's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But even if counsel did not confer with Yannai about additional questions on cross-examination, that decision would not constitute ineffective assistance.

Br. 28. Putting aside the fact that this letter was submitted over a year after the close of trial and that, as Yannai himself notes in his brief, mistrial motions are subject to harmless error review, the Second Circuit has already held that the trial properly continued while Yannai was hospitalized.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
