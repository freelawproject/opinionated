INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff law firm Hunton &amp; Williams LLP (\"Hunton\") filed this action under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") against three federal agencies: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\"USACE\" or \"Corps\"), and the U.S. Department of the Army (\"Army\"). The nine FOIA requests at issue in this suit concern the federal government's Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") and Rivers and Harbors Act (\"RHA\") jurisdiction over an industrial site in Redwood City, California. The developer of the site, Hunton's client, had requested an Approved Jurisdictional\n   Determination (\"AJD\") in 2012 in order to definitively establish the government's position on CWA and RHA jurisdiction over the site. The Corps, which is a component of the Army, and the EPA share responsibility for issuing such AJDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Corps prepared a draft AJD in 2014 addressing jurisdiction under both the CWA and RHA, but before that AJD was released, the Army intervened to perform a \"legal and policy review\" in its role as the Corps' parent agency. After that legal and policy review was complete and the Corps had briefly returned to work on the AJD, the EPA stepped in and used its \"special case\" authority to take over the CWA portion of the AJD. As far as the Court is aware, the EPA had still not issued the CWA portion of the AJD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to learn more about each agency's decision-making process, Hunton filed FOIA requests with the EPA, the Corps, and the Army, and ultimately challenged each agency's response by filing suit. The three agencies submitted motions for summary judgment on their responses to the requests, and Hunton submitted a motion for partial summary judgment challenging the agencies' withholdings pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6. The Court found that the agencies had performed adequate searches and that the agencies had properly justified some of their withholdings under the applicable FOIA exemptions. However, the Court found that none of the agencies had sufficiently justified their withholdings under Exemption 5 on the basis of the deliberative process privilege, nor had the Corps sufficiently justified its withholdings under Exemptions 5 based on either the attorney-work product privilege or attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the Court ordered supplemental briefing and submission of selected documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review so that it could determine the propriety of the agencies' withholdings under these exemptions. For the reasons given below, the Court grants the three defendant agencies summary judgment on the majority of their withholdings. However, a small number of redactions were either not sufficiently justified or simply do not fall under Exemption 5 or Exemption 6, and therefore, summary judgment as to those redactions is denied. The Court now orders the release of the erroneously redacted information that it has observed\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , but does not order that the agencies reprocess and relabel their responsive records due to the low rate of error observed during this round of summary judgment briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case arises from several FOIA requests Hunton submitted in 2014 and 2015 seeking documents related to the federal government's response, or lack thereof, to its client DMB Redwood City Saltworks's 2012 request for an AJD on an industrial site\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   it plans to redevelop in Redwood City, California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5, ECF No. 1. It submitted its AJD request because, in order to proceed with its planned redevelopment, Hunton's client would \"need[ ] to know whether or to what extent the federal Government considers its Salt Plant facilities to be jurisdictional under either the RHA or CWA\" as either \"navigable waters of the United States\" or \"waters of the\n   United States,\" respectively. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. \"The extent of federal jurisdiction will dictate whether Saltworks must apply for permits under the CWA and RHA before redeveloping the Site.\" Compl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Corps holds sole authority to issue AJDs regarding RHA jurisdiction, while the Corps and the EPA share the authority to issue AJDs regarding CWA jurisdiction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Because of the \"EPA's historic involvement [in] and understanding\" of the industrial site, when Saltworks submitted its request for an AJD in 2012, it requested that the EPA issue the CWA portion of the AJD. Compl. \u00b6 10. Initially, the EPA declined to exercise this authority, informing Saltworks that the Corps would determine both the RHA and CWA portions of the AJD, with some EPA involvement as to the CWA portion. Compl. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By early 2014, the Corps, which had maintained primary authority for issuing the AJDs over the industrial site, had completed its review and was almost ready to release its final AJD on both RHA and CWA jurisdiction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-18. At that point, the EPA and the Army intervened. In May 2014, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy instructed the Corps not to release the AJD for the site because the Assistant Secretary's Office would be conducting a \"legal and policy review\" of the Corps' determination. This review \"only considered the procedural aspects of the determination and did not in any way consider the substantive question of whether the property in question is in fact jurisdictional.\" Darcy Mem. for the Chief of Engineers at 1, Ex. 1, ECF No. 46-1. Once the Army had finished this review in November 2014 and returned the matter to the Corps, the Corps sent a draft of its AJD to the EPA. The draft analyzed jurisdiction under both the RHA and the CWA. Then, in March 2015, EPA decided to use its \"special case\" authority to take over responsibility for the CWA portion of the AJD. As a result, that same month, the Corps issued an AJD addressing jurisdiction under the RHA only. Compl. \u00b6 27. As far as the Court is aware, the EPA has yet to issue its decision regarding CWA jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Seeking information on the EPA's, Corps', and Army's protracted decisionmaking processes, Hunton filed several FOIA requests with the agencies. As to the EPA, Hunton filed a FOIA request in May 2014 seeking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. Any and all documents related to the DMB Redwood City Salt Plant (also known as DMB Redwood City Saltworks project, Redwood City Saltworks project site, Redwood City salt production facilities, or Cargill operations in Redwood City) since January 1, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. Any and all communications between EPA (all offices) and the other parties, including but not limited to the Corps (all offices), the Department of the Army (all offices, including the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works), Congress (members and staff), other Executive Branch employees, and non-government third parties, related to the DMB Redwood City Salt Plant (also known as DMB Redwood City Saltworks project, Redwood City Saltworks project site, Redwood City salt production facilities, or Cargill operations in Redwood City) since January 1, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. Any request (other than this letter) from any entity or person for any documents relating to the DMB Redwood City Salt Plant (also known as DMB Redwood City Saltworks project, Redwood City Saltworks project site, Redwood City salt production facilities, or Cargill operations in Redwood City) received on or after January 1, 2014, and all documents, communications, and records relating to such a request, including any response by EPA to that request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Compl., Ex. E, ECF No. 1-5. Hunton twice requested that the temporal scope of its request be expanded to include any documents generated since its previous request. Additionally, in March 2015, Hunton submitted a fourth request to the EPA seeking: \"the Corps' 'final' CWA JD (with attachments) and/or 'final' combined RHA and CWA JD (with attachments) for Redwood City Saltworks. By 'final,' [Hunton meant] the version of the document that was prepared for signature by Major General Peabody (whether or not the document was ever actually signed), and sent to the EPA.\" Compl., Ex. N, ECF No. 1-14 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In May 2014, Hunton also sent a request to the Corps that was nearly identical to its May 2014 request to the EPA, and thrice expanded the temporal scope of its request to include more recent documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15-cv-1207, Compl., Ex. E., ECF No. 1-5; Compl., Ex. F, ECF No. 1-6; Compl., Ex. G, ECF No. 1-7. In March 2015, Hunton also submitted a nearly identical request to the Army, but never expanded the temporal scope of its request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15-cv-1208, Compl., Ex. E, ECF No. 1-5. Unsatisfied with the agencies' responses, Hunton filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following an initial round of summary judgment briefing, the Court determined that all three agencies had performed adequate searches for responsive records.\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 236. The Court also granted summary judgment to the Army as to its withholdings pursuant to Exemption 5 on the basis of the attorney-client privilege, as well as its withholding of its employees' contact information pursuant to Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 255, 257.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court denied summary judgment as to the Army's withholding of the names of Army employees appearing in responsive records pursuant to Exemption 6, and ordered that those names be released.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 257-59. Additionally, the Court denied summary judgment as to all three agencies regarding their withholdings under Exemption 5 on the basis of the deliberative process privilege because none of the agencies had provided sufficiently detailed explanations of their withholdings under the privilege.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 240. The Court similarly denied the Corps summary judgment on its withholdings pursuant to Exemption 5 on the bases of the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product privilege.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Given these deficiencies, the Court ordered supplemental briefing so that the agencies could better explain their redactions, and also ordered that each agency submit \"a representative selection of a portion of the responsive documents\" for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Order, ECF No. 62. The parties recommended that they submit 120 representative documents to the Court-20 selected by Hunton, and 100 selected at random by the Defendants, subject to certain\n   restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Proposed Case Management Plan, ECF No. 65. Having received the 120 selected documents, Defendants' updated\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Indices, and the parties' supplemental briefing, the Court now grants summary judgment as to the majority of Defendants' redactions, but denies it as to a few.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

When reviewing the EPA's documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court did not identify any portion of the EPA's documents that contained what appeared to be secret law concerning its decision to exercise its special case authority. Indeed, each redaction submitted to the Court is clearly both predecisional and deliberative. For that reason, the Court grants summary judgment to the EPA on its deliberative process privilege withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Army\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, the Court evaluates the Army's withholdings under the deliberative process privilege and grants the Army summary judgment on these withholdings. The Court previously found the Army's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and declarations to be insufficiently detailed to allow the Court to determine why the deliberative process privilege had been applied to certain records.\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 244. In particular, the Court found that the Army's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index entries \"provide[d] only the fuzziest description of the deliberative process, and also omit entirely to describe the 'function or significance' of the particular record or the decisionmaking authority vested in the author.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, these entries lacked explanations of the \"possible harms that could result from releasing the withheld information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Many of the documents the Army has submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review relate to its legal and policy review of the Corps' AJD process. In its prior memorandum opinion, the Court explained that \"[b]efore it c[ould] consider whether the documents were predecisional or deliberative, the Court must determine whether the legal and policy review was a deliberative process at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 250. In some situations, an agency's reexamination of its own behavior does constitute a deliberative process. The Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Discussion of the merits of past efforts, alternatives currently available, and recommendations as to future strategy are privileged if the documents bear sufficient indicia that they were part of the deliberative process ... [including that] they were all written by subordinates to superiors, the authors had no decisionmaking authority, and the opinions expressed therein did not explain agency policy or establish agency guidelines or secret law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ashley v.

The Army responds that \"the Army's legal and policy review was not a reexamination of agency behavior or past agency efforts,\" but rather \"an Army Secretariat-level review of the procedure then being utilized by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for reaching its AJD of the Redwood City Salt Plant site.\" Defs.'

It further explains that \"[i]t was not a reexamination of Corps procedures; rather, it was a review to ensure that the Corps employed the proper procedure for reaching an AJD in a then pending case,\" meaning\n   that the analysis employed in\n   <em>\n    Ashley v. Department of Labor\n   </em>\n   would not apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Instead, the Army argues that the legal and policy review was a deliberative process contributing to another, ongoing deliberative process, and the documents leading up to the final report were the types of documents that, because they reveal \"the give-and-take of the consultative process,\" are covered by the privilege.\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having reviewed the Army's supplemental\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and sample documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court agrees on both counts. Many of the documents submitted to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review consist of emails discussing the need for the review,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 36, 104, 347 (emails from Army personnel explaining the Army's decision to conduct the review); emails coordinating the timing and logistics of the review,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 104, 183, 208, 334, 342, 347, 462 (emails discussing how to proceed with the Corps and EPA in light of the decision to institute a review, how to interact with Cargill's owner during the review, and the Army's own decision-making process in carrying out the review); and a draft of the review itself,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 387 (draft memorandum of the review's findings and email transmitting and describing the draft). The remainder of the documents are emails coordinating or seeking input from Army personnel,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 53, 156, 170 (emails seeking and giving input on drafts of letters to non-profits concerned with the Cargill AJD and discussing communications strategy for the Cargill AJD); or drafts of documents that the Army ultimately released,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 156, 272, 273, 409 (draft letters and memoranda). These types of documents fall squarely within the privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the deliberative process privilege \"covers recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency\"). Each document was predecisional and contributed to one of the Army's decision-making processes: either deciding how best to communicate and work with outside actors, be they personnel in other agencies or the public, in light of the Army's decision to conduct the review, or the ultimate result of the review itself. Therefore, the Court grants the Army's motion for summary judgment for its redactions based on the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Corps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court next evaluates the Corps' withholdings under the deliberative process privilege. In its prior Memorandum Opinion, the Court denied the Corps' summary judgment because \"[m]any of the entries in the Corps'\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index for records withheld under the deliberative process privilege [we]re sparse, and d[id] not describe either the specific deliberative process, the function of the particular record, or the nature of the decisionmaking authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 243. Now that the Corps has submitted a sampling of documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, and has greatly expanded upon the information included in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, the Court is able to conclude that the majority of these documents were properly redacted pursuant to the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The majority of the documents presented to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review are emails.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   USACE\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, ECF No. 73-2. Each entry in the Corps' supplemental\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index now explains each deliberative process the Corps seeks to protect through its redactions, as well as how these documents fit into that deliberative process. With these added details, as well as a review of each\n   email\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court is able to determine that most of these emails fall within Exemption 5 based on the deliberative process privilege and are thus properly withheld. However, as explained below, three of the emails do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In particular, Document 40 includes an email on SPDUSACE002598-99 from Corps Major General John Peabody to Brigadier General Mark Toy and other Corps personnel which the Corps describes as \"USACE leadership providing expanded guidance on the legal advice provided by the Chief Counsel concerning public response to inquiries.\"\n   <em>\n    USACE\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index at 1. This message amounts to instructions from senior leaders to subordinates. Similarly, Document 1374 includes two emails that served as directives from supervisors to their subordinates. The first is from District Engineer John C. Morrow relaying instructions to his own staff. The second is the same directive email sent by Major General Peabody in Document 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Directives from decisionmakers are not covered by the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See Coastal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"instructions to staff\" not covered by the deliberative process privilege\"). Nevertheless, the Corps justifies this redaction by explaining that \"the guidance contained therein is based off legal advice from the Chief Counsel as referenced in MG Peabody's comment.\" USACE\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 1. However, in the document submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the Corps merely labels this email as redacted because it is \"deliberative\" and an \"opinion,\" and not because it is covered by the attorney-client privilege. The lack of justification for withholding based on the attorney-client privilege is logical, because the legal advice on which these instructions is based is not apparent from the text of the email. Because these emails are directives, they cannot be redacted pursuant to the deliberative process privilege, the only withholding basis identified by the agency, and therefore must be released.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As explained above, instead of challenging specific\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index entries that it deems objectionable, Hunton has broadly explained that it does not believe that the three defendant agencies have satisfied their burden of demonstrating that the redacted portions of these responsive records fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, Hunton does challenge one particular entry regarding HQ USACE007348-51, insisting that the Corps' description of the document as an \"[e]ditorial conversation between HQUSACE regulatory and Chief Counsel regarding scheduled meeting\" that reflects the authors' thoughts and opinions is too vague because it does not describe the role the document played in the deliberative process. Pl.'s Opp'n at 9 (quoting USACE\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 15). Hunton is correct that this entry does not explain the role that this document played in the deliberative process, identified as \"the processing of the Cargill JD in light of the legal and policy review.\" USACE\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 15. However, upon review of the document\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court can determine that this email exchange served the purpose of relaying a Corps attorney's candid opinion about the results of the legal and policy review, and how those results would affect\n   the Corps' process for adjudicating the Cargill JD, to another high-ranking Corps official. This type of communication falls within the deliberative process privilege's exemption of the release of \"subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because this document, as well as the majority of the other documents submitted to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, fall within the deliberative process privilege, the Court grants summary judgment to the Corps on all of its deliberative process privilege withholdings except for those mentioned above in Documents 40 and 1374.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Attorney-Client Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In its prior Memorandum Opinion, the Court granted summary judgment to the Army for its withholdings pursuant to Exemption 5 based on the attorney-client privilege, but denied summary judgment to the Corps because its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and declaration were not detailed enough for the Court to determine whether these documents actually fell within the ambit of the privilege. For example, the Corps' prior\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index did not specify \"the identities of the client and lawyer and whether legal advice was sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 255. Hunton did not challenge the EPA's use of the privilege in its prior summary judgment briefing, and it does not challenge it in this round either. Having reviewed the Corps' supplemental\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and its sample documents provided for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the Court now finds that most of the documents the Corps has claimed are covered by attorney-client privilege are indeed covered by the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications from clients to their attorneys made for the purpose of securing legal advice or services.

Emails between only Corps officials and Corps attorneys in which the authors exchange legal theories or provide information for the purpose of receiving legal advice regarding the processing of the AJD fall squarely within the privilege and Exemption 5 and were therefore properly withheld.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 37, 42, 236, 247, 269, 304, 579, 697, 873, 942, 1171, 1241, 1302, 1351;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bates Nos. 0069-0073, 2209-2211, 7262, 000378 (plaintiff's selection). Additionally, the documents presented in the latter two categories also mostly fall within the privilege, except for those described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Corps has questioned the Court's earlier determination that the Corps had provided insufficient explanations for why emails between Corps personnel on which attorneys were carbon copied or of which they were not the primary recipient should be covered by the privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1263 (email to from one Corps leader to another, with Corps attorney carbon copied to keep her in the loop); Bates Nos. 2209-2211 (same). The Corps explains that their attorneys were carbon copied on these two email exchanges so that those attorneys could then provide legal advice based on the content of those emails, and further argues that \"[i]t would produce a dissonant result if the same conversation which would be protected if the employee had chosen to forward the email to the attorney is not protected because he chose instead to copy the attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. The Court is unpersuaded by the Corps' email analogy-after all, if the official had written an email to his staff, and then forwarded the email to his attorney, the forwarded copy of the email would be covered by the privilege, but the original email to his staff would not have been privileged. Indeed, the Court finds that neither of these exchanges are covered by attorney-client privilege, though both are covered by the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has held that even if a document is sent not only for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, but also for some other reason, so long as obtaining or providing legal advice was one of the primary purposes for sending the communication, the communication is covered by the attorney-client privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280771,5900221\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/754/\">\n    756 F.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (D.C. Cir. 2014). After reviewing the Corps' supplemental\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and its sample documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that on at least two occasions, the Corps attempted to withhold documents pursuant to the attorney-client privilege when one of the primary purposes for sending the document was not the receipt of legal advice. Document 1263 is an email from Jane Hicks, Regulatory Division Chief in the San Francisco District to San Francisco Commander and District Engineer John Morrow, as well as three other Corps leaders, including San Francisco District Counsel Merry Goodenough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1263. Ms. Hick's email is a response to LTC Morrow, explaining what documents Ms. Hicks believed could be shared with the EPA and asking whether he concurred with her determination. She did not engage Ms. Goodenough for advice in any way, and the language used in her email indicates that she only expected a response for LTC Morrow. Therefore, while this document is clearly covered by the deliberative process privilege because it is primarily composed of a recommendation, it is not covered by the attorney-client privilege, because it does not appear that the pursuit of legal advice was one of the primary reasons it was sent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Additionally, the two emails on Bates Nos. HQUSACE002210-11 do not appear to contain privileged information, although they do contain recommendations covered by the deliberative process privilege. The first email, from Corps Director of Civil Works Steve Stockton, addresses Chief of Engineers Tom Bostick, explaining events he expects to occur in the near future and suggesting that the Chief discuss the matter with Corps attorney Earl Stockdale. The email contains no privileged information relayed to Mr. Stockdale for the purpose of receiving legal advice. However, the email does contain several suggestions from a subordinate to his superior for next steps he should take, and therefore is covered by the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    Klamath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p8\">\n    532 U.S. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p8\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second email is a response from Mr. Stockdale to Mr. Stockton, with the Chief carbon copied, explaining that Mr. Stockdale had informed the Chief of what he expected to happen next in the AJD process, along with his recommendations for next steps. These recommendations do not appear to contain any privileged information that Corps personnel might have given him for the purpose of receiving legal advice. However, because this email is entirely composed of recommendations from a subordinate to his superior officer, it is covered by the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p8\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In its original motion for summary judgment, Hunton also objected to the Corps' withholding of attorney notations on documents pursuant to Exemption 5 based on the attorney-client privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MPSJ Corps at 14, ECF No. 56. The Court reserved judgment on the propriety of these redactions until it had a chance to review them\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , but noted that \"redaction-where it will not render the privilege futile-is the typical remedy in this jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 255 n.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Corps now argues that such redactions were proper under this privilege because the markings were used to communicate with other agency counsel about how the AJD should be determined.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , USACE\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 8 (discussing Docs. 906 and 941, which contain highlight markings, but no notes). However, the Court is not convinced that the redaction, in full or in part, of these pages pursuant to the attorney-client privilege is permissible.

The documents now submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review contain redactions pursuant to Exemption 6 that Hunton did not challenge when opposing the EPA's first motion for summary judgment, and does not challenge now either.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n. For example, in Document 174, the EPA redacted an employee's work email address and mobile phone number. As Hunton has not identified any public interest in the disclosure of this information, the Court grants the EPA summary judgment on the redaction of the email addresses and phone numbers of government employees that appear in records responsive to the FOIA request, just as it granted the Army summary judgment on the same type of information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 257.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The EPA has also redacted a line in an email containing the number of hours two employees intended to take for vacation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 29. These two employees have more than a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   privacy interest in this information, and Hunton has not articulated any public interest in the release of this information. Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment on this redaction as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Next, the Court examines the Army's Exemption 6 redactions. In its prior Memorandum Opinion, the Court granted the Army summary judgment as to its redactions of the contact information of government personnel below the level of either general officer or senior executive service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 256-257. However, it ordered that the Army needed to release the names of such government personnel, because the \"public interest in understanding what the government is up to outweighs the interest of the Army employees in privacy as to the names of the involved employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 258.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Despite this order, the documents the Army submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review continue to have the names of Army personnel redacted. These redactions are not mentioned in the Army's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, nor are they mentioned in its supplemental briefing.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Army Docs. 53, 104, 156, 170, 183, 208, 307, 337, 347, 348, 350, 387, 462. The Court assumes that the Army intends to comply with its prior order once there is a final judgment in this case given that the Army has not provided an explanation for why these names should be redacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Last, the Court reviews the Corps' redactions under Exemption 6. In its prior Memorandum Opinion, the Court had granted summary judgment to the Corps only as to its redactions of conference call numbers and access codes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 256 n.44.

However, the Court must determine how the agency will remedy its erroneous redactions. Courts in this Circuit require agencies to reprocess responsive records and produce all non-exempt materials when a district court has determined a high rate of misapplying FOIA exemptions to responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonner v.

Here, the error rate is far more negligible. The Court has determined that only two of the 120 sample documents, 40 and 1374, were wrongfully withheld from Hunton pursuant to Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.1.c. Every other sample document that was mislabeled as qualifying for withholding under either the attorney-client or work product privilege was properly withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sections IV.A.2, 3. And indeed, given the role that Corps attorneys played throughout the AJD process made clear by the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, assisting decisionmakers as they adjudicated the AJD and dealt with the Army and the EPA, the Court cannot foresee any responsive record involving a Corps attorney that the Corps might try to label as covered by either the attorney-client privilege or the work product privilege that would not in fact be deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Courts in this district do not require agencies to reprocess all responsive records when review of either a sample\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index or a representative sample of responsive documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   reveals that the withholding error rate is negligible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Washington v.

Because the Corps error rate was similarly miniscule-two emails in 120 documents withheld in error under Exemption 5, and names in 15 out of 120 documents withheld in error under Exemption 6-the Court will only order the release of the improperly withheld portions of the sample documents, and will not order the Corps to reprocess the thousands of pages of responsive records that were not submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunton I\n   </em>\n   , 248 F.Supp.3d at 232-33 (portions of 20,448 pages of 22,776 have already been released).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Therefore, the Court will order that the agencies release the small portion of redacted documents submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review that the Court has found to not be covered by any exemption, but otherwise will grant the agencies summary judgment in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
