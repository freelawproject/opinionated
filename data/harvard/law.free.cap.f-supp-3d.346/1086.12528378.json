Plaintiff Hawes claims that her 900 thread-count sheets were actually 249 thread-count and Plaintiff Hill claims that her 1000 thread-count sheets were \"far less.\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). Plaintiffs claim that Defendants Macy's, AQ Textiles LLC (\"AQ\"), and Creative Textile Mills Pvt. Ltd. (\"Creative\") are responsible for deceiving, misleading, and inducing them - and the American consumer public - into buying these bed sheets with false, inflated thread counts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3-5, 24-29, 34-35, 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Macy's was aware that consumers associate higher thread counts with being higher in quality, being softer, and being more comfortable.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42). Plaintiffs claim Macy's knew or should have known that thread counts were being inaccurately reported. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50). Plaintiffs allege they have suffered because the products they purchased with inaccurate thread counts did not perform with the same characteristics as sheets with the thread counts as advertised, and that the products were not fit for use.

(Doc. 17-1 at 16-17). This argument is not well-taken. California and Missouri recognize an exception to the economic loss doctrine in instances of fraudulent inducement.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Erlich v.
