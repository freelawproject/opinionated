(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 120).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Court are three Motions. First, there are two Motions To Dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6) -one on behalf of Tobia, Reitano, Santangelo, DiStefano, Thomas, RLA, Premium Staffing, Premium Parking, and First Resource (collectively \"Tobia Defendants\"), (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 138), and the other on behalf of ACC, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 144). In addition, Plaintiff has filed a Motion To Dismiss the counterclaims asserted by Mr. Palazzolo, and to strike the affirmative defenses asserted by Mr. Palazzolo, Palazzolo, F &amp; M, B.A.B. I, B.A.B. II, and Ridgeview LLC, (collectively \"Palazzolo Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 140.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the following reasons, the Tobia Defendants' Motion and ACC's Motion are both denied, and Plaintiff's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A. Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Action involves a large number of parties with various roles in the unlawful scheme alleged by Plaintiff. For clarity, the Court provides a summary of the Parties and their respective roles in the alleged scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Board is an unincorporated association and the legal entity responsible for the control and operation of all common areas and public spaces of the Trump Tower at City Center Condominium at White Plains (the \"Condominium\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6 10.) The Board is comprised of seven members and has governed the Condominium since its opening in 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Palazzolo served as Treasurer of the Condominium from 2007 until his removal by the Board in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Mr. Palazzolo currently resides in the Condominium and remains a member of the Board as the nominated representative of the commercial spaces in the Condominium, including the commercial space owned by ACC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Palazzolo is a real estate investor, and owns a commercial building at 800 Central Park Avenue in Scarsdale, New York known as \"Palazzolo Plaza,\" an address used by Defendants F &amp; M, RLA, First Resource, Premium Staffing, Premium Parking, ACC, and Ridgeview LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Palazzolo is alleged to have either controlled or have been a member or managing member of a variety of businesses, including F &amp; M, RLA, Premium Staffing, Premium Parking, ACC, Ridgeview LLC, B.A.B. I, and B.A.B. II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Palazzolo is married to Palazzolo, who herself controlled or was otherwise a member of F &amp;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   M and Ridgeview LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Defendant Thomas was an employee of Mr. Palazzolo and Palazzolo at F &amp; M. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Palazzolo's long-time business associate Tobia is also alleged to have either controlled or have been a member or managing member of RLA, ACC, First Resource, and Ridgeview LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Tobia, a real estate investor and businessman, served as a member of the Board from October 2006 through his ouster in 2015, including a term as Vice President of the Board from June 2011 through December 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Together, Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia are alleged to have either owned or controlled ACC, a limited liability company that owns one commercial unit in the building alongside RLA, another limited liability company which itself owns two commercial units. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Reitano was also a member of the Board, serving from April 2006 through February 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Reitano is alleged to have controlled and/or been a member or managing member of Ridgeview LLC, along with Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Santangelo is the final member of the Ridgeview LLC, and also \"controlled and/or was a member or managing member of\" Premium Staffing and Premium Parking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Ridgeview LLC was created by Mr. Palazzolo, Tobia, Reitano, and Santangelo to manage an investment in a real estate project, Ridgeview, in Elmsford, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Ridgeview LLC received financing through F &amp; M, which itself used funds earmarked for Tobia's company, RLA, on its own balance sheets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Palazzolo was also involved with Premium Staffing and Premium Parking, of which Santangelo and DiStefano were controlling partners and/or members or managing members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15-16.) Premium Staffing was created in December 2007 by Santangelo and DiStefano to manage the Condominium's Garage finances and ensure that the valet parking provider, Supreme Parking, Inc. (\"Supreme\"), was paid its monthly service fee from 2008 onward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 159-60.) Premium Parking, also created by Santangelo and DiStefano, came into the picture in 2014, where it took over for Supreme as the valet service provider at the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    B. Amended Complaint Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint and are taken as true for the purpose of resolving Defendants' respective Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Condominium has 215 units, all but three of which are residential. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 30.) In 2005, almost immediately after opening, the Condominium encountered financial difficulties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beginning in 2007, Mr. Palazzolo, a resident of the Condominium, became the Treasurer of the Condominium and negotiated payments from the Condominium's developer, Louis Cappelli (\"Cappelli\"), to boost the Condominium's reserve account, while also engineering the Condominium's purchase of the garage and recreation deck from Cappelli. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) For these actions, among others, Mr. Palazzolo was credited for righting the Condominium's financial ship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Palazzolo used these past successes to dominate all aspects of the Board. Outside of a pre-existing business relationship with fellow Board member Tobia, Mr. Palazzolo began to enter into real estate investments with Reitano, also a Board member, and loaned substantial sums of money to two other Board members, John Durante and Fred Mastroianni. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) During this early period of Mr. Palazzolo's\n   tenure, he also entered into an agreement with the Trump Corporation, which was then acting as the Condominium's managing agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) In exchange for a $100,000 annual fee, Mr. Palazzolo agreed to manage the Condominium's Reserve Account (the \"Reserve Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is Mr. Palazzolo's management of the reserve account, in addition to his later involvement with Premium Staffing, Premium Parking, and ACC, that spurred this Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    1. Mr. Palazzolo's Use of the Reserve Accounts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    a. The Complex Web of Bank Accounts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prior to Mr. Palazzolo's tenure as Treasurer of the Condominium, the Reserve Account was maintained together with the operating account in a single account managed by the Trump Corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Mr. Palazzolo quickly changed this practice, opening and closing seven different accounts in the Condominium's name-but under his direct control-at four different financial institutions between 2007 and 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) These accounts are alleged to have been critical to facilitating the actions of the alleged \"Palazzolo Enterprise,\" as it became increasingly difficult to identify how much money the Condominium held in its Reserve Account, while allowing Mr. Palazzolo to transfer funds to and from those accounts without detection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Indeed, during Mr. Palazzolo's time as Treasurer, the Board only expressly authorized five transfers from the Reserve Account, but there appear to be hundreds of withdrawals during that period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, Mr. Palazzolo opened an account at Key Bank in June 2008 (\"Key 158 Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) During the two years that account was open, Mr. Palazzolo directed the transfer of $550,000 to F &amp; M from the Key 158 Account without Board authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Palazzolo then opened an account at Hudson Valley Bank in June 2010 (\"Hudson 9741 Account\"), which was funded by a $400,000 transfer from the Key 158 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) When the Key 158 Account was closed in September 2010, the balance was transferred to an account set up by Mr. Palazzolo at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (\"Chase 7595 Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Similarly, when Mr. Palazzolo closed the Hudson 9741 Account in December 2010, the balance was transferred to a new account at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (\"Chase 7742 Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) In September 2012, the Chase 7595 Account was closed, with the balance transferred into the Chase 7742 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Then, in June 2014, Mr. Palazzolo opened a new account at Hudson Valley Bank (\"Hudson 3641 Account\") with a $500,000 transfer from the Chase 7742 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) The Hudson 3641 Account was then closed in July 2015, with the balance transferred to a new account at Popular Community Bank (\"Popular 5767 Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In between the opening of the Hudson 3641 Account and the Popular 5767 Account, Mr. Palazzolo opened a third account at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (\"Chase 9221 Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) The Chase 9221 Account was closed in July 2015 as well, with the balance flowing to the still-open Popular 5767 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    b. Transfers to and from the Reserve Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In April 2010, Mr. Palazzolo approached the Board with a business opportunity: the Condominium could loan $400,000 to RLA at an interest rate of six percent per annum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) At the time, Mr. Palazzolo did not disclose to the Board that RLA was owned by fellow Board member Tobia, nor did he disclose that RLA's business address was at Palazzolo Plaza. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.) Mr. Palazzolo also agreed to personally\n   guaranty the repayment of the funds from RLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ultimately, the Board approved the loan to RLA, with Mr. Palazzolo-and not Tobia-recusing himself from the vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59, 61.) However, unbeknownst to the Board and the Condominium, the money was actually being loaned from the Condominium's reserve funds to F &amp; M, which was owned by Mr. Palazzolo and Palazzolo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.) On April 13, 2010, Mr. Palazzolo transferred $400,000 from the Key 158 Account to F &amp; M, which F &amp; M used to qualify for financing in connection with the Ridgeview development managed by Ridgeview LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Soon after the transfer was consummated, the minutes of the Board meeting at which the loan to RLA was approved were made available to all unit owners in the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) The owners were displeased with the use of Condominium reserve funds to an outside business, RLA, and demanded restitution of the funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Mr. Palazzolo agreed to return the funds, which came via a transfer of $404,117 from F &amp; M into the Key 158 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response to the undoing of the April 2010 RLA loan, Mr. Palazzolo decided to open three JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. accounts for the Condominium's reserve funds (the Chase 7742, 9221, and 7595 Accounts) that he could then link to his personal bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) This allowed Mr. Palazzolo to alter the Condominium accounts to make it appear as if there was more money in the Reserve Account than there actually was, and also allowed Mr. Palazzolo to quickly transfer funds between the Condominium's accounts into his own accounts without any authorization from the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Indeed, in December 2010, Mr. Palazzolo began this pattern of unauthorized transfers between the Condominium's JP Morgan Chase accounts and his personal JP Morgan Chase accounts. On December 1, 2010, Mr. Palazzolo transferred $400,000 from the Chase 7742 Account to F &amp; M without notifying the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.) Later that month, on December 29, 2010, Mr. Palazzolo transferred an additional $500,000 from the very same Chase account to his attorney, Lawrence Gottlieb, without notifying the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) All told, from February 28, 2011 through June 12, 2015, Mr. Palazzolo made 22 additional unauthorized transfers, for a total of $2,893,369.16, from the Condominium's reserve funds held in the Chase 7742 Account to F &amp; M through his personal accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. A.) This included an additional $400,000 transfer from the Chase 7742 Account to F &amp; M and $100,000 to an unknown recipient on February 28, 2011 and March 10, 2011, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) On April 8, 2011, $500,000-the total previously transferred out of the Chase 7742 Account-was transferred from Ridgeview LLC back to the Chase 7742 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those funds were then transferred back to Ridgeview LLC three days later, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and returned again to the Chase 7742 Account from an unidentified source on June 6, 2011, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As for the two other Chase accounts, Mr. Palazzolo engaged in the very same pattern of transfers. Specifically, on July 19, August 5, and November 10, 2011, Mr. Palazzolo transferred a combined total of $79,481.69 from the Condominium's Chase 7595 Account to F &amp; M without notifying the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Similarly, Mr. Palazzolo used the Chase 9221 Account to transfer $120,340.27 to F &amp; M through three transactions between March and July 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) All told, over the course of his tenure as Treasurer, Mr. Palazzolo transferred $8,078,985.26 from the Condominium's Reserve Account without authorization,\n   failing to return $668,271.33. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Palazzolo also used the Chase accounts to divert funds due to the Condominium. For example, the Condominium was in receipt of a $650,122.70 check that accounted for the total amount to be refunded to each current or former unit owner in the Condominium based on a tax certiorari proceeding reducing the real property taxes owed by the unit owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Mr. Palazzolo deposited the full amount of the tax certiorari proceeds into the Chase 7595 Account, which he then used to disburse refund checks to unit owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) Mr. Palazzolo and Reitano then circulated notices throughout the Condominium that the checks were available for unit owners, and those that picked up their check received checks frequently signed by Tobia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) Although Mr. Palazzolo knew precisely how much each unit owner was due, he made no attempt to issue refunds to the 17 unit owners who did not pick up their check, and kept the money for himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, in 2012, Mr. Palazzolo diverted insurance proceeds that flowed to the Condominium as a result of Superstorm Sandy on four separate occasions between November 2012 and May 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.) Within days of receipt of the check from the Condominium's insurer, Mr. Palazzolo would transfer, the identical amount of insurance proceeds-or more-to F &amp; M. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.) Ultimately, Mr. Palazzolo transferred $478,095.14 in insurance proceeds to F &amp; M, as well as an additional $15,774.02 tacked onto those proceeds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    c. The Foreclosed Units\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In April 2012, the Board was approached by Ridgewood Savings Bank's subsidiary, Ridge Forest Realty Corp. (\"Ridgewood\"), with an opportunity to purchase three units in the Condominium that were owned by Mr. Palazzolo, or by related persons or entities under his control, and had entered foreclosure, for $900,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) The Board considered the offer, but prepared to decline it, believing the purchase price would deplete its Reserve Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Mr. Palazzolo, however, insisted that the Condominium purchase the units on his behalf, and offered to advance the down payment for purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-06.) The Board agreed, not knowing that it had less than $7,000 in its Reserve Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, after negotiating a price reduction to $875,000, Mr. Palazzolo transferred $87,500 to the Condominium for a down payment, and the Condominium entered into a contract to purchase the units, then assigning its rights to Mr. Palazzolo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.) Mr. Palazzolo then compiled the balance due by using the Condominium's reserve funds, and with less than one month before closing, Mr. Palazzolo had amassed $725,000 by transferring funds from the Condominium's accounts to F &amp; M's accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) Mr. Palazzolo then transferred $800,000 back to the Chase 7742 Account as the balance of the purchase price he owed, although that money was actually just a return of the Condominium's funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) Thus, Mr. Palazzolo simply used the Condominium's own money to finance a purchase of three units on his own behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    2. Depletion of the Operating Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   By March 2014, the Condominium began to have liquidity issues and it became clear that the Condominium's Reserve Account had reached an unsustainably low amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) This led to a depletion of the Condominium's Operating Account, which impacted the Condominium's ability to pay for basic needs and services such as taxes, payroll, security, and routine maintenance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) In response, Mr. Palazzolo authorized numerous transfers to cover up\n   the fact that there were gross deficiencies in the Operating Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.) For example, Mr. Palazzolo caused F &amp; M to transfer $945,000 to the Chase 7742 Account on March 21, 2014, making it appear that the Condominium was solvent, when in fact that money had been long since taken by F &amp; M and Mr. Palazzolo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    3. The FloTV Deal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In 2010, FloTV, a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, negotiated with the Condominium to obtain an easement permitting FloTV to install an antenna on the rooftop of the building in exchange for a $4,200 monthly payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.) FloTV, however, folded in 2014, and began to wind down operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115.) Mr. Palazzolo conducted the negotiations over what would be paid to the Condominium under the contract in light of this early termination, which resulted in a $143,714 payment to the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-16.) However, instead of depositing this check into the Condominium's Reserve Account, the check was deposited in the account of Premium Staffing, which maintained the \"Garage Account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118.) The proceeds of the FloTV deal were never turned over to the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    4. Misrepresentations in Financial Statements and Bank Documents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to Plaintiff, since 2010, Mr. Palazzolo has altered account documents generated by the bank with regard to the Chase 7742 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) Plaintiff provides several examples of this conduct. First, on December 29, 2010, Mr. Palazzolo transferred $500,000 from the Chase 7742 account to his attorney's escrow account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This left the Chase 7742 Account with an actual balance of $42,827.27. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Mr. Palazzolo altered-and Lori Overton, a Chase employee, signed-the year-end statement to reflect the balance from December 28, 2010: $542,618.78. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Palazzolo then provided this account balance to employees of the Trump Corporation and employees of O'Connor Davies LLP, who did the annual audit work for the Condominium, without informing them that the true balance was approximately $500,000 less than presented on the balance statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The next year, in December 2011, Mr. Palazzolo undertook a similar course of action, providing false documentation to the Trump Corporation and O'Connor Davies LLP that reflected a total balance of $723,580.69 in the Condominium's Reserve Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.) However, the true balance was only $15,152.40. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And the year after that, December 2012, the Condominium's Reserve Account fell to $9,064, although Mr. Palazzolo reported a balance of $829,264 in the financial statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.) In December 2013, Mr. Palazzolo again presented fabricated account documents to reflect a Reserve Account balance of $940,472, when the actual balance was $5,372. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    5. One Final Transfer from the Reserve Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On May 12, 2015, the Board drafted and adopted an Ethics Policy and Code of Conduct (\"Ethics Policy\") aimed at prohibiting self-dealing and any attempted preferential treatment for a Board member or their relatives in the use of Condominium property or business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.) Both Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia signed the Ethics Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nonetheless, on June 29, 2015, Mr. Palazzolo effectuated the transfer of $931,250 in refinancing proceeds into the Chase 7742 Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147.) The very next day, Mr. Palazzolo transferred a total of $1.2 million from the Chase 7742 Account to RLA without the Board's approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This transfer did not go unnoticed, as the Board was notified in July 2015 by an\n   employee of Trump Corporation who had reviewed a summary of the Reserve Account prepared by Tobia reflecting this transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148.) The Board confronted Mr. Palazzolo, who responded that Tobia executed the note and agreed to pay interest at six percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151.) The Board demanded that Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia undo the transaction, which he eventually did on July 20, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.) However, the funds were returned to the Condominium via F &amp; M and no RLA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153.) Two days later, Mr. Palazzolo transferred the $1.2 million back to F &amp; M from the Chase 7742 Account, and then returned the money to the Condominium by a transfer into a Banco Popular account controlled by the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On December 16, 2015, as a result of the June and July 2015 transactions, Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia were voted off the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155.) However, Mr. Palazzolo was reappointed to the Board shortly thereafter by RLA and ACC, the owners of the Condominium's three commercial units, as their representative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    6. The Garage Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia's ouster, the Board conducted an internal investigation of the Condominium's Reserve and Operating Accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) During this investigation, it came to light that Palazzolo, together with DiStefano and Santangelo, used the Condominium's parking garage in much the same way as the Reserve Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Condominium had initially purchased the parking garage from Cappelli in 2008, after which the Board hired Supreme to provide valet services from the Condominium for $32,000 per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159.) On December 27, 2007, prior to the Condominium's purchase of the garage, DiStefano opened a bank account at Commerce Bank in the name of \"Premium Staffing, LLC TTCC Garage\" (the \"Garage Account\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160.) DiStefano was the sole signatory of the Garage Account, and upon its creation and without notifying the Board, Mr. Palazzolo directed all garage income into the Garage Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) DiStefano and Santangelo would then issue the $32,000 monthly payment to Supreme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Premium Staffing would also pay itself a monthly fee from the Garage Account for this service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, beginning in 2008, Premium Staffing collected virtually all revenue generated by the operation of the garage, and was thus responsible for payment of Garage expenses, including payments related to financing the acquisition of the garage from Cappelli. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Premium Staffing initially charged the Condominium a $3,000 monthly fee for managing the garage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166.) This fee was increased to $4,000 in 2008, $4,500 in 2009, and $5,000 in 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Beginning in October 2010, Premium Staffing began to pay its fees and Supreme's fees in a single transfer from the Garage Account, which resulted in Premium Staffing stealthily increasing its monthly fee to $7,800. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167.) In February 2011, Premium Staffing's fee increased to $10,800 per month, increasing again in September 2011 to $11,800 per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) All told, between 2011 and 2014, Premium Staffing paid itself roughly $873,475-without Board authorization-for the services of paying Supreme, paying utilities, and paying certain other monthly expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2014, Palazzo and DiStefano approached the Condominium with a \"Parking Agreement,\" under which Premium Parking would provide valet services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169.) Those services were actually performed by Supreme, but the Parking Agreement made it impossible to determine what amount Premium Parking and Supreme would each be paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ultimately, the amounts listed in the Parking\n   Agreement were meaningless, as Premium Parking was paid significantly more than any amount described therein before the Parking Agreement was terminated in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, by 2014, the amount paid to Premium Parking and Premium Staffing grew to be roughly 93% of the gross income generated by the garage, as opposed to 60% in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170.) Due to these increased fees, the garage incurred $35,259 in losses in 2014, as opposed to a $225,000 profit in 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, when the garage was profitable, Premium Staffing never returned those profits to the garage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171.) As a result, Premium Parking and Premium Staffing facilitated the transfer of roughly $680,964.82 of the Condominium's money from the Garage Account to various Defendants from 2008 to 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172.) These transfers include: ten transfers to F &amp; M for a total of $152,944.79; three transfers to RLA for a total of $15,000; four transfers to First Resource for a total of $23,335.27; three transfers to B.A.B. I and II for a total of $43,167; 29 transfers to DiStefano for a total of $167,790; 15 transfers to Thomas for a total of $72,400; one transfer to Premium Staffing's parking operations at the White Plains Ritz Carlton for $60,000; and dozens of other transfers to individuals and businesses unaffiliated with the garage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Premium Staffing is alleged to have charged the Condominium $187,600 for a handyman, to be paid from the Garage Account, only to pay the handyman $30,000 and keep the remainder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 174-75.) Since replacing Premium Staffing and Premium Parking in 2016, the Board has saved nearly $500,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    7. Diversion of Commercial Unity Utility Payments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Condominium employed a third-party service provider, Quadlogic Corp. (\"Quadlogic\") to determine the appropriate charges for electricity to be allocated to each residential and commercial unit and the common areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177.) One of the three commercial units was owned by ACC, with the other two owned by RLA and leased to a hair salon, Demirjian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unbeknownst to the Board, but allegedly known by Palazzolo and Tobia, Quadlogic incorrectly believed that the commercial sub-meters did not need to be tracked because the amounts within those units reflected the electrical use by all common areas in the Condominium. Quadlogic thus never charged the commercial units for their electricity use but rather passed those costs onto the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   After Mr. Palazzolo was removed from the Board, this mistake came to light, and the Board sought to determine why the commercial tenants were not paying for utilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) Demirjian explained that Mr. Palazzolo had informed them that he was paying the electric bills on their behalf, and that the commercial tenants should simply pay him directly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Demirjian then showed the Board a copy of a check that Mr. Palazzolo had shown him, which purported to show that Mr. Palazzolo had paid the Condominium $27,694 in unpaid electrical charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, no such payments were ever made to the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.) ACC in fact refuses to return any funds owed to the Condominium and refuses to pay for any portion of the maintenance charges or utilities owed to the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Instead, Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia contend that the Board agreed that commercial unit owners would not pay for electricity, a contention for which there is no evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.) Accordingly, Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia simply kept the more than $300,000 paid by the commercial tenants for themselves, as opposed to turning\n   those payments over to the Condominium for the electrical bills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    C. Palazzolo Counterclaims Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Palazzolo Defendants' Counterclaims and are taken as true for the purpose of resolving Plaintiff's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the fall of 2004, Mr. Palazzolo entered into multiple contracts wherein he purchased 21 units in the Condominium for $21 million dollars from the Condominium's sponsor. (Counterclaims \u00b6 235 (Dkt. No. 122).) The purchase was conditioned upon the payoff of unpaid trade debt by the sponsor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 239.) Prior to closing, Cappelli, the principal of the Condominium's sponsor, offered Mr. Palazzolo a five percent discount if he closed immediately. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 242.) Mr. Palazzolo rejected this offer, and instead asked that the sponsor contribute $800,000 to the Condominium to establish the Reserve Account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 244.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   According to Mr. Palazzolo, in reliance upon representations made by the Board to him, he gave up multiple personal business opportunities and forewent the monetary benefits that would have flowed to him based on those opportunities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 251.) In June or July 2009, the Board granted Mr. Palazzolo full control over the Reserve account and he used the Reserve account to enhance its value and further the business of the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 259-60.) It is not alleged that he was promised compensation for these actions, but rather that he could do what he wanted with the Reserve Account on behalf of the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 259-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   One such occasion was in 2006, prior to the date which Mr. Palazzolo says he was elected to the board, when Mr. Palazzolo convinced \"his fellow members of the Board\" to purchase energy from someone other than Con Edison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 316). Explaining that this kind of \"speculation\" was \"somewhat obscure,\" Mr. Palazzolo alleges that he saved the Condominium approximately $1,154,000 during the ten-year period that he served as a member of the Board, without \"obtaining\" any fees or compensation for \"arranging the Condominium to obtain its money in this matter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 318-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Then, in July 2007, the Board sought to hire Lawrence Gomez (\"Gomez\") as a live-in resident manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 265-66.) The only available unit owned by the Condominium was a one bedroom, but Gomez required a two bedroom for his family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 266.) To facilitate the hiring of Gomez, Mr. Palazzolo agreed to sell a unit he controlled valued at $750,000 to the Board for a discount of $40,000 for Gomez's use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 269-273.) Mr. Palazzolo also declined to collect no less than $165,000 in interest income for the benefit of the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 279.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At an unspecified time in 2007, the Condominium's sponsor approached Mr. Palazzolo with another opportunity. This time, it was to purchase the garage and recreation center attached to the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 283.) While this would have resulted in substantial personal financial gain for Mr. Palazzolo, he instead advised the Board to purchase these assets from Cappelli. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 283-86.) However, this purchase could not be consummated until the mortgage on the Condominium's retail spaces was satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 287.) Given these circumstances, Mr. Palazzolo agreed to acquire the retail spaces through RLA, thus allowing the Condominium to close upon the purchase of the garage and recreation space in 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 289-90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Next, at an unspecified time, but during Mr. Palazzolo's tenure as Treasurer of the Board, Mr. Palazzolo implemented a hybrid staffing model where the Condominium\n   saved at least $1,690,000 over a ten-year period by hiring non-union employees without \"obtaining management fees, consulting fees, or other payments for staffing the organization he created.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 305-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mr. Palazzolo then, at an unspecified time, was able to secure leases that generated income of $570,000 for the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 314-15.) However, Mr. Palazzolo does not allege that he personally forewent an opportunity in favor of providing this business to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At yet another unspecified point in time, Mr. Palazzolo alleges he purchased cheaper insurance policies for the Condominium, saving at least $880,000 over a ten-year period without \"obtaining\" management or consulting fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 320-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Additionally, at an unspecified time between 2006 and 2009, Mr. Palazzolo \"directed\" the opportunity to secure control of certain foreclosed apartments to the Board, rather than taking \"the[ ] clear business opportunities for himself personally to purchase,\" said apartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 324-27.) Mr. Palazzolo secured control of the units for the board, and was able to generate $1,020,660.33 in rental income between 2009 and 2015 for the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 328-33.) Moreover, these units resulted in income of no less than $2,470,000, in combined rental and common charges, for the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 338.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, in October 2012, Mr. Palazzolo contends that via F &amp; M, he was able to perform emergency flood repairs for at least 23 unit owners in the Condominium, presumably caused by Superstorm Sandy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 296-304.) Mr. Palazzolo \"laid out significant money to effect those repairs,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 297), and \"used his personal contact ... to effect the emergency repairs, for the benefit of the Board and unit owners, without payment or commissions he otherwise could have obtained as a private investor, [or] an insurance or construction consultant,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 298). Mr. Palazzolo used the excess funds from the insurance proceeds, due to these below market repair rates, \"to effect capital improvements and amenity upgrades\" in the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 303.) In total, the cost of the repairs and amenity improvements totaled \"a fair market value well in excess of\" the insurance proceeds, to Mr. Palazzolo's own detriment as he received no compensation for these actions.

Nos. 42, 44, 48, 53-54, 58, 63), Defendants Reitano and former Defendant Lori Overton (\"Overton\") filed pre-motion letters on January 31, 2017 seeking to dismiss the Complaint, (Dkt. Nos. 55-56). Defendant Reda Romano then filed a pre-motion letter on February 23, 2017, (Dkt. No. 65), and shortly thereafter, on February 27 and 28, 2017, the remaining Defendants filed their respective pre-motion letters, (Dkt. No. 67, 70). Plaintiff then filed its responsive letters on March 3, 2017, (Dkt. Nos. 72-77), and the Court held a pre-motion conference on May 2, 2017, (Dkt. (entry for May 2, 2017) ). The Court then set a briefing schedule, allowing Overton, ACC, and Reda Romano to file their respective Motions To Dismiss. (Mot. Scheduling Order (Dkt. No. 81).) However, on May 22, 2017, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the claims against Overton, (Dkt. No. 84), and then dismissed the claims relevant to Reda Romano's Motion on July 11, 2017, (Dkt. No. 89). Reda Romano then filed its Answer on August 8, 2017, along with crossclaims against all remaining Defendants. (Reda Romano Answer (Dkt. No. 97).)

No. 107), to which the Palazzolo Defendants responded on September 15, 2017, (Dkt. No. 109). Next, the remaining Defendants, but for the Palazzolo Defendants, ACC, and Reda Romano, filed a pre-motion letter seeking to file a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (Dkt. No. 111), which the Palazzolo Defendants joined in on September 29, 2017, (Dkt. No. 113). The Court held a conference on the putative Motions, allowing the Parties to amend their respective complaints and counterclaims by November 22, 2017. (Dkt. (entry for October 25, 2017).) Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on November 21, 2017, (Dkt. No. 120), and the Palazzolo Defendants filed and answer and counterclaims the next day, (Dkt. No. 122). Reda Romano filed an answer and crossclaim against all Defendants on December 12, 2017, (Dkt. No. 127), and the Defendants filed their respective answers to Reda Romano's crossclaim shortly thereafter, (Dkt. Nos. 131, 134, 136).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants DiStefano, First Resource, Premium Parking, Premium Staffing, RLA, Reitano, Santangelo, Thomas, and Tobia Defendants, and ACC, filed pre-motion letters, this time seeking to file a Motion To Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Dkt. Nos. 125, 129.) Plaintiff filed responsive letters on December 13 and 15, 2017, (Dkt. No. 130, 132-33), and filed its own pre-motion letter on December 6, 2017 seeking to dismiss the Palazzolo counterclaims, (Dkt. No. 124).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court held a conference on January 18, 2018, and adopted a briefing schedule for the present Motions. (Mot. Scheduling Order (Dkt. No. 137).) The Court terminated the prior ACC Motion, and had all Parties refile their respective Motions by February 16, 2018, with opposition due on March 16, 2018, and replies by March 30, 2018.

Plaintiff filed their opposition to the ACC Motion, (Dkt. No. 147), and the Tobia Defendants' Motion, (Dkt. No. 148), on March 16, 2018. The Palazzolo Defendants filed their Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion that same day. (Dkt. No. 149.) ACC filed its Reply on March 29, 2018, (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff further alleges that the members of the enterprise \"conspired with each\n   other to conduct, finance, and acquire ownership interests in the Enterprise and its business affairs through a pattern of racketeering,\" and that the members of the enterprise \"knowingly and improperly used the Condominium's money to fund their own business activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188 (\"The defendants are a group of persons and entities associated together in fact as the Palazzolo Enterprise for the common purpose of carrying out an ongoing enterprise ...

The Court notes that the pleadings indicate that nearly all of the corporate entities share an address at Palazzolo Plaza, and that Mr. Palazzolo is alleged to have \"controlled or was otherwise a member or managing member\" of seven of the nine corporate entities. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 11.)

First, the Amended Complaint alleges that Santangelo and DiStefano controlled or were managing members of Premium Parking and Premium Staffing, (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21), and that from 2007 through 2014, they, along with Mr. Palazzolo, began charging the Condominium a fee for managing the Garage Account without any authorization from the Board, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 164, 166). Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that Santangelo and DiStefano, \"without authorization,\" paid themselves, via Premium Staffing, $873,475 between 2010 and 2014 \"for simply handing money from the Condominium to ... its valet parking service provider, paying utilities, and a few other monthly expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) Moreover, in 2014, DiStefano and Mr. Palazzolo allegedly presented the Condominium with a \"Parking Agreement\" on behalf of Premium Parking, and Premium Parking thereafter \"paid itself far in excess of the amounts described in the Parking Agreement in 2015 and 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169.) Plaintiff described the actions of DiStefano, Santangelo, Premium Parking, and Premium Staffing by alleging that \"when the garage was making money ..., Premium Staffing was simply distributing those profits to members of the Palazzolo Enterprise. Mr. Palazzolo, DiStefano, and Santangelo were allegedly stealing from the Condominium in two ways: first, by diverting enormous unauthorized monthly fees to Premium Staffing and/or Premium Parking; and second, by distributing any profits the garage made to the coffers of the members of the Palazzolo Enterprise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171.) In total, these individuals and entities allegedly transferred $680,964.82 of the Condominium's money to members of the Palazzolo Enterprise or others from 2008 to 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172.) Indeed, the Premium Parking and Premium Staffing entities encompassed Thomas as well, who was a recipient of fifteen transfers from these entities, totaling $72,400. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Thomas notarized an agreement executed by DiStefano regarding the unauthorized payment of $187,600 to Gomez, \"even though Thomas was not present when Mr. Gomez signed the agreement,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174), which led to the payment of additional monies from the Condominium to the Garage Account, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, Reitano is alleged to have controlled or have been a managing member of Ridgeview LLC, (Am. Compl. \u00b6 14), which participated in numerous \"unauthorized, undisclosed, and illegal round trip transfers back and forth of the Condominium's funds to Ridgeview and other entities within the Palazzolo enterprise,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93). Reitano also allegedly \"caused notices to be circulated within the Condominium building that refund checks were available,\" and \"set up shop in the Business Center and issued checks for refunds to\n   those owners who appeared before them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) However, because of the refund scheme allegedly created by Reitano and Palazzolo, tax certiorari refunds for 17 Unit Owners were \"knowingly and intentionally\" withheld. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Third, Tobia is alleged to have controlled or have been a managing member of RLA, First Resource, Ridgeview LLC, and ACC, each of which is a central figure within the Palazzolo Enterprise. (Am. Compl \u00b6 13.) As the principal of RLA, Tobia is alleged to have facilitated the fraudulent transfer of funds from the Condominium to F &amp; M, as Tobia approved the transfer of $400,000 to RLA, with the understanding that the RLA loan was in fact to be transferred-without authorization-to Mr. Palazzolo and F &amp; M. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-62.) Indeed, Tobia voted to transfer the money to RLA based on representations he allegedly made, through Mr. Palazzolo, that he would repay the loan at six percent interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Tobia, obviously self-interested in a transaction between the Board, of which he was a member, and RLA, of which he was a managing member, did not recuse himself and instead voted to facilitate the allegedly sham transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59-60.) In sum, Tobia, with Mr. Palazzolo, \"conspired to present the 2010 RLA Loan as a good investment that was secure ... [when,] [i]n fact, ... none of these things [was] true,\" and instead, \"[Mr.] Palazzolo and Tobia were ... conspiring to disguise their transfer of the Condominium's reserve funds to F &amp; M.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) This was allegedly done to inflate the value of F &amp; M, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62), which would then be able to qualify for financing in Ridgeview, a real estate investment that Tobia, Mr. Palazzolo, Santangelo, and Reitano all managed, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64). All told, Ridgeview LLC, RLA, and First Resource, with Tobia's control, allegedly received, and facilitated the receipt of, numerous transfers totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in allegedly stolen funds. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 135, 147, 172;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A.) As to ACC in particular, Plaintiff does not allege that ACC itself undertook any acts. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia \"repeatedly claimed in communications with the Board that they either owned or controlled ACC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177.) Palazzolo and Tobia, as the owners of ACC, knew that the unit owned by ACC was not being charged for electricity use, and instead that the cost was being borne by the Condominium and its unit owners. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178.) Indeed, Mr. Palazzolo allegedly concocted a scheme in which he told ACC's tenants that ACC was paying the Condominium for the electrical charges, and thus the bill could be paid directly to Mr. Palazzolo, as the owner of ACC, which in turn was the owner of the commercial space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) These payments were notarized by Thomas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, no payments were ever made by Mr. Palazzolo, Tobia, or ACC for electricity; instead, Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia, the owners of ACC, used in excess of $300,000 that ACC should have been paying the Condominium for the enrichment of the Palazzolo Enterprise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   It is true that courts in the Second Circuit \"generally do not impose vicarious liability under RICO unless the corporate ... defendant is a central figure in the RICO scheme,\" and thus, \"[p]laintiffs seeking to impose vicarious liability must, at a minimum, show that a corporate ... officer had knowledge of or was recklessly indifferent toward the unlawful activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Fin.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 177-180.) Plaintiff has further pled that ACC participated in and benefited from these acts, and that ACC has refused to return the more than $300,000 allegedly diverted from the Condominium to ACC and other members of the Palazzolo Enterprise.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 178.) Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Palazzolo allegedly concocted a scheme in which he told ACC's tenants that ACC was paying the Condominium for the electrical charges, and thus the bill could be paid directly to Palazzolo, as the owner of ACC, which in turn was the owner of the commercial space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) In fact, no payments were ever made by Mr. Palazzolo, Tobia, or ACC, for electricity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 178-80.) ACC continues to refuse to pay any portion of the charges for maintenance and utilities owed by it to the Condominium that ACC was, according to Plaintiff, obligated to pay initially. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) To state a claim for conversion, \"a plaintiff must show that: (1) the property subject to conversion is a specific identifiable thing; (2) plaintiff had ownership, possession or control over the property before its conversion; and (3) defendant exercised an unauthorized dominion over the thing in question, to the alteration of its condition or to the exclusion of the plaintiff's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Moses v.

At this stage, Plaintiff has adequately alleged the existence of unjust enrichment, conversion, and money had and received claims, as it alleges that the funds withheld by ACC were rightfully the property of the Condominium, and that ACC withheld and took that money to the detriment of the Condominium, who was allegedly the rightful owner of those funds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 225-28, 246-52.) Accordingly, the Court denies ACC's motion to dismiss these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

ACC does not appear to dispute that Plaintiff has adequately pled that Mr. Palazzolo breached his fiduciary duty to Plaintiff, but rather that ACC did not aid and abet Mr. Palazzolo in his breach. \"[T]o adequately plead a claim of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty under New York law, a plaintiff must allege: (1) breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff; (2) defendant's knowing participation in the breach; and (3) damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Glidepath Holding B.V. v.

Here, Plaintiff alleges that ACC was not being charged for electricity use, and instead, that cost was being borne by the Condominium and its unit owners. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 178.) Plaintiff further alleges that Mr. Palazzolo, a fiduciary of Plaintiff by virtue of his status as treasurer, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 11), knew that ACC was not being charged as it should have been, and thereafter crafted a plan in which he informed ACC's tenants that ACC was paying the Condominium for the electrical charges, and thus the bill could be paid directly to Palazzolo as opposed to the Condominium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) Mr. Palazzolo and Tobia, the sole owners and employees of ACC, then kept those funds in lieu of returning them to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.) ACC does not challenge that Mr. Palazzolo breached a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff and the Court concludes that Plaintiff has plead sufficient facts to create a strong inference that ACC had actual knowledge of this breach. Indeed, Plaintiff has alleged that Mr. Palazzolo was one of only two controlling members of ACC, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177), and that ACC had knowledge of Mr. Palazzolo's intentional diversion of funds owed by ACC to the Condominium, particularly because ACC has refused to return the more than $300,000 allegedly withheld from the Condominium by ACC for electrical charges, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179). Thus, at this stage, Plaintiff has adequately pled ACC's knowing participation in Mr. Palazzolo's breach, and ACC's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claims is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Mr. Palazzolo alleges\n   that he was elected to the Board in 2007 and elected treasurer of the Board in 2009. (Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 247-48.) \"Throughout his tenure ...

Indeed, in reliance on representations made to the Board as to his \"broad, unfettered discretion and authority to act on\"\n   <em>\n    the Board's\n   </em>\n   behalf, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 250), Mr. Palazzolo \"gave up the personal business opportunities\" described in the counterclaims and forewent \"the monetary benefit that would have been conferred upon himself personally and instead\n   <em>\n    acted so as to benefit the Board and the Condominium\n   </em>\n   ,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 251) (emphasis added).

By contrast, Mr. Palazzolo's Counterclaims repeatedly plead the exact opposite of such an expectation; instead, he affirmatively pleads that he entered into the transactions on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Board and the Condominium with full knowledge that he would not be compensated. (Counterclaims \u00b6 260 (\"[Mr.] Palazzolo was authorized to use and did use the Reserve Account at his discretion so as to enhance its value and further the business of the Board and the Condominium.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 275 (\"As of the date of the Purchase Money Mortgage and for purposes of benefitting the Board and the Condominium, F.

Simply put, Mr. Palazzolo claims he was \"granted broad, unfettered discretion and authority\" by the Board to act on behalf of the Board and Condominium. Mr. Palazzolo then used that authority to effect transactions on behalf of the Board and Condominium that were designed to benefit the Board and Condominium, without any expectation that he would be compensated for the supposed lost opportunity to benefit himself. Effectively, Mr. Palazzolo seeks to recover the profits for opportunities that he willingly gave to the Board and Condominium, and of which he had no expectation of profit. \"[T]hat is an effort to change the rules of the game after the game has been played, and equity and good conscience require no such result.\"\n   <em>\n    Tasini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3548376\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/851/734/#p740\">\n    851 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   741 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leibowitz v.

The Counterclaims allege that \"the majority of the members of the Board,\" granted Mr. Palazzolo \"full and complete control over the Reserve Account and permission and authority to engage in transactions involving the Board, which in [Mr.] Palazzolo's experience, were in the best interests of the Board and the Condominium.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 259.) By its pleaded terms, Mr. Palazzolo's alleged oral agreement with the Board is that he was granted \"full and complete control over the Reserve Account and permission and authority to engage in transactions involving the Board\" with no end date, no termination provisions, and is thus pled as an indefinite secession of power by the Board to Palazzolo. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Indeed, the whole basis for Mr. Palazzolo's promissory estoppel claim is that he was granted general authorization to act under this \"broad mandate\" that was abruptly terminated in 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 359-369.)
