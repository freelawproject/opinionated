Jones, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiff, Reginald Cornelius Latson, now 26 years old, is a former prison inmate\n   with the Virginia Department of Corrections (\"VDOC\"). He is alleged to suffer from autism spectrum disorder (\"ASD\"), post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"), and intellectual disability (\"ID\"). Latson contends that he was denied proper medical treatment for these conditions and subjected to abuse, lack of due process, and retaliation during his eight months of incarceration at the Marion Correctional Treatment Center (\"MCTC\"), a VDOC facility, prior to his conditional pardon by the Governor of Virginia in 2015. He asserts claims based on the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and the Rehabilitation Act (\"RA\"). The present defendants are VDOC; Harold W. Clarke, Director of VDOC; and Larry Jarvis and Dara Watson (n\u00e9e Robichaux), the former Warden and Assistant Warden, respectively, of MCTC. The ADA and RA claims are brought against VDOC; the \u00a7 1983 claims are brought against the individual defendants. Latson seeks both compensatory and punitive damages from the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After extensive discovery, the defendants jointly filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which has been briefed by the parties and orally argued and is ripe for decision. The parties have submitted a voluminous summary judgment record relating to Latson's confinement at MCTC, including depositions, affidavits and declarations, experts' evaluations and reports, and various official and unofficial records and correspondence. Together the parties have filed nearly 3,000 pages of briefs and exhibits in support or opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court has also considered oral argument by counsel, which lasted nearly two and a half hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Among other arguments, the defendants contend that Latson's claims under the ADA and the RA are barred by the statute of limitations and that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. I agree and will grant the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts taken from the summary judgment record are either undisputed or, where disputed, are presented in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Latson was diagnosed with ASD and ID as a child. As a result of these disabilities, he has poor eye contact and social skills, poor auditory and reading comprehension, and he mumbles and is difficult to understand. He does not like to be touched and\n   has a heightened fight-or-flight response, often becoming physically combative when frustrated. His coping skills and executive functioning are limited. In addition to ASD and ID, Latson has also been diagnosed with co-morbid conditions of depression and anxiety, which often accompany ASD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of his disabilities, Latson often does not respond well to authority figures and has a history of troubled interactions with law enforcement, which on several occasions have led to criminal convictions and incarceration. He was previously incarcerated at Powhatan Correctional Center (\"Powhatan\"), a VDOC facility, in 2011 and 2012. Jeena Porterfield oversaw Latson's treatment there. According to Porterfield, Latson's ASD would be obvious within five minutes of talking to him. Powhatan staff were instructed to verbally advise Latson before touching him for any reason and were educated that his lack of eye contact did not indicate that he was lying. While at Powhatan, Latson was offered recreation daily. Latson's mother frequently communicated with Powhatan staff about Latson, advocating on his behalf and often complaining about his treatment. However, according to Porterfield, Latson did not have problems with security staff at Powhatan. Latson was generally satisfied with his time at Powhatan, and at oral argument in this case, his counsel pointed to his treatment there as an example of how MCTC should have handled Latson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 7, 2014, Latson was sentenced in Frederick County, Virginia, Circuit Court for attempting to disarm a law enforcement officer and assaulting a law enforcement officer. On March 20, 2014, he was sentenced in Stafford County, Virginia, Circuit Court for assault on a law enforcement officer. These felony convictions and sentences led to his incarceration, first at Northwestern Regional Adult Detention Center (\"NRADC\") and then at Rappahannock Regional Jail (\"Rappahannock\"), where he was transferred on April 21, 2014. Neither NRADC nor Rappahannock is a VDOC facility. Rappahannock is a local jail operated by a local jail authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When he arrived at Rappahannock, Latson was immediately placed in segregation. The administrative segregation cell in which Latson was housed at Rappahannock had a mattress on a ledge, a toilet, and a sink. It had no window, only a flap in the door that was generally kept closed. Latson was allowed to keep his toiletries, commissary items, radio, books, and other personal property in his cell at first. Three days after his arrival, however, Latson was moved to a crisis cell, which contained nothing but a hole in the floor to be used as a toilet and a safety mattress. He was not allowed to keep toiletries or any other personal property in that cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Latson was moved to the crisis cell because a psychiatrist evaluated him, found him to be suicidal, and directed that he be put on full suicide watch. As he was being placed into the crisis cell and his clothing removed, he was pushed against the wall and told to put his hands on the wall. When his handcuffs were removed, he turned and struck an officer three times in the temple, ear, and face. Another officer used a Taser on Latson and placed him in handcuffs and leg irons. A nurse saw Latson and removed the Taser probes. Latson was then placed in a restraint chair with his arms, legs, and chest strapped to the chair. He was left in the chair for almost nine hours, which is longer than allowed under the applicable policy without authorization from command staff. Latson was criminally charged with assault and pled guilty, and he received an additional six-month sentence. About a week after this incident, Latson was moved from the crisis\n   cell to administrative segregation, where he remained for the duration of his time at Rappahannock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There is no evidence in the record that defendants Clarke, Jarvis, or Watson learned of this incident at Rappahannock prior to Latson's later transfer to MCTC. At some point, an attorney for Latson, Lisa Greenman, called Director Clarke and told him that conditions at Rappahannock were not good and that Latson was defecating in a hole in the floor of his cell. She asked for Latson to be moved to a VDOC facility because she believed that VDOC could better serve Latson's needs. Neither Clarke nor Greenman can recall the specifics of this conversation or the date on which it occurred. Clarke did not speak to MCTC Warden Jarvis about Latson. He asked Assistant Warden Watson for information about Latson, but he does not recall when he made the request or what prompted it. Greenman had also been contacting Keith Dawkins, a high level VDOC official, regularly with concerns about conditions at Rappahannock, but the timing and content of those conversations is not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As Director of VDOC, Clarke has discretion about which inmates to bring from regional jails to state facilities. In making that determination, he considers bed availability and date of final sentencing order. By statute, a person sentenced to more than a year of incarceration is to be received into VDOC custody \"within sixty days of the date on which the final sentencing order is mailed by certified letter or sent by electronic transmission to the Director by the clerk.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2053.1-20\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 53.1-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B). There is a conflict in the evidence as to when VDOC considers an inmate to be \"VDOC-responsible\" or \"state-responsible,\" although that issue is not of critical importance. Because Latson had been convicted of felonies and sentenced to more than a year of incarceration, Clarke had the power to transfer him from Rappahannock to a VDOC facility, which he ultimately did. Latson spent approximately six weeks at Rappahannock and was transferred to MCTC on June 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Attorney Greenman's advocacy led Clarke to accept Latson into a VDOC facility more quickly than would otherwise have been expected based on standard practice and bed availability. Once he made the decision to transfer Latson to MCTC, Clarke received updates regarding the status of Latson's arrival there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 4, 2014, the day before Latson's arrival at MCTC, VDOC psychologist Eric Madsen wrote in an email to Jarvis, Watson, and others that he had spoken with mental health staff at Rappahannock and a VDOC community psychologist had visited Latson at Rappahannock, and Latson had seemed to be doing well there, contrary to Greenman's accounts. It was Madsen's decision to place Latson at MCTC, a facility that focuses on mental health treatment. He took Latson's disabilities into account in a general way, but he did not specifically consider Latson's ASD and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2053.1-20\">\n    ID.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Madsen did not believe special input from an autism expert was required when deciding on Latson's placement. He believed that MCTC was the best facility that VDOC had to offer Latson, and the mental health unit there could serve the needs of an inmate with ASD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon Latson's arrival at MCTC, Christopher Armes, a psychology associate, assessed him as having a high risk of aggression based on his impulsiveness, poor insight, and limited coping skills, as well as his history of assaulting law enforcement and his experiences at Rappahannock. Armes reviewed thousands of pages of documents regarding Latson in preparation for Latson's transfer to MCTC. He\n   had heard about Latson through emails and phone calls before Latson arrived at MCTC, and he and others also knew about Latson from newspapers and the internet. Most offenders are received into the VDOC system at a reception center where they go through an intake process, but Latson was transferred directly from Rappahannock to MCTC and skipped the usual reception process, so it took the MCTC staff longer than usual to complete their assessment and other intake tasks. Recreational therapy supervisor Mark Guerry conducted a Recreation Therapy Assessment and planned for himself or another recreational therapist, Helen Fuqua, to meet with Latson one-on-one approximately three times per week to provide him recreational and therapeutic activities that matched his interests and abilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a mental health appraisal dated November 4, 2014, Armes wrote that Latson has \"Autism Spectrum Disorder, requiring support for deficits in social communication and for restricted repetitive behavior with accompanying intellectual impairment; and requiring support for some deficits in to-and-from conversation with accompanying language impairment.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex.

His housing status varied - sometimes it was listed as administrative segregation, and other times it was listed as general detention, pre-hearing detention, or disciplinary segregation - but these are all considered forms of special housing and all use the same cells. The changes in housing status affected the privileges he was afforded vis-\u00e0-vis personal property, commissary access, phone calls, and out-of-cell time, but not his actual location. The plaintiff refers to all of these special housing statuses as solitary confinement, but because that term is imprecise and somewhat misleading, I will refer to them collectively as restrictive housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Immediately upon his arrival at MCTC, Latson was placed in restrictive housing with a general detention status, purportedly to allow the staff to assess him and decide on an appropriate housing status. Although the applicable policy states that he should only have been in general detention status for three days, he was classified as general detention for six days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   His status was then changed to administrative segregation for 30 days, pre-hearing detention for four days, administrative segregation for six days, disciplinary segregation for nine days, and administrative segregation for 55 days before he was placed in general population. This initial period in restrictive housing lasted from June 5, 2014, through September 22, 2014, for about three and a half months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Latson then spent 12 days in general population before being returned to pre-hearing detention on October 5, 2014, remaining in that status for 14 days. His status was changed to general detention\n   for two days and then to administrative segregation for 52 days. This second round of restrictive housing lasted about nine and a half weeks. Latson was then placed into general population again and spent 39 days there, from December 12, 2014, through January 19, 2015. Upon being conditionally pardoned by the Governor, he was returned to general detention status for four days. He was then placed in general population status and moved to his own wing of the prison for 11 days while he awaited transportation from MCTC to a private residential treatment facility in Florida, a condition of his pardon. He departed MCTC on February 2, 2015. In total, Latson spent 182 days in restrictive housing at MCTC and 62 days in general population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Latson had some form of human interaction every day while he was in restrictive housing, although on a few days his only human contact was with a nurse through a slot in his cell door several times throughout the day. He was offered some form of out-of-cell recreation on most weekdays, although he did not always accept it. He was given the opportunity to shower at least once a week and at times every other day or every day, and he usually accepted the chance to shower, leaving his cell to do so. He spoke with either his mother or his attorney by phone most days while he was in restrictive housing, although several days would sometimes pass between phone calls. At one point, he may have gone as long as 12 days without a phone call, but he may have spoken with his attorney from his counselor's office during that time. Latson often used the counselor's office phone, and those calls were not logged. Latson testified that when he was in segregation, he was not permitted to make \"privilege phone calls\" until he had been there for 30 days. Pl.'s Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex. D, Latson Dep. 112-13, ECF No. 202-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition to daily nurse visits, he was visited by a member of his treatment team on at least 35 days while he was in restrictive housing. These visits were more frequent early in his incarceration at MCTC and slowed considerably as time went on. There were stretches of time when Latson went 11, 13, 20, and as long as 26 days without being visited by a member of his treatment team or by psychologist Ann Horst, nurse Tammy Jones, or Nurse Hall, although he did meet with recreational therapists at times during these periods, and nursing staff continued to check on him through his cell door several times per day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other routine but infrequent interactions included occasional cell cleanings, delivery of mail, and haircuts. Latson sometimes went 48 hours or longer without being given the opportunity to leave his cell. At one point he refused recreation for several days and spent four consecutive days in his cell. In July and August, 2014, Latson declined recreation opportunities for a period of three and a half weeks, leaving his cell only for showers, a court hearing, a couple of phone calls, and a handful of medical appointments and treatment team meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Latson testified that he refused recreation because he did not want to interact with the guards or cause any problems with them. He also sometimes refused to\n   go outside because it was cold. During recreation, a guard would remove Latson from his cell and take him to an outdoor cage. There was nothing in the cage; it was simply a fenced outdoor space where he could do exercises like push ups. He would be the only inmate in his cage, although other inmates might be in their own cages. Latson did not want to interact with other inmates, who would call him over to talk to them, asking him questions and looking at him in ways that made him uncomfortable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Latson was prescribed and administered medication beginning on June 7, 2014, his third day at MCTC. Aside from two days on which he was not given medication and one day on which he partially refused it, Latson took medication every day from June 7, 2014, through February 1, 2015, his final full day at MCTC. To facilitate weight gain, he was given Ensure from June 16, 2014, through August 14, 2014, and again from August 25, 2014, through February 2, 2015, with the exception of January 25, 2015. Nurse Jones prescribed Ensure because Latson's body mass index was at the low end of the normal range. There was a period of ten days during which, for no known reason, Latson was not provided Ensure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When Latson was in disciplinary segregation, he was not permitted to have any books in his cell other than a religious text. When he was in other housing statuses, he at times had books in his cell. A radio played in the hallway outside his cell. While in disciplinary segregation, Latson's hygiene materials were kept outside his cell for security reasons, although his toilet paper remained in his cell. Latson usually did not ask for his hygiene items when he needed them because he was afraid of the guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   MCTC implements Segregation Release Plans (\"SRPs\") to allow inmates in segregation to socialize with other offenders. During his time at MCTC, Latson had a series of SRPs, which were designed by Armes, reviewed by Watson, and approved by Jarvis. The SRPs provided that Latson could spend a certain amount of time per day, on a certain number of days per week, outside of his cell, usually in the day room on another wing or in the gym. While in the day room, he could make phone calls, watch television, play games, or otherwise interact with other inmates. When he was in the gym, he could not watch television or use the phone, but he could walk, play basketball, use an exercise bike, or do other physical activities, or he could choose to simply sit in the gym and do nothing. Whenever he had the opportunity to use the telephone, Latson usually called his mother or his attorney rather than partaking in other activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Latson's first SRP became effective on June 27, 2014, and provided for one hour per day, three days per week of out-of-cell time. During his first SRP, Armes or social worker Gary Lyons sat with Latson while he was out of his cell to ensure he was safe and socializing appropriately. Armes had not done this with other offenders. Latson's first SRP was in place for four days when Latson had an outburst and threw toiletry bottles against his cell door and water under his cell door. As a result of this incident, his SRP was terminated. An SRP was again implemented seven days later, on July 7, 2014, which provided for 30 minutes to one hour of out-of-cell time three days per week. That SRP remained in place for four days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 11, 2014, Latson had another behavioral outburst and his SRP was suspended. He pushed his meal tray through the tray slot in his cell door, hitting a guard, and then refused to return his rubber cup. Latson has testified that he had intended to hit the guard with the tray. The guards handcuffed him to retrieve the\n   cup, and while they were removing the handcuffs through the tray slot, they twisted and pulled his arm, he pulled away, and he sustained a laceration to his arm. He received sutures. According to Latson, blood from this incident remained in his cell for an extended period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After the incident, Armes conducted an Offender Mental Health Assessment and \"determined that Latson was mentally capable of being held responsible for the offense, that his mental disorders did not impair his understanding of the penalty offer that was made to him, that he was capable of effectively participating in the hearing, and that disciplinary segregation would not be detrimental to Latson's condition.\" Mem. Supp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 33, Armes Aff. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 182-34. Sarah Angliker, the chief social worker at MCTC, testified that the treatment team agreed with the decision to charge Latson with simple assault because they believed Latson knew what he was doing and knew it was wrong, but threw the tray in anger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a result of the July 11 offense, an Institutional Classification Authority Hearing (\"ICA Hearing\") was held on July 21. During an ICA Hearing, a multidisciplinary team is present, and everyone offers recommendations for the offender. An Institutional Classification Authority (\"ICA\") is a person who makes sure that the hearing is fair, correct, and sound. Assistant Warden Watson was designated to serve as the ICA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To satisfy due process requirements for offenders in segregation, the inmate has to be served with paperwork in a timely manner and to know why he is there. Latson was served with the relevant paperwork for the July 21 hearing. The warden generally does not attend ICA Hearings, but the warden approves all recommendations, and in his absence, the assistant warden approves them. Latson pled guilty and accepted a penalty offer of 20 days of disciplinary segregation for his conduct on July 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Latson's next SRP took effect on August 8, 2014, and provided for 30 minutes to one hour of out-of-cell time at least three days per week. After seven days, his SRP was changed to provide for up to one hour of out-of-cell time at least five days per week. A new SRP form was completed on August 21, 2018, providing that on three out of the five days, Latson's out-of-cell hour would be spent in the gym during residential recreation time, while on the other two days, he would spend his out-of-cell time on wing 2B, where he had previously been going for SRP time. Wing 2B was a more controlled environment than other residential general population wings. This plan continued for several weeks until September 10, 2014, when his out-of-cell time was increased to up to two hours per day, five days per week, and the location was changed to wing 1D, a residential wing. This SRP was in place until Latson was moved to general population on September 23, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 5, 2014, Latson spat on an officer and was placed back in restrictive housing. He was not otherwise disciplined for the incident, but no new SRP was implemented for about seven weeks. Armes again conducted a mental health assessment and \"determined that Latson was mentally capable of being held responsible for the offense, that his mental health disorders did not impair his understanding of the penalty offer that was made to him, that he was capable of effectively participating in the hearing, and that disciplinary segregation would not be detrimental to Latson's condition.\" Armes Aff. \u00b6 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On November 21, 2014, a new SRP went into effect providing for one hour per day, five days per week to be spent on wing 2B. Two weeks later, the SRP was changed to\n   allow for one hour per day on wing 1D in the morning and two hours in the evening, provided staff was available. This SRP remained in place until Latson was again moved to general population on wing 1D on December 12, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Armes testified that he did not want to overwhelm or overstimulate Latson, which is why he increased Latson's SRP time so slowly and why Latson initially spent time on wing 2B before going to wing 1D. There were fewer inmates in the gym than in the day rooms on the wings, so having Latson spend some of his time in the gym was also intended to ease him into socializing without overwhelming him. The goal of the SRPs was to eventually place Latson in general population. Latson was given more out-of-cell time than other offenders with serious mental health diagnoses. According to Armes, most offenders in segregation at the time were only granted one hour per day, three days per week of out-of-cell time, although the applicable policy stated that the typical frequency would be at least one hour per day, five days per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Julie Carpenter, Latson's former attorney, visited him on October 3, 2014, while he was in general population. Latson asked for her help in completing a grievance form, and she asked for permission to help him, but Watson and others refused to let Carpenter assist in completing or submitting the grievance. Prison staff told Carpenter that Latson had to either complete the form in his own hand or request help from a staff member. Latson was unable to complete the form himself due to his disabilities, so he did not file a grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Latson's treatment team at MCTC was comprised of medical and mental health professionals, including those with expertise in psychology, psychiatry, and nursing, but they collectively had very little training or experience in working with persons with ASD. Angliker was the chief social worker and coordinator of the entire residential program at MCTC, and she supervised all the offenders and their treatment teams. She did not have any formal training specific to ASD. Angliker does not recall having any other inmates with ASD at MCTC before Latson. She did some internet research on Aspberger's syndrome and shared the information she found with the treatment team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Lyons was the residential social worker assigned to Latson, and he was supervised by Angliker. Lyons was the case coordinator for Latson. He had no training specific to ASD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Latson's team nurse was originally Lynn Rector and later changed to Jeffrey McGrady. Neither of them had training or experience in working with persons with ASD. Dr. Horst was the supervising psychologist and prescribed psychotropic medications. She was sometimes on site at MCTC and sometimes did telepsychiatry, talking to inmates over video conferencing. She had some experience treating autistic patients, although the extent of that experience appears to have been minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Amanda McGrady, Ph.D., was a psychology supervisor at MCTC but was not really considered part of Latson's treatment team. She had previous experience working with children with autism under the age of 13 and with children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Armes, the psychology associate, did not receive any training at MCTC that was specific to working with people with ASD or ID and had no previous experience working with people with ASD. He did, however, complete annual training that covered the treatment of mentally disabled inmates, and he teaches classes on management of offenders with mental illness and suicidal tendencies, which are attended by all staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Clarke, the VDOC Director, was not personally involved in any decisions regarding Latson's care and treatment, including housing or disciplinary decisions. Clarke did not receive regular updates on Latson while he was housed at MCTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Jarvis was the Warden at MCTC until December 31, 2014.

Then several other officers came, and they all started pushing Latson back to segregation. Latson testified that he had been fully compliant and had not resisted the officers' efforts to guide him in the direction they wanted him to go. Latson also described another incident in which he had sworn at Hess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Latson described his first cell at MCTC as small, with a toilet and a cement ledge with a comforter on top of it for a bed. The cell had a sink, and there was a window in the door. There was no window to the outdoors, and there was no clock. When Latson arrived, there was toilet paper in the cell. When he ran out, he did not ask for more because he was scared of the guards. He thought they would get angry and yell or cuss at him. At some point, Latson did not have a toothbrush, though he does not know what happened to it. He did not ask anyone about his toothbrush. He told his mother it was missing, she called prison officials, and he then received another toothbrush. Sometimes officers at MCTC would give Latson hygiene packages, which included toilet paper, a toothbrush, and toothpaste, among other things. Latson could not recall how often he received these packages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sometimes Latson would leave his cell to meet with his treatment team, but he does not remember how often he met with them. At one point, Latson had a popular magazine in his cell. He does not remember whether he had other books or whether he accessed the library. At times he purchased things from the commissary, including food items like chips. Attorney Greenman subscribed to some magazines for Latson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Armes testified that Latson usually became agitated after talking to his mother on the phone. When the treatment team was around, they would work with Latson to de-escalate the situation. Armes would remind the team not to make eye contact with Latson. Armes told the treatment team that their uniforms alone could trigger Latson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Latson's care manager, Lyons, was required to have one-on-one meetings with Latson. Armes sometimes met with Latson outside of Latson's cell, in a conference room. Latson directed the conversations but often did not talk much. Often Armes and Latson would watch television or he would talk with his mother or lawyer on the phone during meetings with Armes. These meetings would last an hour or less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Recreational therapist Guerry suggested a points-based rewards system for Latson, but Latson thought it was childish and did not want to participate. Guerry implemented the use of stickers in keeping Latson's daily log while he was housed in wing 2B. Guerry initially met with Latson in the day room to complete the daily log forms, but he eventually began giving Latson the forms to complete on his own in his cell. Latson stopped completing the forms, stating that they were not helping him. Guerry spent more time on Latson than other offenders, both in one-on-one meetings and treatment team meetings. When Latson did not want to participate in group activities, Guerry would leave coloring pages or other materials for him to complete in his cell. Guerry invited Latson to play volleyball several times, but Latson always declined. He also declined to participate in other activities like basketball.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Watson testified that inmates who receive conditional pardons are placed in segregation for their protection to prevent other inmates from harming them. After he was conditionally pardoned, Latson was placed in general detention status and moved to a segregation cell for several days until Watson secured an empty wing for him, wing 2C. While in general detention status, his privileges were limited and\n   his personal property was taken from him. He did not initially have access to books, although he was eventually given books and magazines. While on wing 2C following his pardon, an officer was present with Latson around the clock. Latson had access to books, puzzles, a television, and a telephone. Guards reviewed his commissary list with him, and he was able to shower. He had a music player. He was required to be in his cell two times per day, but otherwise he could leave his cell freely to watch television or make phone calls in the day room. He was allowed to leave the wing for recreation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Throughout Latson's time at MCTC, attorney Greenman frequently emailed and called staff expressing concerns about conditions and events as Latson had described them to her. She explained that Latson struggled to identify his needs and had difficulty asking guards for things. In her communications with MCTC staff, she asked about the SRPs, requested that they consult with a sister Virginia agency about how to work with people with ASD, asked what Latson could access, and expressed concern about his weight loss and how being in isolation would affect his mental health. Greenman connected MCTC staff with Barry Seaver of the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services, who was willing to assist MCTC with Latson's treatment, but MCTC staff did not follow up on that offer. Greenman visited Latson at least once while he was at MCTC, on August 5, 2014. She ordered books and magazines for him and repeatedly asked for him to be provided greater stimulation, specifically requesting that he be given a television or radio. Watson and Dawkins joked about that request, with Watson writing, \"She is asking for a bit much.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex.

Watson in particular was well aware that MCTC was under intense scrutiny regarding its treatment of Latson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Denise Malone, VDOC's chief psychologist, received emails from Greenman and communicated with the treatment team and others about Latson.

They argue that the undisputed facts fail to establish their deliberate indifference to those needs. I agree. The defendants - Clarke, Jarvis, and Watson - are not\n   medical professionals and were not part of Latson's treatment team. There is no evidence that they intentionally interfered with treatment prescribed by the treatment team or denied Latson access to necessary treatment. The only suggestion of interference in the record is Dr. Horst's testimony that had she ordered that Latson be given more books or other stimuli, those orders would not have been followed due to concerns about security. That testimony is speculative, however, and does not show that the defendants interfered with any actual directive from Latson's treating professionals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The plaintiff seems to argue that the very act of placing him in restrictive housing was meant to interfere with his treatment, but the evidence does not support that assertion. Latson was visited by nurses and dispensed medication nearly every day while he was in restrictive housing, and he met with recreational therapists and members of his treatment team even while he was in prehearing detention and disciplinary segregation, the most restrictive housing statuses. It is undisputed that Latson received medical and mental health treatment throughout his time at MCTC, even when he was in restrictive housing. Latson contends that the treatment he received was grossly inadequate, but again, the defendants he has named are not medical or mental health professionals and were not the people prescribing or providing that treatment. Moreover, at least as of the time of these events, there was \"no authority for the proposition that the Eighth Amendment entitle[d] [prisoners] to effective treatment, or that [V]DOC is a guarantor of mental health.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3915252\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/462/348/\">\n    462 F. App'x at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The plaintiff contends that the members of Latson's treatment team were inadequately trained to treat an inmate with ASD. While failure to train can serve as a basis for \u00a7 1983 liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Canton v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p380\">\n    489 U.S. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p380\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p380\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), the Amended Complaint did not assert a failure-to-train claim. Even if Latson had brought such a claim, it was not clearly established as of 2014 that the Director of VDOC and MCTC's Warden and Assistant Warden - nonmedical prison officials - had a duty to train medical professionals on how to work with inmates who have a particular medical diagnosis like ASD. The plaintiff has pointed this court to no case that would have required such training. Moreover, the undisputed facts show that at least one professional who saw Latson frequently, Dr. McGrady, had significant experience and training with respect to treating patients with ASD. Although Dr. McGrady was not considered a member of Latson's treatment team, she saw him nearly daily when making rounds, consulted on his care, and supervised Armes, who assessed Latson, worked extensively with him, and designed his SRPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Watson, Jarvis, and Clarke cannot be liable for the treatment team's acts or omissions under a respondeat superior theory.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

There is scant evidence in the record of Clarke's actions with regard to Latson's treatment at MCTC. While Watson and Jarvis approved Latson's SRPs, Armes, a mental health professional, designed them. Although the defendants received emails from attorney Greenman conveying what she found concerning about Latson's treatment at MCTC, they had a right to rely on the assessments of their medical professional colleagues, who were working with Latson at MCTC, over the opinions and recommendations\n   of Latson's attorney-advocate who was relaying second-hand information. As the Third Circuit has aptly explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   If a prisoner is under the care of medical experts ..., a non-medical prison official will generally be justified in believing that the prisoner is in capable hands. This follows naturally from the division of labor within a prison. Inmate health and safety is promoted by dividing responsibility for various aspects of inmate life among guards, administrators, physicians, and so on. Holding a non-medical prison official liable in a case where a prisoner was under a physician's care would strain this division of labor. Moreover, under such a regime, non-medical officials could even have a perverse incentive\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to delegate treatment responsibility to the very physicians most likely to be able to help prisoners, for fear of vicarious liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   ... [A]bsent a reason to believe (or actual knowledge) that prison doctors or their assistants are mistreating (or not treating) a prisoner, a non-medical prison official ... will not be chargeable with the Eighth Amendment scienter requirement of deliberate indifference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    Spruill v.

The defendants were entitled to defer to medical and mental health staff as to Latson's treatment, and the record evidence does not establish that the defendants had reason to believe that the treatment team was mistreating or failing to treat Latson. Because the undisputed facts fail to demonstrate that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to Latson's serious medical needs, Clarke, Jarvis, and Watson are entitled to summary judgment as to Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Due Process.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In Count Three, Latson contends that the defendants violated his Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights by placing him in restrictive housing without first giving him a hearing and by preventing his attorney from helping him draft a grievance.

Latson appears to have been in some form of restrictive housing during the entire time he was at Rappahannock. The record does not indicate that he was ever housed in the general population there. When he was moved to MCTC and placed first in general detention, then in administrative segregation, the conditions of his confinement were not any worse than when he was housed in administrative segregation at Rappahannock immediately before his transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Latson arrived at MCTC on June 5, 2014, and an ICA Hearing was held on June 11, 2014, to determine an appropriate housing status. A hearing report states that Latson was present at the hearing. The report says that \"the Residential Team requests Continued Restrictive Housing at this time in order to complete classification and assessments and to formulate a comprehensive treatment plan.\" Mem. Supp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 16, ECF No. 182-17. Watson recommended that Latson's status be changed to administrative segregation to allow more time for the treatment team to evaluate Latson. Jarvis approved the status change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Another ICA Hearing took place on June 26, 2014, to consider the treatment team's recommendation of an SRP. Latson was present at the hearing. The report states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Although [Latson] has a significant history of aggression, he has demonstrated appropriate behavior since his arrival, has been medication-compliant, and has ben [sic] behaviorally controlled.

Jarvis approved the recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Four days after the SRP was implemented, it was suspended on June 30, 2014, for misbehavior that did not result in a charge. No ICA Hearing was held regarding the suspension of Latson's first SRP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The record contains a Disciplinary Offense Report regarding the July 11, 2014, incident in which Latson hit an officer with a tray through the tray slot. Sergeant Cullop signed that he had served the report on Latson and that Latson refused to sign the report. Cullop marked Latson's responses to a series of questions. According to the report, Latson indicated that he did not request a staff or offender advisor to assist him at the hearing, that he did wish to request witnesses, and that he did not wish to request documentary evidence. Latson indicated that he wished to waive his right to 24 hours of preparation time prior to a hearing and that he did not wish to appear at the disciplinary hearing. The report contained several statements regarding Latson's rights, including that he had the right to question the reporting officer and the right to remain silent. The report is dated July 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The next page of the report states that a hearing took place on July 21, 2014, and that the reporting officer was not present. The report states that Latson accepted a penalty offer, thereby pleading guilty. The agreed penalty was 20 days in disciplinary segregation. The hearing officer was A.L. Doss. The form indicates that Latson was in pre-hearing detention from July 11 until July 20 and in isolation from July 21 until July 30, for a total of 20 days in segregation. Watson approved the penalty. Latson signed a separate penalty offer form to acknowledge that he had been advised of his rights and signed a second time to show his acceptance of the offer. The penalty offer form stated that he was waiving his right to a hearing and pleading guilty. On August 11, 2014, Latson signed the form to indicate that he had received a copy and had been advised of his right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Armes completed a Discipline - Offender Mental Health Assessment on July 11, 2014, the date of the incident, and found that Latson could be held responsible for the offense, that his disability did not impair his understanding of the penalty offer, that he was capable of effectively participating in a hearing, and that disciplinary segregation would not be detrimental to his mental status. The assessment was received and signed by Lieutenant Olinger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   On July 15, 2014, four days after the incident and six days before the disciplinary hearing, Watson held an ICA Hearing at which Latson was present. The report of the ICA Hearing notes that the treatment team requested that Latson remain in segregation until his disciplinary hearing because of his two incidents of aggression while at MCTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Latson's memory of these events is hazy. At his deposition, when asked if the signatures on the forms were his signatures, he replied, \"I don't know.\" Latson Dep. 147, ECF No. 202-7. He was asked, \"Do you remember anybody talking to you about whether or not to accept the penalty from the July 11, 2014, event? Any correctional officer or treatment officer?\" He responded, \"I don't remember.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When asked, \"Do you remember taking the penalty rather than having a hearing?,\" he replied, \"I don't remember.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I find that these answers do not create any genuine issue of material fact because they do not satisfy Latson's duty to produce affirmative evidence disputing the defendants' version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   On August 7, 2014, an ICA Hearing was held to consider a proposed SRP. Latson was present at the hearing. Watson recommended implementation of the proposed SRP, and Jarvis approved the recommendation. On September 9, 2014, another ICA Hearing was held to consider a proposal to increase the amount of time on a residential wing allowed by Latson's SRP. Latson was present at this hearing as well. Watson recommended the treatment\n   team's proposed changes to the SRP, and Jarvis approved the changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   On September 18, 2014, at the request of the treatment team, another ICA Hearing was held to consider releasing Latson into general population. Latson was present at the hearing and indicated his readiness to be released into general population. Watson concurred in the treatment team's recommendation, and Jarvis approved the status change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   A Disciplinary Offense Report regarding the October 5, 2014, spitting incident states that at a disciplinary hearing on October 8, Latson pleaded guilty and was penalized with 20 days in disciplinary segregation. The report indicates that Latson refused to sign to acknowledge his receipt of the report and would not accept a copy of it. On the corresponding penalty offer form, Latson signed to acknowledge that he had been advised of his rights, but he did not accept the penalty offer of 20 days of disciplinary segregation and chose to proceed to a hearing. Armes again completed a Discipline - Offender Mental Health Assessment on October 6 and made the same findings that he had made on July 11 regarding Latson's competence. As a result of the spitting incident, Latson was placed in pre-hearing detention from October 5 through October 8 and was then placed in disciplinary segregation through October 24, for a total of 20 days in segregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The day before his disciplinary hearing, an ICA Hearing was held on October 7, 2014, to consider Latson's placement in pre-hearing detention for the spitting incident. Latson was present and indicated that he did not want to remain in detention. However, the treatment team recommended that he remain in pre-hearing detention until his disciplinary hearing. Watson adopted that recommendation, and Jarvis approved it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   An ICA Hearing took place on October 21, 2014, to address a status change from pre-hearing detention to general detention that had occurred on October 19, 2014. Latson was present and indicated a desire to return to wing 1D. The treatment team recommended that he remain in segregation because attempts to move him into general population had been unsuccessful. Watson concurred and recommended that his status be changed to administrative segregation. Jarvis approved this status change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   On November 20, 2014, an ICA Hearing was held to consider a proposed SRP. Latson was present and stated that upon being released into general population, he wanted to be productive by working and attending school. Watson recommended approval of the proposed SRP, and Jarvis approved it. On December 4, 2014, an ICA Hearing was held to consider expanding Latson's SRP. Latson attended the hearing and asked when he could start the new SRP. Watson recommended approval of the proposed changes and Jarvis approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   On December 11, 2014, an ICA Hearing was held to consider releasing Latson into general population. Latson attended the hearing and stated that he was ready to be released from restrictive housing.

Watson had placed him in general detention the day before. The ICA for this hearing was Vickie O. Williams. Williams recommended a change to administrative segregation, noting that Latson was placed in detention for his safety until his release within two weeks. Watson reviewed and approved the recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   VDOC's Special Housing Operating Procedure defines general detention status as \"[s]pecial purpose bed assignments, utilized under proper administrative process, for the immediate secure confinement of offenders pending review for an appropriate assignment.\" Mem.

This interest must arise from a state policy or regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p526\">\n    791 F.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I find that the Special Housing Operating Procedure and the Facility Classification Management Operating Procedure are state policies that create a protected liberty interest in avoiding placement in restrictive housing absent certain procedural protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The parties disagree on the baseline against which to compare the conditions of Latson's confinement in restrictive housing. The defendants argue that because Latson was in restrictive housing for most of his period of incarceration, the conditions of restrictive housing constitute the ordinary incidents of prison life for him. Latson argues that his conditions\n   should be compared to general population, as that was the goal toward which everyone was working. Latson was not sentenced to any particular housing status, and he was able to be housed in general population for at least part of his time at MCTC.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prieto v. Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072988\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/245/#p252\">\n    780 F.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (4th Cir. 2015) (holding that inmates specifically sentenced to death row had no liberty interest in being housed in a less restrictive environment; thus, general population was not the appropriate baseline for them). Therefore, I conclude that Latson's baseline was general population, even though he spent a relatively small percentage of his time there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The undisputed facts show that inmates in general population can have more personal property in their cells, enjoy more out-of-cell time, can watch television more often, and have greater opportunities to interact with other inmates than offenders in restrictive housing. In comparison to the general population baseline, restrictive housing imposed atypical and significant hardships in the form of significant reduction in stimulus and interaction with other inmates, which had an unusually harsh effect on Latson because of his disabilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Latson has established a liberty interest in avoiding restrictive housing, and he was entitled to some amount of process when being deprived of that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Latson, however, received all the process that was due to him under the Fourteenth Amendment. In making this determination, I apply the three factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   : (1) Latson's private interest in avoiding restrictive housing; (2) the risk that Latson could be deprived of that interest erroneously under the procedures in place, and the likely value of additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the state's interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens of additional processes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) ;\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p526\">\n    791 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As a prisoner, Latson's liberty was already curtailed, and his private interest must be viewed within the context of the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p222\">\n    545 U.S. at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p222\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given his disabilities and restrictive housing's particular impact on him, I find that Latson had a significant interest in avoiding placement in restrictive housing. But the procedures in place adequately guarded against the risk that he could be erroneously deprived of that interest, and additional procedures would have provided little added protection against him being placed in restrictive housing in error. Latson was given the basic requirements of due process: notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p222\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p222\">\n    at 225-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p222\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Latson was present and able to participate at each ICA Hearing. His treatment team made recommendations about his placements, and they could have assisted him in expressing his desires and concerns if he felt unable to do so on his own. ICA Hearings to consider Latson's housing status and SRPs were held frequently during Latson's relatively short period of incarceration. Recommendations of Watson were reviewed and approved by Jarvis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In advance of each disciplinary hearing, Latson was given a report explaining the charges against him and advising him of his rights, including his right to be present at the hearing and to call witnesses. Armes, a psychology associate who worked extensively with Latson, assessed his competency before each disciplinary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   His findings included that Latson was mentally capable of effectively participating in a hearing. The hearings took place within a reasonable amount of time following each incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Latson asserts that he did not understand what was happening in the hearings, but the record evidence demonstrates that he had the ability to participate and ask questions, which he did in fact do. Latson has not proposed additional procedural safeguards that should have been implemented. In any event, in the prison context, the state has an interest in avoiding additional procedural burdens that take staff attention and resources away from the security and operation of the prison, particularly where those burdens are unlikely to significantly protect against incorrect disciplinary action. It is important to note that here, Latson pled guilty to the disciplinary charges and did not dispute that he had conducted himself as charged. I conclude that the notice and hearings provided to Latson were sufficient to satisfy his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Latson has not pointed to any state law, regulation, or policy that would have required a hearing before he could be placed in general detention upon his arrival, and I cannot conclude that the Due Process Clause required such a pre-detention hearing. Latson's initial placement in restrictive housing did not constitute any meaningful departure from the conditions in which he was housed in administrative segregation at Rappahannock. The realities of prison administration required that Latson be segregated while he was being assessed to reduce the risk of harm to Latson or others that could have resulted from placing him immediately into general population without fully understanding his needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   VDOC policy did require a hearing within three working days of Latson's placement in general detention, and it is undisputed that the hearing was held at least two days late.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   I find, however, that the delay of several days before this first hearing was de minimis, particularly given that Latson's conditions did not meaningfully change either when he was transferred from administrative segregation at Rappahannock to general detention at MCTC or when his housing status was changed from pre-hearing detention to administrative segregation following the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riccio v. Cty. of Fairfax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541576\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/1459/#p1469\">\n    907 F.2d 1459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1469 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding that not every violation of state-created procedures amounts to a federal due process violation). This delay of several days did not amount to a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   As to the June 30, 2014, termination of Latson's SRP without a hearing, I find that Latson did not have any protected liberty interest in his SRP. No state policy or regulation required him to be granted an SRP or mandated a hearing before it could be suspended or terminated. His housing status remained administrative segregation after the SRP was suspended. The SRP was suspended for only one week, and during that time he was given the opportunity to shower on two days and to leave his cell for recreation on two different days. He refused the offers of recreation and one shower, but he left his cell once to shower, had mail delivered, had his cell cleaned, got a haircut, made one phone call, received one phone call, and was observed reading on two occasions while his SRP was suspended. Therefore, even if a policy or regulation had created a protected liberty interest in an SRP, the relatively short suspension of it here was\n   de minimis and did not cause an atypical, significant deprivation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Finally, Watson's unwillingness to allow Latson's attorney to complete a grievance form for Latson did not violate his procedural due process rights. At the time of the attorney's visit, Latson was housed in general population and no move to restrictive housing was being considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The attorney states in her declaration that to the best of her recollection, Latson wanted to complain about the number of hours he was confined to his cell and restrictions on the personal property he was allowed to have in his possession. If his contemplated grievance arose out of his placement in restrictive housing, it would have pertained to a previous placement that had already terminated. Having viewed Latson's handwriting on several exhibits, I agree with the plaintiff that it would have been difficult for him to complete a grievance form in his own hand, but it is undisputed that he could have requested assistance from MCTC staff. Latson claims that his fear of the guards prevented him from doing so, but nothing would have kept him from requesting the assistance of Guerry, Armes, another member of his treatment team, or even another inmate. The record evidence does not establish that the defendants prevented Latson from filing a grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   I find that the undisputed facts do not show any violation of Latson's procedural due process rights. But even if Latson had arguably shown a Fourteenth Amendment Due Process violation, the defendants did not violate any clearly established law because there was no case law in 2014 holding that they were required to provide any additional procedural protections beyond what they provided. Because the defendants provided Latson with adequate process to protect his liberty interest, and because they are entitled to qualified immunity as to this claim, I will grant the defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    First Amendment.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Count Five of the Amended Complaint claims that Watson and Clarke retaliated against Latson for exercising his First Amendment right to communicate with his attorney, his family, and the Governor by placing him in restrictive housing following his conditional pardon. \"The First Amendment right to free speech includes not only the affirmative right to speak, but also the right to be free from retaliation by a public official for the exercise of that right.\"\n   <em>\n    Suarez Corp.

To succeed on his First Amendment retaliation claim, Latson must show that (1) he engaged in constitutionally protected speech, (2) the defendants took retaliatory action that adversely affected Latson's protected speech, and (3) \"a causal relationship exists between [Latson's] speech and the [defendants'] retaliatory action.\"\n   <em>\n    Tobey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662330\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/379/#p385\">\n    706 F.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Claims of retaliation by prisoners must 'be regarded with skepticism, lest federal courts embroil themselves in every disciplinary act that occurs in penal institutions.' \"\n   <em>\n    Patton v.

Latson has therefore established the first element of his First Amendment retaliation claim, that he engaged in protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   To establish that the defendants' alleged retaliatory action adversely affected Latson's speech, Latson must show that \"a similarly situated person of ordinary firmness reasonably would be chilled by the government conduct in light of the circumstances presented in the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v.

Latson testified that for several days after he was conditionally pardoned, his privileges were limited and his personal property was taken from him. He did not initially have access to books or other stimuli. I find that Latson has proffered evidence tending to show that placing him in restrictive housing, revoking his privileges, and taking his personal property from him would chill the speech of an ordinary person in his circumstances. He has thus satisfied the second element of First Amendment retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Latson must also show that but for his exercise of his First Amendment rights, Watson and Clarke would not have revoked his privileges and placed him in restrictive housing following his pardon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartman v.

On this element, Latson's claim fails. He has not produced evidence sufficient to rebut Watson's testimony that she placed Latson in administrative segregation for his own protection until she could secure a full wing for him to occupy while he awaited release from MCTC. The record contains evidence that other VDOC inmates at different facilities who were pardoned were also placed in isolation while awaiting release and that the general practice was to house pardoned individuals by themselves for their protection. While Watson made the decision to remove Latson from general detention upon his conditional pardon, Lyons recommended on January 22, 2015, two days later, that Latson remain in general detention until his release, for his safety. Aside from Latson's testimony suggesting that certain guards did not like him, mistreated him at various points during his time at MCTC, and were skeptical of the extent of his disabilities, there is no record evidence suggesting that anyone - particularly the defendants here, Watson or Clarke - had any motive to retaliate against Latson for communicating with Greenman, his mother, or the Governor. He simply cannot satisfy the but-for causation requirement for First Amendment retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Because Latson has failed to adduce evidence sufficient to satisfy the causation requirement of a First Amendment retaliation claim, the defendants are entitled to\n   qualified immunity on Count Five, and I will grant their Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 180, is GRANTED.
