Before the Court are Plaintiff's Motions for Attorney Fees and Expenses Pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). (Docket nos. 34, 42.) Defendant responded to Plaintiff's Motions (docket nos. 40, 46), and Plaintiff replied to Defendant's Responses (docket nos. 41, 47).

The Motions have been referred to the undersigned for a report and recommendation pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B).

REPORT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed Title II and Title XVI applications for a period of disability, disability insurance benefits, and supplemental security income on May 1, 2006, alleging disability beginning February 1, 2006, due to \"left/leg/knee/foot problems.\" (TR 201, 326-37 358.) The Social Security Administration denied Plaintiff's claims on July 22, 2006, and Plaintiff filed a timely request for a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing. (TR 196-97, 222-24.) On June 6, 2008, Plaintiff appeared with a representative and testified at the hearing before Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Kathryn D. Burgchardt. (TR 161-94, 209.) In a December 1, 2008 decision, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not entitled to benefits because he was capable of performing a significant number of jobs in the national economy. (TR 201-09.) The Appeals Council reviewed and vacated ALJ Burgchardt's decision on the basis that the decision did not contain an adequate evaluation of Plaintiff's mental impairments ; the ALJ's assessment of Plaintiff's residual functional capacity (RFC) was not consistent with the record evidence and/or made in accordance with the Social Security\n   Regulations; and the decision did not explain how Plaintiff could perform the jobs set forth by the vocational expert (VE) with the limitations listed in Plaintiff's RFC. (TR 211-13.) The Appeals Council remanded Plaintiff's case to an ALJ with instructions to resolve the above-cited issues by obtaining physical and mental consultative examinations for Plaintiff, further develop Plaintiff's vocational abilities, and obtain updated medical records and evidence from a medical expert as appropriate. (TR 212-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On remand, Plaintiff appeared with a representative and testified at a hearing before ALJ Oksana Xenos on August 10, 2011. (TR 131-60.) In a September 7, 2011 decision, ALJ Xenos found that Plaintiff was not entitled to benefits because he was capable of performing a significant number of jobs in the national economy. (TR 116-26.) The Appeals Council declined to review ALJ Xenos's decision (TR 1-7), and Plaintiff filed a timely complaint for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 15), and Defendant filed a cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 20). On February 17, 2015, the undersigned recommended that Plaintiff's Motion be granted in part, Defendant's Motion be denied, and that the matter be remanded to the Commissioner pursuant to sentence four of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). (Docket no. 23.) The District Judge subsequently issued an order on March 24, 2015 adopting in part and rejecting in part the Report and Recommendation, denying Plaintiff's Motion, granting Defendant's Motion, and dismissing Plaintiff's cause of action with prejudice; the Judge also entered a judgment in favor of Defendant. (Docket nos. 26, 27.) Plaintiff appealed, and on January 29, 2016, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the judgment of the district court with instructions to remand the matter to the Commissioner for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081837\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/825/\">\n    811 F.3d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, in a November 15, 2016 decision, ALJ Joy Turner found that Plaintiff had been under a disability as defined in the Social Security Act since February 1, 2006, the alleged onset date. (Docket no. 43-2 at 7-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff has filed two Motions for Attorney Fees and Expenses, seeking a total of $41,448.11 in fees and $1,468.85 in expenses under the EAJA. (Docket nos. 34, 42.) Plaintiff's counsel has also filed a Motion seeking an award of $27,123.25 in attorney fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

EAJA Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The EAJA provides that a court will award attorney fees and expenses to a prevailing party (other than the United States) in any civil action brought against the United States, unless the court finds that the position of the government was substantially justified or that special circumstances exist that would make an award unjust.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). The Act also provides that the attorney fees awarded may not be at a rate of more than $125.00 per hour, unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living, or some other special factor, justifies a higher fee. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A). The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff filed his first Motion for EAJA fees in a timely manner in accordance with \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) or that Plaintiff is a prevailing party under \u00a7 2412.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shalala v.

Defendant does contend, however, that the government's position in this matter was substantially justified, that Plaintiff's second Motion for EAJA fees is untimely, and that even if an award of fees\n   is appropriate, Plaintiff's requested fees are excessive.

Specifically, Defendant argues that a final judgment for purposes of the EAJA means a judgment entered by a court that terminates the civil action, which, in this civil action, is the Sixth Circuit's Opinion and Judgment, because the Sixth Circuit remanded the matter pursuant to sentence four of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) and thereby terminated the civil action in Plaintiff's favor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7.) Defendant asserts that the Sixth Circuit's\n   January 29, 2016 Opinion and Judgment became final after the applicable ninety-day appeal period, and the time for Plaintiff to file a motion for EAJA fees expired thirty days after that, on May 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff's January 12, 2017 Motion for EAJA fees is therefore untimely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff replies that it is unclear whether the Sixth Circuit's Opinion and Judgment falls under sentence four or sentence six of \u00a7 405(g), so he filed his first motion for EAJA fees soon after the Sixth Circuit's Opinion and Judgment issued in the event that it was a remand under sentence four, and he filed his second motion after the ALJ's final decision on remand in the event that it was a remand under sentence six. (Docket no. 47 at 1-4.) Conversely, Plaintiff asserts in both of his motions that \"[t]his is a Section 4 remand because the court did not retain jurisdiction.\" (Docket no. 34 at 4; docket no. 42 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses under the EAJA must submit an application to the court \"within thirty days of final judgment in the action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B).

Accordingly, ALJ Turner's November 15, 2016 decision is not a \"final judgment\" under the EAJA because it was issued by an administrative agency, not a court of law. Thus, Plaintiff's contention that his second EAJA motion is timely because he filed it within 30 days after the appeal period for that decision expired necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The issue of whether the Sixth Circuit's January 29, 2016 Opinion and Judgment constitutes a \"final judgment\" under the EAJA requires further exploration, however, as it depends on what type of remand the Sixth Circuit ordered.

Additionally, the Sixth Circuit addressed the lack of record evidence regarding the identity of James White, a medical source who authored an opinion regarding Plaintiff's mental RFC, by declining to accept the district court's decision to introduce outside evidence to determine Mr. White's identity, and ordering the ALJ on remand to solicit additional evidence from the parties that would allow the ALJ to clarify Mr. White's identity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081837\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/825/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081837\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/825/\">\n    at 839-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Docket no. 34 at 4; docket no. 42 at 4.) When faced with Defendant's argument regarding the untimeliness of his second Motion, however, Plaintiff changes course and argues that Defendant incorrectly assumed that this case involves a sentence-four remand and that the nature of the Sixth Circuit's remand order is unclear. (Docket no. 47 at 1-4.) Plaintiff admits that the Sixth Circuit ruled on the correctness of ALJ Xenos's decision, which he asserts is suggestive of a sentence-four remand. But Plaintiff asserts that the Sixth Circuit's Opinion and Judgment also contains elements of a sentence-six remand because the Sixth Circuit remanded with instructions to obtain additional evidence regarding the identity of James White and because ALJ Turner considered newly-generated expert deposition testimony on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff's latter argument misses the mark. A sentence-six remand occurs upon a showing to the reviewing court that there is new and material evidence available and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate that evidence into the record in the prior administrative proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Here, the expert deposition testimony considered by ALJ Turner was not presented to the Sixth Circuit by Plaintiff as a basis for a sentence-six remand. And the Sixth Circuit did not remand on the basis of any new\n   and material evidence regarding James White's identity with which it had been presented; it remanded for the collection of evidence regarding James White's identity. Moreover, as discussed above, the Sixth Circuit explicitly rejected Plaintiff's request for a sentence-six remand for consideration of treatment records generated after ALJ Xenos's decision because Plaintiff did not demonstrate the materiality of that evidence. Thus, the Sixth Circuit did not order remand of this matter pursuant to sentence six of \u00a7 405(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In finding that ALJ Xenos's decision was flawed in multiple respects, the Sixth Circuit explicitly ruled on the correctness of the ALJ's decision. The Sixth Circuit's Opinion and Judgment is therefore properly characterized a sentence-four remand, and it constitutes a \"final judgment\" under the EAJA.

(Docket no. 34-4 at 2-5.) Plaintiff also provided a table in his brief that breaks down the total amount of fees that he seeks by year, hourly rate, and hours expended. (Docket no. 34 at 12.) Neither of these two hourly breakdowns specifies the total hours expended or the total dollar amount of fees requested. And after considerable time spent by the court comparing and calculating the figures in the two breakdowns, it is apparent that the total amount of hours expended do not match. Specifically, in the table, Plaintiff states that counsel expended a total of 31.90 hours in 2013, but a calculation of the hours expended in 2013 on the itemized schedule totals 31.4. Similarly, Plaintiff states that counsel spent 82.10 hours on this matter in 2015, when, according to the itemized schedule, counsel purportedly expended 85 hours. Because the itemized schedule provides greater detail of the time expended, the Court presumes that the figures within are correct.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also submitted a copy of the State Bar of Michigan's 2010 Economics of Law Practice Summary Report (docket no. 34-2) and claims that the $220.00 hourly rate of a \"sole practitioner, sharing space\" listed within supports his request for a rate increase in this matter (docket no. 34 at 10). Additionally, Plaintiff has submitted a table of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\n   Statutory Maximum Rates Under the Equal Access to Justice Act for the years 2006 through 2015, adjusted for increases in the cost of living. (Docket no. 34-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff contends that while Attorney Glotta's rate would be $300.00 to $350.00 per hour, \"the court can at least accept [and apply] the average\" of his attorney's rate and the $220.00 hourly rate of a sole practitioner, sharing space. (Docket no. 34 at 10.) Plaintiff also asserts that increases in the cost of living during the pendency of this litigation justify an enhanced attorney fee with an adjustment for inflation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, \"the combination of the average billing plus cost of living would justify $300.00 to $350.00 an hour.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff then ultimately, and inexplicably, seeks hourly rates of $187.02 for attorney work performed in 2013, $190.06 for work performed in 2014, and $190.28 for work performed in 2015 and 2016, which are the rates promulgated by the Ninth Circuit. (Docket no. 34 at 12; docket no. 34-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The arguments and evidence set forth by Plaintiff in support of an enhanced hourly rate are disjointed and internally inconsistent. Plaintiff's reasons for initially advocating for an \"average\" rate between $220.00 and $350.00 but then changing course and seeking rates significantly below that figure are perplexing. Moreover, Plaintiff does not explain how the $220.00 per hour rate of a \"sole practitioner, sharing space\" or the EAJA rates promulgated by the Ninth Circuit are \"in line with those prevailing in [\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   ] community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.\"\n   <em>\n    See Bryant,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049406\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/578/443/#p450\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, Plaintiff has not provided satisfactory evidence to support his request for a cost of living increase above the statutory rate of $125.00 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Number of Hours\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As previously noted, Plaintiff seeks attorney fees for 177.35 attorney hours of legal work on this case. (Docket no. 34; docket no. 34-4.) Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not shown that the hours expended by his counsel were reasonable. (Docket no. 40 at 11-12.) Specifically, Defendant objects to (1) the hours billed by Plaintiff's counsel stemming from counsel's failure to follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the applicable court rules; (2) the number of hours expended by Plaintiff's counsel at the district-court level; and (3) the number of hours expended at the appellate-court level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-26.) Plaintiff does not address the specific arguments raised by Defendant in this regard; instead, he generally defends the amount of time expended by his counsel by asserting that counsel's work on this matter was \"performed on the contingency of victory and therefore require[d] the most consistent and extensive expenditure of time.\" (Docket no. 41 at 6.) He further asserts that the favorable result ultimately attained in this matter is the basis for the time expended.

(Docket no. 40 at 12-16.) Under\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   , to the extent that Plaintiff's counsel spent time on this matter that would have been unnecessary absent Plaintiff's counsel's errors, that time would not be properly billed to Plaintiff, and it is not properly billed to the government under the EAJA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant specifically objects to paying fees related to counsel's failure to properly serve Defendant. (Docket no. 40 at 13.) With regard to this issue, the docket reflects that the court issued a summons for Defendant on May 22, 2013 (docket no. 6), but Plaintiff took no further action. Accordingly, on October 3, 2013, the Court ordered Plaintiff to show cause why his case should not be dismissed for failure to serve Defendant in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m). (Docket no. 7.) A week later, Plaintiff requested and was issued another summons for Defendant (docket no. 8), and after Defendant was served, Plaintiff filed a Response to the Order to Show Cause, which Order the Court subsequently vacated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket nos. 9, 10, 11.) Defendant asserts that the following billing entries are related to Plaintiff's counsel's errors in this regard and should not be compensable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 10/3/13 - Met with Plaintiff - 1.00 hour\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 10/3/13 - Prepare \"Show Cause\" and submit - 3.00 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 10/10/13 - Receipt and Review Summons - 1.00 hour\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 10/16/13 - Summons and Complaint Return of Service - 1.00 hour\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 10/17/13 - Receipt and Review Order to Vacate - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Docket no. 40 at 13.) It is not clear if counsel's meeting with Plaintiff was related to the failure to serve Defendant, so the Court will not recommend that these hours be deemed non-compensable on that basis. It is clear, however, that counsel would not have had to prepare a Response to the Court's Order to Show Cause; request, receive, and review a second summons; or receive and review the Court's Order vacating the order to show cause had Defendant been properly served after the initial summons issued. Thus, the court should not award fees associated with the 4.5 hours expended on those matters. Additionally, the hour spent reviewing the three-page Summons and Complaint Return of Service form is unreasonable and should be reduced to 0.1 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In addition, Defendant asserts that the time spent by Plaintiff's counsel related to an Errata that the Court struck pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(b)(2) because Plaintiff did not request leave to file it, the time related to Plaintiff's Motion for Extension of Time to File Response/Reply Brief, and the time spent correcting Plaintiff's appellate brief and appellate reply brief to comply with the Sixth Circuit's briefing requirements should not be compensable. (Docket no. 40 at 14-15.) Defendant asserts that the following billing entries are implicated with regard to the challenged activities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 4/6/14 - Prepare Errata with Research - 5.00 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 4/10/14 - Filed Errata - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 2/15/15 - Receipt and Review Text only order to Strike Errata - 0.50 hours\n   \u2022 4/15/14 - Prep Motion to Extend Time - 1.75 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 4/15/14 - Phone conference with Plaintiff - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 4/17/14 - Filed Motion to Extend Time - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 4/18/14 - Receipt and Review text only [order] Granting extension of time - 0.20 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 5/7/15 - Receipt and Review letter from 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 5/8/15 - Reviews and correct brief - Submit - 4.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 5/8/15 - Phone conference with Plaintiff - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 8/20/15 - Receipt and Review Briefing letter - 0.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 8/20/15 - Revise and Correct Brief - 4.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 8/21/15 - Submit Reply - 1.50 hours\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Again, at this juncture, the Court declines to recommend the denial of fees for the time that Plaintiff's counsel spent conferring with Plaintiff because it is not clear whether the telephone conferences are related to Plaintiff's counsel's failure to follow the court rules. But the Court agrees that the time spent by counsel preparing and filing an Errata without leave of court, moving for an extension of time to file a reply brief, and correcting briefing errors committed not once but twice at the appellate-court level were not reasonably expended and therefore are not properly charged to Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

According to the Court's calculation, Plaintiff's counsel expended 105.05 hours on Plaintiff's case at the district-court level and 72.30 hours on Plaintiff's case at the appellate-court level. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 34-4 at 2-5.) Defendant argues that there are no extraordinary circumstances in this case that justify billing the government for more than twice the high end of the range of reasonable hours. (Docket no. 40 at 16.) Defendant expounds that Plaintiff's counsel, by his own representation, \"is a highly experienced Social Security disability attorney who has represented social security claimants regularly and consistently since 1967;\" the issues in this case were routine; the transcript in this matter was only 573 pages; and Plaintiff's counsel was already familiar with the record prior to the district-court proceedings because he also represented Plaintiff at the administrative level.

The Court agrees and recommends that this billing entry be reduced accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022 12/16/13 - Receipt and Review Defendant's Answer - 3.25 hours. Defendant's Answer is a three-page document that contains only one page of substantive, routine text. The amount of time purportedly spent by Plaintiff's counsel in reviewing this document is extremely excessive. This billing entry should be reduced by 3 hours to 0.25 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \u2022 12/16/13 - Receipt and Review Transcript - 7.50 hours. Defendant asserts that this amount of time is unreasonable and duplicitous in light of the fact that Plaintiff's counsel also represented Plaintiff at the administrative level and was therefore well-familiar with the record in this matter. Defendant submits that \"no more than 2 hours is reasonable for an experienced Social Security attorney who represented the claimant throughout administrative proceedings to simply review a transcript of those proceedings at the district court stage.\" (Docket no. 40 at 20.) Defendant's argument is persuasive, but a thorough review of the 573-page transcript to formulate arguments for summary judgment could reasonably take more than the two hours suggested by Defendant. It is recommended that this billing entry be reduced to a reasonable 3.50 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \u2022 2/28/14 - Receipt and Review Notice of Appearance - 0.20 hours. This billing entry represents time for a clerical task and should be rejected as non-compensable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \u2022 2/28/14 - Receipt and Review Defendant's Motion to Extend - 0.30 hours and 3/31/14 - Receive and Review ExParte Motion - 0.30 hours These two five-page motions consist of two and a half pages of substantive text regarding simple requests for extensions of time. Each of these billing entries should be reduced by half to 0.15 hours each.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 4/29/15 - Telephone call from P. Sugameli Attorney for Dr. James White - 1.50 hours. Defendant asserts that the only purpose for this telephone call was to identify the medical credentials of James White and that 0.2 hours should have been more than sufficient for such a call. (Docket no. 40 at 24.) Defendant's argument holds some merit - if the medical credentials were the only purpose for the call. But there could\n   reasonably have been other purposes for the call, which the Court declines to dissect. The hours billed for this task should stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \u2022 4/30/15 - Prep Appeal Brief; Review 882 page transcript - 10.00 hours. Defendant asserts that the transcript, with which Plaintiff's counsel was already well-familiar, was actually only 573 pages, and the purported time expended for this task should be reduced accordingly. The Court recommends that the number of hours for this task be reduced by 1.00 hour.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \u2022 8/6/15 - Receipt and Review letter from 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit - 0.30 hours and 8/7/15 - Review Revised Appellee Brief - 1.50 hours Defendant explains that these two entries relate to Plaintiff's counsel's review of the Sixth Circuit's letter notifying Defendant that she needed to correct the cover page of her brief with the official caption and Plaintiff's counsel's review of Defendant's corrected brief. Defendant argues that it is \"unreasonable for Plaintiff's counsel to bill 1.8 hours for reviewing an issue concerning the case caption on the cover of the Commissioner's brief; 0.2 hours should have been sufficient.\" (Docket no. 40 at 25.) The Court agrees. Each of these billing entries should be reduced to 0.1 hours each.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \u2022 10/21/15 - Receipt and Review Brief on set date - 0.50 hours. Defendant objects to this billing entry on the basis that there was no brief submitted on this date, and Plaintiff's counsel does not explain why it was necessary to review a brief over two months after the last briefing submission in this matter. (Docket no. 40 at 25.) A review of the Sixth Circuit's docket in this matter reveals that the court issued a letter on this date notifying counsel of its determination that oral argument was not necessary and that the matter would be submitted to the court on the briefs of the parties on December 9, 2015. The billing entry at issue is presumably related to counsel's review of this short letter and should be reduced to a reasonable time of 0.10 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \u2022 1/29/2016 - Receipt and Review 20 page 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit Opinion and Order Vacating District Court for remand to SS - 3.00 hours. Defendant argues that the opinion was only 18 pages long, which means that Plaintiff's counsel purportedly and unreasonably took over 10 minutes to read each page. (Docket no. 40 at 26.) Indeed, even if Plaintiff's counsel conducted an in-depth review of the Sixth Circuit's Opinion, 3.00 hours is an excessive amount of time for an attorney with Plaintiff's counsel's experience to conduct such a review. This billing entry should be reduced to a generously reasonable time of 2.00 hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant further objects to the amount of time that counsel spent conferring and meeting with Plaintiff over the course of this case, particularly during periods of little activity. Specifically, Defendant objects to (1) 4.50 hours billed by counsel for five telephone conferences and two meetings between the filing of the Complaint in April 2013 and the filing of Defendant's Answer in December 2013; (2) 2.00 hours spent conferring with Plaintiff in March and April 2014; (3) 9.85 hours of attorney time for nineteen separate telephone calls, meetings, and conferences with Plaintiff between April 24, 2014 and February 17, 2015, where the only activity in this matter was the two text-only orders regarding\n   reassignment of the District Judge; and (4) 4.00 hours of time spent for seven conferences with Plaintiff between September 2015 and January 2016, where the only activity during this time was the Sixth Circuit's October 2015 letter notifying counsel that it would issue its ruling on the briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   An independent review of the itemized billing schedule submitted by Plaintiff reveals that counsel conferred with Plaintiff either in person or via telephone 49 times for a total of 31.65 hours during the pendency of this matter at the district-and appellate-court levels, which spanned just short of three years. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 34-4 at 2-5.) It is not the Court's role or desire to scrutinize the manner or frequency in which Plaintiff's counsel manages his client relationships. Nevertheless, the majority of counsel's conferences with Plaintiff occurred either monthly or semi-monthly for 30 to 60 minutes at a time during periods of little to no activity in this matter,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , during which periods no more than a brief status update would have been necessary. Neither Plaintiff nor Plaintiff's counsel provides an explanation regarding the reasonableness of the 31.65 hours billed for the 49 conferences, so Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden in this regard. And without such an explanation, the Court finds that the frequency and length of the conferences, particularly during the periods of no activity, was excessive. Therefore, it is recommended that the 31.65 hours counsel spent conferring with Plaintiff be reduced by 25% to 23.75 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Lastly, Defendant objects to the 48.75 hours billed by Plaintiff's counsel for conducting legal research, preparing Plaintiff's motion and brief in support of summary judgment, reviewing Defendant's cross-motion and brief, preparing Plaintiff's reply brief, reviewing the Report and Recommendation, preparing objections thereto, reviewing Defendant's objections, and reviewing the district court's seven-page Order. (Docket no. 40 at 22.) Defendant points out that the time expended for these activities alone are greater than the high end of the 20-40 hour range recognized as reasonable by the Sixth Circuit for work on Social Security appeals at the district-court level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.) Defendant argues that the amount of time expended is \"unreasonable for a routine Social Security appeal, with routine issues, litigated by an attorney with extensive experience representing Social Security claimants who represented Plaintiff throughout the administrative proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) As noted above, Plaintiff's general argument in response is that the favorable result achieved by Plaintiff's counsel is the basis for the time expended. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 41 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiff's argument is unconvincing and unsupported. A favorable result does not necessarily correlate with or justify the number of attorney hours expended on a matter - especially when the number of hours is unreasonable. Again, Court is not inclined to scrutinize every billing entry challenged by Defendant in this regard. Nevertheless, the time spent by Plaintiff's counsel on the following the tasks is plainly excessive: (1) review of the Court's 22-page Report and Recommendation - 3.00 hours; (2) review of Defendant's objections to the Report and Recommendation (which consist of 2 pages of substantive text) - 2.00 hours; and (3) review of the court's 7-page Order - 2.00 hours. It is therefore recommended that the billing entries for these tasks be reduced to 2.00 hours, 0.25 hours, and 0.50 hours, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To summarize, it is recommended that Plaintiff's request for attorney fees for 177.35 attorney hours of legal work be denied with respect to 59.75 of those hours and that Plaintiff be awarded attorney fees\n   for only 117.60 attorney hours of legal work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks $490.08 for the expenses he incurred in pursuing his claim for disability from June 2008 through February 2016. (Docket no. 34 at 12-14.) But fees and expenses incurred in administrative proceedings conducted prior to the filing of a civil action are not compensable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melkonyan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107763\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/89/#p96\">\n    501 U.S. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107763\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/89/#p96\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff's schedule of expenses indicates that Plaintiff incurred charges of $104.10 on May 2, 2014, $41.90 on April 15, 2015, and $100.00 on February 3, 2016, all for the use of the court's electronic records access service, PACER.

Second, the Court finds that a windfall would not occur in this matter if the requested fees were awarded. Plaintiff's attorneys are experienced and established social security attorneys; notably, Attorney Glotta has over fifty years of experience in representing Social Security claimants at all stages of litigation, including the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; he has attended numerous seminars related to the representation of Social Security claimants; and he has been invited to lecture\n   regarding the same. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 43-3 at 2.) Moreover, Attorney Glotta asserts that 228.25\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   attorney hours were spent on this matter at the federal-court level and informs that Plaintiff was awarded $81,369.75 in past-due benefits. (Docket no. 43 at 1; docket no. 43-3 at 5-9.) Twenty-five percent of those past-due benefits, $20,342.44,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   when divided by 228.25 hours of work, would be equivalent to an hourly rate of approximately $89.00, which, under\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   , is reasonable and not a windfall. Furthermore, Plaintiff does not contest the amount of attorney fees requested by his counsel. Accordingly, it is recommended that attorney fees be awarded to Plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $20,342.44 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \"Congress harmonized fees payable by the Government under EAJA with fees payable under \u00a7 406(b) out of the claimant's past-due Social Security benefits in this manner: fee awards may be made under both prescriptions, but the claimant's attorney must 'refun[d] to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    535 U.S. at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the court should (1)\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's first Motion for Attorney Fees and Expenses Pursuant to the EAJA (docket no. 34), and award Plaintiff $14,946.00 in attorney fees and expenses; (2)\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's second Motion for Attorney Fees and Expenses Pursuant to the EAJA (docket no. 42); and (3)\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Attorney's Motion for an Award of Attorney Fees Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (docket no. 43), and award counsel $20,342.44 in attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     REVIEW OF REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Either party to this action may object to and seek review of this Report and Recommendation, but must act within fourteen (14) days of service of a copy hereof as provided for in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and E.D.

But while the Social Security Administration withheld $27,123.25 from Plaintiff's past-due benefits in order to pay any attorney fees (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    docket no. 43-2 at 15), $27,123.25 is actually thirty-three percent of Plaintiff's $81,369.75 in past-due benefits. As stated above, Plaintiff's counsel is only entitled to twenty-five percent of Plaintiff's past-due benefits, in the amount of $20,342.44.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
