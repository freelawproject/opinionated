Plaintiffs maintain that the present regulatory regimen poses a substantial obstacle to the provision of abortion services, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They allege that contemporary abortion procedures, even for second trimester abortions, are extremely safe and that resulting complications necessitating advanced medical care are rare. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin enforcement of related licensing provisions, oversight regulations, and statutes, along with state criminal laws enacted to enforce these provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Amended Complaint (ECF No. 41) names an expansive field of public officials as Defendants, encompassing almost all associated regulatory agencies, as well as commonwealth's attorneys in jurisdictions where facilities providing abortion services are located.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Presently before the Court is a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 20), filed by the Attorney General of Virginia on behalf of all Defendants, except Robert Tracci, Commonwealth's Attorney for Albemarle County, who chose to file his own Motion to Dismiss and supporting memorandum (ECF Nos. 22, 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants seek dismissal of all counts under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). Both sides have submitted memoranda supporting their respective positions. The Court heard oral argument on Defendants' Motions on September 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To facilitate analysis of the individual claims, the original four Plaintiffs, Falls Church Medical Center, LLC; Whole Woman's Health Alliance; All Women's Richmond, Inc.; and Virginia League for Planned Parenthood, will be referred to as \"abortion providers\" and Dr. Jane Doe will be referred to as \"Dr. Doe.\" Where appropriate, the Plaintiffs collectively will simply be referred to as \"Plaintiffs.\" This distinction will be particularly significant in the analysis of the standing issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By way of historical context, Plaintiffs chronicle the administrative and legislative development of what they argue are constitutionally offensive obstacles to a woman's right to seek an abortion in Virginia. According to Plaintiffs, although abortions\n   in Virginia have been regulated since 1848, the genesis of the regulatory scheme at issue was a statutory amendment adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in 2011. \"In March 2011, the Legislature amended an existing statute governing the regulation of 'hospitals, nursing homes, and certified nursing facilities' by adding a sentence requiring VBH [Virginia Board of Health] to regulate any medical facility that provides as few as five first trimester abortions in a month as a type of 'hospital.'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032.1-127\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 32.1-127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(1).\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 67.) As a result, Plaintiffs contend that facilities providing first trimester abortion services were required to comply with a wide swath of restrictive regulations. These mandates dictated strict standards for construction, staffing, equipment, enhanced training, infection prevention, and facility security. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, as a result of its enhanced regulatory responsibilities, the VBH promulgated a host of codified requirements governing abortion facilities. These requirements included enhanced recordkeeping, personnel and staffing requirements, restrictions on employment of physicians not licensed to practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia, periodic inspections by the Virginia Department of Health (\"VDH\"), including allowing such inspectors to review patient records, and requiring staff to provide certain medical information to patients prior to administering an abortion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Plaintiffs challenge these restrictive requirements as oppressive and calculated to unjustifiably limit women's access to abortion facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs also focus their challenge on several other regulatory measures which, they allege, VDH adopted in response to legislation enacted in 1975. That legislation requires abortions performed during the second trimester of pregnancy to be carried out in a licensed hospital.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-73\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, any such procedure must be performed in a facility that qualifies and meets the regulatory requirements of an outpatient surgical hospital. Plaintiffs argue that the onerous regulatory requirements governing outpatient surgical hospitals \"are wholly inappropriate\" for safe abortion procedures and constitute a restraint on access to them. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs also take issue with \u00a7 18.2-72 of the Virginia Code, adopted in 1975, the so-called \"Physician-Only Law,\" which exempts only licensed physicians from Virginia's general criminal ban on abortion. Plaintiffs contend that this piece of legislation unjustifiably limits \"the pool of abortion providers, even while advanced practice clinicians (\"APCs\")-including licensed nurse practitioners, CNMs, and physician assistants-safely and routinely provide abortion care, including medication and aspiration abortion, in other states throughout the country.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs question the so-called \"Two-Trip Mandatory Delay Law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-76\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)-(C), as another example of the statutory scheme \"restricting abortion while targeting, marginalizing, and impeding the healthcare professionals\n   who provide abortion care as well as the patients who seek it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) This statutory provision\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   requires a pregnant person seeking an abortion to undergo a mandatory ultrasound and then delay their abortion for at least 24 hours, unless they live at least 100 miles from where the abortion is to be performed, in which case the delay is reduced to two hours.... [T]his requirement mandates two separate trips to a facility: one for an ultrasound and the second for an abortion. The law also requires providers to verbally offer patients the chance to view the ultrasound image, receive a printed copy, and listen to fetal heart tones, and then to obtain written certification of whether the patient declined or accepted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-76\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)-(C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a related statutory provision targeted by Plaintiffs, women seeking abortion care are required to receive information concerning the procedure to enable them to provide informed consent. Women receiving such information must then wait at least 24 hours thereafter before obtaining an abortion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-76\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A), (D). The Two-Trip Mandatory Delay Law and the informed-consent-information requirement were enacted by the Virginia General Assembly in 2001, and the ultrasound requirement was adopted in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2001 Va. Acts chs. 473, 477; 2012 Va. Acts ch. 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge is framed in an eight-count Amended Complaint which contends that these regulatory and statutory provisions are overly burdensome and medically unnecessary in light of more modem, advanced procedures that are utilized to carry out abortions. Counts I through V, premised on different theories, allege violations of \"Substantive Due Process - Rights to Liberty and Privacy,\" including Licensing Statute, Licensing Regulations, Hospital Requirement, Physician-Only Law, and Two-Trip Mandatory Delay Law, respectively. Count VI, styled \"Substantive Due Process - Cumulative Burden,\" is a composite claim comprised of the collective effect of the regulations and laws at issue in Counts I through V. Count VII alleges that \"[t]he Hospital Requirement, in conjunction with the Criminalization Laws, is unconstitutionally vague and violates Plaintiffs' rights to due process ....\" (Am. Comp. \u00b6 266.) Finally, Count VIII focuses on provisions of the Licensing Regulations which permit \"at least biennial unannounced, warrantless inspections of Plaintiffs' facilities under threat of license suspension or revocation, in the absence of probable cause to believe that any violation has occurred.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268.) Plaintiffs allege that such an inspection violates the Fourth Amendment. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants urge the Court to dismiss Counts I, II, IV, V, VI, and VIII under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Counts III and VII under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of Article III standing. Alternatively, with respect to Count II, challenging the licensing regulations, the Defendants urge the Court to abstain from action and dismiss that count without prejudice in light of ongoing state, judicial, and administrative proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court's review of a motion to dismiss filed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is both informed and constrained by the well-pleaded facts contained\n   in the Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The task at hand is to determine the sufficiency of the complaint, \"not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Republican Party of N.C. v.

In considering a motion to dismiss, plaintiff's well-pleaded allegations are taken as true, and the complaint must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    T.G.

Legal conclusions, however, enjoy no such deference by the reviewing court.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Although Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) only requires \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" to survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny, a complaint must contain \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

With respect to Count III, which challenges the requirement under \u00a7 18.2-73 that second trimester abortions be performed in a hospital setting, subject to stringent licensing requirements, Defendants rejoin that each Plaintiff facility statutorily qualifies as a hospital. \"Each plaintiff is a facility licensed pursuant to Article I of Chapter 5 of Title 32.1, and each plaintiff is a facility in which the primary function is the provision of diagnosis, of treatment, and of medical and nursing services, surgical or nonsurgical, for two or more nonrelated individuals.\" (Defs.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In further support of this contention, Defendants draw the Court's attention to a 2010 opinion of the Attorney General of Virginia concluding that the definition of \"hospital,\" as articulated in Title 32.1, encompasses facilitates in which abortions are performed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While this definition may apply to the abortion providers, it would not appear to include newly-added Dr. Doe, a physician board certified in obstetrics and gynecology. Dr. Doe's practice includes pre-viability abortion care (Am. Compl. \u00b6 23), but her practice is not licensed as a hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While Defendants \"do not dispute the [P]laintiffs' standing to challenge the regulations or their statutory designation as a hospital,\" they reason that if Plaintiffs are not subject to prosecution under \u00a7 18.2-36, they have suffered no injury in fact. (Defs.' Reply Mot. Dismiss 7, ECF No. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Whether the alleged injury in this case, either actual or imminent, is quantitatively sufficient to satisfy Article III turns on more than simply the threat of prosecution. Plaintiffs argue that the injury resulting from the so-called \"hospital requirement\" for second trimester abortions includes the financially-prohibitive cost and inconvenience of complying with regulatory requirements. \"Plaintiffs allege that they would have to expend significant resources to meet the Certificate of Public Need (COPN) and facility design and construction standards required to obtain an Outpatient Surgical Center license\" and meet the statutory definition of a hospital. (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 22, ECF No. 25.) According to Plaintiffs, if they provided second trimester abortion care in their facilities as currently constituted,\n   \"they would face loss of licensure and risk civil fines and criminal prosecution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To demonstrate standing, Plaintiffs must show actual or imminent injury which is not merely speculative or hypothetical.\n   <em>\n    Benham v. City of Charlotte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4029378\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/129/#p135\">\n    635 F.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (4th Cir. 2011). To establish the requisite case or controversy, a \"plaintiff must satisfy the three requirements that combine to form the 'irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.' Specifically, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) it has 'suffered an injury in fact'; (2) there exists a 'causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of'; and (3) a favorable judicial ruling will 'likely' redress that injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Va. ex rel.

This often requires the development of a particularized record assessing the impact of a statute or regulation on a specific jurisdiction.

Plaintiffs' overarching contention is that Virginia's regulatory scheme violates the Fourteenth Amendment because it imposes an undue burden on the right to choose abortion prior to viability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Count I focuses on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032.1-127\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 32.1-127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B)(1). In pertinent part, this statute provides that \"facilities in which five or more first trimester abortions per month are performed shall be classified as a category of 'hospital.' \" \u00a7 32.1-127(B)(1)(v). According to Plaintiffs, this classification triggers a host of oppressive regulatory requirements \"governing management, personnel, recordkeeping, counseling, testing, [and] equipment....\" (Am. Comp. \u00b6 103.) In addition, implementing regulations require abortion facilities to adopt organizational bylaws, a quality improvement committee, and to submit to annual compliance inspection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117-119.) Count II challenges the allegedly unjustified burden imposed by the licensing regulations, while Count III impugns the necessity for abortion providers to comply with certain hospital regulations as a condition of licensure. Plaintiffs argue that such rigid regulations lack any medical justification because abortion is \"a safe outpatient procedure, with extremely low complication rates, that does not need to be performed in a sterile field.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.) \"[N]o incision is required, and general anesthesia is not used.... [It] entails only the oral administration of medications.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.)

Mem. Supp. Mot.

They add that major medical associations \"reject the notion that all second trimester abortions should be performed in hospitals or Surgical Centers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.)

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Mazurek\n   </em>\n   also pointed out that forty other states in the nation had similar laws restricting the performance of abortions to licensed physicians.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n    520 U.S. at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of additional relevance to the immediate case, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Mazurek\n   </em>\n   noted that \"the only extant study comparing the complication\n   rates for first-trimester abortions performed by [physician-assistants] with those for first-trimester abortions performed by physicians found no significant difference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n    at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But this line of argument is tempered somewhat by\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   itself. In the course of upholding the physician-only requirement at issue in that case, the Supreme Court emphasized that \"[o]ur cases reflect the fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others.\"\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    505 U.S. at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). However, as mentioned above, a significant issue bypassed in\n   <em>\n    Mazurek\n   </em>\n   was the possible effect of compelling evidence of a substantial obstacle to abortion posed by a physician-only requirement.\n   <em>\n    Mazurek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n    520 U.S. at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11653646\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/968/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Supreme Court has consistently cautioned that states have significant latitude to enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. However, as the Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   , \"[U]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    505 U.S. at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Therefore, in the context of an as-applied analysis, the door remains slightly ajar as to whether the physician-only law in Virginia places an undue burden on the fundamental right to choose an abortion prior to viability. Otherwise, from a facial perspective, the physician-only requirement rests on firm precedential terrain. Thus, Count IV survives Rule 12(b)(6) as-applied review and may proceed on that particular footing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Count V, styled as \"Two-Trip Mandatory Delay Law,\" focuses on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-76\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this statutory provision, women seeking an abortion \"are forced to undergo a mandatory ultrasound and then delay their abortion at least 24 hours, unless they live at least 100 miles from the facility where the abortion is to be performed, in which case the delay is reduced to two hours.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 208.) Plaintiffs maintain that the mandatory ultrasound, coupled with the 24-hour delay, is both medically unnecessary and imposes an undue burden on abortion access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 209.) In Plaintiffs' view, the ultrasound provisions required under \u00a7 18.2-76 are unnecessary to ascertain gestational age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 211.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that Virginia's informed consent materials, mandated by statute, are both unnecessary and factually inaccurate. They also point out that physicians, such as Dr. Doe, are subject to civil fines, pursuant to \u00a7 18.2-76(G) for failure to provide this information to their patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 227.) In reply, the Defendants emphasize that simply because a procedure is medically unnecessary does not mean that it poses an undue burden. The Defendants argue that none of the procedures questioned in Count V rise to the level of a substantial obstacle to abortion access. Furthermore, the results of the ultrasound are necessary, in Defendants' view, to determine gestational age, which guides the physician in determining\n   the appropriate procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court is mindful that states have significant latitude to enact regulations to further the health and safety of a woman seeking an abortion, provided they do not impose an undue burden on that right. The requirement that a woman seeking an abortion submit to an ultrasound to enable the physician to ascertain the developmental stage of the fetus, does not appear facially to pose an undue burden. Likewise, the receipt of informed consent information would not appear to pose a substantial obstacle. However, it is conceivable that some other procedures necessitated by \u00a7 18.2-76, in concert, could potentially do so, especially the 24-hour delay. That determination, however, raises factual issues beyond the boundaries of the Amended Complaint. At this stage, viewing all well-pleaded facts in the Plaintiffs' favor, Count V presents a plausible as-applied claim. Whether it presents a triable issue must await the development of a more complete factual record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Viewed in the context of Plaintiffs' exhaustive Amended Complaint, Count VI - Substantive Due Process - Cumulative Burden, appears to articulate a theory of proof as opposed to a substantive claim. Essentially, it urges the Court to assess the collective burden imposed by the statutes and regulations at issue in the other counts in determining whether they pose a substantial obstacle to the fundamental right to choose abortion before viability. As the Defendants emphasized during oral argument, this type of freestanding, collective claim is unfamiliar to abortion jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs are, of course, free to argue the collective impact of the statutes and regulations at issue as they affect the burden imposed by each claim. They will not, however, be considered a separate claim for relief. Therefore, Plaintiffs' Count VI will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Count VII is a skeletally pleaded claim that \"[t]he Hospital Requirement, in conjunction with the Criminalization Laws, is unconstitutionally vague and violates Plaintiffs' rights to due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it fails to define the terms 'hospital' and 'second trimester of pregnancy.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 266.) While even the Defendants agree that Virginia's abortion statutes need some refinement, and are not a model of clarity, they provide ample guidance as to what statutorily constitutes a hospital\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the \"second trimester of pregnancy,\" a medical term of art. (Defs.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 7.) Inevitably, the definition of these terms will be addressed during the course of this litigation, but Count VII, based on the present record, fails to state an actionable constitutional claim of vagueness warranting relief under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Count VIII of the Amended Complaint alleges that Virginia's Licensing Regulations violate the Fourth Amendment by subjecting Plaintiffs to \"biennial unannounced, warrantless inspections....\" (Am. Compl. H 268.) The regulatory provision in question,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20Va.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-412-90\">\n    12 Va. Admin.

Defendants contend that the inspections under the Licensing Regulations are constitutional because they are conducted pursuant to an owner's consent or a valid warrant. However, either by omission or design, Defendants' memoranda in support of their Motions to Dismiss fail to mention the potential revocation or suspension that facility owners face if they withhold consent to an inspection.
