Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Robert Gordon moves to suppress evidence derived from an illegal search as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In a previous order, this Court suppressed evidence seized on August 27, 2017, when officers from the Southfield Police Department (\"SPD\") entered Defendant's hotel room without a search warrant while responding to a report that a 16-year-old girl (\"MV1 [Minor Victim -1]\") was inside the room with Defendant, a 45-year-old man unknown to her parents. The officers knocked on the door several times, but no one answered. Using a key provided to them by the hotel's front desk clerk, the officers entered the room. They found the Defendant and MV-1 inside and seized electronic devices belonging to Defendant. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence found on those devices, and the motion was\n   granted by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Suppress, Dkt. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   But that was not all of the evidence in this case. Also seized at the time of the illegal entry into the hotel room was the cell phone belonging to MV-1. Further, in the days following the hotel room search, police came into possession of a second cell phone that MV-1 had previously used, as well as additional evidence seized during a subsequent search of defendant's home and vehicle. Defendant moves now to suppress both of MV-1's cell phones, as well as all evidence seized from his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons outlined below, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At around 3:00 a.m. in the morning on August 27, 2016, parents of 16-year-old \"MV-1\" called 911 to inform officers that they received information their daughter was at the Marvin's Garden Inn in Southfield, Michigan. (\"Marvin's Garden\" or \"the hotel\"). Although MV-1 told her parents that she would be spending the night at a friend's house, she was actually at the hotel with a 45-to-50 year old man from Indiana named \"Robert.\" Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   MV-1's parents had never heard of \"Robert\" and did not know who he was. According to the government, Marvin's Garden Inn is a hotel \"well-known to the officers for sex trafficking, drugs, and violence.\" Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Four Southfield Police Officers met MV-1's parents in the hotel parking lot. Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 41; Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 62, 64. Believing MV-1 was with an unknown older man from Indiana, police officers observed an orange Chevrolet HHR with an Indiana license plate parked in the hotel parking lot. After running the license plate in their database, the officers learned that the vehicle belonged to the Defendant, Robert Donald Gordon-a white, 45-year-old male from Logansport, Indiana. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 64. Based on that information, the officers talked to the hotel clerk and learned that Gordon had checked into room # 103 earlier that afternoon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Using their steel batons, the officers loudly struck the hotel room's steel front door and the room's glass window for \"five to ten minutes\" but no one answered. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 41. They yelled \"Southfield Police\" and \"Open the door,\" but did not hear any noise whatsoever from within the room. Transcript, Motion to Suppress Hearing, Feb. 20, 2018, Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 154-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Getting no answer, the officers went back to the front desk, asked for a room key, and waited for the arrival of their Sergeant. After the Sergeant arrived, they returned to the room and again used their batons to pound on the door while they announced their presence as police officers. Transcript, Motion to Suppress Hearing, Feb. 20, 2018, Dkt. 22, Pg. ID 185-86.When no one answered, they used the key to enter Defendant's room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg. ID 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once in the room, the officers encountered Defendant sitting on the bed. Defendant informed the officers that MV-1 was\n   in the bathroom. Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 42. The officers found and escorted MV-1 out of Defendant's hotel room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 65. The officers did not arrest Defendant, but they did provide him with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Dkt. 17, Pg. ID 65. Defendant told the officers that he wanted to \"cooperate 100 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He allegedly gave law enforcement permission to search the room and all of his belongings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Law enforcement searched the room and seized a number of pieces of personal electronic property belonging to defendant, and a pink and white Samsung phone that belonged to MV-1. Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next day, MV-1's father contacted police and informed them that he found an old cell phone that belonged to MV-1 when she was 15 years old. Officers took this device and its passcode from MV-1's father, and obtained a search warrant the following day to examine its contents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The affidavit for the search warrants to examine the contents of both of MV-1's phones rested solely on evidence gathered from within the hotel room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sealed Exh., Dkt. 31, Pg. ID 328-36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two days later, Defendant was arrested at his place of work for alleged violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 2422(b), and 2252A(a)(5)(B). See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gordon\n   </em>\n   , 17-mj-30443-DUTY, Dkt. 1 (sealed). He was later charged in a seven-count indictment alleging four counts of production of child pornography, one count of coercion and enticement of a minor, one count of interstate travel with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, and one count of possession of child pornography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14, Pg. ID 37. After being arrested, defendant was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, signed a waiver of those rights, and also signed a form giving police consent to search his home and vehicle. Unbeknownst to him at the time, police had already obtained a warrant to search his home. It is unknown whether the search was actually being conducted pursuant to the warrant before, or after, Defendant gave his consent. As with the affidavits regarding MV-1's cell phones, the affidavit supporting the application for a warrant to search defendant's home and vehicle rested\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on evidence obtained in the hotel search-evidence which the court later found was illegally seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant moves to suppress derivative evidence, challenging both of MV-1's cell phones and any evidence seized during the search of Defendant's home, as \"fruit of the poisonous tree\"-that is, stemming from the unconstitutional search and seizure at the hotel.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202251\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant argues that all of the evidence obtained by police should be suppressed, and also that the arrest of defendant was illegal for lack of probable cause. The government responds that not only was the evidence collected in the days after the illegal entry (MV-1's old cell phone, and the items from the home search) admissible under the independent source and inevitable discovery doctrines, but also that MV-1's cell phone collected at the hotel was not suppressed by this court's first order, because it was handed over voluntarily outside of the hotel room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Having already decided that the hotel room search violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights and that evidence seized in that hotel search must be excluded, the Court now considers the question of what to do with evidence not necessarily seized\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the illegal search of the hotel room, but acquired later by police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Not everything acquired in the subsequent investigation by the police is automatically considered \"fruit of the poisonous tree\". Later-acquired evidence may be admissible under the independent source doctrine, the inevitable discovery doctrine, the defendant's later knowing and voluntary consent to a search of his home, or some other reason. In addition, the government contends that MV-1's cell phone seized on the night of the illegal search was located on her person and handed voluntarily to police in the parking lot of the hotel, as opposed to seized inside of the hotel room, and therefore should not be suppressed. We discuss each of these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Applying the above standards, the Court will consider each category of evidence individually-MV-1's cell phone seized at the time of the hotel room search, MV-1's prior cell phone with a cracked screen, and items seized during the execution of a search warrant at Gordon's home-to assess whether it is a fruit of the poisonous tree, and, if it is, whether any exception to the exclusionary rule applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. MV-1's Cell Phone Seized at the Hotel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   MV-1's cell phone was taken from her\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the hotel search. The affidavit for a search warrant of this phone states unambiguously: \"The One white Samsung Galaxy S5 cell phone contained in a wallet case with butterflies on the cover\n   <em>\n    was located in room 103\n   </em>\n   of Marvin's Gardens at 27650 Northwestern Hwy in the City of Southfield.\" Dkt. 28-2, Gov't Exh. A, Pg. ID 308 (emphasis added). No extensive analysis is necessary to determine that, as primary evidence seized during an illegal search, this phone is properly excluded, especially since this Court already undertook that analysis in its prior order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This\n   evidence was excluded by the Court's prior Order because \"the officers here took purposeful and independent actions: they deliberately chose to enter Defendant's private hotel room without a warrant and in a scenario lacking exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless entry,\" Op. and Order, Dkt. 20, Pg. ID 138. The phone was not discovered from an independent source-it was seized during the course of the illegal search. The phone would not have been inevitably discovered-there was no other line of investigation occurring at that time, except for the illegal search. There was no sufficient attenuation from the illegal search, as the illegal search was still occurring when this phone was seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   MV-1's cell phone seized at the hotel was properly excluded by this Court's previous Order, because that cell phone was primary evidence seized during an illegal search, and no exceptions to the exclusionary rule were present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. MV-1's Old Cell Phone\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Unlike MV-1's cell phone seized at the hotel, her old phone-the one her father turned into the police that had a cracked screen-was not discovered at the scene of the hotel. Rather, her father discovered this phone at his home, and called police the next day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sealed Exh., Dkt. 31, Pg. ID 335; Sealed Exh., Dkt. 32, Pg. ID 389. He informed police that he activated the phone and observed text messages between MV-1 and Gordon.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276422\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/586/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Police told MV-1's father to turn the phone off and bring it to the station, which he did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276422\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/586/#p591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   MV-1's father also informed police at this time that his daughter admitted she had sexual intercourse with Defendant three times previously, when she was only 15-years-old.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 28, Pg. ID 290.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court must determine whether this phone constitutes derivative evidence. This cell phone is tangible evidence that was acquired as an indirect result of the unlawful search-insomuch as the events of that early morning tipped the father off as to the evidentiary value of the old phone-and it was obtained very soon after the illegal search, such that the connection to the illegal search had not been sufficiently attenuated. For these reasons, the second cell phone is derivative evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murray v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775229\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/533/#p536\">\n    487 U.S. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775229\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/533/#p536\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775229\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/533/#p536\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   If the second phone is indeed evidence derived from the primary illegality, the next consideration is whether it should be excluded, or if any of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule apply. Though it was derivative of the primary illegality, the phone was not obtained by police as a result of an investigation they were conducting,\n   nor any that they were apparently about to conduct. It was rather literally dropped into the hands of the police by the father of MV-1. This phone was obtained from a source independent of the illegality, and therefore should not be excluded.\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775229\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/533/#p536\">\n    487 U.S. at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775229\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/533/#p536\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (independent source doctrine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It is noteworthy that excluding this second cell phone would accomplish no deterrent to police misconduct: whether the officers had gone in without a warrant, entered with consent, or waited until Gordon and MV-1 eventually emerged, MV-1's father acted independently in locating and turning the second phone over to the police. Suppressing evidence that the father of a victim turns in of his own accord-after the police misconduct is over-will not deter future police misconduct because that evidence arrived independently from that misconduct; it is likely that MV-1's father would have hunted for that phone once he was aware of what he perceived to be a threat to the safety of his daughter regardless of whether the police had violated the warrant requirement. At the same time, there would be a tremendous social cost to excluding this evidence. Weighing these considerations, the Court will not exclude MV-1's old cell phone.\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597903\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2056/#p2061\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (courts are only to apply the exclusionary rule \"where its deterrence benefits outweigh its substantial social costs.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Although the government also argues that the second cell phone should not be suppressed under the inevitable discovery doctrine, this is not a situation that calls for application of that doctrine. That doctrine is more concerned with police procedures or official protocols that would invariably have been pursued and which would have inevitably yielded evidence that has been otherwise illegally obtained. The seminal inevitable discovery case is\n   <em>\n    Nix v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , which concerned a suspect's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201711\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/431/#p443\">\n    467 U.S. 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201711\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/431/#p443\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201711\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/431/#p443\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). In that case, the suspect made an inadmissible confession outside the presence of his counsel regarding the location of a deceased girl's body. A search team was already underway and moving through a field toward where she was left by the suspect. The court found that because the body would have inevitably been found by the on-going search, evidence of her body and its condition was admissible even though it had been found based on interrogation conducted outside the presence of counsel. To exclude this piece of evidence based on the Sixth Amendment violation would have put the police in a worse place than if the violation had never occurred, because the body would have been located as a result of the on-going massive search.

The two bags were mislabeled and sent to the wrong destination. The airline, upon realizing the mistake, and pursuant to their policies and procedures, attempted to open the bags to see if they contained any identifying information. The bags had locks on them, but the airline was able to open one of them, in which they discovered $176,000 in cash. They immediately reported this to the police department, who responded to the airport. There, an officer became suspicious of the second, as yet unopened bag, because he observed a strong odor emanating\n   out from within. Concerned about the possibility of explosives inside the bag, this officer had the bag x-rayed, which revealed several dense, rectangular objects that appeared metallic. The officer then used a hammer and screwdriver to break open the lock on the suitcase, discovering that those bricks were in fact drugs. Because the policy and protocol of the airline would have resulted inevitably in the discovery of the drugs, and the airline would have then contacted police, the drugs were not excluded based on the illegal search. Absent the illegality, the police would have been in exactly the same situation, and exclusion would serve no deterrent effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   court observed that the inevitable discovery doctrine applies when the government can demonstrate \"either the existence of an independent, untainted investigation that inevitably would have uncovered the same evidence or other compelling facts establishing that the disputed evidence inevitably would have been discovered.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11313052\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/494/\">\n    61 F.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (6th Cir. 1995). While it is likely that, after his daughter was recovered in such circumstances, MV-1's father would have located and turned in her old cell phone, this is not the kind of inevitability that creates an exception to the exclusionary rule. Rather, the doctrine requires something more: an independent, untainted, in-process, investigation or protocol that would have inevitably located the evidence, or\n   <em>\n    compelling\n   </em>\n   facts establishing the inevitability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no in-progress search or ongoing process that would inevitably have discovered MV-1's old cell phone. An element of happenstance attends the circumstances here: MV-1's father fortunately recalled, searched for, and found MV-1's old cell phone. That is not the kind of process-driven, investigative practice meeting the \"compelling facts\" establishing inevitability that the\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   court describes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   While it is the case that MV-1's old cell phone was discovered as a consequence of the illegal search of Defendant's hotel room, and therefore could be subject to exclusion, it is also clear that this evidence was obtained from a source independent of the illegality. MV-1's old cell phone is therefore admissible under the independent source exception to the exclusionary rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Evidence Seized from the Search of Defendant's House and Vehicle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant seeks to exclude any evidence seized from the search of his home and vehicle pursuant to a search warrant because the affidavit for the warrant relied upon illegally seized evidence. The government contends that even if the search warrant relied on evidence from the illegal hotel room search, Gordon nevertheless voluntarily consented to the search of his home. Because Gordon was Mirandized and consented to the search, the government maintains that any evidence seized from the house should not be excluded. Further, the government argues that if Gordon's consent were somehow to be\n   found invalid, the good faith exception should apply to validate the warrant's execution.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings alone do not necessarily assure that a person's consent is a product of free will such that the causal connection between the illegality and the consent is broken, and the taint dissipated.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

If Defendant's Arrest Was Pursuant to Probable Cause, His Consent May Authorize the Search of his Home\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If the search and arrest warrant affidavits lacked probable cause, evidence derived from those warrants would have to be suppressed unless either (a) there was another legal justification for the search of Defendant's house, such as consent; or, (b) the agents were justified in relying on the inadequate warrants under the good faith exception. For the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that (regardless of the infirmities of the affidavit for the arrest warrant of Defendant), the agents had probable cause to arrest Defendant. Because Defendant's arrest was upon probable cause, there was no illegality to taint his consent to search. Defendant's consent authorized the search of his home, and evidence from the search may be used even though the search warrant affidavit was inadequate. Because the Court has concluded that the evidence seized from Gordon's home is admissible, there is no need to definitively decide the question of whether the officers could have relied upon the warrants under the good faith exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    1.

If his arrest is illegal, then the consent would be an inadmissible fruit of that poisonous tree. As already mentioned, the affidavit for the arrest warrant of Gordon was solely supported by illegally obtained information. The remaining information on that arrest warrant affidavit does not support probable cause for arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   But the operable requirement for arrest is probable cause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   not the existence of a valid arrest warrant. If police have developed probable cause that a person has committed a crime, they are authorized to make an arrest. Probable cause necessary to justify an arrest is defined as \"whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Radvansky v.

The Southfield Police Department also took possession of the second cell phone and received the information about it from MV-1's father. Defendant was later arrested at his place of work by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The affidavit for the warrant to arrest Defendant was sworn out by an FBI agent, and is supported solely by information that was gathered through the illegal search. However, when police became aware of the existence of the second cell phone-and then came in to actual possession of it-they also came in to possession of probable cause that Gordon had enticed or attempted to entice MV-1 to engage in sexual activity when she was under age, because the cell phone showed that Gordon allegedly used multiple cell-phone-based social media platforms to engage in discussions with MV-1 toward that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   FBI Agent Nichols lists\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) in his affidavit as one of the crimes for which the FBI seeks to arrest Gordon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   That section states, in relevant part, \"Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce ... induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so,\" is liable for fines and imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense\" includes the production of child pornography, per\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Minor\" means \"any person under the age of eighteen years,\" and \"sexually explicit conduct\" includes, in relevant part, graphic\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   sexual intercourse (including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal); or lascivious simulated sexual intercourse where the genitals, breast, or pubic area of any person is exhibited; or graphic or lascivious simulated masturbation; or graphic or simulated lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, if the FBI had adequate probable cause to arrest Defendant for violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202422\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   of the information presented in the affidavit for the arrest warrant-then the arrest is still validly supported by probable cause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Gordon's consent is not tainted\n   by any unlawful arrest.

The police officers who responded to the hotel may properly be charged with the knowledge (or are expected to have such knowledge) that their search was-at the time-illegal because they entered the equivalent of a home without either a search warrant or exigent circumstances. But here the question is whether the agents who executed the search warrant of Defendant's home and arrested him on a facially valid warrant should be charged with knowledge that the warrants were invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29388\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"By imposing an objective standard,\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   indicated that courts evaluating an officer's conduct must charge the officer with a certain minimum level of knowledge of the law's requirements.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   , 468 U.S. at 923,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p922\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The first requirement of the good faith exception is that officers reasonably believed in good faith that the evidence they were collecting would be admissible. While it is clear that the police officers who entered Defendant's hotel room without a warrant should have known that a warrant or exigent circumstances were required, it is a much closer question whether the federal agents who later obtained a search warrant based on the evidence seized from that illegal search should have caught the fact that their colleagues had erred-particularly when their affidavit would have been reviewed and authorized by an Assistant U.S. Attorney and a United States Magistrate Judge-both of whom are experienced attorneys trained in the criminal law who did not catch the same error, but rather gave the affidavit their stamp of approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Of course, the Court does not need to decide the issue on this factor, because the Defendant consented to the search. While the applicability of the good faith exception under these circumstances may be a close call, the record supports a conclusion that the officers in this case reasonably believed in good faith that the evidence they were collecting pursuant to a validly-issued warrant would be admissible. It does not suggest that the agents would necessarily have realized that the initial search was illegal, or that the evidence they were collecting as a result of that search was fruit of the poisonous tree, and that it would ultimately be excluded. Such a chain of suppositions is simply a \"bridge too far.\" If Defendant had not consented to the search, the evidence seized pursuant to the inadequate search warrant would not be subject to suppression because the good faith exception would then apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, and those explained in its previous order, the Court reiterates that the warrantless entry into Defendant's hotel room violated his Fourth\n   Amendment rights. The Court now also finds that the taint of that unlawful entry had not dissipated when police seized MV-1's cell phone at the hotel. That cell phone and any evidence found on it are subject to exclusion. The Court further finds that MV-1's other cell phone (the one turned over by her father) was discovered from a source independent of the illegality, that police developed adequate probable cause from that independent source to arrest Defendant, and Defendant's consent to search his home and vehicle was validly given. That second cell phone and any evidence found on it, as well as any evidence seized at Defendant's residence or in his vehicle, may be admitted. Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Suppress Derivative Evidence (Dkt. 25) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   as it pertains to MV-1's cell phone seized at the hotel, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   as it pertains to MV-1's old cell phone, and the evidence seized in the search of Defendant's home or vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, the Court sets the following dates in this matter:\n  </p>\n  <table id=\"p-106\">\n   <tbody>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      PRETRIAL CONFERENCE:\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      October 11, 2018 at 2:00 PM\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>\n      TRIAL:\n     </td>\n     <td>\n      October 23, 2018 at 9:00 AM\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </tbody>\n  </table>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court finds that additional time is necessary for parties to reasonably prepare for trial, and that the additional time shall be deemed excludable delay under the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
