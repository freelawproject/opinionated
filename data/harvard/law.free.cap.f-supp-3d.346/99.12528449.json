Section 9712(d) of the Coal Act places responsibility \"for financing the benefits\" of the 1992 Plan on entities called \"1988 last signatory operators.\" \u00a7 9712(d).

Initially, Arch Coal posted a bond that satisfied \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B)'s security requirement with respect to those subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in 2005, Arch Coal sold the subsidiaries to Magnum Coal Company, and Magnum contractually agreed to replace Arch Coal's security with its own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.

These transactions did not alter Arch Coal's status as a \"related person\"-which remained fixed by the Coal Act based on a snapshot of 1992-but they did leave Patriot primarily responsible for securing the subsidiaries' Coal Act obligations, which Patriot did by amending a letter of credit with Fifth Third Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9-10.

As a result of that bankruptcy, the subsidiaries' Coal Act obligations were terminated in October 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Arch Coal notified the 1992 Plan that, as a \"related person,\" it would begin providing benefits to its former subsidiaries' qualifying retirees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Arch Coal implemented a benefit plan as promised on November 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Since then, Arch Coal has paid the monthly premiums that \u00a7 9612(d)(1)(A) requires and that were previously paid by the subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The 1992 Plan drew down Patriot's $8,608,392 letter of credit on December 10, 2015 and received a $8,608,392 wire transfer from Fifth Third Bank on December 18, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 16, 2016, the 1992 Plan informed Arch Coal that it had not provided security and asked it to do so. Pls.' Statement of Facts \u00b6 46. Almost a year later, in February 2017, the 1992 Plan wrote Arch Coal again, asserting that Arch Coal had a \"statutory obligation\" to provide security and requesting that Arch Coal provide security immediately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47 (quoting Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. M., Dkt. 19-17). Arch Coal declined to provide the demanded security and took the position that Patriot's letter of credit satisfied any security obligation on the part of Arch Coal.\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49-52. Arch Coal acknowledged that \"Arch [Coal] and its related persons are required to provide the 1992 Plan with security in the amount of $8,160,720\" but argued that the $8,608,392 drawn from Patriot's letter of credit served as a \"cash escrow\" that rendered Arch Coal \"over-secured in the amount of $447,672.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (quoting Pls.'

Arch Coal answered and counterclaimed on March 21, 2017 seeking the return of what it characterizes as excess security. Dkt. 4. The Trustees answered the counterclaim on April 10, 2017. Dkt. 7.

But the first sentence of the cited definition defines \"payment\" broadly as \"[t]he fulfillment of a promise, or the performance of an agreement,\" and the definition goes on to make repeated references to \"money\n   <em>\n    or its equivalent.\n   </em>\n   \" Def.'s Reply Ex. 1 (emphasis added). Thus, even the defendant's proffered definition is more than capacious enough to encompass the provision of security. Security, at minimum, enables a conditional payment to the beneficiary. And it often involves a payment to someone else in the interim-whether a surety, a bank, an escrow agent, or some other entity. Section 9712(d)(4)'s joint and several liability is not limited to payments made\n   <em>\n    to the 1992 Plan\n   </em>\n   but extends to all payments required to be paid\n   <em>\n    by 1988 last signatory operators.

Thus, the fact that providing security may involve payments to third parties for the benefit of the 1992 Plan-rather than to the 1992 Plan itself-does not mean those payments are not \"required to be paid ... under this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9128717\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/292/49/#p54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moving to statutory structure, the same subsection that creates joint and several liability for \"any amount required to be paid\" refers to the narrower concept of \"premiums\" in the very next sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9712(d)(4).

This difference is especially revealing considering that elsewhere in the Coal Act Congress\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   limit related persons' joint and several liability to premiums, and it did so explicitly. In outlining the financing requirements for the Combined Fund-another fund created by the Act-Congress made \"related person[s] ... jointly and severally liable for any\n   <em>\n    premium\n   </em>\n   required to be paid.\" \u00a7 9704(a) (emphasis added). The use of the word \"premium\" in \u00a7 9704 reflects the fact that, unlike in \u00a7 9712, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   financial obligation imposed in that section is the obligation to pay premiums; there is no obligation to post security. Hence, in a section requiring operators to pay premiums, Congress made related persons jointly and severally liable to pay \"premium[s];\" and in a parallel section requiring operators to pay premiums\n   <em>\n    and to provide security\n   </em>\n   , Congress made related persons jointly and severally liable to pay \"amount[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00a7 9712(d)(4). The natural implication of this difference is that Congress used the broader term \"amount\" in \u00a7 9712(d) precisely to include the provision of security required under that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, the obligation to provide security in \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B) \"must be read in [its] context and with a view to [its] place in the overall statutory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The obligation is listed between the premiums in \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(A) and \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(C) as one of three \"financing\" requirements imposed on 1988 last signatory operators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(A)-(C). If Congress wanted to identify only two out of three of those financing obligations, it would be strange to do so through a cryptic reference to \"amount[s] ... paid\" when it could have done so explicitly by using the term \"premium\" or simply cross-referencing the two subsections it had in mind. Naturally read, the phrase \"any amount required to be paid under this section\" thus refers to all three \"financing\" requirements, including the provision of security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendant counters that it \"makes perfect sense\" to obligate 1988 last signatories, but not their related persons, to provide security. Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 12. In the defendant's view, when a 1988 last signatory operator fails to meet its Coal Act obligations, its related persons serve as the \"first backstop.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. But because some 1988 last signatory operators do not have any related persons, Congress devised the security requirement to cushion the blow in the event a \"standalone operator[ ]\" goes out of business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The defendant argues that it would be \"surplusage\" to require both a 1988 last signatory operator\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   its related person to post security, because the security requirement was designed for scenarios in which no related person exists and because ordinarily the security arranged by the 1988 last signatory operator will remain available even after a related person assumes responsibility over premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. But what the defendant considers \"surplusage,\" Congress may well have considered belt and suspenders. And, in any event, the Court \"need neither accept nor reject a particular 'plausible' explanation for why Congress would have written [the Coal Act]\" the way it did.\n   <em>\n    Sigmon Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108314\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/438/#p444\">\n    534 U.S. at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108314\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/438/#p444\">\n    122 S.Ct. 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees with the plaintiffs that the plain text and structure of \u00a7 9712(d)(1) and \u00a7 9712(d)(4) unambiguously hold related persons jointly and severally liable for the obligation to provide security under \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B). The defendant must therefore provide security compliant with that provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Cash Proceeds from a Letter of Credit Qualify as the \"Provision of Security\" Under \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendant argues that, even if it is obligated to provide security, that obligation was fulfilled by Patriot's letter of credit, which has now been drawn down and converted into cash by the Trustees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 21. But \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B) requires security to be provided in one of three specific \"form[s]\": \"a bond, letter of credit, or cash escrow.\" \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B). Patriot's letter of credit is no longer in place,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

But even if, as a practical matter, \"[t]he proceeds from the letter of credit provide the Plan no less security than the letter of\n   credit itself,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108314\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/438/#p444\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the plain text of \u00a7 9712 does not allow for \"as-good\" or \"even-better\" security; it requires security in one of three exclusive forms. Because the defendant has not arranged for the provision of security in any of those forms, it has not met its obligation under \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Coal Act Requires the 1992 Plan to Use the Cash Proceeds from a Called Security to Provide the Benefits Secured by that Security.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to the defendant, the inquiry cannot end here because \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B) also limits the uses to which proceeds from a called security may be put. Specifically, the defendant argues that the proceeds must be used for the sole purpose of \"defray[ing] the cost of providing health benefits for the beneficiaries of a 1988 last signatory operator, should that ever become necessary.\" Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 20. Thus, in the defendant's view, the funds drawn from Patriot's letter of credit must be used in one of three ways. First-and preferred by Arch Coal-the funds could be placed in a Coal Act-compliant cash escrow account to secure Arch Coal's Coal Act obligations moving forward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Failing that, the 1992 Plan must use the funds either to provide the benefits Arch Coal has assumed responsibility for (until the funds are exhausted) or to reimburse Arch Coal for providing those benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendant roots these proposed limitations in the text of \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B), which provides that the security must be \"in an amount equal to a portion of the projected future cost to the [1992 Plan] of\n   <em>\n    providing health benefits for eligible and potentially eligible beneficiaries attributable to the 1988 last signatory operator\n   </em>\n   \" for whom the related person is liable. Def.'s Reply at 3-4 (quoting \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B) ) (emphasis added in original). But that language merely determines the amount of security required and, at most, reveals the purpose behind that requirement. It does not, by its terms, set limits on the 1992 Plan's ability to call a security, or to use the proceeds it receives as a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mertens v.

Reply at 7-8 (arguing that Arch Coal would lack standing to challenge the drawdown).

Thus, if anything, the text of ERISA precludes the Trustees from using the funds to offset Arch Coal's obligations as an employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court is sympathetic to Arch Coal's plight. After all, the 1992 Plan received over $8 million without incurring any corresponding loss or obligation. And now Arch Coal must fund the same commitments the $8 million was designed to secure. But to the extent the 1992 Plan has received a windfall, that windfall is due to the terms of Patriot's letter of credit, not the Coal Act. Had the 1992 Plan's right to draw funds been conditioned upon the 1992 Plan incurring the cost of providing benefits-as opposed to Patriot's failure to provide them-then the letter of credit presumably would have either remained in effect or been terminated without payment in a manner that left no room for doubt about Arch Coal's obligation to replace it. But instead, the letter of credit allowed the 1992 Plan to draw funds when\n   <em>\n    Patriot\n   </em>\n   ceased to provide benefits, even though those same benefits would subsequently be provided without interruption by Arch Coal. Although the defendant characterizes this result as \"seeking refuge in the law of commercial paper,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 9, the Court views it as the natural consequence of the letter of credit's terms, which the defendant does not challenge. The Court therefore denies the defendant's requests to require the Trustees to place the funds in a cash escrow account,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or to impose a constructive trust on the proceeds,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201103\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and will allow the letter of credit-and the Coal Act-to apply as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Arch Coal is required to provide security pursuant to \u00a7 9712(d)(1)(B), that it has not yet done so in one of the statutorily authorized forms, and that the Coal Act does not require the Trustees to place the proceeds of Patriot's letter of credit in a cash escrow account or to use them to fund the benefits owed by the defendant as a related person. Consequently, the Court also finds that the 1992 Plan is not over-secured. The Court will therefore grant summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on both the plaintiffs' claim and the defendant's counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part the plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and denies the defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.
