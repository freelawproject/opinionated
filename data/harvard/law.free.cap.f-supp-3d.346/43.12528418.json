And because no such explicit statement appears in the waiver agreement that Massachusetts and HHS entered into in regard to Commonwealth Care, HHS contends that the patient days relating to the treatment of Commonwealth Care beneficiaries do not count in the Medicare-reimbursement formula that the regulations prescribe. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    at 5-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Hospitals respond that HHS's explicit-statement requirement is contrary to both the plain language of the regulation and the intent behind section 412.106(b)(4)(i) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

The Hospitals further maintain that HHS's reading departs from the agency's practices in other cases (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

As a result, the Court also\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   the challenged agency decision, and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   this matter to HHS for further proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) This Memorandum Opinion provides the Court's reasons for that Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In short, after reviewing the parties' briefs, examining the record, and considering the oral arguments presented in this case, this Court concluded that HHS's interpretation of the unambiguous text of section 412.106(b)(4)(i) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations to disallow the inclusion of the patient days of service that were associated with patients who were covered by Commonwealth Care is an arbitrary and capricious determination, and thus violates the APA. It is clear from the plain language of the regulation's text that patients who are eligible to receive comprehensive medical care through an insurance program authorized under a section 1115 waiver (as evidenced by their eligibility for inpatient hospital services) are to be included in the Medicare reimbursement formula, and whether or not the waiver agreement through which the Secretary authorized the program\n   <em>\n    says\n   </em>\n   anything about their eligibility for inpatient hospital services is irrelevant to the calculation of a hospital's disproportionate share hospital adjustment. Furthermore, given that every individual enrolled in Massachusetts's Commonwealth Care program during the relevant time period obtained a subsidized insurance plan that actually provided coverage for inpatient hospital services, the Secretary's authorization of the Commonwealth Care program under the pertinent section 1115 waiver made every individual insured via Commonwealth Care \"eligible for inpatient hospital services\" within the meaning of section 412.106(b)(4)(i). Therefore, per the plain text of the applicable regulation, HHS should have counted the patient days pertaining to Commonwealth Care beneficiaries when calculating the Hospitals' disproportionate share hospital adjustments under the Medicare program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Consequently,\n   as far as Medicare reimbursements are concerned, patient counts matter. Moreover, as explained below, Medicare's reimbursement formulas take into account a variety of factors, including whether a particular hospital's actual costs are significantly higher than average due to its treatment of low-income individuals. Thus, the Medicare payment system's base per-patient rates are subject to a variety of adjustments that increase or decrease the total sum that the government pays each hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Billings Clinic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518332\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/301/#p303\">\n    901 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   304 ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

No. 99-241, pt. 1, at 16 (1985), and that absent this additional payment, the standardized rates that Congress has authorized for certain medical expenses would not cover the full operating costs for these hospitals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12170832\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/179/31/#p36\">\n    179 F.Supp.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The fact that the subsidized premiums can be used to purchase inpatient benefits is irrelevant.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties in the instant case chiefly dispute whether HHS correctly interpreted the phrase \"the patient is eligible for inpatient hospital services ... under a waiver authorized under section 1115(a)(2)[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(i). HHS says this language requires that the Secretary must have\n   <em>\n    stated\n   </em>\n   in the terms and conditions of the section 1115 waiver that individuals obtaining insurance through the given demonstration project are \"eligible for inpatient hospital services[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 5.) But the agency never explains\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the regulation concerning DSH adjustments would contain\n   such a requirement, and for the reasons explained fully below, this Court concludes that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In short, the plain language of the applicable regulation unambiguously requires that all patient days attributable to individuals receiving health insurance through Medicaid or through a roughly equivalent authorized demonstration project (as evidenced by the provision of \"inpatient hospital services\") must be counted in the Medicaid fraction's numerator. There is no dispute that the coverage provided to subscribers of Massachusetts's Commonwealth Care program is roughly equivalent to Medicaid insofar as every individual covered under the Commonwealth Care program did in fact receive premium assistance with respect to a health insurance plan that provided benefits for inpatient hospital services; moreover, when the Commonwealth Care waiver was issued, the Secretary incorporated the entirety of that state-run healthcare coverage program into the authorized demonstration project. This means that, for the purpose of the calculation at issue, the fact that the waiver document itself makes no reference to \"inpatient hospital services\" is irrelevant, and HHS acted in a manner that was contrary to its own regulations when it refused to count the patient days associated with the Commonwealth Care program in the numerator of the Hospitals' Medicaid fractions. Accordingly, and on this basis alone, HHS's determination must be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Under Section 412.106(b)(4), The Patient Days Attributable To Individuals Who Are Eligible For Inpatient Services Pursuant To A Waived Demonstration Project Must Be Included In The Medicaid Fraction's Numerator\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The plain language of section 412.106(b) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations establishes certain requirements for calculating a hospital's DSH adjustment; moreover, and importantly, it also provides the\n   <em>\n    context\n   </em>\n   in which the established computation is to be made. It is crucial to recall that context, for it appears that HHS has lifted words from the middle of the applicable text, and has presented them standing alone, thereby suggesting that the provision at issue requires something quite different than its unambiguous meaning when the terms of the regulation are considered as a whole. There can be no question that, like the words of a statute, the words of a regulation must be viewed in context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utility Air Regulatory Grp. v. Envtl. Prot.

And the relevant requirements of section 412.106(b) could not be clearer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To start, the regulation plainly indicates that it is \"[t]he fiscal intermediary\" who \"determines ... the number of the hospital's patient days of service for which patients were eligible for Medicaid but not entitled to Medicare Part A[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). This is the number that becomes the numerator of the Medicaid fraction (which the regulation calls \"the second computation\"), and thus, any subsequent language clarifying\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the fiscal intermediary is to arrive at that number-including the language that HHS has seized upon-has to be considered relative to this ultimate objective.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (introducing the subsequent directions by stating that \"[f]or purposes of this second computation, the following requirements apply\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As relevant here, the regulation then proceeds to expand the pool of qualifying hospital patient days of service, from merely those \"days of service for which patients were eligible for Medicaid[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), to include the days of service in which a patient \"is eligible for inpatient hospital services under an approved State Medicaid plan\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   under a waiver authorized under section 115(a)(2)\"-which is indisputably\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a state Medicaid plan-\"regardless of whether particular items or services were covered or paid under the State plan or the authorized waiver[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(i) (emphasis added). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 6 n.1 (acknowledging that HHS uses the word \"waiver\" in this context synonymously with the phrase \"demonstration project\").) Notably, this expansion of the kinds of patient days that are to be included in the Medicaid fraction's numerator occurs via the regulation's instruction that \"[f]or purposes of this computation, a patient is\n   <em>\n    deemed eligible for Medicaid on a given day\n   </em>\n   only if the patient is eligible for inpatient hospital services under\" either the state Medicaid plan or a demonstration project waiver.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(i) (emphasis added). This \"deemed eligible for Medicaid\" language is crucial, because that phrase unambiguously\n   <em>\n    equates\n   </em>\n   the patient days for Medicaid-eligible patients (which are expressly included in the Medicaid fraction computation per the prior paragraph) with the patient days of patients who, while not technically eligible for Medicaid, receive healthcare coverage under similarly comprehensive state-authorized plans,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , plans that include inpatient hospital service benefits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 504 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"deem\" as \"[t]o treat (something) as if (1) it were really something else, or (2) it has qualities that it does not have\"). Furthermore, when read as a whole, section 412.106(b)(4)(i) plainly indicates that a patient's\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   eligibility for Medicaid, or an equivalent state-run healthcare plan, \"on a given day\" is what matters-\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   is what the fiscal intermediary is called upon to figure out-regardless of what the plan documents might say about eligibility for any particular service, and even if the hospital at issue provided the patient with \"items or services\" that were not themselves covered by the state Medicaid plan or waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In this regard, when a fiscal intermediary undertakes to determine who is \"eligible for Medicaid\" on a given day for the purpose of the Medicaid fraction, the word \"eligible\" is generally construed to mean \"capable of receiving[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Covenant Health Sys. v.

First of all, and perhaps most importantly, HHS does not, and cannot, explain why the express terms of the demonstration project waiver agreement\n   <em>\n    matter\n   </em>\n   in the context of a regulation that is simply and solely concerned with the fiscal intermediary's proper calculation of a hospital's DSH adjustment given the population that it serves. HHS has plunged headlong into dictionary definitions of purportedly ambiguous terms, divorced from context, and in so doing has unquestionably lost its moorings: again, the point of the section at issue is to explain how HHS will determine who is to be deemed eligible for Medicaid for the purpose of the Medicaid fraction (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baystate Med.

It is clear, then, that with respect to the task at hand, the Secretary's understanding of the scope of the demonstration project as expressed in the waiver agreement, or whether the Secretary \"know[s], when he approves a demonstration project, whether or not he is committing federal funds\" via the DSH adjustment (Def.'s Reply at 8), is utterly irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Given that section 412.106(b)(4) says nothing about the particular contents of a section 1115 waiver, and does not so much as cross-reference the portions of the Code of Federal Regulations that do in fact address a section 1115 waiver's requirements, it makes little sense to require fiscal intermediaries to look to the terms of the waiver agreement to identify those patients who are to be deemed eligible for Medicaid for the purpose of section 412.106(b)(4)'s Medicaid fraction computation, as HHS suggests here. Even so, requiring the Secretary to have stated affirmatively that the covered patients would be \"eligible for inpatient hospital services\" runs counter to the structure of the Medicaid program and the waiver system that\n   Congress authorizes in section 1115, both of which make crystal clear that inpatient hospital coverage is the\n   <em>\n    default\n   </em>\n   , and that any explicit statement of the Secretary in the section 1115 process would\n   <em>\n    waive\n   </em>\n   such coverage, not authorize it. That is, by law, a state-run Medicaid program has to include benefits for inpatient hospital services,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (noting the requirements for \"[a] State plan for medical assistance[,]\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a traditional Medicaid program);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396d(a)(1) (defining \"medical assistance\" to include the provision of \"inpatient hospital services\"), but the Secretary may waive this requirement (and others) through a section 1115 waiver, thereby treating such a demonstration project as a Medicaid program for reimbursement purposes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1315(a)(1) (permitting the Secretary to waive the requirements of section 1396a of Title 42 of the United States Code ). Thus, the statutory scheme establishes baseline circumstances that are precisely the opposite of the interpretation that HHS proposes here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Secretary acts affirmatively to waive the requirement that inpatient services be provided to covered patients, not the other way around-yet HHS insists that, for patients who are covered through a demonstration project to be included in the relevant reimbursement formula, section 412.106(b)(4)(i) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires an affirmative and express adoption of inpatient hospital coverage by the agency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 5 (suggesting that \"[t]he special terms and conditions of the Massachusetts demonstration project\" must state \"that Commonwealth Care beneficiaries\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be eligible to have the costs of their inpatient hospital services covered by the insurance they purchased\" (emphasis added) ).) The agency's inversion of the background rule to imbue the waiver's silence with a meaning that is inconsistent with the waiver scheme itself creates a conflict with the Medicaid statute that renders the agency's reading \"plainly erroneous[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Drake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429029,3698870\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/59/\">\n    291 F.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"plainly erroneous\" interpretations of agency rules are not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, it is clear that HHS's statements during rulemaking do not support the interpretation that it seeks to advance now. The propositions that expansion waiver populations are \"specific, finite populations identifiable in the award letters\" and that \"special terms and conditions apply to the demonstrations\" (Def.'s Reply at 8 (quoting 68 Fed. Reg. at 45,420 ) ) plainly stand merely for the unremarkable notion that a section 1115 waiver must identify the population that a demonstration project will serve, and that a section 1115 waiver needs \"special terms and conditions\" because the proposed demonstration project deviates from the statutory Medicaid requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20430.25\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (discussing the details of a waiver of Medicaid requirements). Thus, HHS has distorted these Federal Register statements in much the same manner as the text of the regulation at issue; it finds significance in various words plucked from their context, when none actually suggests in the slightest that the Secretary must affirmatively state that patients are authorized to receive inpatient hospital services under the demonstration project when the waiver is approved in order for those patients to be deemed eligible for Medicaid for the purpose of computing the Medicare DSH adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In short, HHS's interpretation is out of sync with both the overall statutory Medicaid scheme and the structure of the Code of Federal Regulations, and thus this Court owes it no deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429029,3698870\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/59/\">\n    291 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   68 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christensen v.

Because Patients Who Were Covered By Commonwealth Care During The Relevant Timeframe Were Eligible To Receive Inpatient Services, The Patient Service Days Attributable To Such Patients Must Be Counted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the waiver that the Secretary executed with respect to Massachusetts's Commonwealth Care program, there can be little doubt that the patient days attributable to patients who were covered by the Commonwealth Care program must be included in the Hospitals' Medicaid fraction. Notably, the section 1115(a)(2) waivers relevant to this case contained no carveouts that are relevant to this issue-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the waivers incorporated the entirety of the Commonwealth Care plan. Indeed, when describing the contours of what was being approved as a demonstration project and what populations would be covered under that project, the Secretary simply and solely stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Commonwealth Care\n   </strong>\n   . Expenditures for premium assistance for the purchase of commercial health insurance products for uninsured individuals with income at or below 300 percent of the FPL who are not otherwise eligible under the Massachusetts State plan or any other eligibility category.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (AR Pt 2 at 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, the demonstration project at issue in this case encompassed the entirety of the Commonwealth Care program, and the only other general question from the standpoint of the fiscal intermediary who is charged with counting the patient days associated with an approved demonstration project under section 412.106(b)(4) of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations is whether patients covered by Commonwealth Care were capable of receiving inpatient health services through the insurance plans this program financed. The record is unambiguous on this point, and there is no dispute among the parties:\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   Commonwealth Care patient was, in fact, eligible for inpatient hospital services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR Pt 1 at 28 (explaining that \"[t]he record also shows that the [Commonwealth Care] days in this appeal relate to individuals who were enrolled in the same managed care plans and received the same core health benefits as other MassHealth recipients, including inpatient hospital services\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 23:6-9 (government counsel acknowledging that \"Commonwealth Care apparently guaranteed[,] [ ] though it was not required by the demonstration project, it did in practice, under state law, guarantee inpatient hospital coverage\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, per the unambiguous language of section 412.106(b)(4), and in light of the undisputed facts pertaining to the healthcare plan at issue, any patient service days attributable to patients whom the Hospitals treated and who were covered by Commonwealth Care on those service days should have been included within the numerator of the Medicaid fraction for the purpose of calculating the Hospitals' DSH adjustments. Consequently, HHS's refusal to include such patient days in the numerator of the Medicaid fraction when calculating the Hospitals' DSH adjustments for the period between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2009, was arbitrary and capricious agency action that must be vacated under the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
