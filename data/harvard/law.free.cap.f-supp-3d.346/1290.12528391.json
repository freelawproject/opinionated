Plaintiffs Abdisalam Wilwal, Sagal Abdigani, and their four children ages 5, 6, 8, and 14 (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") bring this lawsuit claiming their detention\n   was unlawful and assert various constitutional, Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), and Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") claims against the Government. This matter is before the Court on the Government's motion to dismiss. (Doc. No. 37.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants the Government's motion to dismiss Mr. Wilwal's substantive due process claim. The Court otherwise denies the Government's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth are drawn from Plaintiffs' amended complaint (Doc. No. 25 (\"Am. Compl.\") ), and accepted as true for the purposes of considering the motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs are United States citizens residing in Eagan, Minnesota. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26.) On March 30, 2015, Plaintiffs were returning to Minnesota from a trip to Regina, Saskatchewan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28.) At the checkpoint in Portal, North Dakota, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") officers detained Plaintiffs for over ten hours because Mr. Wilwal's name appeared on a terrorism-related watchlist maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (\"TSC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 37, 52-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plaintiffs' Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 27, 2015, Plaintiffs drove from their home in Eagan, Minnesota, to visit relatives in Regina, Saskatchewan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) At the border crossing in Portal, North Dakota, Canadian border officers told Mr. Wilwal that their records indicated that Mr. Wilwal might face additional questioning when attempting to reenter the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) When Plaintiffs returned around 6:00 a.m. on March 30, they presented a CBP officer with the family's U.S. passports and birth certificates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) After a few minutes, CBP agents approached Plaintiffs' van with their guns drawn and directed at the van carrying the parents and four young children, and ordered Mr. Wilwal out of the van. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) The agents handcuffed Mr. Wilwal and escorted him into the station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) While escorting Mr. Wilwal into the station, one of the CBP agents accused him of being involved in terrorism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Mr. Wilwal asked the agent why he made that accusation; the agent responded, \"We have information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Inside the station, the agents took Mr. Wilwal into a room, sat him in a chair, and left him handcuffed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) Around 10:30 a.m., and without any food or water, Mr. Wilwal passed out on the floor of the room where he was being detained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) After paramedics evaluated Mr. Wilwal, the agents changed the position of the handcuffs so that Mr. Wilwal's arms were in front of his body. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) The agents also gave Mr. Wilwal water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around 3:00 p.m., the agents informed Mr. Wilwal that HSI officers had arrived from Minot, North Dakota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Beginning around 4:00 p.m., the HSI officers questioned Mr. Wilwal for approximately 45 minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57, 61.) The HSI officers denied Mr. Wilwal's requests for an interpreter and a lawyer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) The HSI officers asked Mr. Wilwal if he is Muslim, whether he is Sunni or Shia, and whether he attends a mosque. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Additionally, the HSI officers questioned Mr. Wilwal about Plaintiffs' trip to Canada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) Around 4:40 p.m., after being detained over 10 hours, with no explanation, the HSI officers told the agents that they could remove Mr. Wilwal's handcuffs and that he could leave the station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Abdigani and the four young children were also detained for over ten hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) While the agents escorted Mr. Wilwal into the station, they directed Ms. Abdigani to park the van outside the border station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.) The agents then told Ms. Abdigani to leave her cell phone\n   in the van and directed Ms. Abdigani and the children into the station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After approximately one hour, Ms. Abdigani asked an agent if she could retrieve her cell phone from the van and contact family or friends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) The agent denied the request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Abdigani also asked if the children could go home to Eagan, either via her driving them or her brother-in-law coming to pick them up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) The agent denied that request also, stating: \"You're all detainees, including the children.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Around 11:00 a.m., Ms. Abdigani used her 14-year-old son's, M.O., cell phone to call 911. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.) M.O. had not been told to leave his cell phone in the van. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Ms. Abdigani told the 911 dispatcher that she and her family were being held against their will at the border station and were afraid for their safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) One of the agents then took the cell phone, and after approximately ten minutes, convinced the 911 dispatcher to not send assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the 911 call, the agents conducted pat-down searches of Ms. Abdigani and M.O. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-79.) To search M.O., the agents took him into a separate room, patted him down, and then ordered him to take off his clothes for a strip search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) M.O. refused to take off his clothes, and neither he nor Ms. Abdigani consented to the searches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Apart from asking Ms. Abdigani to write something in Somali, the agents never questioned Ms. Abdigani and the children, nor gave them a reason for being detained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) Plaintiffs were released and left the station just after 4:40 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 31, 2015, the same day that Plaintiffs arrived home, Mr. Wilwal and Ms. Abdigani went to the FBI and DHS offices to report what had happened to them at the border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.) An employee at the DHS office said she would get back to them with more information if possible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Two or three weeks later, an administrative staff member at the DHS office left Mr. Wilwal a voicemail stating that the incident at the border likely occurred because Mr. Wilwal's name appeared on a terrorist watchlist.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Plaintiffs submitted administrative tort claims to CBP based on the injuries sustained during their detention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) Plaintiffs amended their claims on July 11, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In mid-September 2017, CBP denied all of Plaintiffs' administrative claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this suit on July 13, 2017 and filed an amended complaint on October 12, 2017. Mr. Wilwal asserts the following claims against the Government: (1) unconstitutional seizure and excessive use of force under the Fourth Amendment (Counts I and II); (2) violation of Mr. Wilwal's procedural and substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment (Count IV and V); (3) violation of the APA (Count VII); and (4) battery, for which Plaintiffs assert the Government is liable under the FTCA (Count X). (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-96, 98-102, 105-07, 112-13.) Sagal Abdigani, M.O., N.W., A.W. and A.M. separately assert a claim for unconstitutional seizure under the Fourth Amendment (Count III). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.)

Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief (1) \"enjoining Defendants from arresting, seizing, searching, or interrogating Abdisalam Wilwal because of his placement on a terrorism-related watchlist\"; (2) enjoining Defendants from arresting, seizing, detaining, searching, or interrogating Sagal Abdigani, M.O., N.W., A.W., or A.M. because of their association with Abdisalam Wilwal\"; (3) \"requiring Defendants to provide Abdisalam Wilwal with notice of the reasons for his placement on the master watchlist and a meaningful opportunity to contest his continued retention on it\"; (4) requiring Defendants to remedy the constitutional and statutory violations [alleged in the amended complaint], including the removal of Abdisalam Wilwal from the master watchlist\"; and (5) requiring Defendants to expunge from government databases or otherwise destroy all information unlawfully obtained from Plaintiffs[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.)

Mr. Wilwal also plausibly alleges that he was injured when he passed out in the detention room and had to receive medical attention.

Specifically, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that all Plaintiffs' \"identification documents were valid,\" \"the family members were not carrying any illegal items,\" \"there were no reasons to suspect that any member of the family was carrying illegal items on their persons or in the vehicle,\" and that Mr. Wilwal was not fleeing or resisting the agents.
