Vollenweider also testified that he had the authority to sign contracts on Evalueserve's behalf. (Vollenweider Dep. (Dkt.

(Def. Br. (Dkt.

The parties have not offered any testimony from Malvika Kumar, and Gupta - the only member of Rosewood whose testimony was offered - testified that he believed the options were in Rosewood's name until April 2011, when Evalueserve contacted Gupta and Kumar and told them that they should immediately exercise the options listed in their names for tax reasons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. to Pltf. R. 56.1 Stmt. (Dkt. No. 82) \u00b6 11; Gupta Dep. (Dkt.

R. to Def. R. 56.1 Stmt. (Dkt.

No. 86) \u00b6 124)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   As discussed above, however, the Court has concluded that the plain language of the Grant Notice and Stock Option Agreement indicate that Evalueserve granted stock options to Mindspirit, that additional board approval was not required, and that there is a question of fact as to whether the Agreement expressly conditioned the issuance of the options on the consent of the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Accordingly, this Court cannot determine, as a matter of law, that Evalueserve did not breach the contract when it transferred the options to Gupta and Kumar, when it failed to extend the buy-back program to Mindspirit, and when it failed to obtain Mindspirit's consent to modification of the options grant in violation of Section 11(e) of the Equity Incentive Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Evalueserve also argues that its refusal to transfer the options back to Mindspirit did not breach the Agreement, because such a transfer \"was prohibited by the terms of the stock options.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.
