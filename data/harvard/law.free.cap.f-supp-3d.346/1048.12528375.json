Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Crossing at Eagle Pond, LLC (\"Eagle Pond\") is the owner of an apartment complex in Walled Lake, Michigan known as The Crossing at Eagle Pond Apartments (the \"Eagle Pond Apartments\"). Eagle Pond was established by Bleznak Real Estate Investment Group (\"BRI Group\"), a commercial holding company. In October 2011, the BRI Group purchased the Eagle Pond Apartments from Walled Lake Granite, LLC through five separate, but related, BRI Group owned entities: BRI-W # 1, LLC; BRI-W # 2, LLC; BRI-W # 3, LLC; BRI-W # 5, LLC; BRI-W # 6, LLC (collectively, the \"Five LLCs\"). (Doc # 20, Pg. 5) While under the ownership of the Five LLCs, the Eagle Pond Apartments' plumbing system experienced leaks on October 26, 2011; April 15, 2012; March 31, 2013; and June 14, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Five LLCs subsequently hired Delta Mechanical to re-pipe the entire Eagle Pond Apartments plumbing system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Eagle Pond acquired the Eagle Pond Apartments from the Five LLCs in January 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Eagle Pond is owned by the same owners of the Five LLCs. The Five LLC owners retained the same ownership percentages in the Eagle Pond Apartments each held respectively before the acquisition. Eagle Pond and the Five LLCs are Michigan companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant LZAM, a subsidiary of Lubrizol Corp., is the manufacturer of a chemical compound commercially known as FlowGuard Gold. (Doc # 17, Pg. 12) LZAM sells the compound to manufacturers of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) plumbing pipes and fittings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lubrizol Corp. is an Ohio corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. LZAM is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. (Doc # 1, Pg. 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Samples of the failed Eagle Pond Apartment pipes were submitted to Kent Engineering for forensic analysis. (Doc # 1, Pg. 14) The tests performed by Kent Engineering revealed: (1) that the subject CPVC pipe and fittings contained defective materials causing embrittlement; (2) the embrittlement was detrimental to the operation and maintenance of the plumbing system; (3) and the embrittlement was caused by faulty component materials manufactured and provided to the piping manufactured by LZAM.

Defendants base their argument on the deposition testimony of Adam Bleznak (\"Bleznak\"), one of the owners of the BRI Group, one of the Five LLCs, and Eagle Pond. Bleznak testified that the Five LLCs owned the Eagle Pond Apartments when the plumbing leaks were remedied. (Doc # 20-2, Pg. 128:15-24) Bleznak also testified that Eagle Pond acquired the Eagle Pond Apartments in January 2016. (Doc 20-2; Pg. 58:1-8) Bleznak further testified that there have not been any leaks in the Eagle Pond Apartments piping since the remediation was complete in June 2013. (Doc # 20, Pg. 128:1-14) Defendants do not challenge the other two (causation and redressability) elements of standing, as they would be satisfied if Eagle Pond meets the injury-in-fact requirement. The Court's analysis focuses only on the injury-in-fact element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Storey v. Attends Healthcare Prod., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-13577,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203125210\">\n    2016 WL 3125210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Mich. June 3, 2016) (focusing only on the injury-in-fact element where the other two elements of the standing inquiry were clearly satisfied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Eagle Pond argues that it is the successor of the Five LLCs, and received an assignment of interests in the Eagle Pond Apartments held by the Five LLCs. Eagle Pond asserts that the conveyance of the Eagle Pond Apartments from the Five LLCs to Eagle Pond was merely a name change for tax purposes. (Doc # 20, Pg. 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To support its theory, Eagle Pond directs the Court to aspects of the property conveyance between the Five LLCs and Eagle Pond. First, the Eagle Pond Operating Agreement states that the Five LLC owners retained the same ownership interests in the Eagle Pond Apartments that they had prior to the conveyance. Second, no consideration was passed between the Five LLCs and Eagle Pond because the entities have common ownership. Eagle Pond cites MCL \u00a7 211.27a(7)(m), a Michigan taxation of real and personal property statute, which states in part: \"Transfer of ownership does not include ... [a] transfer of real property or other ownership interests among ... limited liability companies ... or other legal entities if the entities involved are commonly controlled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Eagle Pond's theory of common ownership is incorrect. Bleznak's testimony does not support Eagle Pond's position. Bleznak testified that he is only an owner of one of the Five LLCs, and that the LLCs are owned by different members of the BRI Group. (Doc # 20-2, Pg. 57:1-11) While it is true that the owners of the Five LLCs retained the same ownership interests in the Eagle Pond Apartments following the conveyance to Eagle Pond, the property was transferred from five separate and distinct entities with separate, uncommon ownership, to a single entity with common ownership. It is a well-established\n   principle of law that corporate form must be respected.\n   <em>\n    Seasword v. Hilti, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2038467\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/449/542/#p547\">\n    449 Mich. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=537%20N.W.2d%20221\">\n    537 N.W.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (1995). Contrary to Eagle Pond's assertions, there was not a transfer of property between commonly controlled entities. The Five LLCs currently exist separate, and with different ownership respectively, from Eagle Pond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Eagle Pond alternatively argues that, even if the Five LLCs and Eagle Pond are not commonly controlled, Eagle Pond still has an injury because the Bill of Sale Eagle Pond obtained from the Five LLCs-dated January 1, 2016-assigns the personal property of the Eagle Pond Apartments to Eagle Pond. (Doc # 20, Pg. 13) The Bill of Sale states the Five LLCs were \"Grantors\" and \"Assignors.\" (Doc # 20-2, Pg. 136) The document also states that the Five LLCs \"assign, transfer, convey and set over unto [Eagle Pond] ... the other\n   <em>\n    personal property\n   </em>\n   owned by [the Five LLCs] located at [the Eagle Pond Apartments] and used in connection with the ownership and operation thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under Michigan law, an assignee \"stands in the same shoes of the assignor and acquires the same rights as the assignor possessed.\"\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Rehab.

In general, a claim accrues \"at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done....\" MCL \u00a7 600.5827. \"Wrong\" under MCL \u00a7 600.5827 is \"the date on which the defendant's breach harmed the plaintiff, as opposed to the date on which the defendant breached his duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Frank v.

Bleznak testified that he knew of the plumbing leaks when the Eagle Pond Apartments were transferred to the Five LLCs in October 2011. (Doc # 20-2, Pg. 59:18-24) Based on Michigan's \"possible cause of action\" standard, Bleznak was aware of the harm caused by Defendants' alleged breach by October 26, 2011. Eagle Pond's ability to bring a products\n   liability action against defendants expired in October of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Eagle Pond argues that despite being made aware of plumbing leaks, the leaks that occurred on October 26, 2011, and April 15, 2012 were \"common occurrence[s] in the apartment management business.\" (Doc # 20, Pg. 24) Eagle Pond contends that those leaks were not \"the product liability 'harm' that Eagle Pond suffered\" and that the Eagle Pond Apartments were \"perfectly able to continue with business as usual.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Eagle Pond adds that the repair of the October 26, 2011 and April 15, 2012 leaks was completed quickly and at a lower cost than the repairs for the subsequent leaks. (Doc # 20, Pg. 25)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   According to Eagle Pond, the ruptured pipes at the Eagle Pond Apartments that occurred on March 31, 2013, and June 14, 2014, constitute the \"harm\" suffered and caused by the alleged product defect because they were larger, more damaging, and more expensive to repair. (Doc # 20, Pg. 27) Eagle Pond contends that the \"harms\" suffered from the two sets of leaks are not the same because smaller pipes-the pipes involved in the October 26, 2011 and April 15, 2012 leaks-failed regardless of their manufacture or composition, and were quickly and inexpensively repaired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In contrast, thicker pipe failures-the pipes involved in the March 31, 2013 and June 14, 2013 leaks-evidence a product defect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, Eagle Pond's contention that its first harm was the March 31, 2013 leak is unsupported by the Complaint. Paragraph 4 of the Complaint states, \"The cause of action that is the subject of this complaint arises out of damages suffered by Eagle Pond arising out of piping failures at the apartment complex (the \"piping failures\").\" (Doc # 1, Pg. 13, \u00b6 4) Paragraph 6 states, \"Eagle Pond experienced a number of piping failures that caused water damage to the premises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6) Paragraph 7 highlights the damage caused by the June 14, 2013 piping failure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7) The Complaint refers generally to \"piping failures,\" and makes no distinction between the different leaks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, Eagle Pond's harm theory is contrary to Michigan law. Eagle Pond does not dispute that Bleznak was aware of plumbing leaks when the Five LLCs acquired the Eagle Pond Apartments. The October 26, 2011 leak, in addition to the awareness of plumbing leaks at the apartments, means that the statutory period on Eagle Pond's claim began to run on that date. Eagle Pond argues that the March 31, 2013 leak was the first evidence of a product defect, however, a plaintiff does not need to know the details regarding evidence to support a products liability claim. The Five LLCs began experiencing leaks, and first suffered injury, on October 26, 2011. The cause of action giving rise to this claim began on that date. While the March 31, 2013 and June 14, 2013 leaks might have caused more damage, \"the statute of limitations begins to run when the first harm caused by the last act of defendant[ ] occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. Willow Tree Vill.\n   </em>\n   , No. 294544,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20711136\">\n    2011 WL 711136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 1, 2011). Based on undisputed facts, the first harm caused by the allegedly defective CPVC compound sold by LZAM occurred no later than October 26, 2011. There is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding this issue. Eagle Pond's products liability claims are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In addition, Defendants argue that Eagle Pond cannot bring this products liability action under a negligence theory because the Five LLCs had actual knowledge of the product defect when they acquired the Eagle Pond Apartments. Eagle Pond argues that Defendants assertion that the Five LLCs had actual knowledge of the product defect is erroneous. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Eagle Pond, there are genuine issues of material fact regarding this issue. Because Eagle Pond's claims are time-barred, either under the UCC or Michigan's products liability statute, the Court need not address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
