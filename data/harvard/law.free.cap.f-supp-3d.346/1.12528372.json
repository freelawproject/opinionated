The first request, submitted by Plaintiffs George Canning and Jeffrey Steinberg (\"the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs\"), sought (1) a 2010 memorandum from the President to his foreign policy advisors, entitled \"Presidential Study Directive 11\" (\"PSD-11\"), and related records, and (2) records concerning the Muslim Brotherhood. Dkt. 72-4 at 2. That request is the subject of the litigation in\n   <em>\n    Canning v. Department of State\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-cv-831 (\"the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   case\"). The parties to the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   case, with leave of the Court, previously filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to the first category of records-records relating to PSD-11-and the Court issued an opinion resolving those motions.\n   <em>\n    Canning v. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   \"). The second request, submitted by\n   SAE Productions, Inc. (\"SAE\"), piggybacked on the first. It referred to a news report about the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   case and requested copies of three documents quoted in the article and all other \"records that are being processed pursuant to\" the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' FOIA request. Dkt. 72-4 at 24-25. The second request is the subject of the litigation in\n   <em>\n    SAE Productions, Inc. v. Department of State\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-1245 (\"the\n   <em>\n    SAE\n   </em>\n   case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given the overlap between the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    SAE\n   </em>\n   cases, the Court granted the State Department's motion to consolidate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (July 13, 2017), which the Department filed almost two years after the Court issued the\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   opinion, Dkt. 67. After the cases were consolidated, the State Department moved for summary judgment with respect to all remaining claims in the two cases, Dkt. 74; the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    SAE\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs opposed that motion, Dkt. 80, Dkt. 77; and the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment with respect to one document, Dkt. 79, and contested the adequacy of the State Department's response to the\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   decision, Dkt. 49. As narrowed by the parties in their respective briefs, only the following issues remain for decision: SAE (1) contests the adequacy of the State Department's search for responsive records and (2) challenges the Department's reliance on FOIA Exemption 5 to withhold certain purportedly deliberative records, and the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs (1) challenge the Department's reliance on FOIA Exemption 1 to withhold certain purportedly classified records that were classified after they submitted their FOIA request and (2) dispute its invocation of FOIA Exemption 5 to withhold certain purportedly deliberative records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the Department's search was adequate. With respect to those records that were classified in whole or in part after the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request, the Court concludes that the Department has satisfied the requirements of Executive Order 13562 -which governs the processes for post-request classification of responsive records-for all but four of the withheld records. As to those four, however, the Department has not yet shown that it complied with Executive Order 13562, and thus has not shown that it properly invoked FOIA Exemption 1. With respect to the Defendant's reliance on the deliberative process privilege to withhold various records, the Court concludes, first, that the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have failed to establish the absence of a dispute of material fact as to the one document at issue in their cross-motion for summary judgment; second, that the Department has failed to carry its similar burden as to three \"draft\" letters to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia; and, finally, that the Department has carried its burden as to its remaining assertions of the deliberative process privilege. The Court will, accordingly, grant in part and deny in part the Department's motion for summary judgment and will deny the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In the first, Stein attests that the IPS Branch Chief for Litigation and Appeals reviewed SAE's FOIA request for \"copies of all the State Department documents and records identified in [the] June 18, 2014 Gulf News Report\" and \"determined that the only FOIA lawsuit against the Department concerning the Muslim Brotherhood was the suit filed by Plaintiffs Canning and Steinberg.\" Dkt. 72-1 at 5 (First Stein Decl. \u00b6 9). Based on this assessment, which SAE does not dispute, the Branch Chief searched the \"F2\" database \"using information quoted in\" the \"\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article cited in SAE's request,\" and she \"located the documents described in the article.\" Dkt. 72-1 at 5 (First Stein Decl. \u00b6 9). The second Stein declaration further attests that the IPS Branch Chief used search terms derived from the\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article's quotations from the documents SAE sought, which included \"Mission Benghazi,\" \"banned for over three decades,\" and \"Chairman of Justice and Construction Party.\" Dkt. 81-1 at 3-4 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 5). Taken together, the Department maintains, these declarations demonstrate that the search was adequate. Dkt. 81 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   SAE raises a number of questions regarding the adequacy of the searches-but each is readily answered, and none of those answers suggest that the Department's search was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , SAE asks: what search terms did the Department use? The answer to that question is straightforward. SAE sought three documents, each of which was quoted in the\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article. So, the Department took a distinctive phrase from each of the three quoted passages-\"Mission Benghazi,\" \"banned for over three decades,\" and \"Chairman of Justice and Construction Party\"-and searched for that phrase. Dkt. 81-1 at 3-4 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 5). That search process, moreover, proved successful. Each of the phrases\n   \"located\" a document that contained \"the same language quoted in the article,\" and, as SAE's request posited, each of those documents was among the records \"previously produced to [the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs] in response to\" their FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the extent this process might have left any doubt about whether the Department found the exact documents that SAE sought, Exhibit 2 to the Second Stein declaration puts that doubt to rest. That exhibit compares the language quoted in the\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article to the language appearing in the documents that the Department released to SAE, and it shows that the same-extended-quotes appear in both. Indeed, the punctuation and capitalization are identical, and, where the\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article varied slightly from one of the documents, the author used brackets to reflect that minor variance. Dkt. 81-3 at 1-2 (Second Stein Decl.) (Ex. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , SAE asks: what timeframe did the Department use for purposes of its search? Here, too, the record provides an answer. SAE requested copies of the three documents quoted in the\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article, all three of which, according to SAE, the Department had previously released to the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs. According to the Stein declaration, the Department located and produced to SAE \"all material that had been previously released in\n   <em>\n    Canning, et al. v. State\n   </em>\n   , 13-cv-831.\" Dkt. 72-1 at 6 (First Stein Decl. \u00b6 11). There was no reason for the Department to search for records created after its earlier release of records to the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs-or after publication of the\n   <em>\n    Gulf News Report\n   </em>\n   article-and the record clearly establishes that the Department not only searched for, but located, the records from the relevant timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , SAE asks: why did the Department search only one database, the \"FREEDOMS 2\" or \"F2\" database? The Second Stein declaration answers this question as well: \"F2 is the database in which the Department maintains documents released in response to FOIA requests.\" Dkt. 81-1 at 3 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 4). Because SAE sought records that the Department had released in response to a prior FOIA request, this was the obvious place to search. As explained in the Second Stein declaration, the search was \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents\" responsive to SAE's request.\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n    180 F.3d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Truitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479440,3479962,10532205,10532302\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/540/\">\n    897 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   542 ). FOIA requires nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court thus concludes that the Department's search for records responsive to SAE's FOIA request was adequate and that the Department, accordingly, is entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Withholdings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Both the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs and SAE contend that the Department has failed to carry its burden with respect to a handful of withholdings. The\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs oppose the Department's motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Department has not shown (1) that certain records withheld under Exemption 1 (including records addressed in\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   ) were properly classified under the post-request standard for classification; (2) that a handful of other documents withheld under Exemption 1 that are marked \"unclassified\" are, in fact, classified; and (3) that three documents withheld under Exemption 5 are, in fact, deliberative. With respect to one of those three documents, moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs go a step further and argue that they have carried their burden of showing that the document is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   deliberative and that it therefore must be released. SAE, for its part, raises only a\n   general challenge to the Department's withholdings. It argues that the Department has failed to provide sufficient detail-either in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index or elsewhere-to permit the Court to determine whether the thirty-eight documents withheld as deliberative under Exemption 5 are, in fact, deliberative. The Court holds (1) that the Department has not yet justified its use of post-request classification to withhold four documents; (2) that it has not yet justified its use of the deliberative process privilege to withhold three additional documents; but (3) that the Department has otherwise carried its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Exemption 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   FOIA Exemption 1 covers \"matters that are ... specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and ... are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

All but four of these documents were reviewed and classified by Margaret Grafeld, who at the time served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Information Services, and the remaining four documents were reviewed and classified by Eric Stein, who currently serves as the State Department's Director of the Office of Information Program and Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 4-5 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6, 8).

In pressing this argument, however, they conflate the well-established requirement that an agency seeking summary judgment in a FOIA action must proffer declarations or other evidence \"describ[ing] the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,\"\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

As to each post-request classification decision, the Department explains with \"reasonably specific detail\" the basis for decision in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index. See Dkt. 81-2 at 5-8, 11, 13-14, 17-24, 29-47, 49, 51. To take just one example, the Department explains that it \"classified portions of [a] document that were originally UNCLASSIFIED as CONFIDENTIAL\" because those portions of the document \"contain[ ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   sensitive details regarding the security situation in Libya and Egypt,\" which were \"provided by a foreign government in confidence,\" and because the Department's \"[r]elease of the ... information ... would cause foreign officials to believe that U.S. officials are not able or willing to observe the confidentiality expected in such interchanges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Given the deference that courts must accord to judgments made by the Executive Branch on issues of national security and foreign policy,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Nat'l Sec.

Plaintiffs do not cite any relevant authority in support of this contention, and nothing in the text of Section 1.7(d) of the Executive Order supports their position. With respect to the substance of the classification decision, the Executive Order mandates that the record meet \"the requirements\" for classification, EO 13526 \u00a7 1.7(d), and those requirements include a finding that \"disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.4, the \"national defense or foreign relations of the United States,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.1 (cc). Given this mandate, it is appropriate to put the classifying agency to the test of explaining-in general terms-how disclosure could harm the national security interests of the United States. Once the agency does so, however, it is shown that the record at issue was \"properly classified pursuant to [the] Executive Order,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and FOIA requires nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    \"Ambiguously Marked\" Documents\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also argue that certain documents were improperly withheld under Exemption 1 because they contain ambiguous markings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80 at 22. According to the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, this poses two problems. First, it casts doubt on the Department's claim that the redacted material is, in fact, classified. Second, it raises the possibility that the records continue to reside in the Department's general files without classification markings and that, as a result, the records are classified only as to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. 80-1 at 3-4 (Fourth Canning Decl. \u00b6 5). Each of those documents, however, bears a heading indicating that it is classified at either the \"CONFIDENTIAL\" or \"SECRET\" level.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fourth Canning Decl. \u00b6 5) (explaining that \"each bear a notation indicating they had been classified by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Global Information Service\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 13-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Exs.

In short, there is no meaningful ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs' disagreement is based on surviving \"UNCLASSIFIED\" or \"SBU\" portion marking, but those markings must be understood in light of the \"CLASSIFIED\" headers and the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index. Although the Department might reasonably have crossed out the surviving markings and added new portion markings, there is no question that the redacted portions have, in fact, been designated as classified. Similarly, there is no question that, if a State Department employee were to review any of these documents, that employee would understand that the document is classified. Finally, there is no basis to infer that the Department maintains these classified records in general files that are accessible by employees or others without the requisite security clearance, and there is no reason to conclude that, even if they did, the documents would have lost their status as classified records under Executive Order 13526.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Post-Request Authority to Classify\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Department has failed to carry its burden of showing that it complied with the \"personal-participation or under-the-direction-of\" requirement of Section 1.7(d), both with respect to its original ten Section 1.7(d) withholdings and fifty of its subsequent Section 1.7(d) withholdings. As explained below, the Court concludes that the Department has satisfied its burden with respect to all but four of the withheld records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Under the Executive Order, an agency may classify documents\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   receiving a FOIA request only \"with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under [S]ection 5.4 of th[e] [Executive] [O]rder.\" EO 13526 \u00a7 1.7(d). The senior State Department official designated under Section 5.4 is the Under Secretary of State for Management.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%209.3\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For present purposes, all agree that neither the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of State nor the Under Secretary for Management personally participated in the Section 1.7(d) review, and all agree that the review did not take place \"under the direction of\" the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of State. The question, accordingly, comes down to whether the post-request review occurred \"under the direction of\" the Under Secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Two Department of State \"notices\" issued by the Under Secretary for Management speak to this issue. The first, which was in effect at the time Deputy Assistant Secretary Grafeld conducted her review, \"authorize[d] and direct[ed] the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Records and Publishing Services ... to be the official to classify information on a document-by-document basis consistent with the circumstances and procedures described in\" the relevant Executive Order, and provided that \"[t]he Deputy Assistant Secretary\n   shall act under the direction of the Under Secretary for Management and shall keep [him] apprised of actions taken under this authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%207227\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. 7227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 12, 1999). The second, which was in effect at the time IPS Director Stein conducted his review, \"authorize[s] and direct[s] the Deputy Assistant Secretary ... and the Director of Information Programs and Services ... to classify or reclassify information consistent with the circumstances and procedures described in [S]ection 1.7(d) of E.O. 13526,\" and provides that \"this authority shall be exercised on a document-by-document basis only as to information that has not been previously released to the public under proper authority, and only if such classification meets the requirements of E.O. 13526.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015605\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 15605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 23, 2016). The second notice omits the requirement that the Under Secretary be kept \"apprised of actions taken,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%207227\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. at 7227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but does specify that \"[t]he official exercising [the Section 1.7(d) ] authority shall do so under the direction of the Under Secretary for Management,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015605\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 15605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When the Court last considered whether Grafeld's document-by-document review satisfied the under-the-direction-of standard, it concluded that the 1999 notice was facially consistent with the requirements of Section 1.7(d); the notice required that the official engaged in the document-by-document review exercise the assigned authority \"under the direction of ... the Under Secretary\" and that she keep the Under Secretary \"apprised of actions taken under\" the assigned \"authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%207227\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7227 ). The Court now reaffirms that conclusion and further concludes that the 2016 notice is also facially consistent with the Executive Order; although it omits the express duty to keep the Under Secretary apprised of the classification actions taken, it maintains the core requirement that the official engaged in the document-by-document review act \"under the direction of the Under Secretary for Management,\" which is precisely what the Executive Order requires.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015605\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 15605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   That, however, answers only part of the question. As the Court also explained in\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   , more than\n   <em>\n    facial\n   </em>\n   consistency is required; it is not enough, in short, simply to say that the reviewing official \"shall\" exercise her authority \"under the direction of the Under Secretary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The process must also be structured or implemented in a way that provides an \"opportunity for actual oversight by the Under Secretary\" because, absent such an opportunity, the under-the-direction-of requirement would be rendered obsolete: \"[T]here would be no meaningful difference between acting at the Under Secretary's direction and acting pursuant to [an unconstrained] delegation of his authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that \"\u00a7 1.7(d) limits post-request classification authority in order ... to ensure that a senior government official takes responsibility for intervening classification decisions that thwart otherwise valid FOIA requests,\" such a wholesale delegation of responsibility would contravene the purposes of the Executive Order's limits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be clear, this does not mean that the Under Secretary must review and approve each decision. Rather, one acts under the \"direction\" of another if she is subject to that person's \"guidance[,] supervision,\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   328 (10th ed. 1996), or \"management,\"\n   <em>\n    The New Oxford American Dictionary\n   </em>\n   479 (2d ed. 2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not the\n   Court's role to micromanage how the Under Secretary-or any other senior official designated under the Executive Order-guides, supervises, or manages the review process. But, because the Executive Order requires that the document-by-document review occur \"with the personal participation of, or under the direction of, the agency head, the deputy agency head,\" or designated official (here, the Under Secretary), EO 13526 \u00a7 1.7(d), the Court must ensure that responsibility for the review is not simply reassigned in its entirety to the Deputy Assistant Secretary or the IPS Director. In short, the Under Secretary is free to decide\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   he will guide, supervise, or manage the review process, but the Court must decide\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   he has done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court starts with the slice of\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   that remains for decision. In that opinion, the Court observed that, in the then-controlling notice, the Under Secretary \"direct[ed]\" that Grafeld conduct the required document-by-document review \"under [the Under Secretary's] direction\" and that she \"keep [him] apprised of actions taken under this authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%207227\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7227 ). Although that process was, in the abstract, sufficient, the Court could not enter summary judgment in favor of the Department because the record did not reveal whether the contemplated process was, in fact, followed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 507-08. The Court, accordingly, provided the Department with sixty days to \"submit additional declarations confirming that Grafel previously reviewed-or has now reviewed-each document classified in accordance with \u00a7 1.7(d) and that she previously apprised-or has now apprised-the Under Secretary of her decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 508.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Consistent with the Court's order, the Department has now submitted a declaration from Grafeld attesting that she personally reviewed each of the documents at issue and determined that each document satisfied the requirements for classification under the Executive Order, Dkt. 48-1 at 2-3 (Grafeld Decl. \u00b6 3), and that she has \"apprised Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy of [her] decision to classify the [specific] documents [at issue] in accordance with \u00a7 1.7(d) of Executive Order 13526,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Grafeld Decl. \u00b6 4). That declaration addresses the Court's remaining question, and it establishes that the review of these particular documents was, as contemplated by the February 1999 notice, conducted under the direction of the Under Secretary. Although not the only means by which a senior official might guide, supervise, or manage another official, by \"appris[ing]\" the Under Secretary of her decisions, Grafeld provided the Under Secretary with \"some opportunity for actual oversight,\"\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That opportunity, when combined with the \"direct[ion]\" to conduct a review \"on a document-by-document basis\n   consistent with the\" requirements specified in the Executive Order, is sufficient to show that the review was conducted \"under the direction of\" the Under Secretary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015605\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 15605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs disagree, arguing that the Grafeld declaration is inadequate because it does not explain how Grafeld apprised the Under Secretary of her determinations, does not identify what information she provided him, and does not indicate whether the Under Secretary concurred in her determinations. Dkt. 49 at 2. Nothing in the Executive Order or in the concept of \"direction,\" however, requires either that level of detail or the affirmative concurrence of the Under Secretary. Here, moreover, Grafeld\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   identified the substance of her apprisal: in her declaration, she pinpoints the specific documents at issue and reports that she apprised the Under Secretary of her decision to classify those specific documents in accordance with \u00a7 1.7(d) of Executive Order 13526. Dkt. 48-1 at 3 (Grafeld Decl. \u00b6 4). The Under Secretary directed that Grafeld conduct the review, told her to do so in compliance with the Executive Order, and had \"some opportunity for actual oversight,\"\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160672\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/490/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because he was \"apprised of actions taken under\" his direction. Dkt. 48-1 at 3 (Grafeld Decl. \u00b6 4). This process may lie at the edge of any reasonable understanding of what constitutes guidance, supervision, or management. But, as the Supreme Court has cautioned in a different context, absent clear constraints or compelling circumstances, agencies should be left free to fashion their own rules and procedures in the discharge of their responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2961\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/519/#p543\">\n    435 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2961\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/519/#p543\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2961\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/519/#p543\">\n    55 L.Ed.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Because nothing in the Executive Order precludes the approach the Department applied, and because that approach ensures that the Under Secretary bears ultimate responsibility for the classification decisions, the Court concludes that the Department has carried its burden with respect to the records at issue in\n   <em>\n    Canning I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   That same conclusion also applies to the additional records that Grafeld reviewed and classified or reclassified after the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request. As Stein now attests, those records were reviewed pursuant to the same notice from the Under Secretary; Grafeld reviewed each document; and she apprised the Under Secretary of her determinations \"in a biannual report.\" Dkt. 81-1 at 5 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 7). Again, the Under Secretary acknowledged that Grafeld was acting \"under his direction,\" and he had the opportunity to disagree with her actions when he was \"apprised\" of her decisions. That is enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court is not convinced, however, that the Department has carried its burden with respect to the four records that Stein reviewed pursuant to the March 23, 2016 notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8). As noted above, the Department has narrowly carried its burden with respect to the records that Grafeld reviewed. What pushed the Department's showing over the line was the evidence that Grafeld \"personally reviewed\" each of the documents; that the Under Secretary was apprised of Grafeld's decision to classify those specific documents \"in accordance with \u00a7 1.7(d) of Executive Order 13526,\" Dkt. 48-1 at 3 (Grafeld Decl. \u00b6 4); and that the Under Secretary had the opportunity to disagree or otherwise guide the process. With respect to the remaining four records, however, Stein merely asserts that he \"\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   apprise the Under Secretary for Management of [his] actions in the next biannual report.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 8) (emphasis added). There is\n   no evidence that the Under Secretary was aware that the four records were subject to reclassification; there is no evidence that he had the opportunity to express a contrary view; and there is no evidence he guided, managed, or supervised Stein's review in any way, beyond merely assigning the review responsibility to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In focusing on whether the Under Secretary was apprised of Stein's determinations, the Court does not mean to suggest that apprisal and an opportunity to weigh in is the only way to satisfy the under-the-direction-of requirement. As noted above, judges need to avoid injecting themselves \"into day-to-day agency management.\"\n   <em>\n    Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p66\">\n    542 U.S. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66-67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p66\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p66\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The problem, however, is that \"direction\" requires\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   more than an unconstrained delegation, and the only something that the Department has identified is the apprisal process. Without that-or\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   else-all the Department has is a notice that says, \"perform the review required by the Executive Order under my direction,\" with no guidance, supervision, or management. Such a bare reassignment of authority cannot be squared with the manifest intent of the Executive Order to require \"participation\" or \"direction\" by the agency head, deputy agency head, or designated \"senior agency official.\" EO 13526, \u00a7 1.7(d). Absent some indicia of \"participation\" or \"direction\" by one of these senior Department officials, EO 13526 \u00a7 1.7(d), the Court cannot conclude that a post-request classification determination was \"properly\" made \"pursuant to [the] Executive [O]rder,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) -and here, with respect to these four documents, there is no evidence that apprisal or any other means of \"direction\" has occurred. The Court, accordingly, concludes that the Department-at least on the present record-is not entitled to summary judgment with respect to the four records that Stein classified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, the Court is unpersuaded by the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' more sweeping contention that the records at issue were not properly classified in accordance with the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual-or \"FAM.\" They argue that the FAM in place at the relevant time required that the Under Secretary\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Global Information and Services draft a memorandum regarding \"upgrad[ing]\" the classification of the relevant documents and that the memorandum be \"approved.\" Dkt. 80 at 18-19. And because there is no evidence that the Under Secretary played any role in the process or that the classification decisions were \"approved,\" they contend, the Department has failed to carry its burden of showing that the records were properly classified.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, as explained in the Second Stein declaration, the version of the FAM quoted in Plaintiffs' brief contained an error that was corrected in subsequent versions; the requirement was not that the Under Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary draft the memorandum but, rather, that \"the classification memorandum is drafted for the Under Secretary ..., the Deputy Assistant Secretary ..., or the director of the Office of Information Programs and Services ..., who subsequently review and approve or disapprove the memorandum.\" Dkt. 81-1 at 6 n.5 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 9 n.5). Moreover, even putting that aside, FOIA Exemption 1 applies to records that \"are in fact properly classified pursuant to [the] Executive [O]rder,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and does not require compliance with the FAM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court concludes that the Department has satisfied the requirements of Executive Order 13562 regarding the post-request\n   classification of responsive records for all but four of the withheld records. As to those four, the Department has not yet shown that it complied with Executive Order 13562, and thus has not shown that those documents were properly withheld. The Court will, accordingly, grant in part and deny in part the Department's motion for summary judgment with respect to Exemption 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Exemption 5\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Exemption 5 protects \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).

The Department explains in its\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index that Document C05781947 is \"a draft letter to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia,\" which was withheld pursuant to Exemption 5 because it is \"pre-decisional and deliberative with respect to a final determination on the content of the letter,\" and its release \"could reasonably be expected to chill the open and frank expression of ideas, recommendations, and opinions that occur when U.S. Government officials are crafting text for signature by the President.\" Dkt. 72-2 at 146-49. Documents C06231742 and C06320987 are Arabic \"versions\" of document C05781947: \"Document C06231742 is an incomplete draft of the letter and Document C06320987 is an unsigned draft of the full letter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144.

To this, Plaintiffs add that the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index entry for these Arabic-language versions of the letter lacks the \"draft\" designation found in the column header that appears for the English-language version of the letter, and, unlike the entry for the English-language version, the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index refers to the documents-at least once-as \"versions of a letter\" as opposed to \"draft[s]\" of a \"letter.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 72-2 at 144\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927918\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/384/1/#p19\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927918\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/384/1/#p19\">\n    at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response, Stein attests that the three versions of the letter \"are all in draft form, as stated in the 'Description' category of the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index.\" Dkt. 81-1 at 6-7 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 11). Stein further explains that the differences that the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs highlight in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index are \"merely stylistic\" and were \"not intended to convey that the Arabic versions are final.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927918\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/384/1/#p19\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927918\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/384/1/#p19\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To start, the Court is unconvinced that Document C06320987 \"is clearly the final version of the letter.\" Dkt. 80 at 26. Both the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and the Second Stein Declaration represent that the document is a draft, Dkt. 81-1 at 6-7 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 11), and that characterization, at the very least, gives rise to a disputed issue of material fact. But, at the same time, the Court is unconvinced-at least on the present record-that the three documents were deliberative. To be sure, none of the documents bear the President's signature, and none is printed in final form on presidential stationary. If all that remained to be done, however, was to print and sign the letter-and if, in fact, any of the three documents is identical in\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   to the letter that was sent to King Abdullah-it is difficult to discern how that document reflects anything that is \"\n   <em>\n    pre-\n   </em>\n   decisional.\" That concern, moreover, is more than hypothetical. Given the opportunity to respond to the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' arguments-including their contention that \"all decisions [had] been made\" regarding the content of the letter-the Second Stein Declaration merely attests that the documents were \"in draft\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   .\" Dkt. 81-1 at 6-7 (Second Stein Decl. \u00b6 11) (emphasis added). The declarant's use of the word \"form\" at least raises the question whether he means to distinguish between the \"form\" and the \"substance\" of the records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It may be that the documents were drafts, both as a matter of \"form\" and \"substance.\" It may be that the President had yet to sign off on the documents, and that the Department contends that a recommendation that is ultimately approved remains a recommendation until finally and formally approved. Or it may be that the Department takes the view that a pre-decisional, presidential recommendation does not lose its exempt status, even after the President formally adopts the recommendation without modification. On the present record, however, the Court cannot discern what significance the Department attaches to the word \"draft,\" and, to the extent it intends to distinguish between \"drafts in form\" and \"drafts in substance,\" the Department has not briefed any of the potentially relevant legal issues. Moreover,\n   because the Department has failed to release a final, signed version of the letter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80 at 32 n.14, an unsigned-but otherwise final-version of the letter would add materially to FOIA's goal of shedding light on workings of government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178611\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/214/#p242\">\n    437 U.S. at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178611\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/214/#p242\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. 77 at 11. Like the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, SAE focuses on the Department's decision to withhold \"drafts,\" but, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs, SAE offers little reason to question the Department's characterization of the records at issue. Instead, SAE simply asserts in categorical terms that the descriptions contained in the Department's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index fail to provide \"sufficient context with which to evaluate\" the Department's reliance on the deliberative-process privilege, and it offers six examples to support its contention. Dkt. 77 at 12 (citing Documents C05429202, C05475534, C05475572, C05475573, C05517719, C05999326).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The deliberative process privilege \"covers recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

Review of the six examples that SAE cites shows that the Department has carried this burden with respect to the deliberative process withholdings that SAE challenge (other than the three withholdings, discussed above, that the\n   <em>\n    Canning\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have also challenged).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The first example-Document C05429202-is a draft of a paper regarding \"how certain terms [would] be defined for the purposes of\" PSD-11.

Although a document that is \"predecisional at the time it is prepared ... can lose that status if it is adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue,\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that does not mean that every suggestion, proposal, or draft that precedes a final decision-and that is consistent with that decision-loses its protected status.
