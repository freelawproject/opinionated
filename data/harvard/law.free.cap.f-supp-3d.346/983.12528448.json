The Student-Athlete Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Marie Mayerova is a senior at EMU who joined the women's tennis team her freshman year and played until EMU terminated the team. A native of the Czech Republic, Mayerova was recruited by EMU and received a full athletic scholarship. Mayerova contends that her student visa restricts her to attending EMU and that \"she does not have the resources to effectively transfer.\" Doc. 3-1 at 5. According to Mayerova, a transfer would require her to return to the Czech Republic in order to re-apply for a new student visa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ariana Chretien is a junior at EMU who was recruited for the women's softball team, which she joined her freshman year. Chretien receives a partial scholarship and is studying aviation, a less common major. After EMU disbanded the softball team, Chretien received interest from other schools, but testified that they either did not offer her major or did not have scholarships available.

Athletic Opportunities at Eastern Michigan University\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately 12,700 undergraduates attend EMU, which is a member of the Mid-American Conference. Defendants assert that 59.5% of undergraduates for the 2017-2018 school year were women, and 40.5% were men. At that time, EMU had 729 undergraduate student-athletes participating in varsity athletics on twenty-one teams. Four hundred and six men, or 55.7% of EMU student-athletes, participated on nine teams: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, swimming and diving, track and field (indoor and outdoor), and wrestling. (Doc. 13-3 at PageID 178). Three hundred twenty-three women, or 44.3% of EMU student-athletes, participated on twelve teams: basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field (indoor and outdoor), and volleyball.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   EMU has operated with a budget deficit for the last seven years. The university attributes its financial struggles to declining state support and shifts in population and enrollment. Because EMU's athletic department is not self-sufficient, the university's financial problems have impacted athletic funding. In March 2018, EMU decided to reduce athletic spending by $2 million by eliminating four teams: men's wrestling, men's swimming and diving, women's tennis, and women's softball.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 34 at PageID 1002, 1004). Eighty-three student-athletes participated on these teams during the 2017-2018 school year - fifty-eight men and twenty-five women. (Doc. 13-3 at PageID 177).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In making the decision to eliminate teams, EMU sought to retain NCAA Division 1 standing and remain in the Mid-American Conference. This required maintaining sixteen sports, including football, men's and women's basketball, and volleyball, as well as at least six male sports. EMU avers that remaining in the Mid-American Conference \"adds value to EMU degrees and provides a financial benefit to the University,\" which would incur substantial costs if it were to exit the conference. (Doc. 34 at 2.) EMU also considered the costs associated with each sport, including the cost per athlete. Although EMU tried \"to be as least impactful ... as possible\" to female athletic participation, it claims that it could not achieve its budgetary goals by eliminating men's teams alone. Tr. at 84-85, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   EMU announced the teams' elimination on March 20, 2018. Student-athletes could choose to transfer without sacrificing any period of their NCAA eligibility or remain at EMU and continue to receive their athletic and academic scholarship aid. (Doc. 13-3 at PageID 180).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At that time, the softball team had seventeen members. (Doc. 13-3 at PageID 178). Four members exhausted their NCAA eligibility after the spring 2018 season and at least one is transferring.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Five, including plaintiff Chretien, indicated an intent to return to EMU.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The tennis team had eight members in the spring of 2018, five of whom have exhausted their NCAA eligibility.

In response, plaintiffs rely on the testimony of Chretien and former tennis coach Jason Wiseman, who claim that both sports could field teams with returning players and walk-on athletes. Chretien testified that eleven softball players, including pitchers and catchers, remain on campus, which would allow EMU to field a team. Tr. at 67. The softball season generally includes nonconference games in the fall, and conference games in the spring.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since March, EMU has taken actions to wind down the teams. Every full-time coach involved in the four eliminated teams was terminated and signed a severance agreement.

The roster management plan also called for an expansion of opportunities in softball (5) and tennis (2), which were eliminated in 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants' 2014 roster management plan is of limited utility in assessing EMU's history of program expansion. Although the plan evidences EMU's recent intent to expand opportunities for women and increase the athletic participation rate, EMU has not provided information demonstrating that the goals outlined in the plan were met. Further, the roster plans appear to differ from the actual number of student athletes. For example, EMU asserts that there were 406 male and 323 female student-athletes in 2017-2018. The roster plan's target numbers for the same year are 345 men and 294 women. Because they lack concrete numbers and context, the roster plans do not assist the court in finding a history of program expansion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Next, the court reviews actual numbers of EMU female athletes over the past several years. Pursuant to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, EMU has certified enrollment numbers and student athlete participation data, by gender, to the U.S. Department of Education since 2003.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20668.41\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 668.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1)(i).

For the 2017-18 school year, there were 323 female athletes. EMU did not provide data for any time prior to 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants claim that EMU is expanding opportunities because EMU had an average of 222.6 female student-athletes between 2007 and 2011 and an average of 313.4 between 2012 and 2016. Defendants do not articulate why they have created a seemingly arbitrary comparison of two groups of five-year averages. Defendants claim these figures show that \"EMU increased women's participation by an average of 90 student-athletes per year.\" (Doc. 34 at 10). Defendants' assertion is belied by a review of their own statistics, which show that EMU never added 90 female athletes in a single year, let alone an average of 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   According to the above chart, the number of female athletes increased from 246 in 2003 to 298 in 2004, then dropped for several years to a low of 195 in 2008. The number of female athletes increased again from 222 in 2009 to 316 in 2012, remaining relatively close to that figure until reaching 323 in 2017. EMU expects the number of female athletes to be 306 in the coming school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The court notes that increases in the number of female athletes at EMU have generally been accompanied by increases in the number of male athletes, resulting in little change in the percentage of female athletes over the years. The highest percentage of female athletes was in 2003, at 48.62 percent. Thereafter, the percentage has hovered in the 40 to 44 percent range, while the percentage of female undergraduates has ranged from approximately 56 to 60 percent. The disparity between the percentage of female undergraduates and the percentage of female athletes has fluctuated between 12 and 20 percent, showing no significant improvement between 2009 to 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs have provided data regarding the number of women participating in each EMU sport between 2003 and 2016. (Doc. 17-3). This information includes participation figures for women's basketball, track (combined), golf, gymnastics, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, and volleyball. Because the filed exhibit is not legible, Plaintiffs provided the court with an electronic copy of the spreadsheet. The data are reproduced in the chart below:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-91\">EADA Basket-ball Track Golf Gymnastics Rowing Soccer Softball Swim Tennis Volley-ball Survey and Year Dive 2003 14 37 10 19 72 26 16 31 7 14 2004 15 94 10 21 51 25 25 30 10 17 2005 15 70 9 17 30 25 34 25 7 15 2006 14 68 9 19 51 24 17 25 9 14 2007 15 22 9 20 37 29 16 27 8 13 2008 18 28 7 20 35 22 15 31 7 12 2009 23 39 10 20 37 20 19 31 8 15 2010 14 39 10 22 53 24 23 32 8 15 2011 15 81 9 23 33 22 23 31 9 14 2012 24 96 9 23 54 24 21 37 10 18 2013 15 88 9 23 76 26 17 35 8 16 2014 25 97 9 22 50 28 21 35 9 15 2015 19 105 9 18 49 28 22 50 8 14 2016 16 109 7 18 54 20 23 36 9 13</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Between 2003 and 2016, basketball, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball experienced minor fluctuations in the overall number of participants. The swimming and diving team was often relatively consistent in size until an increase in\n   2015 that did not last into 2016. The rowing and track teams have seen significant fluctuations in size; both increases and decreases, although track has been generally on an upward trend since 2010. The figures Defendants submitted regarding the number of athletes in the 2017-2018 school year suggests that the size of these teams has remained consistent between 2016 and 2018. (Doc. 34-3 at PageID 1159).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The participation numbers do not provide clear support for EMU's contention that it has a history of expanding athletic opportunities for women. Part two of the test is not just concerned with an increase in the number of women's opportunities, however. The test also directs the court to consider whether the expansion in women's opportunities is \"\n   <em>\n    demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex\n   </em>\n   .\" 1996 Clarification at 3 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants do not articulate how they have attempted to respond to the developing interests and abilities of female EMU students. EMU has not, for example, explained how its goal to increase track rosters is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of women. Nor has EMU articulated what those developing interests and abilities might be. EMU has not conducted interest surveys to gauge student interest in athletics for the past few years. (Doc. 34-2 at PageID 1141).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The court also considers EMU's history of adding or upgrading women's teams. EMU has no recent record of adding women's teams and has not provided evidence regarding whether students have requested such opportunities. Women's field hockey and men's gymnastics were eliminated in 1988. Women's rowing was added and men's tennis and soccer were eliminated in 2000. Since 2000, the number of women's teams remained constant until the elimination of softball and tennis in 2018. (Doc. 13-2 PageID 166.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court next considers whether EMU has established a continuing practice of program expansion. The administering agency advises the court to consider two factors: (1) EMU's current implementation and effective communication of a nondiscriminatory policy for requesting new sports, and (2) EMU's current implementation of a plan of program expansion that is responsive to developing interests and abilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendants make no showing regarding a policy for requesting new sports at EMU. Relatedly, Defendants do not establish that such a policy is effectively communicated to students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   To show a continuing plan of program expansion, Defendants rely on \"a new, expanded\" roster management plan (\"2018 Plan\"). The 2018 Plan comprises four charts showing that EMU intends to add 56 women student athletes to its existing teams (including 30 to the existing 65 on the crew team) by fiscal year 2023. EMU is also considering creating a women's lacrosse team in fiscal year 2021, which could provide 35 additional opportunities for women student-athletes. EMU contends that it expects 306 male and 306 female athletes for 2018-19, which would raise its participation rate for female athletes to 50 percent. EMU has not provided actual numbers to the court for the upcoming season, however. EMU also has not explained how this roster management plan is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of student-athletes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Other than the estimates projected in the roster management plans, Defendants have not provided further information supporting their plan for program expansion such that the court may assess Defendants' past success in meeting their targets, whether the targets are realistic, and whether adding athletes to existing teams is responsive to the interests and abilities\n   of female athletes. Without additional information, the court is unable to assess whether EMU's estimates reflect a meaningful expansion of the program, particularly when EMU's actual numbers do not reflect a history of expansion. Nor is the court able to assess whether EMU's proposal to add an additional sport (lacrosse) or more athletes (rowers) is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of current or future athletes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Based upon this record, the court is unable to conclude that Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating a history and continuing practice of expansion. The actual numbers reveal a participation disparity that has lingered for at least fifteen years, with no evidence of a serious effort to address it. In light of this history, it is difficult for the court to credit EMU's 2018 roster management plan as anything more than \"mere promises to expand its program ... at some time in the future,\" which is insufficient to satisfy part two of the Three-Part Test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1996 Clarification at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants argue that the elimination of women's tennis, softball, men's wrestling, and men's swimming and diving will serve to increase the female participation rate to 50 percent, thus demonstrating a move toward proportionality and Title IX compliance. However,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   OCR will not find a history and continuing practice of program expansion where an institution increases the proportional participation opportunities for the underrepresented sex by reducing opportunities for the overrepresented sex alone or by reducing participation opportunities for the overrepresented sex to a proportionately greater degree than for the underrepresented sex. This is because part two considers an\n   <em>\n    institution's good faith remedial efforts through actual program expansion.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   1996 Clarification at 3-4 (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515270\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/998/824/#p831\">\n    998 F.2d at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he ordinary meaning of the word 'expansion' may not be twisted to find compliance under this prong when schools have increased the relative percentages of women participating in athletics by making cuts in both men's and women's sports programs.\");\n   <em>\n    Cohen II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515723\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/888/#p895\">\n    991 F.2d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]ven balanced use of the budget-paring knife runs afoul of Title IX where, as here, the fruits of a university's athletic program remain ill-distributed after the trimming takes place.\").

Given the limited information provided by EMU, the court is unable to conclude that the university has engaged in good faith remedial efforts through actual program expansion. EMU has not met its burden of demonstrating that it satisfies part two of the Three-Part Test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Part Three - Interests and Abilities Fully Accommodated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Under part three, the court considers whether women's \"interests and abilities have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.\" Defendants do not argue that EMU satisfies this part of the test. Indeed, Plaintiffs, as members of eliminated teams, represent interests and abilities that are not effectively accommodated by the present program. Accordingly, part three of the Three-Part Test does not provide safe harbor for Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs have met their burden and established that EMU does not provide substantially proportionate participation opportunities and that there is unmet interest in athletic opportunities. Defendants have failed to meet their burden to establish compliance with either the second or third prong of the Three-Part Test. Plaintiffs are therefore likely to succeed on the merits of their Title IX claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim of irreparable harm is based on the inability to participate in their sports and the alleged barriers to transferring to other schools. Plaintiffs also argue that irreparable harm is often presumed in cases involving the enforcement of civil rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendants argue that there is no irreparable harm because the student-athletes may keep their scholarships and have not shown that they are unable to transfer. They state that Mayerova would be able to alter her visa without leaving the United States and Chretien could attend another institution, like Western Michigan University, that offers an aviation program and a softball team. Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs' delay in filing this action undermines a finding of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In general, courts have found that the elimination of a women's team creates irreparable harm when the plaintiffs have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their Title IX claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biediger v.

This conclusion is not altered by Defendants' argument regarding delay. EMU announced the decision to cut the softball and tennis teams on March 20, 2018. After attempting to resolve the matter short of litigation and having difficulty finding counsel willing to sue the university, Plaintiffs filed their complaint and motion for preliminary injunction on June 15, 2018.

The court recognizes this financial burden, as the cost to reinstate the teams is not insignificant. The court notes, however, that Defendants have not provided information regarding EMU's entire athletic budget, precluding a complete assessment of whether the reinstatement of the teams would present an undue burden on EMU.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022803477\">\n    2003 WL 22803477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *14 (\"In examining this fact, courts generally look to the school's athletic budget and consider the overall expense of reinstating the program[s] as compared with the entire athletic budget.\");\n   <em>\n    Favia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405783\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/812/578/#p584\">\n    812 F.Supp. at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no undue harm to defendants where the \"budget, while shrinking, has space for reallocation and cutbacks in other areas\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Moreover, the court finds that the financial burden on EMU is outweighed by the harm to Plaintiffs if the teams are not reinstated. Indeed, financial hardship is not a defense to a Title IX violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horner v. Kentucky High Sch. Athletic Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303968\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/265/#p275\">\n    43 F.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (6th Cir. 1994) (an institution \"may not simply plead limited resources to excuse the fact that there are fewer opportunities for girls than for boys\"). Although it is mindful of and sympathetic to EMU's need to cut costs, the court concludes that the balance of equities favors Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants assert that the public interest strongly favors deferring to EMU's budgetary decision. Defendants rely upon\n   <em>\n    Equity in Athletics I,\n   </em>\n   which determined that the public interest \"weighs in favor of permitting colleges and universities to chart their own course in\n   providing athletic opportunities without judicial interference or oversight,\n   <em>\n    absent a clear showing that they are in violation of the law.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1087107\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/504/88/#p94\">\n    504 F.Supp.2d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gonyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11294578\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/837/989/\">\n    837 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   996 ) (emphasis added). The court acknowledges that the public interest is generally served by allowing public universities to determine how to allocate financial resources, but, as stated above, there is a clear showing that Defendants are in violation of Title IX. Moreover, \"the public interest demands that [EMU] comply with federal law and in this instance that means compliance with Title IX.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022803477\">\n    2003 WL 22803477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *15.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802833\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/809/978/#p983\">\n    809 F.Supp. at 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"the public interest will be served by vindicating a legal interest that Congress has determined to be an important one\");\n   <em>\n    Favia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405783\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/812/578/#p584\">\n    812 F.Supp. at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The public has a strong interest in prevention of any violation of constitutional rights.\"). \"Title IX does not purport to override financial necessity. Yet, the pruning of athletic budgets cannot take place solely in comptrollers' offices, isolated from the legislative and regulatory imperatives that Title IX imposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515723\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/888/#p895\">\n    991 F.2d at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these reasons, the court finds that the public interest is best served by upholding the goals of Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Modification of the Status Quo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendants argue that a preliminary injunction is disfavored here because the softball and tennis teams have already been eliminated and plaintiffs seek to modify the status quo rather than preserve it.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3866734\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/579/831/#p855\">\n    579 F.Supp.2d 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 855 (E.D. Mich. 2008) (noting motions seeking to modify rather than maintain the status quo should be \"more closely scrutinized\"). The court has indeed closely scrutinized Plaintiffs' request and has recognized the burden on EMU's budget and autonomy, but has nonetheless determined that a careful balancing of the preliminary injunction factors favors granting Plaintiffs' requested relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802833\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/809/978/#p983\">\n    809 F.Supp. at 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]ven if the current configuration of teams were considered the status quo, restoring women's gymnastics and volleyball to full varsity status through a preliminary injunction is the only effective tool available to this Court to prevent irreparable harm.\"). Further, the court is confident that practical impediments to reinstatement can be overcome. Plaintiffs \"merely seek what the law requires, equal athletic opportunities.... [Reinstatement] is the least the Athletic Department can do in light of its legal violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Favia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405783\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/812/578/#p584\">\n    812 F.Supp. at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 3) is GRANTED. The court recognizes that its ability to craft a solution is limited and that often the parties are in a better position to accommodate the interests of both sides. Accordingly, the parties shall attend a status conference with the court on October 23, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. to discuss the implementation of the court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
