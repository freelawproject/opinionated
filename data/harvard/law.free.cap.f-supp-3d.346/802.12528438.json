App. 333-357 (USFWS Red Wolf Recovery/Species Survival Plan). To that end, USFWS issued an internal document in January 1999 entitled \"Guidelines for Applying the Current Red Wolf Rule (April 13, 1995) to Requests to Remove red wolves from private land.\" Pl. App. 723. The 1999 Guidelines distinguished between problem wolves and non-problem wolves. Problem wolves are wolves which have engaged in actions that directly caused the loss of personal property and wolves which are exhibiting inappropriate behavior, such as a tolerance of humans, which may suggest the wolf would become a more serious problem. Under the 1999 Guidelines, reports of problem wolves would be addressed by field personnel within forty-eight hours, and problem wolves would be captured and removed if feasible, or authorization to landowners to effect a lethal or non-lethal take would be given.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Requests to retrieve non-problem wolves from private land, however, would be addressed within manpower limits, and whether traps would be set to capture the non-problem wolf would be subject to certain criteria.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The 1999 Guidelines for implementing the red wolf 10(j) rule were drafted in response to continuous requests from two or three private landowners to remove red wolves from their property, in combination with the increase in red wolf population and the logistical and economic difficulties with continuing to try to honor all requests for red wolf removal. Pl. App. 731. USFWS noted that removal of non-problem wolves \"may be detrimental to the conservation of the species by preventing natural expansion and recovery of the species,\n   and by contributing to the establishment of coyotes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. App. 723. In essence, beginning in the late 1990s, USFWS focused efforts on addressing landowner complaints about problem wolves, and shifted away from making efforts to remove every wolf identified on private property. The 1999 Guidelines referenced addressing landowner concerns regarding the presence of non-problem wolves primarily in terms of capture and removal and other non-lethal take methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Coyotes were not present in the Red Wolf Recovery Area when the red wolf reintroduction program was initiated. As the presence of coyotes in the area increased in the late 1990s, USFWS implemented an adaptive management work plan to prevent coyote-red wolf interbreeding, which included the sterilization of coyotes in the wild and use of sterile coyotes as placeholders; placeholder coyotes would hold territories as against other coyotes territories until the placeholder territories were taken over by red wolves either naturally or by management action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. App. 500. In 2005, the Red Wolf Recovery Adaptive Work Plan included the dual goals of reducing interbreeding between red wolves and coyotes and building and maintaining the wild red wolf population in the Northeastern North Carolina recovery area. Pl. App. 808-814. Pup fostering, or placing captive-born red wolf pups in the den of wild wolf parents, was determined to be a \"significant and useful population management tool in red wolf recovery\". Pl. App. 470. In the 2007 Red Wolf 5-year Status Review, Pl. App. 491-548, the reintroduction of red wolves to the Red Wolf Recovery Area was determined to be a \"remarkable success,\" with nearly 130 red wolves in the wild.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Recall[ing] that wolves were rather easily exterminated from the U.S. during the predator control efforts of the early 20th century, while at the same time the range of the coyote increased,\" Pl. App. 820, the 2010-2012 Red Wolf Adaptive Management Plan recognized that eliminating the breeding potential of eastern coyotes within the red wolf area would support increasing the red wolf population. Pl App. 820-827. These same goals of reducing coyote interbreeding and increasing the wild red wolf population were repeated in the 2013-2015 Red Wolf Adaptive Management Plan. Pl. App. 846-859. Other than coyote interbreeding, the 2007 Status Report cited human interaction and gunshot mortality as the primary areas of concern for the viability of the wild red wolf population. Pl. App. 523-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 6, 2014, USFWS issued the first lethal take authorization to a private landowner under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(v). Pl. App. 938-940. The authorization was in a letter from Leopoldo Miranda, Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services. Pl. App. 938-940. USFWS renewed the February 2014 take authorization twice - once on September 23, 2014, and again on April 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In September 2014, USFWS noted that, over a period of several weeks, 228 letters requesting that red wolves be removed from private land had been received, Pl. App. 949, and by October 30, 2014, USFWS had received 405 individual requests to remove red wolves from private land. Pl. App. 951. On follow-up from USFWS personnel, however, it was determined that numerous individuals who had signed letters had thought they were signing a coyote hunting petition, while others stated that that they did not have red wolves on their property, or that they did not object to having red wolves on their property; other requests for removal contained no contact information or were duplicate\n   requests from the same address. Pl. App. 949-951.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Citing population decline and growing stakeholder concerns, USFWS hired the Wildlife Management Institute \"to conduct an independent evaluation of the Red Wolf Recovery Program that focused on supporting science, program management, and human dimensions.\" [DE 88 at 11] Miranda-Castro Decl. \u00b6 4. On January 29, 2015, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission passed resolutions requesting that defendants declare the red wolf extinct in the wild in North Carolina and terminate the Red Wolf Reintroduction Program for free-ranging red wolves. Pl. App. 972-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Beginning in the winter of 2015, USFWS stopped conducting coyote sterilizations. Pl. App. 23, Harrison Dep. at 96. Releases of red wolves into Eastern North Carolina were also discontinued in 2015, as was pup fostering. Benjamin Dep. at 227-28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [DE 88 at 271] (June 30, 2015 Press Release: Service Halts Red Wolf Reintroductions Pending Examination of Recovery Program).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A second take authorization was granted by Pete Benjamin, Field Supervisor, to two additional landowners on May 20, 2015, Pl. App. 1006-7, which resulted in the lethal take of a red wolf on June 17, 2015. Pl. App. 1009. The red wolf that was killed was a non-problem, six-year old denning mother. Pl. App. 1013. In June 2015, USFWS issued an internal memorandum providing revised procedures for responding to landowner requests for removal of red wolves. Pl. App. 1020-22. The 2015 procedures provide that lethal take authorizations for specific wolves will be provided to landowners where removed wolves return to the subject property or where reasonable efforts to capture known wolves are unsuccessful. Unlike the 1999 Guidelines, the 2015 procedures do not distinguish between problem and non-problem wolves.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On June 30, 2015, USFWS publically announced that it would be conducting a \"thorough and deliberate evaluation of the red wolf recovery program\" and confirmed its commitment to \"get[ting] the science right, [and] rebuild[ing] trust with our neighbors ... state partners and many stakeholders ....\" [DE 88 at 272].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2015, USFWS estimated there were 50-75 red wolves in the wild, and the last publically released population estimate shows an estimated 46-60 red wolves in the wild. Pl. App. 1114. Plaintiffs instituted this action in November 2015, and the Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the take of non-problem wolves on September 28, 2016. As of November 2017, as few as two or three breeding pairs of red wolves remain in the wild population. Pl. App. 258-59, Benjamin Dep. II at 145-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In May 2017, USFWS published an advance notice of its intent to develop a proposed rule, prepare a NEPA document, and convene two public scoping meetings. Miranda-Castro Decl. \u00b6 7. USFWS completed a five-year status review of the red wolf on April 23, 2018, and intends to finalize its NEPA document and to either finalize or withdraw its proposed rule by November 30, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2017.84\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12, 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Amd. Cmpl. \u00b6\u00b6 146-151. At bottom, plaintiffs challenge defendants' actions in authorizing the lethal or non-lethal take of red wolves on private land without first satisfying the requirements of the governing regulations and in shifting their efforts and administering the red wolf rules and regulations in a manner resulting in a failure to provide for the conservation of the wild red wolf population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In their motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs asks this Court to find that defendants are violating and will continue to violate the ESA and its implementing regulations as well as NEPA. Plaintiffs further request that the Court, pursuant to its equitable authority: maintain the injunction against the capturing and killing of non-problem wolves as issued by the Court as a preliminary injunction; order the USFWS to, within thirty days of the date of entry of this order, reinstate the coyote sterilization program and red wolf releases or explain why such action is not necessary for the conservation of the red wolf; and require that any subsequent modification to the historic implementation of the red wolf rule or the longstanding red wolf adaptive management program go through the required analysis under the ESA, NEPA, and the Administrative Procedures Act before they take effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, defendants argue that, due to recent changes to management of the red wolf population, plaintiffs' claims are moot and the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider them. Defendants further argue that, if plaintiffs' claims are not found to be moot, the USFWS' actions regarding the red wolves comply with the ESA and NEPA; defendants also contend that plaintiffs' request for mandatory injunctive relief must be denied because it lacks any basis in law or equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I.

As the Court could not order defendants to conduct the Section 4 five-year review because it was conducted in April 2018, the Court, in its discretion, finds that its inability to order an effective remedy has rendered this claim prudentially moot.

The May 2015 take authorization cites no direct evidence of wolves on the subject property. However, in both authorizations, after noting that the properties are adjacent to a National Wildlife Refuge on which red wolves are known to occur, USFWS states that, in light of staffing commitments and lack of access to trap on the subject property, USFWS was foreclosed from pursuing animals that may be on the subject land \"and\n   <em>\n    in that sense\n   </em>\n   must abandon efforts to capture and relocate the animal ourselves.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. App. 939 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The 2014 and 2015 take authorizations were issued because landowners had refused to give USFWS access to continue trapping or engaging in other efforts. Abandonment of USFWS efforts based on a landowner's refusal to grant USFWS access to their property cannot serve as a proper basis for issuing a lethal take authorization under \u00a7 17.84(c)(4)(v), as doing so would impermissibly tip the scales in favor of public demand and away from USFWS' congressionally mandated goal to recover and rehabilitate the red wolf in the wild. In addition to requiring USFWS to\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   abandon attempts to capture red wolves on private land prior to issuing a take authorization, the red wolf 10(j) rule contemplates that USFWS would have abandoned efforts to capture\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   red wolves prior to issuing a take authorization. The 2015 take authorization, for example, plainly states that USFWS has not even confirmed the presence of a red wolf on the subject property. USFWS' expansive reading of the circumstances which would support issuing a take - including lethal take - authorization to a private landowner under the red wolf 10(j) rule impermissibly broadens the scope of wolves subject to take authorizations, and therefore conflicts with the ESA's \"purpose to protect endangered and threatened\" species.\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

The population decrease coincides with defendants' making internal revisions to its guidelines and management policies, in response at least in part to mounting public pressure against red wolf recovery efforts, and defendants have failed to proffer any other evidence which could be deemed responsible for such change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Allowing the wild red wolf population to continue to decline, while having access to methodologies which were previously successful in increasing or maintaining the wild population of the species, is an interpretation and application of the red wolf 10(j) rule that \"is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is undisputed that the reintroduction of the red wolf into the Red Wolf Recovery Area is not without its challenges, but absent a change in Congress' mandate or a decision to delist or reclassify the red wolf under the ESA, the recent USFWS decisions to discontinue successful population management tools while increasing the likelihood that landowner lethal takes will be approved for wolves which historically would not have been subject to take, amount to a failure comply with its affirmative duty to \"carry out conservation measures until conservation [is] no longer necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

Moreover, as was aptly stated by USFWS in 1999, \"[w]ildlife are not the property of landowners but belong to the public and are managed by Federal and State governments for the public good.
