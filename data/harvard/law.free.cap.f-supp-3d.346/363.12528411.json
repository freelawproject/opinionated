Docket Item 1. The Act provides that it is \"unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

More specifically, the parties dispute the meaning of the term \"analogue\" under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(vi) and whether butyryl fentanyl is \"any analogue of\" fentanyl under the specific penalty provision. Although the Act defines the term \"controlled substance analogue,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 802 (32), it does not define the term \"analogue\" or \"any analogue of fentanyl.\" And by defining \"controlled substance analogue\" without defining \"analogue,\" the drafters created a thorny definitional problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Under the Act, the term \"controlled substance analogue\" excludes \"a controlled substance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Butyryl fentanyl is a controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Butyryl Fentanyl and Beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl Into Schedule I,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029492\">\n    81 Fed.

Does that mean it is not an \"analogue of fentanyl\" because fentanyl is itself a controlled substance? Although the result may seem counterintuitive, this Court agrees with the government and concludes that although butyryl fentanyl is not a controlled substance analogue, it is an analogue of fentanyl. Therefore, the Act does not preclude a controlled substance such as butyryl fentanyl from being charged as an \"analogue of fentanyl\" under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 15, 2017, McCray was charged in a three-count indictment.

In this instance, the statutory term used in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(b)(vi) is \"any analogue of [fentanyl],\" not \"controlled substance analogue.\" The Act does not define the term \"analogue\" or \"any analogue of fentanyl.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court considers the term's plain and ordinary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ordinary meaning of the term \"analogue\" supports the government's reading of the statute. In the chemistry context relevant here, the term analogue means \"a chemical compound structurally similar to another but differing often by a single element of the same valence and group of the periodic table as the element it replaces.\"\n   <em>\n    Analogue\n   </em>\n   , WEBSTER'S NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (1985). Nothing in the dictionary definition of analogue suggests that butyryl fentanyl cannot be an analogue of fentanyl; in fact, the chemistry of the two substances suggests that it is. Thus, according to the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"analogue,\" the government may prove that butyryl fentanyl is an analogue of fentanyl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant's argument to the contrary has some intuitive appeal to it. After all, fentanyl is a controlled substance and so the government's argument leads to the conclusion that an analogue of a controlled substance (that is, fentanyl) is not a \"controlled substance analogue.\" That is a conclusion only a lawyer can love. But this Court is convinced that it is the correct one, based on the science, based on the dictionary definition of analogue, and based on the fact that \"controlled substance analogue\" is a term of art under the statute. What is more, other canons of construction lead to that same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In this scenario, the manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute the substance violates the Act under \u00a7 813 because the substance meets the definition of \"controlled substance analogue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 802(32). The defendant's reasoning and interpretation of the statute would put the stricter penalties under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(vi) at play because the substance is an analogue of fentanyl that has not been scheduled as a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the second scenario, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration has exercised his authority under \u00a7 811 to add butyryl fentanyl to the schedule of controlled substances because he found \"that such a drug or substance has a potential for abuse\" and because he made the other necessary statutory findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 811. According to the defendant's interpretation of the statute, the Administrator's recognition of butyryl fentanyl as a controlled substance has the effect of eliminating the enhanced penalty under \u00a7 841(b)(1). In other words, the defendant's interpretation renders meaningless the enhanced penalty provisions for fentanyl analogues that have been scheduled as controlled substances. And this is so even though scheduling a substance as a controlled\n   substance, if anything, recognizes the potential for the substance's abuse and despite Congress's intent to protect the public by enhancing penalties for possessing and distributing such substances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Congress could not have intended such a perverse outcome: that the enhanced penalty provisions for fentanyl analogues apply only when the Administrator has not yet recognized the need to schedule the substances as controlled substances. \"[I]nterpretations of a statute which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Messina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357193\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/55/#p70\">\n    806 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oceanic Contractors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    458 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ). Here, a non-absurd interpretation not only is available but, as discussed above, is consistent with the plain meaning of the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Legislative History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, the ambiguity that gives rise to this complex discussion makes legislative history fair game. And a brief examination of the legislative history of the statute underlying this complex matter corroborates and fortifies this Court's understanding of the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The requirement that a controlled substance analogue be treated as a controlled substance, the definition of \"controlled substance analogue,\" and the enhanced penalty provisions applicable to fentanyl analogues all were amendments added to the Act in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L No. 99-570 \u00a7\u00a7 1002 (amending \u00a7 841(b)(1) ), 1202 (inserting \u00a7 813), 1203 (inserting definition of controlled substance analogue). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was omnibus legislation that included a number of legislative changes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Subtitle A of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 included the Narcotics Penalties and Enforcement Act of 1986, which added the enhanced penalties for fentanyl analogues.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1009. Subtitle E of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 included the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986, which added the provisions regarding the treatment of \"controlled substance analogues.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 1201-1204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before it was included in the House's version of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the House Judiciary Committee approved a separate bill-the Narcotic Penalties and Enforcement Act of 1986-which contained language substantially similar to what was ultimately enacted as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act. H.R. 5394, 99th Cong., (1986). The House Judiciary Committee Report accompanying that legislation explained that the term of \"fentanyl analogue\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   does not include fentanyl,\n   <em>\n    nor does it include controlled substance analogues\n   </em>\n   (as defined in the Designer Drug Enforcement Act of 1986)\n   <em>\n    which may be analogues of fentanyl.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   H.R. REP. NO. 99-845, at 17 n.2 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Committee's report demonstrates that when the statute was enacted, Congress considered the term \"fentanyl analogue\" to be different from the more generalized term \"controlled substance analogue\" even though fentanyl is a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In other words, the legislative history shows that Congress considered a controlled substance analogue and an analogue of fentanyl to be definitionally and conceptually different. Again, that is a distinction that only a lawyer-or, perhaps, a legislator-can love. But it is a distinction that Congress intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(vi) permits the government to prove that butyryl fentanyl is an analogue of fentanyl. Therefore, the Court respectfully rejects Judge McCarthy's recommendation to grant the defendant's motion in part. The defendant's motion to dismiss counts 2 and 3, Docket Item 25, is DENIED. The case is referred back to Judge McCarthy for further proceedings consistent with the referral order of August 17, 2017, Docket Item 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Act uses the chemical term for fentanyl: \"N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] propenamide.\" See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(B)(vi).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    It also imposes the same penalty for violations involving four hundred grams or more of fentanyl and one hundred grams or more of any fentanyl analogue.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(A)(vi).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Designer Drug Enforcement Act of 1986, H.R. 5246 was a bill that was reported to the House by the House Judiciary Committee in 1986.
