For the reasons set forth below, the Court will GRANT Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   People Ready, the successor entity of Labor Ready, is a staffing company that helps place unemployed blue-collar workers with job opportunities in the local community. Dkt. 49-1, p. 2 (Pg. ID 744). Traditionally, workers would arrive at the labor hall around 5:00 a.m. each morning to see whether there was any work available, and jobs would be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at p. 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pg. ID 745). Today, People Ready uses a messaging platform called WorkAlert to inform workers about potential jobs via text message.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hence, workers no longer need to come into the office to learn about job opportunities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If a People Ready branch employee opts to use WorkAlert to fill an open position, the first step in placing a worker with a customer is for the employee to manually open the WorkAlert web browser application on their desktop computer and enter their log-in credentials.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at p. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pg. ID 746). Next, the branch employee is directed to the \"work search\" screen, where they must input criteria to search for potential workers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at pp. 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pg. ID 746-47). The branch employee then hits the \"search\" button, which returns a list of potential workers to whom the branch employee can consider sending a text message.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at p. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pg. ID 747). Once the branch employee is satisfied with the pool of potential workers, the employee will manually compose a text message that will go out to the workers who have opted into the WorkAlert program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Defendants' Director of Platform Solutions -- Cindi Knutson -- there is no way to send a text message through the WorkAlert system without the several steps of human intervention described above.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at p. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pg.

Even more, WorkAlert lacks the capability to randomly or sequentially text potential workers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff applied to join Labor Ready on July 7, 2011. Dkt. No. 49-2, p. 6-7 (Pg. ID 754-55). When he did so, Plaintiff completed and signed an application form that contained a provision entitled, \"Consent for Telephone Contact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at p. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pg.

That provision stated, \"I give Labor Ready my express permission and consent to call my phone number that I provided on my employment application for the sole purpose of alerting me to new job opportunities at Labor Ready.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since joining Labor Ready, Plaintiff asserts he has received over 5,600 text messages from Defendants through the WorkAlert system. Dkt. No. 50, p. 7 (Pg. ID 945). Plaintiff further asserts that on several occasions he revoked his consent to continue receiving those text messages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, on September 17, 2016, February 23, 2017, and February 26, 2017, Plaintiff texted the WorkAlert system, \"Please don't contact me anymore.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50-4. In addition, Plaintiff has two documents from Defendants' branch employee -- Kristina Bellizzi -- dated February 22, 2017, indicating a request that Plaintiff be opted out of receiving messages through the WorkAlert system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50-8. Despite this, Plaintiff has continued to receive text messages from WorkAlert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50-5, pp. 29-51 (Pg. ID 1002-24); Dkt. No. 50-6. At the same time, it appears that Plaintiff opted back in to receiving text messages and continued to accept jobs via WorkAlert.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Through the discovery process, Plaintiff learned that Defendants' WorkAlert system acts in conjunction with a third-party aggregator called mBlox. Dkt. No. 50, p. 7 (Pg. ID 945). According to Defendants, \"Text messages leave Work Alert, go to mBlox (SMS provider) and are then sent to each worker's wireless carrier to be delivered to the individual's cell phone.\" Dkt. No. 50-9, p. 2 (Pg. ID 1072). Plaintiff now claims that mBlox is a fully-automated-text-messaging system regulated by the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50, p. 7 (Pg. ID 945). And because Defendants' WorkAlert system acts in conjunction with mBlox, Plaintiff suggests Defendants' text messages violate section 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The TCPA, in relevant part, prohibits any person from using an automatic telephone dialing system to make a call or send a text message to another person without that person's consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii) ;\n   <em>\n    Keating v.

Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, Defendants have moved for summary judgment raising four arguments. Dkt. No. 49.

ID 741).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, the Court agrees that Defendants' WorkAlert system does not qualify as an automatic telephone dialing system under the plain language of the TCPA. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Defendants are Entitled to Summary Judgment because there is no Evidence that its WorkAlert System is an Automatic Telephone Dialing System as Defined by the TCPA.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Through the discovery process, Plaintiff learned, \"Text messages leave Work Alert, go to mBlox (SMS provider) and are then sent to each worker's wireless carrier to be delivered to the individual's cell phone.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Instead, he argues Defendants combine its system with a third-party aggregator -- mBlox -- whose equipment is fully automated.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   This combination, Plaintiff suggests, makes Defendants liable under the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In support, Plaintiff cites to the FCC's 2015 Ruling where the Commission held, \"parties cannot circumvent the TCPA by dividing ownership of dialing equipment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10 (Pg.

ID 748). Still, Plaintiff claims Defendants' third-party aggregate, mBlox, has this capacity because mBlox uses programs such as \"Java API, XML, and SMPP servers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50, p. 9 (Pg. ID 947). However, Plaintiff's evidence in support of this claim is lacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff first offers a document titled, \"Technical Specifications.\" Dkt. No. 50-10, p. 2 (Pg. ID 1074). The document, among other things, contains the following text box:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-41\">Feature: Supported: Additional Information: API Options v Java API, XML, or SMPP</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff contends that this document shows mBlox uses Java API, XML, and SMPP. Dkt. No. 50, p. 9 (Pg. ID 947).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, Plaintiff attempts -- unsuccessfully -- to explain Java API and SMPP through a series of documents he obtained from the Internet. For example, Plaintiff offers an excerpt of an article from dzone.com titled, \"Random Number Generation in Java.\" Dkt. No. 50-12. Plaintiff provides no additional commentary on this article, and therefore, asks the Court to make the inferential leap that this document proves mBlox can randomly generate and text phone numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff offers a document from quora.com titled, \"How do SMPP server works?\" Dkt. No. 50-11, p. 3 (Pg. ID 1081). Remarkably, this document comes from an Internet forum where, it appears, anyone with an Internet connection can log on and answer posted questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff provides no information about who these individuals on the forum are or the basis for their knowledge. Moreover, Plaintiff specifically directs the Court's attention to a user's answer that reads: \"SMPP is an application layer protocol, [w]hich is used in telecom industry to message transfer.\" However, even if true, this in no way demonstrates that mBlox has the capacity to randomly or sequentially dial or text phone numbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As Defendants correctly note, Plaintiff had the opportunity to add mBlox as a co-defendant, conduct discovery to see how mBlox interacts with Defendants' WorkAlert system, and even obtain evidence directly from mBlox to see how these Java API and SMPP programs operate within its system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 52, p. 6 (Pg. ID 1098). Plaintiff did none of these things. In contrast, Defendants have presented evidence that WorkAlert lacks the capability to randomly or sequentially dial or send text messages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 49-1, p. 6 (Pg. ID 748). Hence, even viewing all the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, no reasonable juror could decide in Plaintiff's favor on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    WorkAlert and/or mBlox are not Automatic Telephone Dialing Systems Irrespective of Whether they have Automated Functions.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In a now vacated portion of its 2015 Ruling, the FCC reaffirmed that basic functions of an autodialer are to \"dial numbers without human intervention\" and \"dial thousands of numbers in a short period of time.\" 2015 Ruling,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. at 7975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Keying on this language, Plaintiff raises three arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, Plaintiff argues that WorkAlert can operate without human intervention because its third-party aggregate, mBlox, allegedly uses a program called \"Auto Retry\" that resends undelivered text messages for up to a seventy-two-hour period. Dkt. No. 50, p. 9 (Pg. ID 947). Second, Plaintiff argues WorkAlert and/or mBlox can operate without human intervention because he received text messages about\n   job opportunities when Defendants' branch office was closed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues WorkAlert and/or mBlox can operate without human intervention because he has received immediate responses from the system in less than a second.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50, p. 15 (Pg. ID 953). Specifically, Plaintiff references two occasions where he received automated opt-out messages from WorkAlert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 50-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With respect to this last argument, the Court has already held that automatic opt-out text messages are generally not actionable under the TCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.
