Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n   Insurers who paid Chevron Corporation policy proceeds for damage to an oil drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico have sued the platform's marine warranty surveyor, alleging breach of fiduciary duties, redhibition, products liability, and negligence under Louisiana law. The insurers are Lloyd's Syndicates; Arch Insurance Company (Europe) Limited; Axis Specialty Europe Limited; General Security Indemnity Company; Houston Casualty Company; Hyundai Marine and Fire Insurance Company; Infrassure Limited; International General Insurance Company Limited; International Insurance Company of Hannover Limited; Lancashire Insurance Company (UK) Limited; Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company; National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Sompo Japan Insurance Incorporated; Statoil Forsikring A.S.; Tokio Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance Company Limited; and Zurich Insurance PLC UK (together, the \"Underwriters\"). The marine warranty surveyor sued is American Global Maritime Inc. The Underwriters also sued American Global Maritime's foreign parent, grandparent, and sister companies, Global Maritime AS, Global Maritime Consultancy Limited, and Global Maritime Holdings Limited. The foreign Global Maritime companies moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and American Global Maritime moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons set out below, the court grants the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and grants the motion for summary judgment in part. As a result, the claims against Global Maritime Group, Global Maritime Consultancy, and Global Maritime Holdings are dismissed, without prejudice, and the fiduciary duty, redhibition, and products liability claims against American Global Maritime are dismissed, with prejudice. The motion for summary judgment as to the negligence claims is denied, without prejudice to the parties moving for summary judgment on an expanded record after discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, Chevron contracted with a number of companies to build an oil drilling platform with tension legs approximately 225 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Project \"Big Foot\" was designed to reach through 5,185 feet of water to oil reserves beneath the seabed. Sixteen steel tethers, or \"tendons,\" would secure the platform to the seabed. While the tendons were being installed, they would be clamped to tendon buoyance modules to keep them afloat. Each clamp had 12 bolts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Heerema Marine Contractors Nederland BV and Heerema Marine Contractors U.S. Inc. transported and installed the platform parts. (Docket Entry No. 1-1 at 13). McDermott Inc. procured and fabricated the tendons and buoyancy modules, and their components. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Detail Design Inc. designed the buoyancy modules and specified the bolts for the clamps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). FloaTEC LLC provided the \"engineering design and analysis for the pre-service conditions to which the tendons, [buoyance modules] and associated parts would be subjected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Chevron obtained insurance for the Big Foot Project. The primary policy, issued by Aon Limited, \"insure[d] against all risks of physical loss\" and \"damage\" for \"works executed anywhere in the world in the performance of all contracts relating to the Project.\" (Docket Entry No. 98-1 at 61). The covered \"works\" included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Project studies, engineering, contingencies, design, project management, procurement, fabrication, construction, prefabrication, storage, load out, loading/unloading, transportation by land, sea or air ..., towage, mating, installation, burying, hook-up, connection and/or tie-in operations, testing and commissioning, existence, initial operations and maintenance, testing, trials, pipelaying, trenching, and commissioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56). The Policy listed Chevron as one of the \"Principle Assureds\" and defined \"Other Assureds\" as \"Project managers\" or \"[a]ny other company, firm person or party, including their contractors and/or sub-contractors and/or manufacturers and/or suppliers, with whom the Assured(s) named...have entered into written contract(s) in connection with the Project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A number of insurance companies underwrote the Policy. The Underwriters were subrogated \"to all rights which the Assured may have against any person or other entity, other than Principle Assureds and Other Assureds, in respect of any claim or payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Policy terms and conditions included requiring Chevron to hire a marine warranty surveyor to \"review/attend/approve the major marine operations as appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). The Policy provided an allowance \"of 2.5% on gross premium\" for Chevron to hire a marine warranty surveyor and listed surveyors for Chevron to choose from. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). The listed candidates were London Offshore Consultants, Global Maritime, Noble Denton and Associates, and Matthews Daniel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45). Chevron chose Global Maritime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Chevron and American Global Maritime entered into a service contract that required American Global Maritime to \"review, witness, oversee, observe, approve and certify facilities as fit for transport, installation and duty pursuant to marine standards and [Chevron's Policy].\" (Docket Entry No. 98-2 at 60). American Global Maritime agreed to review and certify the tendon installation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 16, 2015, American Global Maritime issued a certificate of approval stating that it had \"reviewed procedures, checked calculations and inspected preparation for float over and installation of ... the tendons .... [and] the operation is hereby approved.\" (Docket Entry No. 84 at 246). The tendon installation went forward. On May 29, the tendons were connected to a foundation on the seabed and to the buoyancy modules. Nine of the sixteen tendons sank before they could be secured to the platform. The remaining seven tendons were taken back to shore. An inspection report stated that the clamp bolts had failed, causing the tendons to detach from the buoyancy modules and sink. The Underwriters paid Chevron approximately $500 million under the Policy for the damage the tendon detachment caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Underwriters sued FloaTEC, Heerema Marine Contractors, McDermott, and Detail Design in the 234th District Court of Harris County, Texas in May 2016. (Docket Entry No. 1-1). The Underwriters alleged that the bolts were underdesigned and failed to account for \"static load from offsets caused by loop eddy currents,\" \"fatigue load from 'VIM' and vibration,\" and \"other contributing factors,\" and that FloaTEC had failed to account for these factors when it approved the bolts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The Underwriters asserted state-law claims for negligence, gross negligence, products liability, and redhibition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19). The Underwriters amended the complaint in early October, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27), removing Detail Design as\n   a defendant and increasing their damages claim, but asserting the same factual allegations and state-law claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). FloaTEC, Herrema, and McDermott timely removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Docket Entry No. 1). Federal subject-matter jurisdiction is based on the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Underwriters amended their complaint again. (Docket Entry No. 9). The second amended complaint dismissed Herrema and McDermott from the action but joined American Global Maritime as a defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The second amended complaint alleged that FloaTEC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   failed to adequately account for compression of air in the [buoyancy modules] and drag resulting from VIM vibration in the tendons which caused large loads on the bolts. FloaTEC failed to include sufficient VIV-suppression in the tendon design to dampen or eliminate VIV, which led to fatigue cracks. FloaTEC also failed to provide design and fatigue loads for the [buoyancy modules] and clamp assembly design. FloaTEC failed to properly perform its duties as interface manager, resulting in a significant gap in analysis, design and data exchange between key components and entities involved in the design of the [buoyancy modules] and clamp assembly. These design, engineering and interface failures resulted in the collapse of the tendons and substantial damages to Chevron and ultimately to [the Underwriters].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7). The second amended complaint alleged that, as the Chevron-appointed marine warranty surveyor,\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    [American] Global Maritime's duties and obligations include, but are not limited to:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    \u2022 technical engineering review and approval of design bases, engineering drawings, specifications, plans, procedures; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \u2022 review and approval of operational aspects of the installation process of the tendons and ETLP.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8). This complaint alleged that American Global Maritime had: (1) failed to appoint competent personnel to review and certify the tendon installation and (2) failed to \"identify and correct the glaring and obvious design errors that led to the collapse of the tendons.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Underwriters asserted subrogated claims against FloaTEC and American Global Maritime. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10). The Underwriters also claimed to have a direct cause of action against American Global Maritime that arose from its \"legal duties to [the] Underwriters.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The Underwriters asserted claims against American Global Maritime for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, products liability, and redhibition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    FloaTEC and American Global Maritime moved to dismiss the Underwriters' claims for failure to state a cause of action on which relief can be granted, or to dismiss the litigation and compel arbitration under an arbitration clause in their Contract with Chevron. (Docket Entries No. 29-30). These defendants argued that they were \"Other Assured[s]\" under Chevron's Policy, and that the Underwriters had waived subrogation rights against Other Assureds. (Docket Entries No. 29-1 at 4-5, 30-1 at 9). In the alternative, FloacTEC and Global Maritime contended that their Contract with Chevron mandated arbitration. (Docket Entries No. 29-1 at 10, 30-1 at 9).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Eight days later, the Underwriters amended the complaint a third time. (Docket Entry No. 32). They added three foreign companies as defendants: Global Maritime Group, Global Maritime Consultancy, and Global Maritime Holdings. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1). The Underwriters alleged that this\n    Texas court has personal jurisdiction over these companies, both because American Global Maritime's contacts could be attributed to them and because they had sufficient contacts with Texas. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-6). The allegations and claims relating to the Project were the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    This court granted FloaTEC's motion to dismiss and denied American Global Maritime's motions to dismiss and to compel arbitration. (Docket Entry No. 63). The court determined that FloaTEC and American Global Maritime were Other Assureds under the Policy. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18). The court dismissed the claims against FloaTEC with prejudice because \"they are subrogated claims,\" which the Underwriters had waived. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The dismissal was based on an inability to recover as a matter of law, making pleading amendment futile. The court found, however, that the Underwriters' claims against American Global Maritime were \"pleaded as direct tort claims rather than as claims brought as a subrogee of Chevron.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The court ruled that \"the Underwriters have stated a plausible tort claim against American Global Maritime that does not depend on a subrogated assertion of Chevron's rights.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The court's Memorandum and Opinion stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    A Louisiana court might reject the Underwriters' direct tort claims against American Global Maritime as impermissible artful pleading, or find that, in this case, public policy strongly militated against concluding that American Global Maritime owed the Underwriters a tort duty. Or a Louisiana court could find that this unusual set of facts justified an extension of the antisubrogation rule to bar any claim that, while not pleaded as a subrogated claim with the insurer standing in the shoes of its insured, would nonetheless have the functional effect of reimbursing an insurer for payments it made under the policy. But American Global Maritime has provided neither authority nor argument to support these approaches.... American Global Maritime is free to provide authority and argument in support of its positions at summary judgment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21). The court denied American Global Maritime's motion to compel arbitration because the Underwriters' claims against it did not arise from its Contract with Chevron. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    American Global Maritime answered the third amended complaint, denying the allegations or stating that it had insufficient information to admit or deny them. (Docket Entry No. 64). American Global Maritime admitted that Chevron appointed it as the marine warranty surveyor on the Project and that written contracts existed to that effect. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6). American Global Maritime's answer asserted as defenses that Chevron or other parties had caused the tendon failure, that Louisiana's anti-subrogation rule barred the claims, and that the tendon detachment resulted from an act of God or from force majeure. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13-14).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The foreign companies moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2). (Docket Entry No. 65). They argued that this Texas court could exercise neither general nor specific personal jurisdiction over them. As to general jurisdiction, the foreign companies alleged that they had no affiliations with the State of Texas. As to specific jurisdiction, they asserted that they lacked sufficient contacts with Texas relating to the Project. The foreign companies also argued that American Global Maritime's contacts with Texas could not be attributed to them because they are separate and independent entities that have no control over American Global Maritime. To support their arguments, directors from Global Maritime Group, Global Maritime Consultancy, and American\n    Global Maritime submitted affidavits stating that the foreign companies did not work on the Project, do not have contacts with Texas, do not control American Global Maritime, and maintain accounts and records separate from American Global Maritime. (Docket Entries No. 65-3-65-5).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Underwriters responded, arguing that the foreign companies wholly controlled American Global Maritime, so that its Texas contacts could be imputed to them. (Docket Entry No. 83 at 6). The Underwriters contended that this court has jurisdiction because the foreign companies have marketed themselves and their services or products in Texas, hired Texas residents, sent employees to Texas, and worked on Texas projects. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Lastly, the Underwriters argued that the court should exercise jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2) because the case arose under federal law and the foreign companies had received service under the Hague Convention and had sufficient contacts with the United States. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The foreign companies replied, maintaining that they lacked sufficient contacts with either Texas or the United States and that American Global Maritime's contacts could not be imputed to them because they are distinct and separate entities. (Docket Entry No. 100). They attached documents to support dismissal, including American Global Maritime's financial statements for 2013 and 2014, Chevron and American Global Maritime's Contract, board-meeting minutes, and affidavits from board members of Global Maritime Holding and Global Maritime Consultancy. (Docket Entry No. 100-1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    American Global Maritime moved for summary judgment. (Docket Entries No. 97-98). It argued that it did not have a fiduciary relationship with the Underwriters; that it did not owe the Underwriters a tort duty under Louisiana law; and that Louisiana's confusion doctrine extinguished the claims against it. (Document Entry No. 98 at 9-10). American Global Maritime attached the Underwriters's Policy with Chevron and the Contract between Chevron and American Global Maritime. (Docket Entry No. 98-1-98-2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Underwriters responded, maintaining that American Global Maritime does not have Other Assured status and that the insurance and indemnity clauses in American Global Maritime's Contract with Chevron disclaimed rights under the Policy relating to the Project. The Underwriters also argue that American Global Maritime breached duties owed to them under negligent-misrepresentation and negligent-professional-undertaking theories and that the anti-subrogation rule does not bar these claims. The Underwriters argue that the confusion doctrine is inapplicable because the duty that American Global Maritime owed them as a marine warranty surveyor differed from the obligation that the Underwriters owed American Global Maritime as insurers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Each motion, argument, and response is considered below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

This record evidence shows that American Global Maritime respects corporate formalities and operates as an independent corporation, outside the direct control of the foreign companies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Underwriters make much of the companies' reference to themselves as \"Global Maritime.\" The Underwriters submitted an Assumed Name Certificate filed in Texas, stating that American Global Maritime could do business as \"Global Maritime\"; documents relating to previous litigation in which American Global Maritime referred to itself as \"d/b/a Global Maritime\"; a certificate issued to \"Global Maritime\"; the companies' shared \"Global Maritime\" website; an online energy directory listing of \"American Global Maritime Inc\" as a branch of \"Global Maritime AS\"; and marketing materials showing that the companies both market as \"Global Maritime.\" (Docket Entry No. 84 at 50, 257, 265, 306-57). According to the Underwriters, the companies' use of \"Global Maritime\" suggests that they disregard corporate formalities. But using \"Global Maritime\" as a shorthand company name or label \"is no evidence\" that the companies fail to \"observe corporate formalities,\" because \"Global Maritime\" forms \"part of their names.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     BMC Software\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433901\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/83/789/#p799\">\n     83 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    800 ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     PHC-Minden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8365519\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/235/163/#p175\">\n     235 S.W.3d at 175\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Whether two related entities share a common name ...does not affect whether each has sufficient contacts with the forum for jurisdictional purposes.\"). In legally binding circumstances-like contracts, financial statements, insurance policies, invoices, certifications, board meeting minutes, and board resolutions-American Global Maritime used its formal and unique name: \"American Global Maritime Inc.\" (Docket Entries No. 83 at 50, 102, 105, 222-23, 225-28, 238-56). Its informal references to itself as \"Global Maritime\" do not support an inference that corporate formalities were ignored.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Underwriters contend that the foreign companies control American Global Maritime's day-to-day operations. They contend that the foreign companies are \"consolidated under a global management team,\" (Docket Entry No. 32 at 5-7); that an employee of Global Maritime Group, \"J. Linde,\" worked on the Big Foot Project, (Docket Entry No. 83 at 20); and that the foreign companies sent employees to Houston to help on other projects. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 16). The record undermines these allegations. Officers and directors of the foreign companies submitted affidavits declaring that the companies did \"not control the day-to-day activities\" of American Global Maritime. (Docket Entries No. 65-3-65-5; 100-1 at 1-5; 100-2; 100-3; 100-4). An affidavit of a former American Global Maritime vice-president states that the only contact between the management of American Global Maritime and of the foreign companies concerned soliciting business\n    at conferences held in Houston and London once or twice a year. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 31-35). His affidavit also states that American Global Maritime billed for the services of the employees that the foreign companies sent to Houston, which suggests that American Global Maritime, not the foreign companies, controlled those employees' work. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 34). The record shows that American Global Maritime independently contracted with and paid for \"J. Linde\" to work on the Project. (Docket Entry No. 100-1 at 111-13). These circumstances support an inference of independence, not of control.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Underwriters contend that the foreign companies and American Global Maritime share funds through loans and a cash-pool agreement. American Global Maritime offers and receives \"borrowings from its parent company,\" which are \"unsecured, do not accrue interest, and have no set repayment term.\" (Docket Entry No. 100-1 at 15). But American Global Maritime records the amounts due and payable in its separate financial statements. In 2013 and 2014, American Global Maritime \"had $911,425 and $1,412,905, respectively, of accounts payable to companies related by common ownership.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15). During those years, American Global Maritime \"had $1,561,696 and $1,287,246, respectively, of accounts receivable due from companies related by common ownership.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Similarly, in 2015 and 2014, American Global Maritime \"had approximately $410,000 and $911,000, respectively, of accounts payable to companies related by common ownership\" and accounts receivable of \"209,000 and $1,562,00, respectively.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 32-33). In his affidavit, American Global Maritime's former vice-president stated that \"funds were generally treated as a pool for the benefit of the worldwide company,\" but \"the funds would normally be repaid.\" (Docket Entry No. 84 at 35). While one Global Marine company might make a loan to another, the borrowing entity tracked, reported, and \"normally\" repaid those loans. This does not suggest blurred corporate lines.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Underwriters next point to a cash-pool agreement and argue that the foreign companies treated American Global Maritime's property as their own by using shares as collateral. Global Maritime Holdings entered into an agreement with DNB Bank ASA for access to a credit facility of 80,000,000 Norwegian Krone. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 167). The credit facility was secured with Global Maritime Holdings' assets, including its shares in American Global Maritime. As part of this agreement, American Global Maritime was required to pledge DNB Bank a security interest in its shares. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 91, 102). American Global Maritime would receive access to the credit facility through a credit-facility agreement stating that \"[t]he companies in the cash pool agreement are jointly liable for the draw down on the facility.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 77, 91, 102). American Global Maritime's board met and approved the pledge agreement and the credit-facility agreement's terms. The board determined that the pledge agreement and credit-facility agreement were \"advisable and in the [c]ompany's best interests, [would] benefit the [c]ompany, directly and indirectly, and [were] necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion or attainment of the [c]ompany's business.\" (Docket Entry No. 100-1 at 57-58). With board approval, American Global Maritime agreed to the credit-facility agreement and in return received access to credit. The credit-facility agreement does not show that Global Maritime Holdings exercised control over American Global Maritime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Underwriters' allegations regarding consolidated financial statements, annual management meetings, common policies, and financial monitoring do not establish the control necessary to impute jurisdictional\n    contacts from American Global Maritime to the foreign companies.\n    <em>\n     PHC-Minden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8365519\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/235/163/#p175\">\n     235 S.W.3d at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Appropriate parental involvement includes monitoring the subsidiary's performance, supervision of the subsidiary's finance and capital budget decisions, and articulation of general policies.\" (quoting 16 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE \u00a7 108.42(3)(b) ) ).

The Underwriters allege that American Global Maritime received a fee \"in excess of $2 million\" but had only \"one professional liability policy with a limit of liability of $1,000,000.\" (Docket Entry No. 83 at 19-20). This, the Underwriters claim, \"is evidence of undercapitalization.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20). American Global Maritime had professional services coverage of $1 million per incident and umbrella coverage for $5 million per incident. (Docket Entry No. 84 at 222). That gave American Global Maritime $6,000,000 in coverage because the umbrella coverage would apply after the professional services coverage was depleted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     N.

But the affidavit supports the argument that those employees worked for American Global Maritime, not the foreign companies, and that American Global Maritime included their work \"in the invoices to clients from the Houston office as though they were Houston employees.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The work was for American Global Maritime, not the foreign companies;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    it is at best a weak contact between the foreign companies and Texas.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The Underwriters assert that \" 'Global Maritime' was the approved [marine warranty surveyor] on three Gulf of Mexico projects between 2011 and 2017,\" and that \"[the foreign companies] are likely to have either procured this U.S. work or lent employees to the Houston office to complete the work, and would have received compensation from this Texas work.\" (Docket Entry No. 83 at 29-30). But the Underwriters neither point to nor submit supporting evidence showing that the foreign companies sent their own employees to Houston and paid for the work those employees did in Houston.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The Underwriters produced a press release showing that the U.S. Coast Guard certified Global Maritime Consultancy to \"provide Subchapter M compliance services as a Third Party Organization.\" (Docket Entry No. 84 at 305). This press release, without more, does not show sustained contacts between the foreign companies and Texas. The press release states that \"Global Maritime\" provides services in the United States. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). It is unclear which Global Maritime corporation-American or foreign-provides those services, what the services are, or how frequently they were provided.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Lastly, the Underwriters cite a press release stating that \"Global Maritime Consultancy &amp; Engineering\" completed a project carried out by the \"Houston team.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 344). Again, it is unclear even which entity performed this work. The imprecise language means that these press releases provide little support for the argument that Global Maritime Consultancy contracted for or worked on Texas projects and, even if they did, they do not show contacts of a continuous and systematic nature.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The record shows that the foreign companies hired someone or some entity to incorporate American Global Maritime, sent officers to international conferences held once or twice a year, lent an unspecified number of employees to American Global Maritime under unknown conditions, had a U.S. certification, and may have contracted to provide services for one project. This evidence does not establish that the foreign companies' \"affiliations\" with Texas were \"so continuous and systematic as to render them essentially at home\" in Texas.\n    <em>\n     Goodyear Dunlop\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n     564 U.S. at 919\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2846\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation omitted).

The press release reads: \"hear how Global Maritime is working with a leading operator to provide Marine Warranty services for an offshore wind farm.\" (Docket Entry No. 84 at 341).

(Docket Entry No. 84 at 34). He said nothing about regular or frequent marketing in Houston. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). It is at best unclear what additional depositions would add. As to doing business in Texas, the depositions of Alberto Morandi and Thomas Smith would not likely yield relevant information because the parties agree that American Global Maritime does business in Texas. The affidavits from the foreign companies' directors and officers state that neither Global Maritime Holdings nor Global Maritime Group do business in Texas. The affidavits state that Global Maritime Consultancy does not have an office in the United States and provided no services or support on the Big Foot Project.

The Underwriters required Chevron to select a marine warranty surveyor for the Project and listed surveyors from which Chevron could choose. (Docket Entry No. 98-1 at 4, 45). The Policy required the appointed marine warranty surveyor to approve environmental criteria; survey marine vessels, barges, and equipment; issue certificates for transportation and installation; and review and approve procedures and engineering studies. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-5). These services were required \"to meet the terms and conditions of Big Foot Construction-All-Risk (CAR) policy, Big Foot Installation Job Specifications and Standard Industry practice.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5).

Chevron could not change the surveyor, once chosen, without \"the express and prior agreement of the lead underwriter(s).\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Chevron picked American Global Maritime to serve as the marine warranty surveyor. (Docket Entry No. 98-2 at 2). American Global Maritime did not sign or endorse the Underwriters's Policy. Instead, American Global Maritime contracted directly with Chevron. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The contract detailed American Global Maritime's duties to Chevron. American Global Maritime had to inspect, review, witness, and monitor \"activities and documents to certify to [Chevron] and [Chevron's] insurance underwriters that the marine components and facilities meet industry accepted standards, maritime laws and codes applicable to marine facilities and are likewise sea-worthy for transportation, installation and operation.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 51). American Global Maritime agreed to work \"in accordance with [Chevron's] insurer's underwriting requirements and good industry practice\" and to \"coordinate and interface with [Chevron], [Chevron's] insurance underwriters, [Chevron's] freight forwarder, installation contractors, vessel owner/operators, fabricators and others to perform its review and/or approval responsibilities.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 61-62). As to the tendons and buoyancy modules, Chevron specified that American Global Maritime must:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n    [a]ttend on the installation vessel for the installation of the 16 tendons\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n    1) Witness dynamic positioning in field tests\n    2) Attend daily progress meetings with the installation coordinator\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    3) Attend \"decision to proceed\" review meetings with the installation contractor and review selection of appropriate design and operational environmental criteria for installation site and adequacy of environmental information to be supplied prior to and during the operations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    4) Issue Certificates of Approval to proceed for individual tendon installations\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n    5) Witness the installation of the tendons\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 71-72).

Official communications from American Global Maritime were to be \"solely through [Chevron's representative] or his delegate.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 62). The contractual obligations ran only between American Global Maritime and Chevron. American Global Maritime had no contractual or other legal relationship to the Underwriters. The Underwriters have not identified promises that American Global Maritime made to them. While American Global Maritime had to comply with the Underwriters' requirements, that obligation was a contractual duty owed to Chevron, not to the Underwriters. No fiduciary relationship exists between American Global Maritime and the Underwriters. Summary judgment is granted as to this claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    <strong>\n     d.

The court also determined that the subrogation waiver did not impact the Underwriters' direct tort claims and that the anti-subrogation rule bars only subrogated actions that an insurer asserts against a coinsured. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 18-19).

Chevron could claim up to $5,000,000 under the commercial liability policy for damage or loss arising from the Contract.

American Global Maritime knew that the Underwriters relied on their approvals and certifications; the Policy and Contract show that the Underwriters were members of the limited group for whose benefit and guidance those approvals and certifications were contracted and supplied; and American Global Maritime performed the services for compensation and to fulfill Chevron's Policy obligation to the Underwriters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The Policy required a marine warranty surveyor to \"review/attend/approve the major marine operations.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4). It required the surveyor to \"provide the [s]ervices as and when required by Chevron\" and allowed the surveyor to \"report to and receive guidance directly from the [U]nderwriters\" where \"applicable and under instructions from the Big Foot Installation Management Team.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5). Chevron chose American Global Maritime as the surveyor and, in the Contract, laid out American Global Maritime's duties:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n    [American Global Maritime] shall perform inspections, reviews, witnessing and surveillance of activities and documents to certify to [Chevron] and [Chevron's] insurance underwriters that the marine components and facilities meet industry standards, maritime laws and codes applicable to marine facilities and are likewise sea-worthy for transportation, installation and operation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    (Docket Entry No. 98-2 at 51).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    American Global Maritime agreed to \"coordinate and interface with [Chevron], [Chevron's] insurance underwriters, [Chevron's] freight forwarder, installation contractors, vessel owners/operators, fabricators and others to perform its review and/or approval responsibilities.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 61). American Global Maritime agreed to perform the services called for \"in accordance with [Chevron's] underwriting requirements and good industry practice.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 62). While American Global Maritime lacked a legal relationship with the Underwriters, the Contract shows that American Global Maritime knew that the Underwriters would receive and rely on its services. The Policy and Contract show that Chevron contracted with American Global Maritime to provide the services because the Underwriters wanted to reduce the risks of insuring the Project. Chevron compensated American Global Maritime. Three of the\n    <em>\n     Barrie\n    </em>\n    factors are met.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    The final factor requires asking if recognizing a duty of care would serve public policy. It would. In\n    <em>\n     Barrie\n    </em>\n    , the Louisiana Supreme Court asked whether finding a duty of care would \"promote[ ] the maintenance of a high quality of services\" and \"impart[ ] confidence in those services to the contracting party and to those persons who, due to current business practices, are expected to receive and rely upon the contents of the report.\"\n    <em>\n     Barrie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505137\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/625/1007/#p1014\">\n     625 So.2d at 1017-18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The record shows that the purpose of appointing \"[a] marine warranty surveyor\" is to \"protect the interest of the underwriter.\" (Docket Entry No. 107 at 10-11). The marine warranty surveyor \"should at all times act as an independent unbiased entity.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Recognizing that American Global Maritime has a duty to use reasonable care in obtaining and evaluating the facts in making the certifications helps to maintain the high-quality marine warranty surveyor services, encourage surveyors to remain independent and unbiased, and impart confidence on the underwriters who rely on their services.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    The\n    complexities and risks of the projects the surveyors often work on underscores the importance of the quality of their work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    The four\n    <em>\n     Barrie\n    </em>\n    factors support recognizing a tort duty in this case.

Chevron and American Global Maritime entered into their Contract because the Underwriters demanded it. Chevron provided Global Maritime's reviews and certificates to the Underwriters. The reviews and certificates were necessary for coverage under the Policy. Chevron entered the Contract to benefit itself and the Underwriters by reducing the Project risks.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    If American Global Maritime was negligent in approving the Project's specifications, seaworthiness, and construction, the economic harm to the Underwriters was foreseeable. The Underwriters did not have representatives on the Project site. They looked to American Global Maritime's certificates to ensure that Chevron and its contractors followed the \"underwriting requirements and good industry practice.\" (Docket Entry No. 98-2 at 62). The Underwriters depended in part on American Global Maritime to reduce the Project risks. While American Global Maritime's negligence did not make the Underwriters' harm certain, it increased the likelihood that the Underwriters would have to cover a loss. American Global Maritime's alleged negligence in approving the tendons, buoyancy modules, and bolts bears a close connection to the harm the Underwriters incurred when they paid for the lost tendons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    Had American Global Maritime refused to issue a certificate of approval for the tendon installation, Chevron would not have proceeded. If American Global Maritime was negligent, as the Underwriters allege, that negligence contributed to the Underwriters' loss. Finding that American Global Maritime owed the Underwriters a duty in tort gives marine warranty surveyors like American Global Maritime an incentive to perform their services with care, especially when the potential losses are enormous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    The factors lean one way. American Global Maritime owed the Underwriters a duty of reasonable care in inspecting, reviewing,\n    witnessing, and monitoring the Project to decide whether to certify that \"the marine components and facilities meet industry standards, maritime laws and codes applicable to marine facilities and are likewise sea-worthy for transportation, installation and operation.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 51).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    <strong>\n     3. The Breach of Duties\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    The record shows that American Global Maritime issued a certificate of approval for the installation of the tendons and floats and another for the \"seafastening of various components/materials.\" (Docket Entry No. 84 at 240, 246). A field survey log shows that American Global Maritime met with \"key entities to discuss loop current[s]\" and participated in the \"Go-no go meeting\" to install the tendons. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 230). After installation, 9 of the 16 tendons sank to the ocean floor. (Docket Entry No. 107 at 322). But the Underwriters have not pointed to evidence of what American Global Maritime did that fell below the standard of care or whether its acts or omissions caused the tendons to sink. The court denies the motion for summary judgment on these issues relating to American Global Maritime's negligence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    The Underwriters ask the court to defer ruling on summary judgment because \"no discovery has taken place pending this [c]ourt's ruling on [the foreign companies'] Rule 12 motions to dismiss.\" (Docket Entry No. 106 at 12). Given that the issues presented in the summary judgment motion are issues of law, the court declines to do so. The court denies the motion for summary judgment as to negligence, but permits the parties to move again for summary judgment on the issues that cannot be determined on the present record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d)(1). The court hopes that the rulings will help the parties tailor the scope of discovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    <strong>\n     VI. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    The court grants the foreign companies' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, without prejudice, and denies the Underwriters' request to defer ruling on the motion for summary judgment. (Docket Entries No. 65, 104). The court grants American Global Maritime's motion for summary judgment on the products liability, redhibition, and fiduciary duty claims, with prejudice, but denies the motion as to American Global Maritime's negligence, without prejudice.
