Having considered the motions, submissions, and applicable law, the Court determines the motions should be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a false advertising case brought pursuant to the Lanham Act. Plaintiff Illinois Tool Works, Inc. (\"ITW\") and Defendant Rust-Oleum Corporation (\"Rust-Oleum\") sell competing water repellant products for use on vehicle windshields. ITW's product is named \"Rain-X\" and Rust-Oleum's product is named \"RainBrella.\" As part of Rust-Oleum's advertising campaign for RainBrella, Rust-Oleum has made three statements in its advertising relevant to this lawsuit: (1) that RainBrella \"Lasts 2X Longer than Rain-X\" (\"2X Claim\"); (2) \"And remember, RainBrella lasts twice as long as Rain-X. We ran it through 100 car washes to prove it.\" (\"Twice As Long Claim\"); and (3) RainBrella \"Lasts Over 100 Car Washes\" (\"Over 100 Claim\") (collectively, the \"Claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the foregoing, on July 7, 2017, ITW filed this lawsuit asserting Lanham Act claims for false and misleading advertising against Rust-Oleum. On July 16, 2018, the Court commenced a five-day jury trial. The Court submitted questions, definitions, and instructions to the jury. In response, the jury made findings that the Court received, filed, and entered into the record. The jury found in favor of ITW on all questions submitted to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the jury verdict, on August 1, 2018, ITW filed a motion for a permanent injunction. On August 28, 2018, ITW moved for prejudgment and post-judgment interest. On August 30, 2018, Rust-Oleum moved for an entry of judgment denying ITW monetary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    II. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following the jury's verdict, (1) ITW moves for a permanent injunction; (2) Rust-Oleum moves for an entry of judgment denying ITW any monetary relief; and (3) ITW moves for prejudgment and post-judgment interest. The Court addresses each motion in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    A. Permanent Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ITW moves for a permanent injunction seeking to: (1) enjoin Rust-Oleum from disseminating the Claims in advertising materials in connection with RainBrella (\"Dissemination Provision\"); (2) require Rust-Oleum to recall all advertising materials which contain the Claims (\"Recall Provision\"); and (3) require Rust-Oleum to destroy all advertising materials containing the Claims (\"Destruction Provision\"). Rust-Oleum contends a permanent injunction is not proper because there is no evidence of irreparable injury to ITW and the balance of hardships does not weigh in favor of granting a permanent injunction. A plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must establish the following elements: \"(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

Irreparable Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rust-Oleum contends ITW did not prove irreparable injury. ITW contends it has and will continue to suffer irreparable injury if Rust-Oleum continues to make false and misleading advertising claims. The potential for ongoing harm if a defendant continues to make similar false or misleading statements and the likely impossibility of quantifying the extent of harm suffered as a result of false or misleading statements weigh in favor of finding\n   irreparable injury.\n   <em>\n    Eastman Chemical Co. v.

The Court therefore finds ITW has proven an irreparable injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    2. Balance of Hardships\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rust-Oleum contends the balance of hardships between Rust-Oleum and ITW does not weigh in favor of issuing a permanent injunction because ITW's proposed permanent injunction is overbroad\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and would require Rust-Oleum to expend significant amounts of money. Specifically, as to the Destruction Provision, Rust-Oleum contends destroying all advertising material containing the Claims would require it to repackage all its RainBrella product, costing between $40,000 to $50,000. As to the Recall provision, Rust-Oleum contends recalling all RainBrella product would greatly damage its ability to continue as a viable product and would require Rust-Oleum to identify all retailers who still have RainBrella product, buy back the product, and pay for freight and labor. ITW contends an injunction would protect its interest in preventing Rust-Oleum from continuing to make false and misleading commercial advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Preventing a party from \"repeating statements a jury found to be false and misleading\" weighs in favor of granting an injunction.\n   <em>\n    Eastman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4126334\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/969/756/#p769\">\n    969 F.Supp.2d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The jury found the Claims were false or misleading advertisements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence introduced at trial showed Rust-Oleum spent $1,318,023 on advertising. There is no evidence regarding how much RainBrella product is still on the market or the cost to Rust-Oleum in complying with the Recall Provision. Having found ITW will be irreparably harmed if Rust-Oleum continues to make the Claims the jury found to be false or misleading, the Court finds the balance of hardships weighs in favor issuing a permanent injunction. The Court,\n   however, finds the balance of hardships does not weigh in favor of recalling all RainBrella product containing the Claims. Accordingly, ITW's motion for a permanent injunction is denied as to the Recall Provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    3. Remaining Elements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court will briefly address the remaining elements because ITW has the burden of proof on the necessity for a permanent injunction. First, ITW contends the monetary damages the jury awarded are inadequate to compensate it for its injuries because it is difficult to quantify the extent of harm to its reputation and goodwill as a result of the Claims.\n   <em>\n    Fringe Ins. Benefits, Inc. v. Beneco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. A-13-CV-034-AWA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20631181\">\n    2015 WL 631181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2015) (Austin, Mag.

The Court finds ITW has established that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are alone inadequate to compensate it for its injuries in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, \"the public interest is always served by requiring compliance with Congressional statutes such as the Lanham Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Quantum Fitness Corp. v. Quantum LifeStyle Centers, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11466174\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/83/810/#p832\">\n    83 F.Supp.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (S.D. Tex. 1999) (Rosenthal, J.). ITW was the prevailing party in this lawsuit because the jury found the Claims constituted false or misleading advertising. ITW seeks a permanent injunction to enforce the Lanham Act. The Court therefore finds ITW has established a permanent injunction in this case would serve the public interest. In sum, ITW has established all four elements to demonstrate that it is entitled to a permanent injunction in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    4. Scope of Permanent Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rust-Oleum contends ITW's proposed permanent injunction is overbroad. ITW contends its proposed permanent injunction is not overbroad in this case. The scope of an injunction \"is dictated by the extent of the violation established\" and so a court \"must narrowly tailor an injunction\n   to remedy the specific action which gives rise to the order.\"\n   <em>\n    John Doe # 1 v.

In particular, Rust-Oleum contends ITW's proposed permanent injunction: (1) does not allow for the possibility that RainBrella could be modified to substantiate the Claims; (2) should not include the prohibition on the Over 100 Claim because ITW argued that the Over 100 Claim is misleading, not false; (3) should not include \"Protects Through 100 Car Washes\" because it was not litigated at trial; and (4) improperly includes Rust-Oleum's NEVERWET product that was not litigated at trial. Having found ITW has established it is entitled to a permanent injunction and having considered the contentions, submissions, and applicable law, the Court enters a permanent injunction, as reflected in the final judgment, that is narrowly tailored to remedy the specific violations at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    B. Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rust-Oleum moves for an entry of judgment denying ITW any monetary damages. Damages awarded for false advertising under the Lanham Act are subject to the principles of equity and must be compensatory not punitive.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The Court first addresses the jury's award of profits, then turns to the jury's award for corrective advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Profits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A plaintiff who proves false advertising may recover the defendant's profits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Courts consider the following factors when deciding whether an award of profits is appropriate: (1) whether the defendant had the intent to confuse or deceive; (2) whether sales have been diverted; (3) the adequacy of other remedies; (4) any unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in asserting its rights; (5) the public interest in making the misconduct unprofitable; and (6) whether it is a case of palming off.\n   <em>\n    Pebble Beach Co. v.

However, there is a strong public interest in making false advertising unprofitable and there was no unreasonable delay in ITW asserting its rights. Although the Court found ITW is entitled to a permanent injunction, the injunction is inadequate to remedy any past harm ITW suffered as a result of the Claims. The Court therefore finds the jury's award of profits falls within the principles of equity in this case. Thus, the Court declines to disturb the jury's verdict awarding ITW disgorgement of profits in the amount of $392,406 from Rust-Oleum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clearline Tech.
