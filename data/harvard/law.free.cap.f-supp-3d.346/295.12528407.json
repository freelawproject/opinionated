No. 11670, 1343 U.N.T.S. 89, and the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\"ICARA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209001\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 9001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (formerly codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ). Petition at 1-2, ECF No. 1. The Petition generally alleges Respondent, NIR's mother, wrongfully removed NIR to and has retained NIR in the United States in violation of Petitioner's paternity rights under Hungarian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 1, 2018, Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, the presiding Miscellaneous Duty Judge at the time, issued an Order to Show Cause directing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that neither Respondent nor anyone else remove NIR from the jurisdiction of this Court, and also directing the U.S. Marshals to serve Respondent with a copy of the Petition and take Respondent's and NIR's passports into custody for safekeeping. ECF No. 4. On May 4, 2018, pursuant to Petitioner's request, ECF No. 5, Judge Matsumoto extended the time for Petitioner to serve Respondent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 4, 2018 Electronic Order. On May 10, 2018, in light of Petitioner's May 9, 2018 letter requesting an extension of time to serve Respondent because of difficulties locating Respondent, ECF No. 9, this Court entered an order further extending the time for service and also extending the time for Respondent to respond to the Petition. ECF No. 10. On May 18, 2018, Petitioner informed this Court that the U.S. Marshals served Respondent with the petition on May 16, 2018\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and seized the passports of NIR and Respondent. ECF No. 12 (letter); ECF No. 13 (certificate of service). Pursuant to a May 23, 2018 order issued by Magistrate Judge Robert Levy, the Court directed the U.S. Marshals to deposit the passports of Respondent and NIR with the Clerk of Court for safekeeping. ECF No. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 15, 2018, Respondent, through her newly-retained counsel, filed an answer to the petition. Answer, ECF No. 18. Respondent admitted,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   . NIR was born in Hungary on September 19, 2014, she is a parent of NIR, and she lived with Petitioner for roughly two years in Budapest,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but generally denied the remaining allegations in the petition. Respondent asserts seven defenses and argues the petition should be dismissed for the following reasons: (1) Petitioner cannot show NIR was habitually resident in Hungary; (2) Petitioner cannot show NIR was wrongfully removed; (3) Petitioner does not reside in Hungary and cannot exercise his parental rights in Hungary; (4) Petitioner consented and/or acquiesced to NIR's removal by Respondent from Hungary; (5) Petitioner never exercised custody rights; (6) there is a grave risk NIR's return would expose NIR to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place NIR in an intolerable situation; and (7) these proceedings were: not initiated until more than one year after NIR's removal and NIR is well-settled in his new environment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n    at 11-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 20, 2018, this Court held its first conference in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 20, 2018 Minute Entry.

Also on July 20, 2018, this court held a pre-hearing conference to address outstanding issues including witnesses testifying abroad, and rescheduled the evidentiary hearing for July 24 and 25, 2018 at the parties' request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 20, 2018 Minute Entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 24 and 25, 2018, this Court held an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 24 &amp; 25, 2018 Minute Entries.

Petitioner admitted he physically assaulted Respondent during their relationship on more than one occasion. Hearing Transcript (\"Tr.\") 50:16-51:1, ECF Nos. 49-50. During one incident in 2012, Petitioner testified he hit Respondent during a sexual encounter with another individual because Respondent kissed the third individual. Tr. 50:16-23. Petitioner indicated this was against the \"rules\" and it hurt his feelings. Tr. 50:21-23. During another incident, Petitioner admitted he \"slapped\" Respondent. Tr. 50:24-51:1. In reality, this incident involved much more than a slap. As Respondent explained in testimony which this Court credits, Petitioner nearly choked her to death. Tr. 136:2-137:6. In an August 2014 incident, Petitioner admitted he was drunk and showed up at Respondent's mother's apartment-where Respondent was living at the time and was approximately eight months pregnant-and threw a rock through a window, breaking the glass. Tr. 53:15-56:6. Petitioner admitted he could be heard on a recording of the incident in which he was verbally abusive to Petitioner, and among other threats, he stated \"[i]f I am not there at the birth of my child, you're gone, you're history!\" Tr. 117:4-6, 168:17-18; Ex. G at HERRERA_0000274_T at 5:44. Petitioner acknowledged he was sentenced to community service as a result of this incident. Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   55:13-55:24. When asked if he would meet NIR at the airport if this Court ordered NIR's return, Petitioner stated it depended on his work schedule and whether he was in Hungary at the time. Tr. 121:14-23. When asked where NIR would live if this Court ordered his return to Hungary, Petitioner admitted he \"can't take [his] son,\" who only knows Respondent and does not know Petitioner. Tr. 125:24-126:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner admitted he videotaped himself and Respondent having sex with other people \"all the time,\" and stated only he and Respondent had access to the videos, which he uploaded to YouTube. Tr. 49:2-22. As the documentary evidence in this case reflects, Petitioner repeatedly used these videos to threaten and harass Respondent. Petitioner posted screenshots of these videos, including pornographic images of Respondent, on various Facebook accounts, which Respondent reported to the Budapest police.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C; Ex. L. In one email to the Budapest Police, Respondent wrote that Petitioner \"stores compromising photos and porn videos of me, on which I was visibly drugged by him. At last I escaped his clutches. But he continuously sends screenshots of these porn videos to my birth father, my mother's current husband. He sends them to me, too. His goal is to alienate everybody from me, so he can beat me at his pleasure and make me continue to take drugs and be a whore.\" Ex. F at HERRERA_0000194 - 0000195_T. Petitioner admitted sending pornographic photos of Respondent to Respondent's father. Tr. 100:14-101:5, 106:12-107:4; Ex. C at HERRERA_0000108; Ex. AC at HERRERA_0000462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Respondent presented testimony from a psychological expert, Dr. B.J. Cling, which this Court credits. For approximately thirty years, Dr. Cling's area of expertise has been domestic violence, harm against women, child abuse, and sexual harassment. Tr. 303:2-10. Dr. Cling has written a book titled \"Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: The Psychology and Law Perspective\" and has presented lectures, given trainings, and taught courses in the field. Tr. 303:13-305:5. In addition to maintaining her own clinical psychology practice, Dr. Cling is a professor in the psychology department at John Jay Criminal Justice and supervises psychology interns at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Tr. 301:9-302:6. Dr. Cling holds a J.D. from UCLA Law School and a Ph.D. from New York University. Tr. 302:8-23. Petitioner did not present expert testimony from a psychologist or mental health professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Cling testified that based on her psychological examination of Respondent, Respondent suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to her relationship with Petitioner. Tr. 308:7-15, 310:5-311:23. Dr. Cling testified Respondent's PTSD symptoms had lessened, but she still suffers from mild PTSD and had recently experienced a resurgence of some symptoms. Tr. 311:1-10. Dr. Cling testified that Respondent experienced PTSD in the three essential domains of symptoms. Tr. 311:24-313:16. Dr. Cling opined that Respondent \"was very credible, psychologically speaking.\" Tr. 311:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Cling testified that if NIR returned to Hungary with Respondent, NIR would be at risk. Tr. 314:1-3. Dr. Cling explained that for children who observe their mother being abused, \"it is like direct child abuse of [the children]\" and is very serious. Tr. 315:1-8. She testified there is empirical research indicating that perpetrators of domestic violence are fifty percent more likely \"to engage in continued harassment of the woman, the victim, and also their children.\" Tr. 315:9-17. Dr. Cling testified to her belief that Petitioner's harassment and abuse of Respondent would likely continue\n   and create a risk of harm for NIR. Tr. 314:3-21. Dr. Cling testified that based on Petitioner's previous interactions with Respondent after NIR's birth-described in more detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   -Petitioner displayed a \"certain disregard of [NIR],\" which contributed to Dr. Cling's assessment of the risk of harm to NIR in Hungary. Tr. 331:10-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In her written report, Dr. Cling stated \"[t]here is an extreme risk that Mr. Mohacsi's abuse of Ms. Herrera would continue-and even intensify-should she return to Hungary with NIR.... Were NIR to witness first-hand the type of abuse that Mr. Mohacsi has inflicted on his mother in the past, NIR would face a substantial risk of developing psychological symptomatology.\" Ex. BN at 9. Dr. Cling stated \"NIR acts and speaks like a typical American child. His behavior indicates that he is in a stable situation, well cared for, and emotionally comfortable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Cling wrote that \"re-exposing NIR's mother to Mr. Mohacsi would have a strong negative effect on NIR himself.... Forcing Ms. Herrera to return [to Hungary] would have a psychologically damaging effect on her, which in turn would cause great harm to NIR, who depends on her as his main emotional support.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Cling's written report concluded: \"The high likelihood of both (1) Mr. Mohacsi's abuse of Ms. Herrera if she and NIR return to Hungary, and (2) NIR's development of a psychological disorder should he witness such abuse, combine to create grave risk of harm to NIR.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011601\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When questioned on cross-examination about her assessment of Petitioner despite not having the opportunity to interview him, Dr. Cling stated her evaluation of Petitioner was more general than specific. Tr. 319:22-321:12. Dr. Cling explained her assessment of the probability of Petitioner's future abuse of Respondent was based on several psychological risk factors, including that as a past perpetrator of domestic violence directed at Respondent, Petitioner is \"extremely likely to continue to want to harass and control her.\" Tr. 324:7-24. Moreover, Dr. Cling testified \"a perpetrator who is generally obsessed with control increases [his] attempts when the victim flees or attempts to escape,\" and \"speaking statistically, [Petitioner is] likely to be an abuser in the future and also likely to abuse his child.\" Tr. 324:25-325:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Cling testified that based on her evaluation of NIR, he was a well-adjusted boy who had an excellent relationship with Respondent. Tr. 309:19-310:4. Dr. Cling opined that NIR was well-adjusted in the United States based on NIR's comfort and happiness, his knowledge of English, various references NIR made to American television, and NIR's enrollment in school. Tr. 321:13-322:6. Dr. Cling testified NIR seemed adjusted to the American culture in which he has grown up. Tr. 322:7-25. When asked whether messages Respondent sent to Petitioner in April 2017 in which she expressed a desire for Petitioner to get to know NIR and to move back to Hungary undermined her findings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10 at MOHACSI0000536, Dr. Cling testified the messages did not affect her assessment of Respondent's PTSD because, among other reasons, most victims of domestic abuse have difficulty leaving their perpetrators. Tr. 326:10-331:2. Dr. Cling testified it is \"unusual for a specific thing to completely undermine a psychological understanding of someone.\" Tr. 330:22-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To the extent Petitioner and Respondent offered conflicting accounts of events, this Court credits Respondent's testimony and finds Respondent to be a believable witness. Much of the documentary evidence supports her testimony and she generally answered questions directly, did not appear evasive, and carried herself in a\n   similar manner on both direct and cross-examination. Petitioner, on the other hand, was defensive and at times aggressive on cross-examination. In some instances, Petitioner appeared to be simply lying. For example, Petitioner claimed that a text exchange from June 2018 between him and a former partner, Timea Arnoth, in which Ms. Arnoth denied receiving any child support from Petitioner despite Petitioner's assertion that he \"currently supports his two other children in Hungary,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Petition at 2, was a fake exchange created to trick Respondent. Tr. 65:2-77:3; Ex. BH. Although Petitioner denied having any communications with Ms. Arnoth about this case, Tr. 82:17-23, Petitioner admitted Ms. Arnoth submitted a statement to his lawyers in response to this very text exchange (in which he demanded that Ms. Arnoth \"write down you bastard that I never laid a finger on my children,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. BH at HERRERA_0000819 - 0000828_T at June 21, 2018, 23:03). Tr. 80:19-23; Ex. 17. In other testimony and documents submitted to this Court, Petitioner stated he lives in Hungary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 83:7-8; Petition at 2, but the documentary evidence indicates otherwise,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. X at HERRERA_0000451; Ex. BG at HERRERA_0000857. In addition, despite being confronted with screenshots of his YouTube account showing pornographic images of Petitioner and Respondent, Petitioner refused to acknowledge it was his account notwithstanding the documentary evidence indicating it was. Tr. 96:1-17; Ex. AD at HERRERA_0000473. Accordingly, where there are factual disputes between the parties' accounts, this Court credits Respondent's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioner and Respondent met in June 2012 in Budapest, Hungary at a photoshoot arranged by Respondent's mother. Tr. 13:1-14, 130:20-24. Respondent's mother had contacted Petitioner via Facebook because he was a professional photographer. Tr. 13:3-14. Petitioner and Respondent started dating right away, and Respondent moved in with Petitioner within a few weeks after they met. Tr. 13:15-18, 131:3-5. At the time they started dating, Respondent was nineteen years old and Petitioner was thirty-eight years old. Tr. 131:22-25. Respondent had never had a sexual relationship with anyone before she started dating Petitioner. Tr. 131:18-21. Petitioner, on the other hand, had two children from a prior relationship: a daughter, now age fifteen and a half, and a son, now age eleven and a half. Tr. 10:6-19, During the two years Respondent and Petitioner were together, Petitioner spent only a few days with his other children. Tr. 263:24-264:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Petitioner and Respondent had been dating for a few weeks, their relationship began to deteriorate. Tr. 132:1-3. Respondent explained Petitioner \"became mad at times\" with her and accused her of being \"a fake, liar, and actress[ ] bitch.\" Tr. 132:5-8. After moving in with Petitioner, Respondent became aware of his alcohol consumption, and testified he consumed alcohol on a daily basis, including beer, vodka, scotch, and wine. Tr. 132:9-23. Respondent testified Petitioner consumed at least five or six beers a day. Tr. 132:14-18. Petitioner also used ecstasy. Tr. 132:24-133:3. After they had been living together for a few weeks, Petitioner began pressuring Respondent to have a sexual encounter with another man, which made Respondent uncomfortable. Tr. 133:4-18. Respondent refused, but Petitioner continued his requests every day, and Respondent continued to say no. Tr. 133:13-24, 137:23-25. The requests continued every day during the summer and fall of 2012. Tr. 137:23-25. When Respondent refused, Petitioner became angry and accused her of \"bring[ing] him down.\" Tr. 133:23-25, 141:24-142:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   One evening in September 2012, Petitioner invited another man-a drug dealer of Petitioner, Tr. 140:21-24-to their apartment and told Respondent he wanted her to have sex with him. Tr. 138:1-13. Respondent initially refused, but Petitioner told her she \"[had] to have sex with [the man].\" Tr. 138:20-25. Petitioner told her approximately twenty times that night to have sex with the other man, and she refused approximately ten times. Tr. 140:2-6. Respondent testified she felt like she had nowhere else to go that night because she was very drunk and could not use her phone to call anyone because Petitioner had previously broken it. Tr. 140:7-20. After Petitioner's repeated demands, she had sex with the other man. Tr. 139:1. Petitioner videotaped the encounter and uploaded the video to his YouTube channel. Tr. 140:25-141:5. The next day, Petitioner forced Respondent to watch the video during sex as a \"punishment\" and told her she was a \"nasty bitch.\" Tr. 141:10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Respondent discovered messages in which Petitioner attempted to set up another encounter. Tr. 143:1-144:12; Ex. U at HERRERA_0000377_T. During another sexual encounter in November 2012, Respondent ended up in the hospital after taking ecstasy. Tr. 144:13-19. With respect to this November 2012 incident, Respondent testified that although her memory of what happened is not very good, she remembers that she, Petitioner, and a third man were naked, and Petitioner \"aggressively\" fed her an ecstasy pill using his fingers and gave her beer to swallow it. Tr. 144:20-145:10, 146:4-10. This happened after Respondent had already taken ecstasy \"through [her] nose\" earlier that day at Petitioner's urging. Tr. 144:22-145:4. Respondent remembered waking up on her back and Petitioner was in her mouth and the third individual was videotaping the encounter. Tr. 145:11-13. Prior to that night, Respondent testified she had never taken drugs before and Petitioner was aware of that fact. Tr. 146:14-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As Petitioner admitted, he physically assaulted Respondent during their relationship. Tr. 50:16-17. During one incident at the end of the summer of 2012, Petitioner logged into Respondent's Facebook account and discovered a message that made him upset and he \"gave [Respondent] a few slaps to [her] face and then he took [her] arm, he grabbed [her] arm, he pulled it, and then he pushed [Respondent] to the floor and he gave [Respondent] one more slap.\" Tr. 134:14-135:2. During this incident, Petitioner called Respondent a \"bitch.\" Tr. 135:3. On another occasion-also around the end of the summer of 2012-Petitioner pushed Respondent to the floor and choked her with both of his hands after Petitioner discovered a Facebook message intended for Respondent. Tr. 136:2-19. Respondent testified she could not breathe and told him to stop or it would be \"too late.\" Tr. 136:13-16. Respondent clarified she believed she might die if he did not stop. Tr. 136:24-137:6. During this incident, Petitioner called her a bitch and accused her of cheating on him. Tr. 136:20-23. He also broke her phone and laptop computer. Tr. 136:17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In late 2012, Respondent became pregnant. Tr. 146:19-20. Petitioner was initially happy about the pregnancy and told Respondent he would change his lifestyle. Tr. 147:3-13. But in late December 2012, Petitioner became angry and told Respondent he did not want her to keep the baby. Tr. 147:14-24. Specifically, Respondent testified Petitioner returned home from a party at a nearby pub and threw a milk carton from the fridge against a wall in anger. Tr. 147:20-148:9. The next day, Respondent's mother came over and Respondent gave her money. Tr. 148:13-24. This upset Petitioner and he locked Respondent out of the apartment later that night even though\n   Respondent was one month pregnant and the weather was \"freezing cold.\" Tr. 148:23-149:10. In response to Respondent's requests to be let back in the apartment or for a blanket, Petitioner initially allowed her to return only until the next morning, but the next day \"[Petitioner] acted like nothing happened.\" Tr. 149:12-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At her mother's urging, Respondent had an abortion in February 2013 in Italy, where her father lived, because Respondent was concerned of possible complications with the baby due to her previous drug overdose. Tr. 150:2-19. Respondent told Petitioner of her plan to have an abortion the day she went to the hospital for the procedure, and Petitioner did not want her to have the abortion. Tr. 150:20-151:2. Petitioner accused Respondent's father of murdering his child and threatened to kill Respondent's father. Tr. 151:6-12. Petitioner coordinated with a friend of his who worked for a gossip newspaper to create an article stating Petitioner was looking for Respondent who had purportedly gone missing, and Petitioner was afraid Respondent might have had an abortion. Tr. 151:15-153:20; Ex. BM. Respondent returned to Hungary in March 2013, and Petitioner picked her up at the airport and acted \"calm,\" \"nice,\" and \"caring.\" Tr. 154:15-19. The next day, Petitioner became upset about the abortion, so Respondent left him and went to his mother's apartment. Tr. 154:23-25. The following morning, Petitioner went to his mother's apartment and \"was very mad and aggressive\" and slapped Respondent \"very hard\" several times. Tr. 155:1-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite this incident, Respondent began living with Petitioner again. Tr. 155:16-19. Respondent testified she was afraid that if she did not live with Petitioner again, he would use the sexually explicit videos he recorded to \"destroy everything around [her]\" by sending the videos to her parents, her friends, and any potential future boyfriend \"so ho could destroy the relationship.\" Tr. 155:22-156:11. Respondent was also afraid that if she left Petitioner to try to find a job, Petitioner would send the videos to her new employer. Tr. 156:12-15. When asked why she believed Petitioner would do this, Respondent explained she had heard Petitioner drunkenly say that when his ex-partner, Ms. Arnoth, asked for child support for their children, he threatened to send a video of Ms. Arnoth to Ms. Arnoth's employer. Tr. 156:16-157:5. During the fall of 2013, Petitioner continued to ask Respondent to have sex with other men \"[a] few times a week.\" Tr. 157:6-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In December 2013, Respondent became pregnant with NIR. Tr. 19:3-5, 160:14-15. Initially, Petitioner was happy about the pregnancy. Tr. 19:6-8, 160:19-22. Petitioner testified they looked for a new apartment in which to raise NIR in Budapest and made other preparations for NIR's birth when Respondent was approximately five months pregnant. Tr. 21:25-22:12. Respondent, however, testified that during her pregnancy, she wanted to raise NIR in New York and never intended to raise NIR in Hungary from his birth. Tr. 170:19-23, 225:6-8. Respondent booked tickets to travel to the United States at the end of the summer of 2014, but ultimately did not travel to the United States at that time. Tr. 171:5-16. While Respondent was pregnant with NIR, Petitioner continued to ask her to have sex with other men, and in February 2014, Respondent gave in to his requests. Tr. 161:7-22. Petitioner recorded the encounter and uploaded it to his YouTube channel. Tr. 161:25-162:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Later, after they broke up, Petitioner made the private videos of sexual encounters involving Respondent-which were previously only available to him and Respondent, Tr. 49:17-22-publicly available. Tr. 172:25-173:10. After she left Petitioner,\n   Respondent received harassing messages on a daily basis from several Facebook accounts containing screenshots of these videos, Tr. 173:11-16, and Petitioner sent Respondent screenshots of the videos \"to remind [her] what a nasty and worthless bastard\" she was, Tr. 173:3-4. In December 2014, Respondent sent an email to the Budapest Police attaching pornographic screenshots of several of the Facebook accounts that contacted her. Tr. 174:10-175:1; Ex. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Both parties agree they had an argument in June 2014 that effectively ended their relationship, Tr. 22:24-23:2, 162:22-23, but their accounts of what led to the argument differ. Petitioner's testimony regarding what led to the argument is not altogether clear. Petitioner testified Respondent received a phone call from her father, who was upset after viewing a photo Petitioner uploaded to Facebook of Petitioner kissing Respondent's stomach while she was visibly pregnant. Tr. 23:5-27:12; Ex. 2. Petitioner testified Respondent's father was upset because her father did not want her to have the baby.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 25:20-25. Petitioner testified he told her to leave. Tr. 24:3-9.

Petitioner, who was \"a little drunk,\" spat in her face several times and threatened to throw a professional photography light at her, and she left. Tr. 163:9-23. Respondent went to her mother's apartment, where she lived after moving out from living with Petitioner. Tr. 27:13-15, 163:24-164:3, 254:21-255:2. Respondent returned briefly to Petitioner in July 2014, but left that same night after discovering the underwear of another woman in Petitioner's apartment. Tr. 28:4-12, 164:12-165:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Respondent next saw Petitioner on August 20, 2014, when he showed up at her mother's apartment. Tr. 53:12-18, 165:19-166:5. Petitioner admitted he was drunk and upset. Tr. 53:22-23. Respondent called the police, who told Petitioner to leave, and he left. Tr. 166:2-5. Petitioner returned later that night and threw a rock through a window, shattering the window. Tr. 166:23-167:8. Respondent called the police again, who came, but by that time Petitioner had left. Tr. 167:7-8. Respondent recorded a portion of Petitioner's interaction that night with her and her mother during which Petitioner was verbally abusive and, among other threats, stated \"[i]f I am not there at the birth of my child, you're gone, you're history!\" Tr. 167:9-12, 168:17-170:18; Ex. G at HERRERA_0000274_T at 5:44. Petitioner acknowledged he was sentenced to community service as a result of breaking the window, Tr. 55:18-24, and Petitioner acknowledged it was his voice on the recording, Tr. 117:4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   NIR was born in Budapest, Hungary on September 19, 2014. Tr. 28:16-20, 171:17-18; Joint Proposed Pre-Trial Order at 2, ECF No. 33. Petitioner was not listed as NIR's father on NIR's birth certificate. Tr. 171:19-21. Within a few days of NIR's birth, Petitioner went to Respondent's building with police officers to see the\n   baby. Tr. 31:15-32:11, 172:1-14, 229:11-18. Respondent told Petitioner and the police that Petitioner had no right to see the baby, and the police agreed. Tr. 172:7-20. During this encounter, Petitioner acted aggressively and Respondent believed he was drunk. Tr. 172:21-24. Respondent described Petitioner as acting in a manner that was \"too nasty for [the] meeting of a newborn baby.\" Tr. 172:22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Approximately two months after NIR's birth, Petitioner filed a paternity lawsuit in Hungary to establish his parental rights. Tr. 33:6-14. Respondent appeared for the first proceeding in March 2015 with her lawyer and described Petitioner as behaving aggressively and noted he appeared drunk. Tr. 177:9-17.

Respondent also admitted she did not appear at subsequent court proceedings despite subpoenas ordering her to appear. Tr. 230:3-9. Although Petitioner informed the court and the police of his belief that Respondent intended to leave Hungary with NIR, the court did not inform Respondent she could not leave Hungary with her son.

Tr. 178:6-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In early 2015, Petitioner continued to send harassing messages to Respondent. Tr. 184:16-19. In one message, Petitioner stated, \"[y]ou either let me see my son or I will destroy you and you will end up in jail with your mother, but maybe your rather as well.\" Tr. 188:3-15; Ex. W at HERRERA_0000412 - HERRERA_0000450_T.

L;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. O (Facebook account containing photo album with hundreds of pornographic images of Respondent). Respondent reported the messages to the Budapest Police in June 2015. Tr. 195:2-6, 265:1-9; Ex. L; Ex. O. Respondent was unable to receive a protective order because she and Petitioner no longer lived together. Tr. 265:10-13. Petitioner testified he has a good relationship with a police commander, who brought him documents related to the complaints Respondent made to the police about Petitioner. Tr. 122:20-123:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After appearing in court in March 2015 in connection with Petitioner's paternity suit, Respondent saw Petitioner in person several times before leaving Hungary for the United States. Tr. 201:1-4. On one occasion, Respondent was with NIR at a bank. Tr. 201:5-8. Petitioner walked into the bank and acted aggressively, and Respondent testified she believed he was drunk. Tr. 201:9-12. Respondent asked security to call the police because Petitioner refused to let her leave. Tr. 201:13-16. On another occasion in the summer of 2015, Petitioner went to Respondent's mother's lake house and was drinking beer nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tr. 201:21-202:4. Respondent testified she was scared by Petitioner's presence because she knew he had been waiting for her there. Tr. 202:2-4. On several other occasions, Petitioner showed up near Respondent's apartment. Tr. 202:14-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 25, 2015, Respondent left with NIR for the United States. Tr. 202:21-23; Joint Proposed Pre-Trial Order at 2. Respondent arrived in New York, where her mother's husband lived at the time and still currently lives. Tr. 203:5-10. Respondent testified that when she left, she did not intend to return to Hungary to raise NIR there, and has not considered going back to Hungary since coming to the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 203:19-24, 223:10-12.

Respondent's father sends money to Respondent on a monthly basis and financially supports her and NIR; the amount he sends her has fluctuated but gradually increased to $1,000.00 per month. Tr. 204:15-22, 250:19-24. Respondent lived at several locations in New York before she met Carlos Herrera in October 2015, whom she met by posting an ad on Craigslist looking for a room. Tr. 204:23-206:2. Mr. Herrera was fifty-eight years old at the time and was an American citizen. Tr. 205:15-16, 206:21-22. Respondent initially rented a room from Mr. Herrera in October 2015, and they married after living together for eight months. Tr. 206:5-25. Respondent stated she married him because he was \"very nice\" to her and had a good relationship with NIR, and because of his status as an American citizen, which could change her immigration status and NIR's immigration status. Tr. 207:17-208:1. Mr. Herrera passed away in May 2017 because of health complications related to kidney disease and a heart attack. Tr. 218:23-219:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In June 2016, the Hungarian court issued a decision declaring Petitioner the father of NIR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 4; Tr. 38:20-21. After the court order, Petitioner was able to change NIR's birth certificate to reflect his paternity. Tr. 39:5-40:22; Ex. 3. Petitioner tried to see NIR, but he learned Respondent had left for New York with NIR. Tr. 40:23-41:23. Petitioner went to the Ministry of Justice of Hungary to try to initiate NIR's return, and on March 30, 2017, the Ministry of Justice of Hungary sent a letter to the United States Department of State in connection with Petitioner's application. Tr. 43:7-19; Ex. 5. On October 1, 2017, Petitioner completed a \"Request for return of a child wrongfully removed abroad,\" which was filed with the United States Department of State, the Hague Convention Central Authority for the United States, in October 2017. Ex. 6; Petition at 5; Decl. of Brent L. Andrus in Supp. of Pet.'s Pre-Hr'g Br. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 25. On October 20, 2017, the United States Department of State sent a letter to Respondent, informing her of Petitioner's application. Tr. 44:21-45:6; Ex. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Respondent and NIR are both currently permanent residents of the United States, having applied in August 2016.

NIR's primary language is English, and he speaks only a \"few words\" of Hungarian. Tr. 221:18-23. He has friends in New York and now attends school. Tr. 222:3-8; Ex. BD. Respondent testified that NIR loves New York and is excited about going to school. Tr. 257:16-22. Petitioner has continued to threaten Respondent since she has been in New York. Tr. 217:8-218:22; Ex. Z.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Both parties presented testimony from Hungarian law experts. Respondent's Hungarian law expert, Dr. Blanca Ill\u00e9s-whose testimony this Court credits-testified Petitioner became a father by court order. Tr. 275:16-19. Dr. Ill\u00e9s explained there are four methods by which paternity can be established under Hungarian law: court order, wedlock, a special human reproduction procedure, and an acknowledgement of paternity. Tr. 276:12-17. She testified that the only applicable method in this case is the first method,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a court order. Tr. 277:8-11. In Hungary, an unmarried father has no legal custodial rights before paternity is established, and an engagement between the parties does not grant an unmarried father any additional rights. Tr. 277:17-20. Regarding the date upon which Petitioner acquired paternity rights, Dr. Ill\u00e9s testified that even though Exhibit 4-the court order at issue-bears a date of June 16, 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at MOHACSI_0000520, the court order did not become legally binding and final until September 2, 2016, because of Hungarian legal rules governing the time for appeals and finality of certain court orders. Tr. 277:21-288:4. Accordingly, Dr. Ill\u00e9s testified that Petitioner became the father of NIR on September 2, 2016, once the court order became final. Tr. 288:22-289:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   When asked about the date upon which Petitioner's parental rights became final, Petitioner's Hungarian law expert, Dr. Orsolya Szeibert, acknowledged the court order was not final on June 16, 2016 due to the time for appeals. Tr. 340:3-342:5. Dr. Szeibert testified she was \"not sure about the exact calculation according to the procedural civil code,\" Tr. 342:1-3, and while she \"would like to say early July is correct\" regarding when Petitioner's parental rights vested, she acknowledged she did not know the applicable rules, Tr. 346:7-348:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dr. Ill\u00e9s testified that under Hungarian law, Respondent would have been legally permitted to leave Hungary for the United States in August 2015 because, at that time, Respondent was the sole custodial parent, and the pendency of the Hungarian court paternity proceeding did not change the analysis. Tr. 288:14-289:1. Dr. Ill\u00e9s explained that during a paternity case, a father does not have parental rights, Tr. 288:22-23, and Dr. Szeibert acknowledged that prior to the Hungarian court's order, Petitioner had no parental or custodial rights under Hungarian law, Tr. 343:2-4, 349:8-23. Moreover, Dr. Ill\u00e9s testified that under Hungarian law, paternity orders from a court do not have retroactive effect. Tr. 289:2-289:8. Dr. Szeibert ultimately agreed. Tr. 351:13-352:2. Dr. Ill\u00e9s testified that once a paternity decision becomes final, a father would have to start a second procedure to determine visitation, child\n   support, and custody, and this second procedure usually takes two or three years, although it is possible to request temporary visitation, which can be obtained within three months. Tr. 290:24-291:14. Dr. Ill\u00e9s testified that while a paternity case is pending, the court before which the case is pending does not have any custodial rights, nor does a trustee appointed to represent the interests of the child. Tr. 292:1-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although Dr. Szeibert testified that parental rights include custody rights, Tr. 338:18-19, 339:11-12, 343:16-22, other parts of her testimony indicate there is a separate procedure to enforce those rights. For example, she testified that once there is a judgment establishing paternity, \"you are the father of the child, and you have parental rights,\" but for \"access to the child,\" the father would need to \"arrange it\" either by agreement or by a court order.

Although Petitioner contends the Hungarian court \"would have refused to agree to [NIR's] removal\" if Respondent had informed the court of her plans to permanently leave Hungary with NIR, Pet.'s Post-Hr'g Br. at 11, the evidence shows the Hungarian court was aware of Respondent's plans, yet did nothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 177:24-178:5, 261:12-25.

Wrongful Retention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Petitioner argues that even if this Court finds Respondent's removal of NIR to the United States in August 2015 was not wrongful, Respondent has wrongfully retained NIR in the United States in violation of his custody rights. Pet.'s Post-Hr'g Br. at 11-15. Petitioner argues NIR's retention in the United States became wrongful \"on the date that Petitioner's custody rights were confirmed,\" which Petitioner contends is sometime in early July 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.

Indeed, Petitioner alleges Hungary was NIR's place of habitual residence \"on the latest possible date the wrongful retention began\" Pet.'s Post-Hr'g Br. at 12. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds Petitioner's paternal rights became final on September 2, 2016. Accordingly, Petitioner's claim of wrongful retention turns on the determination of NIR's habitual residence immediately prior to September 2, 2016, when the Hungarian court order became final and when Petitioner alleges the retention of NIR in the United States became wrongful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Gitter\n   </em>\n   , the first step in determining habitual residence under the Convention is to look into the intent \"of those entitled to fix the child's residence.\"\n   <em>\n    Gitter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9033558\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/124/#p129\">\n    396 F.3d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Respondent moved with NIR to the United States in August 2015, Petitioner had not been confirmed as NIR's father and was not entitled to fix NIR's residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067958\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/729/#p731\">\n    724 F.3d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding respondent, who had sole custody of the child at issue, had the \"exclusive right to fix the place of [the child's] residence\"). As a result, only Respondent's intent is relevant. She testified she always intended to raise NIR in New York and never intended to raise NIR in Hungary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 170:19-23,203:19-204:4,225:6-8. Her intent is supported by evidence in the record, including her marriage to a U.S. citizen, the fact that she and NIR are both lawful permanent residents, and the fact that she has not left New York since arriving. Accordingly, Respondent's physical move to the United States with NIR, coupled with her intent to raise NIR in New York, establishes that as of September 2, 2016-when the Hungarian court's order became final-the United States had already been established as NIR's habitual residence. Petitioner's claim of wrongful retention fails because Petitioner cannot show NIR has been wrongfully retained in a country other than his place of habitual residence, which is the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Although it is not necessary to consider Petitioner's intent because he did not have any custodial or parental rights prior to September 2, 2016 and was not entitled to fix NIR's residence before that date, even if this Court considers his intent, his claim of wrongful retention still fails. The parties' testimony makes clear they never shared an intent regarding where NIR would be raised, and their relationship had broken down by the time of NIR's birth in September 2014. Although Petitioner testified they planned to raise NIR together in Hungary and made preparations for NIR's arrival,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 20:10-22:12, and further asserts he and Respondent always intended to raise NIR in Hungary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pet.'s Post-Hr'g Br. at 12-13, Respondent testified\n   she always intended to raise NIR in New York and never intended to raise NIR in Hungary,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 170:19-23, 225:6-8. By the time of NIR's birth in September 2014, Respondent and Petitioner no longer lived together; Respondent had been living with her mother for several months after moving out from living with Petitioner. Approximately a month before NIR's birth, Petitioner drunkenly threw a rock through the window of the building where Respondent was residing at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Courts have recognized the difficulty of determining habitual residence in cases involving young children where, like here, the parties' relationship breaks down prior to or right after the birth of the child. In discussing habitual residence in the case of young children, the Third Circuit has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Where a matrimonial home exists, i.e., where both parents share a settled intent to reside, determining the habitual residence of an infant presents no particular problem, it simply calls for application of the analysis under the Convention with which courts have become familiar. Where the parents' relationship has broken down, however, as in this case, the character of the problem changes. Of course, the mere fact that conflict has developed between the parents does not\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   disestablish a child's habitual residence, once it has come into existence.

At bottom, Petitioner has failed to establish that NIR-who was less than one year old when Respondent moved with him to the United States in August 2015-was ever habitually resident in Hungary given the lack of shared intent to raise NIR there, the breakdown of the parties' relationship prior to NIR's birth, and NIR's presumed inability to form meaningful connections as an infant before leaving.

As already described in detail, Petitioner has engaged in a prolonged course of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse of Respondent. Petitioner admitted to physically assaulting Respondent on more than one occasion, and his physical abuse includes one incident in which he nearly choked her to death. Petitioner has threatened to kill Respondent. Among other insults Petitioner directed at Respondent during the August 20, 2014 incident, Petitioner stated, \"I'm coming back in the morning, and I'm gonna whack your head to pieces!\" Ex. G at HERRERA_0000274_T at 6:57. Petitioner's threats have continued since Respondent has been in New York. Petitioner consistently pressured Respondent into engaging in sexual activity with other men-including by encouraging her to take drugs-and filmed several of these encounters, which he later uploaded to YouTube. When Respondent, who had never had sex before meeting Petitioner, initially refused Petitioner's demands, Petitioner verbally degraded her and called her a \"fake actress bitch.\" Petitioner sent screenshots of these sexual encounters to Respondent's father and has engaged in a campaign of online harassment of Respondent using sexual images from the videos he filmed. Petitioner forced Respondent to watch the videos he filmed while they had sex as punishment for being a \"nasty bitch.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Far from being sporadic or isolated incidents, the evidence shows Petitioner has subjected Respondent to repeated abuse over the course of many years. Dr. Cling testified Respondent was \"very credible, psychologically speaking,\" and she determined Respondent suffers from PTSD as a result of Petitioner's abuse. Tr. 311:22-23; Ex. BN at 9 (\"[Respondent] still suffers from some symptoms of PTSD related to the domestic violence she experienced.\"). Dr. Cling explained there is an \"extreme risk\" Petitioner's abuse of Respondent would continue and perhaps intensify if she returned to Hungary, and \"[a]s a perpetrator of domestic violence with a clear obsession with controlling [Respondent], [Petitioner] is psychologically extremely likely to continue to harass and abuse her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. BN at 9; Tr. 314:6-14. As a result, Dr. Cling stated \"[w]ere NIR to witness first-hand the type of abuse that [Petitioner] has inflicted on his mother in the past, NIR would face a substantial risk of developing psychological symptomatology,\" a risk which was \"reinforced by the close bond NIR shares with [Respondent] as his sole caretaker.\" Ex. BN at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"Observing this harassment and abuse would expose NIR to psychological harm.\"). Dr. Cling testified it would be \"very harmful to NIR\" if he witnessed the abuse, Tr. 314:10-15, and testified there is empirical evidence suggesting that for children who witness their mother being abused, \"it is like direct child abuse of them, so that's very serious,\" Tr. 315:2-8. In addition to the dangers of viewing first-hand Petitioner's abuse of Respondent, Dr. Cling also testified regarding the potential of abuse of NIR directly. She testified that\n   perpetrators of domestic violence are more likely to become child abusers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 315:9-17, 325:11-13. Dr. Cling noted \"the two incidents where [Petitioner] accosted [Respondent] when she was holding NIR as an infant, which is an indicator of a certain disregard of the child\" also had some bearing on her assessment of the risk of harm to NIR. Tr. 331:10-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Taking into account Petitioner's long history of abuse of Respondent and Dr. Cling's unrebutted expert testimony regarding the likelihood of continued abuse and harmful psychological effects NIR is likely to experience were he to witness the abuse, this Court finds Respondent has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that there is a grave risk of harm to NIR if this Court granted the petition. Petitioner argues Respondent fails to establish a grave risk of harm because, among other reasons, there is no evidence NIR was present for or witnessed any of Petitioner's prior abuse of Respondent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet.'s Post-Hr'g Reply Br. at 9. But this argument is misleading because a substantial portion of Petitioner's prior abuse occurred before NIR's birth and the parties were no longer living together or spending time together when NIR was born. On the small number of occasions when Petitioner has interacted with Respondent in NIR's presence, Respondent's testimony indicates Petitioner acted aggressively and was drunk. It would be disingenuous to attempt to minimize the risk of harm to NIR by arguing there is no evidence NIR witnessed past abuse. Although the grave risk of psychological harm to NIR from witnessing the abuse of his mother is enough to establish the applicability of the defense, Dr. Cling's testimony regarding the potential for physical abuse of NIR further supports this conclusion. In addition, Petitioner has threatened to show NIR sexually explicit images of Respondent; indeed, Respondent testified regarding her fear that Petitioner would show NIR the sexually explicit videos. Tr. 263:14-23; Ex. C. at HERRERA_0000103_T.

When considering the entire period of time during which NIR has lived in the United States, the evidence unequivocally points to the conclusion NIR has become acclimatized to New York. Whether NIR has become acclimatized when considering only his time in the United States until September 2, 2016-when the Hungarian court's order became final and when the continued retention of NIR is alleged to have become wrongful-is a closer question, but the evidence still shows NIR had become acclimatized in this shorter timeframe. By September 2016, NIR had lived in the United States for more than half of his life and had a pending application to be a lawful permanent resident. Petitioner argues NIR's life in the United States during this period of time was unstable because, among other reasons, \"NIR lived in three different homes,\" which Petitioner argues cuts against a determination that NIR acclimatized to the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pet.'s Post-Hr'g Br. at 3.
