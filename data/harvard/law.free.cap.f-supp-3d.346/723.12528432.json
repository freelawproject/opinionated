Plaintiff George Matheis, Jr. brings this action, alleging that Defendant CSL Plasma Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"CSL\") unlawfully discriminated against him due to his disability. Presently before the court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 26.) For the reasons that follow, the court will grant Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts are not in dispute. CSL is the owner and operator of a plasma donation center located in York, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 26-1, \u00b6 2.) At its heart, CSL's business model consists of screening potential blood plasma donors, accepting or rejecting those potential donors, taking blood plasma from approved donors, paying those donors for their plasma, and selling the plasma to pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-9.) CSL is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and is licensed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-16.) FDA regulations guide CSL in determining whether to accept or reject potential donors and require prospective donors to undergo a physical examination and complete a medical history questionnaire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) Members of the public are allowed in CSL's reception area, but must be screened and approved before being allowed into the plasma donation portion of the facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) CSL staff members\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   obtain a blood sample and a \"brief\" medical history consisting of current health, surgeries, medications, diagnoses, tattoos, needle marks, and other related questions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) Staff members also perform a visual examination and may reject donors if they appear to have an undisclosed illness or if a disclosed illness appears particularly severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.) Staff use a medical reference document that lists common conditions and gives guidance on whether those conditions could cause a potential donor to be rejected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) If the staff member is unsure whether a potential donor should be rejected, the staff member can call a licensed physician and consult about whether to accept or reject the potential donor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a Pennsylvania citizen who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\") stemming from a medical screening that occurred after a police-involved shooting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.) Due to his disability, Plaintiff sometimes suffers from panic attacks when exposed to crowded or confined spaces, verbal altercations, or helicopter noise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.) The symptoms associated with Plaintiff's PTSD range from physical paralysis to violent outbursts such as breaking a door off of its hinges if Plaintiff feels trapped in a confined space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49.) Despite his PTSD, Plaintiff successfully made approximately 90 plasma donations at the CSL facility between January and December 2016 and earned approximately $250-$300 per month from plasma donations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.) Plaintiff never had a panic attack during the donation process. Since October 2016, Plaintiff has used a service dog, \"Odin,\" to help him cope with his PTSD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.) Odin was originally purchased as a pet and was not specifically \"prescribed\" by a medical professional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) Odin's training included \"pressure therapy,\" which consisted of leaning on or lying against Plaintiff when a panic attack was imminent and \"willful disobey,\" meaning that Odin would leave his sitting position and lead Plaintiff out of the triggering environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During Odin's initial training, Plaintiff brought him to the CSL facility to allow Odin to become comfortable with places that Plaintiff frequents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.) A staff member initially told Plaintiff that dogs were not allowed in the facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff was instructed to confer with a staff member and informed the staff member that Odin was a service dog used to help him deal with his anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.) Plaintiff was informed that CSL had a policy prohibiting service animals for anxiety, but allows service animals for vision-disabled and hearing-disabled patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40, 67-70.) According to CSL policy, this limitation is not due to health concerns related to the dog's presence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) Instead, the need for a service dog for anxiety is an indicator that the potential donor's anxiety is too severe to safely undergo the donation process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CSL essentially equates the use of a service dog with the need for \"more than two medications daily\" to treat anxiety-related issues, which is a standard reason to reject a potential donor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) This rejection criteria is based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20630.10\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2), which provides that a \"donor is ineligible to donate when donating could adversely affect the health of the donor ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 41.) Apparently, CSL fears that a patient with severe anxiety could harm himself or herself if the donation process induces an anxiety or panic attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Plaintiff had been rejected as a donor and informed of the CSL policy, a CSL nurse told Plaintiff that he would be able to donate if he brought a note from his physician stating that he could donate safely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.) While having this conversation with the CSL nurse, Plaintiff began to have a panic attack and left the facility aided by the nurse and a general manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.) Plaintiff has not returned to CSL or any other plasma donation center since that incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 3, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging discrimination under the ADA, as well as either negligent infliction of emotional distress or intentional infliction\n   of emotional distress under Pennsylvania law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1.) CSL filed an answer to the complaint on June 5, 2017. (Doc. 10.) After the conclusion of discovery, CSL filed the instant motion for summary judgment on March 3, 2018. (Doc. 26.) Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition on March 24, 2018, (Doc. 30,) and CLS filed a reply brief on April 15, 2018 (Doc. 32).

The moving party can discharge the burden by showing that \"on all the essential elements of its case on which it bears the burden of proof at trial, no reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bressman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9134499\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/229/#p238\">\n    327 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (3d Cir. 2003). If the moving party meets this initial burden, the non-moving party \"must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to material facts,\" but must show sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict in its favor.\n   <em>\n    Boyle v.

However, if the non-moving party \"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the non-movant's case, and on which the non-movant will bear the burden of proof at trial,\" Rule 56 mandates the entry of summary judgment because such a failure \"necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\"\n   <em>\n    Jakimas v.

In order to state a claim for discrimination under Title III, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that he is disabled; (2) that the defendant qualifies as a place of public accommodation as defined by the ADA; and (3) that the defendant discriminated against him based on one or more of his disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Sharrow v.

The parties do not contest that Plaintiff's PTSD qualifies as a disability under the ADA. Thus, the court will turn first to a novel issue in this Circuit: whether a plasma donation center, such as CSL, is a \"place of public accommodation\" as defined by the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. CSL meets the definition of public accommodation under the ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ADA sets forth an enumerated list of places that qualify as a place of public accommodation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The following private entities are considered public accommodations for purposes of this subchapter, if the operations of such entities affect commerce-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (A) an inn, hotel, motel, or other place of lodging, except for an establishment located within a building that contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and that is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as the residence of such proprietor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (B) a restaurant, bar, or other establishment serving food or drink;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (C) a motion picture house, theater, concert hall, stadium, or other place of exhibition or entertainment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (D) an auditorium, convention center, lecture hall, or other place of public gathering;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (E) a bakery, grocery store, clothing store, hardware store, shopping center, or other sales or rental establishment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (F) a laundromat, dry-cleaner, bank, barber shop, beauty shop, travel service, shoe repair service, funeral parlor, gas station, office of an accountant or lawyer, pharmacy, insurance office, professional office of a health care provider, hospital, or other service establishment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7). The parties do not contest that CSL is a private entity and that it \"affects commerce\" because it supplies pharmaceutical companies with necessary material to produce pharmaceuticals which are, in turn, sold to the public or other medical service entities. CSL argues that it does not fall within any of the enumerated categories of places of public accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Not surprisingly, \"plasma donation center\" is not a specifically enumerated entity that is defined as a public accommodation under the ADA. Plaintiff argues that a plasma donation center qualifies as an \"other service establishment\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(F), because it is substantially similar to other entities on the enumerated list and because requiring a plasma donation center to meet the requirements of the ADA would effect the remedial purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tawam v. APCI Fed. Credit Union\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-cv-122,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203723367\">\n    2018 WL 3723367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *6 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 6, 2018) (holding that a federal credit union is subject to ADA requirements because it is substantially similar to a \"bank,\" which is an enumerated public accommodation). Although this court is aware of no other courts in this Circuit that have decided whether a plasma donation center qualifies as public accommodation under the ADA, courts in other jurisdictions have done so. Unfortunately, there is a split in authority between courts that have considered the issue. This court will begin its analysis by reviewing the relevant decisions from those jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals appears to be the only federal appellate court to have decided this issue. In\n   <em>\n    Levorsen v.

The Court of Appeals reversed the district court, holding that the exchange of a service for a fee is not dispositive on the issue of whether an entity is a public accommodation and that a plasma donation center is sufficiently similar to the examples listed in Section 12181(7)(F) to bring it under the purview of Title III of the ADA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336564\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1227/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The underlying facts in\n   <em>\n    Levorsen\n   </em>\n   are substantially similar to those in the instant case. Levorsen was an individual seeking to donate plasma at a facility owned and operated by Octapharma. Octapharma and CSL's policies and business models are essentially identical.

The Court concluded\n   that the ordinary meaning of the term \"service establishment\" was unambiguous and, thus, the Court need look no further than the plain language of the statute. Further, the Court held that a plasma donation center was a service establishment because it \" 'assist[ed] or benefit[ed]' those who wish to provide plasma for medical use-whether for altruistic reasons or for pecuniary gain-by supplying the trained personnel and medical equipment necessary to accomplish that goal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1234 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2075 (2002) (\"Webster's\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Judge Holmes of the Tenth Circuit dissented, concluding that a plasma donation center was more akin to a manufacturing plant which would be excluded from the ADA's requirements. Judge Holmes, employing the canons of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   , determined that plasma donations centers were distinct from other enumerated service establishments in that they did not exchange a good or skilled act (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   shoe-repair, dry-cleaning, or accountant services) for compensation from a consumer. The dissent characterized the plasma donation centers as manufacturers, comparing them to paper mills that receive input in the form of wood and convert the wood into paper. In support of this characterization, Judge Holmes cites public health laws that define blood plasma as a \"biological product\" and requires that biological products be marked with the identity \"of the manufacturer of the biological product.\" 42 U.S.C \u00a7 262(i)(1) ; 262(a)(1)(B)(ii). Furthermore, FDA regulations define \"manufacturers\" as any \"legal person or entity engaged in the manufacture of a product subject to license under the act ...,\" which includes Source Plasma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.3\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (t), 606.171(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 640.71(a) (\"All steps in the manufacturing of Source Plasma, including donor examination, blood collection, plasmapheresis, laboratory testing, labeling, storage, and issuing shall be performed by personnel of the establishment licensed to manufacture Source Plasma ...\"). Based in part on these FDA regulations, Judge Holmes concluded that plasma donation centers were manufacturers rather than service establishments and, thus, were not subject to the ADA's public accommodation requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In line with the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Levorsen\n   </em>\n   , the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in\n   <em>\n    Silguero v.

In\n   <em>\n    Silguero\n   </em>\n   , one donor had severe knee problems that CSL staff determined could prevent him from safely transferring to and from the donation bed, and the other donor required a service dog to cope with anxiety issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Texas court's reasoning was straightforward: it rejected the plaintiffs' argument that facilitating the donation of plasma was a \"service\" and held that plasma donation centers did not meet the definition of an \"other service establishment\" because they did not involve an exchange of goods or skilled acts for compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8. The Texas court, like the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Levorsen\n   </em>\n   , applied the canons of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   , finding that the key defining feature of other service establishments listed in Section 12181(7) involved an exchange of something for money from the public.

Under either canon, where a general term follows a specific term or terms, a court is to interpret the general term in accord with the specific term.\n   <em>\n    Norfolk &amp; W. Ry.

Here, the relevant specific terms are \"laundromats, dry-cleaners, banks, barber shops, beauty shops, travel services, shoe repair services, funeral parlors, gas stations, lawyers' offices, accountants' offices, pharmacies, insurance offices, health care providers' professional offices, and hospitals.\" Both the dissent and the Texas court found the common connection between these types of businesses to be that they all required payment in exchange for the performance of skilled acts or the use of specialized equipment. Although Judge Holmes and the\n   <em>\n    Silguero\n   </em>\n   court found the payment element to be the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of a service establishment under the ADA, this court disagrees. For example, hospitals are required to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay. Other health care providers and pharmacies also do not always receive payment directly from the consumer for services rendered. It is true that pharmacies, health care providers and, sometimes, hospitals, do receive payment from insurance providers; yet, CSL is paid for the \"services\" rendered, simply from a different entity than the person for whom it performs a \"service.\" Likewise, banks do not always profit by charging a fee from consumers. In fact, the traditional model of a private bank is that it holds money in trust for its customers and, rather than\n   charge a fee for doing so, loans that money out to others and charges interest on those loans. A bank is unquestionably included as a service establishment, yet it profits from a third party rather than direct payment from the consumers to whom it provides a service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Judge Holmes also offered an alternative definition of a service establishment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [E]very service establishment listed in [ Section] 12181(7)(F) shares some key unifying traits: they offer to the public a 'service' (1) in the form of (a) expertise (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , barbers, beauticians, shoe-repair craftsman, dry cleaners, funeral parlors, lawyers, accountants, insurance offices, pharmacists, health care providers, and hospitals) or (b) specialized equipment (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , laundromats and gas stations), (2) for use in achieving some desired end of the public, (3) in exchange for compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, the first two factors are clearly met. CSL uses skilled staff and specialized equipment to screen potential donors, extract blood, and separate it into component parts. This achieves the desired end of the public in donating plasma. As discussed above, this court does not view the exchange of compensation to be dispositive; however, CSL is compensated for its effort: it is paid by the pharmaceutical companies. Thus, it would arguably satisfy the dissent's own criteria in that it receives compensation for its services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Although the\n   <em>\n    Silguero\n   </em>\n   court did not look to regulatory definitions in order to determine whether a plasma donation center meets the definition of a service establishment under the ADA, Judge Holmes noted that various statutes and FDA regulations define plasma donation centers as manufacturers rather than service providers.

Although a plasma donation center rests on the fringe between a service establishment and a manufacturer, the distinction becomes apparent when compared to establishments that do not provide a \"service\" as defined by prior case law. For example, a car manufacturing plant clearly does not fall within the bounds of Title III of the ADA because the general public is not admitted and it provides no service, or anything bearing hallmarks of a service, directly to the public. Likewise a corporate headquarters is not subject to Title III because the public would not typically be admitted and they take no action that serves individuals. In contrast, the plasma donation center is accessible to the general public and in fact encourages persons to walk in off the street to sell plasma. The donation center is far from the manufacturing plant that Defendant seeks to characterize it as. Except for separating the plasma from other blood components, the entirety of the pharmaceutical production occurs off-site and with a separate entity. Even construing the separation of blood from its component parts to be \"manufacture,\" this process occurs after and distinct from the screening and donation process. A close analogy is a pawn shop or consignment store, although both clearly fall within a separate category of public accommodation because they have a sales aspect in addition to purchasing goods from the general public. A court would be hard-pressed to conclude that a consignment store would cease to be a public accommodation, however, simply by placing a wall between the room where clothes are bought and where they are sold. When compared to businesses clearly outside the purview of Title III, a donation center aligns more closely with a service establishment than an entity not subject to Title III. Because a plasma donation center is most similar to those types of business clearly included as service establishments and, by its conduct and performance, benefits the public by extracting plasma in exchange for a fee, this court finds that it falls within the ambit of Title III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having concluded that Title III of the ADA applies, the court will next\n   address whether CSL lawfully excluded Plaintiff from donating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

CSL argues that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for rejecting Plaintiff as a donor. Specifically, CSL asserts that Plaintiff's anxiety was severe enough to pose a risk of harm to Plaintiff or CSL staff if the stress of donating or the confined setting of the donation room induced a panic attack during the donation process. CSL's main concern appears to be that Plaintiff would have an attack while the needle used to draw blood was being inserted or was already in his arm, thus risking the needle being torn out of Plaintiff or jabbed into one of the CSL staff members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a footnote, the\n   <em>\n    Levorsen\n   </em>\n   majority acknowledged similar concerns, but noted that defendant Octapharma would still be able to evaluate potential donors and reject them for legitimate medical reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Octapharma insists th[e Court's] conclusion will put [plasma donation centers] in an untenable position by creating a conflict between the ADA and certain regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20606.100\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 606.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (requiring [plasma donation centers] to establish \"[c]riteria used to determine donor eligibility, including acceptable medical history criteria\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20630.10\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 630.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (noting that [plasma donation centers] must determine donor eligibility, and that donors aren't eligible if \"not in good health\" or if [plasma donation center] identifies \"factor(s) that may cause the donation to adversely affect\" a donor's health or the \"safety, purity, or potency of the blood or blood component\").

Generally, in order to state a claim of discrimination under Title III of the ADA, a plaintiff must allege: \"(1) that she is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that defendants own, lease or operate a place of public accommodation; and (3) that defendants discriminated against her by denying her a full and equal opportunity to enjoy the services defendants provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Sharrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"646033\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/910/187/#p191\">\n    910 F.Supp. at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the court must draw a necessary, yet counterintuitive, distinction. CSL admittedly denied Plaintiff access due to his disability, yet that does not require a finding that CSL's reason was discriminatory. The DOJ has promulgated regulations that provide for reasonable safety accommodations for the safe operation of public accommodations: \"A public accommodation may impose legitimate safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation.

Some of these factors give CSL discretion in determining if a potential donor may be ineligible and do not solely relate to the possibility of infection from a blood borne pathogen. The \"symptomatic\" criteria requires the staff member or physician to evaluate the potential donor based on first-hand observations to determine if any undisclosed conditions may exist or if certain conditions are more severe than reported. At issue here, the second criterion, \"[c]ertain medical treatments or medications,\" could include a broad range of disqualifying conditions. CSL has a policy that a service dog is a treatment for anxiety analogous to \"more than two medications daily\" to treat that same condition. (Doc. 26-1, \u00b6 41.) This policy is based on CSL's belief that a patient prone to anxiety or panic attacks could dislodge the needle and injure himself or herself during the donation process. Plaintiff admits that he has had panic attacks in the past with violent symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court does not hold that CSL will be \"forced to relax its donor screening requirements, in order to satisfy the obligations of a place of public accommodation,\" and thus, \"face revocation of its manufacturing license [from the FDA].\" Francis M.

A facility such as CSL that has legitimate concerns with the safety of its staff and donors should not be required to make a knee-jerk decision when faced with a potential safety risk: either accept a donor that may create a significant safety hazard or defend against repeated suits under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the present case, CSL articulated a reasonable belief that Plaintiff's anxiety was so severe as to risk endangering Plaintiff's health. Dr. John Nelson, CSL's Divisional Medical Director since 2005, submitted a declaration on behalf of CSL stating that CSL had a general policy to defer potential donors who had high levels of anxiety. (Doc. 26-1, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 40-41.) This policy is based on concern that someone with high anxiety could be prone to having a panic attack while a needle is in his or her arm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41.) Although CSL uses the term \"defer\" to mean both temporary and permanent rejection, the instant case relates, as of now, only to a temporary denial. CSL stated that it would admit Plaintiff if he provided it with a note from a psychologist stating that he could donate safely with Odin accompanying him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.) Plaintiff declined or failed to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.) Had Plaintiff provided such a note, yet was still rejected, he may have sufficient evidence to demonstrate that CSL's legitimate basis for denial was not related to a legitimate medical concern. Plaintiff produced no such note and never attempted to donate plasma again. Thus, CSL does not argue that an outright ban of Plaintiff is necessary, merely that they must temporarily defer his donation until it can determine if his anxiety is at a level where he could safely donate. Accordingly, CSL has demonstrated a legitimate reason for temporarily rejecting Plaintiff and is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's discrimination claims under the ADA. To be clear, however, the court does not hold that Plaintiff is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ineligible to donate. Plaintiff may, in the future, demonstrate that the risk of a violent panic or anxiety attack is minimal and, thus, be eligible to donate under the FDA's safety regulations. He has yet to make such a demonstration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the court finds that CSL is a public accommodation under the ADA. Further, the court finds that Plaintiff proffered sufficient evidence to demonstrate a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claim for discrimination based on his classification as disabled under the ADA; however, CSL has demonstrated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n   basis for denying him access.
