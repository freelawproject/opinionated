PAUL OETKEN, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs, a group of investment funds known as \"Silvercreek,\" brought this action against Defendants, a set of financial institutions, for conduct relating to the issuance of debt securities by Enron Corporation (\"Enron\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs assert claims under New York state tort law and under federal and Texas securities laws. Defendants Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and Merrill Lynch each move for summary judgment. (Dkt. Nos. 114-15, 121.) For the reasons that follow, the motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Like many of the others to have emerged from the Enron bankruptcy, this is a case whose \"facts are difficult to detail but easy to summarize.\"\n   <em>\n    Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Credit Suisse First Bos. (USA), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865960\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/372/#p377\">\n    482 F.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (5th Cir. 2007). Familiarity with the factual background of this particular dispute is presumed based on this Court's prior opinion on Defendants' motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek Mgmt., Inc. v. Citigroup, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274394\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/428/#p434\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434-36 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), and the relevant facts will be detailed with greater particularity below. The following general background is drawn primarily from the parties' Rule 56.1 statements and is not subject to genuine dispute unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between October 18, 2001, and October 26, 2001, Plaintiffs invested over $100 million in two different Enron securities: the 7% Exchangeable Notes (the \"7% Notes\") and Zero Coupon Exchangeable Notes (the \"Zero Notes\" or \"Zeros\"). (Dkt. No. 221 (\"DBSUF\") \u00b6 344; Dkt. No. 215 (\"CSSUF\") \u00b6\u00b6 118, 127; Dkt. No. 220 (\"MLSUF\") \u00b6\u00b6 218, 250, 253.) Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   purchase of the notes came at a turbulent time for Enron. Cautionary signs regarding the company's stability were beginning to emerge, including the departure of some high level executives, revised financial statements, and the announcement of an SEC inquiry into Enron's financials. (MLSUF \u00b6 256; CSSUF \u00b6 693.) But balanced against these warning signs was Enron's continued issuance of positive press releases confirming its financial solvency. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 259-60.) And analyst and credit agency reports around this key eight-day period were mixed, with some downgrading their assessments of Enron's credit-worthiness but most continuing to recommend Enron as a strong buy or safe investment. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 266-84;\n   <em>\n    see also generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 139-79.) Some of the many positive reports about Enron issued in October 2001 came from the Defendants in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 270-71, 275, 279, 281-82, 284; Dkt. No. 168-45 at 2 (October 26, 2001 Credit Suisse analyst report listing Enron as \"strong buy\"); DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 358-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, time would soon vindicate those skeptical of Enron's financials. On November 8, 2001, Enron was forced to again issue restatements of its audited financials, this time correcting all of its annual reports going back to 1997 as well as its first two 2001 quarterly reports, resulting in billion-dollar changes to reported shareholder equity and balance sheet debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 714-17; DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 351-56.) On December 2, 2001, Enron filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, wiping out practically the entire value of Plaintiffs' late-October investments in Enron's securities. (DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 363, 365.) Plaintiffs' resulting losses on these investments, along with Defendants' alleged role in perpetrating Enron's fraud and influencing Plaintiffs' purchase of Enron's overvalued securities, form the crux of this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Enron's corrections to its financial statements, issued in the weeks following Plaintiffs' investments, stemmed primarily from the company's practice of engaging in transactions with unconsolidated special purpose entities (\"SPEs\") and off-balance-sheet transactions. (DBSUF \u00b6 367.) Enron would conduct transactions with these SPEs-which Enron or its executives nominally controlled but whose assets and debts were not consolidated with Enron's-in order to hide debt and generate income, thereby producing a deceptive picture of Enron's financials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Each Defendant played some role in designing, marketing, funding or implementing a number of the transactions that Enron used to cook its books. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 378, 639-48; CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 758-68, 800; MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 341-45.) Each of the Defendants was also involved to varying degrees with the marketing and distribution of the 7% Notes and Zero Notes that Plaintiffs had purchased in late October 2001. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MLSUF \u00b6 245; CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 120-26; DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 704-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs assert a number of claims based on Defendants' involvement in the transactions underlying Enron's fraud, as well as each Defendant's role in directly marketing Enron's securities to Plaintiffs. Specifically, at issue in these motions are six causes of action: claims against all three Defendants for (1) aiding and abetting Enron's fraud, (2) aiding and abetting Enron's negligent misrepresentation, and (3) conspiracy with Enron to commit fraud; claims against Credit Suisse and Merrill\n   Lynch for (4) negligent misrepresentation; and claims against Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank for violations of (5) Section 11 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a), and (6) the Texas Securities Act (\"TSA\"). All of the Defendants now move for summary judgment on all claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the parties do not generally dispute the foregoing facts, they sharply contest the extent to which the Defendants understood Enron's overall scheme and the legal significance of their contributions to Enron's fraud. Despite turning on a wide range of materials and evidence, the parties' disputes can largely be boiled down to a few core questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Were the Defendants' transactions with Enron inherently fraudulent, or was it only Enron's deceitful reporting of these otherwise legitimate transactions that formed the basis of the underlying fraud? (Dkt. No. 217 (\"DB Reply\") at 6-14.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 To what extent was each Defendant aware of Enron's overall fraudulent scheme, and to what extent can each Defendant's transactions be said to have actually furthered Enron's overall fraudulent scheme? (Dkt. No. 219 (\"ML Reply\") at 2-8, 16-19.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Can Plaintiffs establish that they relied on Enron's false financial statements, or on Defendants' own inaccurate assessments of Enron's financial stability, when purchasing the Enron securities? (Dkt. No. 214 (\"CS Reply\") at 7-13.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Did either Enron or the Defendants directly owe Plaintiffs a duty to accurately report information regarding Enron's financial solvency and the value of its securities?

For purposes of summary judgment, this means that Plaintiffs must produce evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find by clear and convincing evidence that (1) Enron issued a statement containing a material misrepresentation or omission of fact; (2) Enron had knowledge of the falsity of the statement; (3) Enron had an intent to defraud; (4) Plaintiffs reasonably relied on Enron's fraudulent statements; and (5) Plaintiffs suffered damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crigger v.

No party contests that Enron knowingly and intentionally issued false financial statements or that Plaintiffs suffered damages when Enron's fraud came to light and its stock prices collapsed. But Defendants Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse each move for summary judgment on element four of Silvercreek's underlying fraud claim, namely whether Silvercreek reasonably relied on Enron's fraudulent statements. (CS Brief at 18-23; ML Brief at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Actual reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch maintain that there is no evidence that Silvercreek actually relied on Enron's financial statements prior to purchasing the\n   Enron notes in October 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch assert that Plaintiffs purchased the Enron notes \"based solely on [their] price.\" (CS Brief at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ML Brief at 32 (\"Plaintiffs' investments were based solely on Enron's stock and bond prices.\").) But the record contains ample evidence showing that Plaintiffs' analysis into whether to purchase the Enron 7% Notes and Zero Notes was more complex and nuanced than Defendants represent. As Louise Morwick-Silvercreek's founder, director, president, portfolio manager, and the woman responsible for making its final investment decisions (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 8-9)-summarized at one point in her deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   We looked at the fundamentals of this business. We were investing in Enron.... I think the market cap, you know, certainly the combined total cap is 20, 25 billion dollars. It's an investment based on the financials of this company and the business strength of this company. And the financials that we were basing our investment decision on were just complete garbage. They were completely wrong. They weren't even close to reality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Dkt. No. 168-1 at 374:17-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 168-2 \u00b6 6.) Indeed, in numerous different depositions, interrogatory responses, and declarations submitted over this case's years-long discovery period, Morwick and her associates have consistently recounted how important their optimistic assessment of Enron's long-term financial stability was to Silvercreek's late-October 2001 purchases. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 659-66; 698-707.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants urge that Plaintiffs cannot establish the reliance element of their underlying fraud claim against Enron absent evidence that anyone at Silvercreek had read and relied on any of Enron's fraudulent financial statements at the precise time of their investment. (CS Brief at 22; ML Brief at 32.) But even if Morwick did not reread Enron's fraudulent financial reports immediately prior to making her late October 2001 purchases of the notes, there is still ample evidence to support a conclusion that she actually relied on the false statements contained therein at the time she authorized Silvercreek's purchases. For example, the record reflects that she had previously carefully reviewed Enron's false annual reports prior to past investments in Enron. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 202-05, 637-49.) The record also includes evidence showing that Morwick continued to stay abreast of developments at Enron between that time and the October 2001 purchases, including by rereading the prospectuses of the relevant notes, reading select quarterly reports, tracking media and analyst reports, and listening to Enron's quarterly earnings calls. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 652, 659-60; Dkt. No. 168-1 at 771-72, 802-03.) All of these sources of information either directly included fraudulent statements by Enron or themselves incorporated and were based on those statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants also make much of Silvercreek's concession that the drop in the price of Enron's securities directly precipitated its purchase of the 7% Notes and Zero Notes. (CS Brief at 18-19; ML Brief at 32.) But the fact that an investor took price into account when purchasing a bond is hardly remarkable, and that investor's admitting that she did so is not tantamount to admitting that she considered\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   price. Morwick repeatedly stated that even though she ultimately chose to purchase the notes only once she found the price-point sufficiently favorable, her decision to purchase was fundamentally founded on her prior assessments of Enron's financial stability, which itself was based on Enron's fraudulent financial statements. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 619, 660-61, 664-65, 698-707;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 168-1 at 802-03.) Crediting\n   as true Morwick's testimony regarding her Enron investment strategy for purposes of this motion, the Court concludes that there is a sufficient basis from which a jury could reasonably find that Silvercreek actually relied on Enron's fraudulent depiction of its financial stability, and not only on price, at the time it purchased Enron's securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Reasonable Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"In assessing the reasonableness of a plaintiff's alleged reliance, we consider the entire context of the transaction, including factors such as its complexity and magnitude, the sophistication of the parties, and the content of any agreements between them.\"\n   <em>\n    Emergent Capital Inv.

Here, all of Silvercreek's purchases of the Enron 7% Notes and Zero Notes came\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Enron declared bankruptcy. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 118, 127; DBSUF \u00b6 363.) And although Enron had issued some mixed signals leading up to Silvercreek's investment (MLSUF \u00b6 256), Enron announced strong quarterly earnings just two days before Silvercreek began purchasing the Enron notes, telling investors that the recent write-down would be a one-time nonrecurring charge with no impact on Enron's strong outlook moving\n   forward (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 259-60). The fact that the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    In re Livent\n   </em>\n   had already been expressly told\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to rely on the company's past financial statements, while Plaintiffs here were expressly told that they\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   continue to rely on the company's past financial statements, readily distinguishes the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants also rely on New York cases for the proposition that a sophisticated party with warning signs regarding a statement's falsity has a duty to inquire further into the truthfulness of those statements. (CS Brief at 22; ML Brief at 29.) Courts have certainly granted summary judgment where \"sophisticated investors [fail] to protect themselves from misrepresentations made during business acquisitions by investigating the details of the transactions and the business they are acquiring,\" but they will do so only where \"the facts are abundantly clear as to why [ ] reliance was unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Glob.Minerals &amp; Metals Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726490\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/35/93/\">\n    824 N.Y.S.2d at 215-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, in all of the cases Defendants rely on, courts were able to identify basic types of due diligence that the relying party should have conducted to prevent its injury but concededly did not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726490\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/35/93/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726490\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/35/93/\">\n    at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"At a minimum, [plaintiff] should have contacted [parties with more information].

(CS Brief at 21; ML Brief at 32.) This argument is insufficient to warrant summary judgment for three distinct reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, in contrast to cases in which a party's reliance was unreasonable as a matter of law, the record now before the Court does not contain \"facts [that] are abundantly clear as to why [Silvercreek's] reliance was unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Glob.Minerals &amp; Metals Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726490\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/35/93/\">\n    824 N.Y.S.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, Plaintiffs here have produced facts sufficient to support a conclusion that they did reasonably inquire into the truth of Enron's statements. As the Court has already explored, Silvercreek consulted a host of different sources in the months leading up to its October 2001 investments, including not only Enron's own financial statements but also the assessments of a number of third-party experts.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1.a. The Defendants may dispute whether Plaintiffs' inquiry was sufficient given the mixed news about Enron issuing at the time of the investment. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 256-60.) But given the evidence that Plaintiffs did conduct some inquiry into Enron's financials, and that their inquiry revealed dozens of similarly positive assessments of Enron's securities repeatedly issuing from credit agencies, brokers, and analysts during the relevant period (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 268-86)-some of which came from the very Defendants now moving for summary judgment on the question of Plaintiffs' reasonable reliance (Dkt. No. 168-45; Dkt. No. 193-10)-the Court cannot now say that Plaintiffs' reliance on Enron's representations regarding its financial status in October 2001 was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, Defendants cannot identify with specificity any type of further inquiry Plaintiffs could have conducted that would not have been stonewalled by Enron's\n   fraud itself. Indeed, Defendants appear to concede that they could not possibly do so, because each acknowledges that Enron's fraud was premised on Enron's ability to conceal the true state of its financials, such that it was knowable only to a select few insiders. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CS Brief at 36 (\"The undisputed evidence thus shows that Credit Suisse took reasonable steps to obtain information about Enron's debt but was stonewalled by Enron.\"); DB Brief at 4 (\"[T]he Enron accounting fraud was premised on secrecy, agreements among key Enron insiders, and transactions that were not public transactions[.]\"); ML Brief at 6 (\"Enron's operations were known to be complex, opaque, and 'impenetrable.' [Enron's former CFO] acknowledged that Enron's true financial condition would not have been apparent to anyone based on its certified financial statements through 2001.\" (footnote omitted) ).) The Court does not fault Defendants for arguing in the alternative, but simply recognizes that the question of what should have been discoverable based on publicly available information about Enron in October 2001 is an extremely fact-dependent inquiry subject to the oft-conflicting assessments of numerous experts, witnesses, and the parties. As such, it is a question on which summary judgment would be improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Third, and finally, the case law on reasonable reliance makes clear that when trading securities on an open market based on representations in registration statements or from underwriters and credit agencies, even \"sophisticated plaintiffs are not required to 'conduct their own audit' in order to rely on a defendant's allegedly fraudulent representations.\"\n   <em>\n    Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg v.

A similar conclusion is appropriate here, particularly because Plaintiffs' inquiry went beyond blind reliance on Enron's annual and quarterly statements but also incorporated credit agency and analyst assessments of Enron's viability.

Here, in crediting as true the testimony of Plaintiffs' witnesses as to their investment strategy and assessment of Enron's financial stability during the key period of October 18, 2001, through October 26, 2001, the Court cannot now hold that no reasonable jury could find in Plaintiffs' favor, even under the clear and convincing standard.

Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785302\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/846/828/#p871\">\n    846 F.Supp.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (S.D. Ohio 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Credit Suisse employee testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Perhaps most damning to Credit Suisse's motion are the numerous statements and emails in which various Credit Suisse employees appear to explicitly acknowledge their awareness of Enron's fraud. As a lens through which to analyze Credit Suisse's different types of rebuttals and challenges to this category of evidence, the Court begins its analysis by focusing on the statements of one particular Credit Suisse employee, Robert Jeffe, who described in strikingly clear terms his understanding of the fraudulent nature of one of the transactions between Enron and LJM1, an SPE wholly controlled by Enron's CFO:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [T]he idea of somebody selling something to themselves representing both sides was something I had never seen.... There were reservations amongst some of the members of the [Credit Suisse] team regarding the kind of compensation that [Enron's CFO] would receive by completing this transaction.... [I]t struck me as a lot of money, number one, but, number two, the Enron people were paying themselves a lot of money. And the part of it that troubled me the most was ... conflict issues. And it was astonishing that the board of directors, that [Enron's law firm and accounting firm] all had, quote, unquote, signed off on this transaction. It was also troubling from the standpoint of [Enron's CFO] personally wanting to do the transaction. Because I think we all told him at various times that at some point this transaction would come to light and he would look very, very bad.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Dkt. No. 169-23 at 26-27.) This same employee also described Enron's CFO's behavior more generally as crossing \"lines of proper behavior in terms of the way you comport yourself, and this was something\n   that I never ever would consider doing myself even if I had approval from the President of the United States or the U.S. Supreme Court.\" (Dkt. No. 169-23 at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Credit Suisse addresses this portion of Jeffe's testimony in its reply Local Rule 56.1 Statement, arguing that this testimony is most fairly construed as reflecting Jeffe's initial concerns about the LJM1 deals, concerns that were addressed by the eventual auditing and third-party vetting of those deals. (CSSUF \u00b6 763.) Credit Suisse's construction of this testimony appears to run up directly against the actual content of Jeffe's testimony, which reflects that he already knew and was \"astonish[ed]\" by the fact that Enron's law firm and accounting firm \"all had, quote, unquote, signed off on this transaction.\" (Dkt. No. 169-23 at 27.) But regardless of the merits of Credit Suisse's interpretation of Jeffe's testimony, consideration of Credit Suisse's alternative interpretation properly belongs to a jury. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as the Court must view it, Jeffe's testimony evinces Jeffe's understanding of the wrongdoing inherent in LJM1 transacting with Enron.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further undermining Credit Suisse's alternative construction of Jeffe's testimony are Jeffe's emails and subsequent testimony, in which he acknowledged his awareness of Enron's failure to disclose billions of dollars of off-balance sheet debt. These later statements stemmed from an August 2001 meeting between Jeffe and Enron's then-CFO Andrew Fastow. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 506-17.) Jeffe testified that he had been under the assumption that Enron had in the range of sixteen or seventeen billion dollars of total debt, but Fastow revealed to him at that meeting that Enron actually had thirty-six billion dollars of debt. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 506-07.) Jeffe testified that he found this number difficult to process, and he referred it to his colleagues at Credit Suisse. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 508-12.) Jeffe's colleagues at Credit Suisse then tried to follow up with Enron for more information about this figure, but Enron rebuffed Credit Suisse's inquiries. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 509, 516-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As Credit Suisse would have it, Jeffe's testimony about the August 2001 meeting demonstrates that Credit Suisse's knowledge of Enron's fraud was limited because Enron's actual off-balance sheet debt far exceeded Jeffe's initial understanding. (CS Brief at 36.) Credit Suisse also argues that this testimony further buttresses its claims that Credit Suisse was kept in the dark by Enron as to the true extent of its debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But the Court cannot adopt Credit Suisse's interpretation of this testimony at this stage. Rather, the Court must read the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. Viewed in this manner, Jeffe's testimony reveals that a Credit Suisse employee entered a meeting with Enron in August 2001 already knowing that Enron had billions of dollars of unreported debt, which by itself would support a finding of actual knowledge of Enron's fraudulent accounting practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Century\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785302\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/846/828/#p871\">\n    846 F.Supp.2d at 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Credit Suisse may not have known all of the intricacies ... but substantial evidence exists to support a conclusion that Credit Suisse had sufficient knowledge to appreciate that [Enron's] representations to investors [regarding its volume of debt] were untrue.\"). That Jeffe then learned that he was correct in assuming that Enron had billions of dollars of concealed debt, but that Enron's concealed debt actually extended far beyond what he had previously surmised, does not undermine the relevance of this testimony to Plaintiffs' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Again, the Court has undertaken this careful exploration Jeffe's testimony, and Credit Suisse's attempts to rebut its persuasiveness,\n   only to highlight the legal insufficiency of Credit Suisse's arguments for purposes of a motion for summary judgment. The record in fact contains a plethora of similar statements from a number of Credit Suisse employees acknowledging their awareness of Enron's wrongdoing and the fraudulent nature of its financials. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 165 (\"PCS Brief\") at 14-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 169-33 (August 16, 2000 email from Credit Suisse banker saying he would \"need to go take a shower and go to confession soon\" prior to accepting Fastow's invitation to participate in future LJM transactions); Dkt. No. 150-19 (October 19, 2001 email to Credit Suisse banker who worked extensively with Enron reflecting \"every time I read about [E]nron's latest travails I think about your ominous warnings 2 years ago that the 'house of cards' may someday collapse.... [H]opefully, we're still making good money on that account anyway. [I]t seems like we are.\"); Dkt. No. 171-22 (October 22, 2001 email from Credit Suisse banker with subject \"I hope you listened to me on [Enron].......\" reflecting his understanding that \"these partnerships ... [are] all smoke [and] mirrors accounting\" but that Credit Suisse \"made a bundle\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As with Jeffe's testimony cited above, Credit Suisse also offers alternative explanations for the speaker's intended meaning for each of these statements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 796, 519-23, 1008.) The Court does not address any of these explanations, because they belong to a jury to evaluate. The Court holds only that these statements provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find that Credit Suisse had actual knowledge of Enron's fraud under the clear and convincing evidence standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. LJM1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs highlight a number of specific Enron deals and transactions on which Credit Suisse worked. Credit Suisse's extensive involvement with any number of these transactions could provide probative evidence of Credit Suisse's actual knowledge of and substantial assistance to Enron's fraud. The Court addresses one such set of deals in detail, and holds that Plaintiffs' evidence of Credit Suisse's involvement in these deals alone is sufficient to establish the actual knowledge and substantial assistance elements of Plaintiffs' aiding and abetting fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   LJM1 was a partnership and SPE formed and controlled by Enron's CFO Andrew Fastow. (CSSUF \u00b6 762.) Fastow formed this entity for the purpose of conducting deals with Enron designed to move certain volatile assets off of Enron's books. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 758-60.) Because Enron was essentially selling the assets to itself, Enron was able to obtain better prices for these assets than it would have been able to obtain on the open market. (CSSUF \u00b6 770.) Enron failed to properly account for sale of and income generated by these assets, primarily because Enron treated the sale as if it were to a third party and not to one of Enron's wholly controlled SPEs. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 767-68.) Enron's failure to properly account for its dealings with LJM1 played a substantial role in producing its misleading financials, as was highlighted by Enron when it announced its November 2001 write-downs. (Dkt. No. 169-18 at 5.) That November 2001 disclosure revealed that Enron's prior reporting of income from deals involving LJM1 inflated Enron's reported income in the years 1999 and 2000 by over one hundred million dollars. (CSSUF \u00b6 774; Dkt. No. 169-18 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Despite Jeffe's misgivings about Enron's proposed use of LJM1 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CSSUF \u00b6 763; Dkt. No. 169-23 at 26-27), Credit Suisse still ended up helping to form LJM1 and funded LJM1 as a limited partner\n   (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 379, 758-62). According to testimony from numerous other employees of both Enron and Credit Suisse, at the time Credit Suisse \"invested\" in LJM1, Enron had already told Credit Suisse that its investment was fully guaranteed and would be repaid at a premium (CSSUF \u00b6 376; Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Dkt. No. 169-21)-evincing Credit Suisse's knowledge that at the time it funded the deals it knew them to be sham transactions. This same testimony also reveals that Credit Suisse contributed to the design and structuring of the LJM1 partnership and certain of its deals with Enron (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 764-65; Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6 54), facts from which a jury could reasonably infer Credit Suisse's actual knowledge of Enron's fraudulent purpose and use of this entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Credit Suisse disputes whether its role in the LJM1 deals was itself problematic, and instead urges that it was only Enron's misreporting of deals with LJM1 that was fraudulent. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CSSUF \u00b6 768.) Credit Suisse emphasizes that the LJM1 deals were all vetted by third parties and publicly disclosed to the SEC, and that therefore Plaintiffs cannot rely on Credit Suisse's role in these deals to support its aiding-and-abetting-fraud claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CS Reply at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This argument fails for two reasons. First, the evidence of outside approval of Enron's LJM1 transactions does not definitively establish that Credit Suisse lacked actual knowledge of Enron's fraudulent purpose in pursuing the deals. As Jeffe's own testimony reveals, insiders at Credit Suisse characterized these approvals as \"astonishing,\" and they found these deals problematic despite evidence that outsiders \"all had, quote, unquote, signed off on this transaction.\" (Dkt. No. 169-23 at 27.) Moreover, Plaintiffs have also produced evidence showing that Credit Suisse knew that Enron would game the system to obtain such third-party approval, because Credit Suisse itself helped to restructure other Enron deals in order to obtain such third-party approval from auditors and law firms. For example, Enron's former CFO testified that he recalled Credit Suisse pitching specific methods it had devised to obtain auditor and law firm approval for deals designed to inflate Enron's reported income. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 216-11 at 1803-05.) Indeed, when Credit Suisse presented these deal structures it described them as proprietary to Credit Suisse, demanding that Enron sign nondisclosure agreements prior to its pitches. (Dkt. No. 216-11 at 1805.) This evidence provides a basis from which a jury could infer Credit Suisse's awareness that Enron would use flawed outside vetting of its deals in order to further its fraud, and it supplements Plaintiffs' otherwise strong showing of Credit Suisse's employees' knowledge of Enron's fraudulent use of LJM1. Credit Suisse's evidence of outside auditing of the LJM1 deals thus at most produces a genuine dispute of fact insufficient to warrant summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, even accepting as true Credit Suisse's arguments that Enron's LJM1 deals were properly vetted but only later misreported by Enron subsequent to Credit Suisse's involvement, Credit Suisse's assistance to Enron in initially completing those deals is still sufficient to support Plaintiffs' claims. A party's contribution to \"atypical financing transactions\" where that party \"devised the marketing and financing scheme\" may provide a circumstantial basis for inferring actual knowledge and substantial assistance when that scheme is subsequently put to fraudulent use by a primary tortfeasor, regardless of whether that party's role itself involved wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gas Reclamation, Inc. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3909132\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/659/493/#p504\">\n    659 F.Supp. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 504 (S.D.N.Y. 1987). As the MDL Court\n   explained, \"[s]ubstantial assistance can take many forms. Helping to mak[e] it possible for [a primary fraudster] to claim that the [performance] reports were based on objective valuations is one.... Executing transactions, even ordinary course transactions, can [thus] constitute substantial assistance under some circumstances[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Enron Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696573\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/511/742/#p806\">\n    511 F.Supp.2d at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The MDL Court emphasized that one such circumstance is where the aider and abettor had \"extraordinary economic motivation to aid in the fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696573\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/511/742/#p806\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' evidence that Credit Suisse was guaranteed exorbitant returns on its LJM1 investment prior to funding the partnership satisfies that condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 169-21 (listing income Credit Suisse would be guaranteed in return for its participation in LJM1) ); (Dkt. No. 169-33 (Credit Suisse employee describing Fastow's guaranteed returns to Credit Suisse as a \"quid associated with this pro quo\" of continued Credit Suisse funding for new LJM enterprises).) Viewing these returns in conjunction with Credit Suisse employees' admitted awareness of problems with LJM1's dealings and Credit Suisse's own role in devising LJM1's deals, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' evidence of Credit Suisse's involvement in LJM1 is sufficient to satisfy their burden of producing sufficient evidence of a genuine factual dispute as to actual knowledge and substantial assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Enron CFO Andrew Fastow's testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, the Court examines statements from Enron's former CFO Andrew Fastow regarding Credit Suisse's involvement with Enron's fraudulent scheme. Fastow's statements regarding his recollection of Credit Suisse's role in devising, financing, and executing that scheme are highly probative of Credit Suisse's actual knowledge and substantial assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Before reviewing Fastow's testimony, the Court first addresses Credit Suisse's arguments that Enron CFO Andrew Fastow's testimony regarding its involvement is inadmissible for lack of foundation. (CS Brief at 27-28.) For purposes of this motion, the Court assumes that Credit Suisse is correct that Fastow's testimony regarding what Credit Suisse actually knew would likely be inadmissible at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 602. Thus, the Court does not consider any of those portions of Fastow's testimony. But it would be preposterous to conclude that Fastow, Enron's CFO and the primary architect of its financial fraud, lacks foundation to testify about how that very fraud unfolded. Fastow's personal experiences provide foundation for his recollection of interactions with Credit Suisse employees and of specific deals on which he worked with Credit Suisse. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) Moreover, Fastow's recollection of specific statements by Credit Suisse personnel may be highly indicative of the company's actual knowledge, and are at the very least relevant circumstantial evidence from which a jury could infer actual knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Credit Suisse also argues that the credibility of Fastow's testimony is colored by the context in which it was given: Fastow's incarceration for his role in Enron's fraud and his extensive cooperation with lead plaintiffs' counsel during the MDL proceedings. (CS Brief at 27-28.) Fastow's cooperation with similar plaintiffs may persuasively cast doubt on his credibility, but it does not undermine the relevance and admissibility of his testimony. Similarly, Credit Suisse's citations to inconsistent portions of Fastow's testimony or to statements describing how he hid the extent of Enron's fraud from Credit Suisse may undercut the probative value of his testimony\n   or impeach his credibility. But evaluating Fastow's credibility or the probative value of his testimony is a task for the jury. For purposes of this motion, the Court is required to credit Fastow's detailed account of his cooperation with Credit Suisse as true and view this testimony in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Doing so here reveals additional evidence that might support a finding of actual knowledge and substantial assistance as to Credit Suisse. Fastow described Credit Suisse as one of Enron's \"Tier-1 Banks,\" and he specifically highlighted Credit Suisse as among the banks he \"told ... of our financial objectives and they, in many instances, created solutions.\" (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, 47.) Fastow related that he paid banks like Credit Suisse \"a premium ... in order to engage in structured-finance transactions that contributed to causing Enron to report its financial statements in a desired manner.\" (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6 8.) Fastow testified to having told Credit Suisse that Enron would retain control of certain assets sold to its SPEs, including LJM1, and that because those assets were never truly sold to third parties he could guarantee the banks certain returns on their investments. (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 12-13.) Finally, Fastow described how Credit Suisse would help Enron design transactions or participate in presentations with the goal of helping Enron obtain credit approval from rating agencies. (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 48; Dkt. No. 216-11 at 1804-05.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Fastow's testimony regarding his recollection of Credit Suisse's role in Enron's fraudulently reported transactions is highly probative, particularly when viewed in conjunction with Credit Suisse's own statements evincing its awareness of its role in that fraud and the record of its involvement in specific transactions such as LJM1. Given all of this evidence, the Court concludes that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Credit Suisse had knowledge of and substantially contributed to Enron's fraud. Accordingly, Credit Suisse's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' aiding-and-abetting-fraud claim against Credit Suisse is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Deutsche Bank\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs have marshaled a similarly substantial body of evidence supporting Deutsche Bank's actual knowledge of and substantial assistance with Enron's fraud. The Court does not detail Deutsche Bank's challenges to the credibility, weight, or sufficiency of each individual piece of evidence, both because these challenges are largely duplicative of Credit Suisse's and because it is not the Court's task in evaluating this motion to consider them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As with Credit Suisse, Plaintiffs have produced statements from Deutsche Bank employees evincing their knowledge of Enron's fraud. For example, on October 23, 2001, as Enron's stock was collapsing, a Deutsche Bank employee, Seth Rubin, emailed his colleague about a prior deal with Enron known as \"Marlin\" to ask \"do I ... torch the [M]arlin files?\" (Dkt. No. 198-9.) When his colleague responded \"what [M]arlin files? [N]ot sure I'm familiar with that deal,\" the employee responded \"exactly ... don't know about [F]irefly, [R]awhide o[r] [O]sprey either,\" referring to three other Enron deals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another Rubin email from that same day evinced his knowledge of \"something funky ... in those [Enron] books.\" (Dkt. No. 202-7.) In a later email, a colleague told Rubin that he was implicated in the developing SEC inquiry \"for aiding and abetting Enron in doing these types of deals.\" (DBSUF \u00b6 672.) Deutsche Bank's reply Local Rule 56.1 statement introduces testimony from Rubin characterizing these statements as\n   jokes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 669-72.) Silvercreek is entitled to have a jury hear Rubin testify about these statements and evaluate his credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As with Credit Suisse, Plaintiffs have also produced evidence detailing Deutsche Bank's involvement in specific deals that Enron used to produce a misleading picture of its financials. The evidence of Deutsche Bank's role in designing and implementing the Marlin and Osprey transactions referenced in Rubin's email is alone sufficient to meet Plaintiffs' burden on both the actual knowledge and substantial assistance elements of its claim for aiding and abetting fraud. Testimony from Deutsche Bank employees supports a finding that Deutsche Bank helped designed these transactions knowing that Enron's purpose was to hide billions of dollars of debt. (DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 651-53, 662-63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 191-18 at 74-77.) With respect to the Marlin transaction, Deutsche Bank employees revealed in correspondences amongst themselves their understanding that that their task for Enron was \"to keep it below the radar of the rating agencies and to ensure that any financing will not effect [sic] the rating of Enron [C]orp.\" (Dkt. No. 202-12.) Deutsche Bank processed these transactions knowing that Enron's goal was to get this debt off its own balance sheet and onto Marlin's, despite Enron's in effect retaining the debt in the form of a pledge of its own stock to Marlin investors in the event Marlin's assets declined in value. (DBSUF \u00b6 654; Dkt. No. 191-18 at 78-80, 84.) Deutsche Bank helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars in outside investments for Marlin, and it received fees from Enron in the tens of millions for doing so. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 658-59.) Deutsche Bank's role in the Osprey transactions was similar in terms of the extent of its participation as well as in its purpose and scale. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DBSUF \u00b6 663.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Much like Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank argues that the Marlin and Osprey deals cannot support Plaintiffs' claims against Deutsche Bank because these deals were publicly disclosed and independently vetted. (DB Brief at 8-9.) But again, Plaintiffs have also produce evidenced showing that Deutsche Bank knew that Enron would work to restructure certain deals in order to obtain third-party approval. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DBSUF \u00b6\u00b6 575-76, 632-34.) Indeed, at times Deutsche Bank itself helped Enron do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Deutsche Bank's evidence that external entities reviewed and approved the Marlin and Osprey deals at best creates only a genuine dispute of fact as to what exactly Deutsche Bank knew when it assisted Enron. Similarly, Deutsche Bank's argument that there \"is no evidence that Deutsche Bank was-or could have been-aware of Enron's\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   misuse of these transaction structures\" (DB Brief at 2 (emphasis in original) ), runs directly into testimony from Deutsche Bank's own employees that they were aware of Enron's intended use of those structures at the time they orchestrated the deals (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 191-18 at 83-84; Dkt. No. 202-12). Thus, this evidence also does nothing more than establish a genuine dispute of fact as to what Deutsche Bank actually knew when it assisted Enron with the Marlin and Osprey transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Deutsche Bank also argues that even if it provided substantial assistance to Enron's fraud, Silvercreek proximately caused its own injury when it failed to independently inquire into Enron's financials prior to investing. (DB Brief at 25.) But for reasons already discussed, there exists a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Silvercreek's reliance on Enron's financial statements in October 2001 was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1.b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   It is well settled that \"[p]roximate cause, and the determination of whether an intervening act will serve to cut off liability, necessitates a fact-intensive analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sept. 11 Prop. Damage &amp; Bus. Loss Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772859\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/468/508/#p519\">\n    468 F.Supp.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). To the extent a jury finds that Silvercreek's reliance was in fact reasonable, Deutsche Bank could be liable for proximately causing Silvercreek's injury through any knowing and substantial contribution to transactions that produced the misleading financials on which Silvercreek relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, as discussed above, Andrew Fastow's testimony is highly probative in assessing the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' evidence in support of their claim against Deutsche Bank for aiding and abetting fraud. Fastow described Deutsche Bank as one of Enron's Tier-1 banks with which he worked directly and extensively. (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6 3.) Fastow averred to having told a Deutsche Bank employee that Enron's financials were inaccurate, and that this same employee worked on a number of transactions that helped produce those inaccuracies. (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6 58;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 191-18 at 74-79 (testimony from the same Deutsche Bank employee about Marlin).) At the very least, Fastow's testimony, if believed, would confirm the veracity of the many statements from Deutsche Bank's own employees admitting their involvement in and understanding of the purpose behind transactions they facilitated on behalf of Enron. Viewing all of this evidence together, the Court concludes that the record before it provides a sufficient basis for a jury to find in Plaintiffs' favor on the actual knowledge and substantial assistance prongs of their aiding-and-abetting-fraud claims against Deutsche Bank. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank's motion for summary judgment on that claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Merrill Lynch\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs' evidence with respect to Merrill Lynch's involvement with and knowledge of Enron's fraud differs in certain respects from the evidence as to Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. The record is devoid of blunt statements from Merrill Lynch employees regarding the need to \"torch [Enron] files\" or describing Enron as a \"house of cards.\" (Dkt. No. 198-9; Dkt. No. 150-19.) And as the Court explores below, the clearest statements from Merrill Lynch employees directly evincing understanding of Enron's fraudulent purposes involved deals whose effects had been erased from Enron's books by 2000, over a year before Plaintiffs' relevant investments. Still, the Court is mindful that generally \"[p]articipants in a fraud do not affirmatively declare to the world that they are engaged in the perpetration of a fraud,\" and for that reason a jury may divine an \"intent to commit fraud ... from surrounding circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Oster\n   </em>\n   , 905 N.Y.S.2d at 72. And here, it must view statements evincing Merrill Lynch's understanding of the fraudulent nature of its 1999 deals with Enron alongside the firm's continued leadership role in subsequent deals. Accordingly, even under the clear and convincing standard, the Court cannot say that there is insufficient evidence in the record as a matter of law for a jury to find that Merrill Lynch knowingly and substantially assisted Enron's fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court begins with an examination of the two specific deals for which the record does contain statements demonstrating Merrill Lynch's understanding of Enron's fraudulent purpose. These two deals, known as the Barges and Electricity Trades transactions, were designed to help Enron meet its 1999 revenue targets by temporarily selling assets to Merrill Lynch that Enron was otherwise unable to move before the close of the year. (MLSUF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 385, 388-91, 454-56.) The understanding between the parties was that Merrill Lynch would purchase these assets from Enron before the close of the year, thereby generating reportable income for Enron, under the condition that Enron promised to have an SPE repurchase those same assets or to \"unwind\" the transaction after the close of the year at a significant profit for Merrill Lynch. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 391-93, 463-65.) These deals helped Enron report upwards of sixty million dollars of additional income in 1999. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ML Brief at 11; MLSUF \u00b6 461.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The record demonstrates that Merrill Lynch employees understood the fraudulent nature of the Barges and Electricity Trades transactions. In internal meeting notes and memoranda, Merrill Lynch employees described these deals as \"income statement manipulation.\" (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 399, 404, 432.) The employees understood that they would be unable to obtain written confirmation of Enron's promise to repurchase the assets in 2000 because it would defeat Enron's purpose of doing the deals, namely \"their accounting treatment.\" (MLSUF \u00b6 417.) Merrill Lynch employees described themselves as \"doing a favor\" for Enron and participating only because Merrill Lynch was \"trying to improve business relations with Enron.\" (MLSUF \u00b6 411.) They participated despite recognizing the \"reputational risk\" associated with their \"aid[ing]/abet[ting] Enron's financial statement manipulation.\" (MLSUF \u00b6 405.) Merrill Lynch eventually entered into a settlement with the SEC in connection with these deals, repaying all of its $37.5 million in fees as disgorgement (plus interest) and paying an equal amount in civil penalties. (Dkt. No. 180 \u00b6 85.) As part of the terms of the settlement, Merrill Lynch agreed to accept responsibility for its employees' criminal conduct in connection with these deals and to make assertions contradicting its responsibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   After Enron repurchased the Nigerian Barge assets back from Merrill Lynch in 2000, it was able to resell them at a profit that same year, thereby erasing any effects of those deals from Enron's financial statements. (Dkt. No. 180 \u00b6\u00b6 83-84; MLSUF \u00b6 450.) The Electricity Trades were also unwound shortly after Enron had obtained its sought-after reportable 1999 income. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 520, 522.) Merrill Lynch argues that because the effects of these fraudulent deals had been erased from Enron's books by the time Plaintiffs purchased the 7% Notes and Zero Notes in October 2001, their contributions to Enron's fraudulent scheme cannot possibly be construed as a proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries. (ML Brief at 19-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court does not reach this question, however, because Plaintiffs need not rely exclusively on these two transactions to support their secondary-liability claims against Merrill Lynch. Plaintiffs have also produced evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to infer Merrill Lynch's knowledge of and substantial assistance with Enron's fraudulent use of a separate SPE, the LJM2 partnership. Viewing this evidence alongside the evidence regarding the earlier fraudulent Barges and Electricity Trades transactions, the Court cannot take from the jury the question whether there is clear and convincing evidence of Merrill Lynch's actual knowledge of and substantial assistance with Enron's overall fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Like LJM1, LJM2 was a partnership wholly controlled by Enron insiders that Enron utilized to create the misleading appearance of high income and low debt. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 528-29.) Enron failed to properly account for these transactions because it treated LJM2's assets and debts as those of a separate and unconsolidated entity. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 525-26.) As a result of\n   the LJM2 deals, Enron was able to produce hundreds of millions of dollars of reportable but fictitious income and to hide similar amounts of debt, numbers that remained hidden within Enron's financials until the November 2001 write-downs. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 591, 606; Dkt. No. 169-18 at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Given the extent of Enron's misreporting of it deals with LJM2, Plaintiffs' claim against Merrill Lynch for aiding and abetting fraud could survive based exclusively on a showing that Merrill Lynch knowingly and substantially assisted Enron with its fraudulent use of LJM2. Plaintiffs have produced extensive evidence supporting such a finding. The Court begins with statements by Merrill Lynch employees showing their understanding of Enron's purpose in pursuing deals with LJM2. Internal Merrill Lynch memoranda circulated in response to Enron's invitation to become a founding investor in LJM2 explained that LJM2 would provide \"preferred access to a large amount of proprietary deal flow created by Enron\" that \"otherwise would not be available to outside investors\" given LJM2's ability \"to evaluate investments with 'full' knowledge of the assets\" to be traded. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 530-31.) A Merrill Lynch employee described LJM2's dealings as \"a bunch of balance sheet deals similar to [Enron's] barge deal.\" (MLSUF \u00b6 532 (quoting Dkt. No. 203-14).) Merrill Lynch's arguments that it did not understand Enron's purpose in pursuing the LJM2 deals lose credibility in light of the evidence that its own employees compared the LJM2 deals to the Barge deals for which Merrill Lynch has conceded wrongdoing. (Dkt. No. 180 \u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   There is also circumstantial evidence of Merrill Lynch's actual knowledge and substantial assistance in the form of Merrill Lynch's extensive role in forming and marketing LJM2 and the fees it obtained for doing so. Merrill Lynch concedes that it set up LJM2 and served as its exclusive private placement agent. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 533-34.) Indeed, Merrill Lynch designed the presentation used by Fastow to market LJM2 to potential investors. (MLSUF \u00b6 539.) These marketing materials clearly reflected LJM2's value-add came from its ability to deal directly with Enron and thereby help Enron \"[m]anage its balance sheet\" and income statements. (MLSUF \u00b6 541.) Similar statements reflecting the way in which LJM2 would operate can be found throughout LJM2's marketing materials. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 542-46.) The close involvement between Merrill Lynch and Enron's insiders in devising LJM2, and statements in LJM2's marketing materials foreshadowing the way in which it would be used to help Enron report favorable financial results, both belie Merrill Lynch's contentions that it lacked actual knowledge of Enron's intended fraudulent use of LJM2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   With respect to Merrill Lynch's fees, Plaintiffs might rely on testimony from Fastow, who avers that he directly told Merrill Lynch his intended purpose in conducting deals between LJM2 and Enron, and explained that doing so allowed him to guarantee Merrill Lynch certain returns on its investments. (Dkt. No. 181-2 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 41-42.) Finally, Plaintiffs can present to the jury internal memoranda showing that Merrill Lynch invested in LJM2 transactions expecting rates of return upwards of 75%. (MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 602, 605-06.) Merrill Lynch's \"clear opportunity and a strong financial motive\" provide a further legally sufficient basis for inferring its actual knowledge of the fraudulent purpose behind Enron's use of LJM2.\n   <em>\n    Wight v. BankAmerica Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191112,11205764\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/219/79/\">\n    219 F.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92 (2d.

The record here demonstrates that Plaintiffs used half a dozen different brokers to process their purchases of the Enron notes. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 119, 128). The record also shows specific brokers and firms with whom Plaintiffs discussed the Enron notes and on whom they relied. (Dkt. No. 142-48 at 391-93.)

But Plaintiffs identify only one such report that they claim Merrill Lynch sent directly to Plaintiffs and on which they claim to have relied: an October 9, 2001 analyst report about the Zero Notes generically addressed to \"fixed income buyers,\" which nowhere identifies Silvercreek as a specifically intended recipient.

According to Silvercreek, it directly received and relied on only one analyst report from Merrill Lynch in which the bank negligently misrepresented the value of the Enron notes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PML Brief at 38, 40 (citing\n   MLSUF \u00b6\u00b6 161-65, 245);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193-10.) And that generic report did not specifically target Silvercreek. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193-10.) Given the \"absence of indications that [this] report was prepared for ... the benefit of\" Silvercreek, and Plaintiffs' failure to identify \"any direct communication between the parties that could supply the otherwise absent linking conduct\" between Merrill Lynch and Silvercreek, Plaintiffs \"may not recover on a claim for negligent misrepresentation based on alleged misstatements contained in that [ ] report.\"\n   <em>\n    In re JWP Inc.

If, for example, plaintiffs showed that they had reached out to a bank to request insight into the value of a security prior to receiving an analyst report, or the bank specifically and regularly singled out plaintiffs for the receipt of such reports, the result might be different. Either of these hypothetical showings would demonstrate at least \"\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   conduct by the [bank] linking it to the relying party and evincing the [bank]'s understanding of their reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Houlihan/Lawrence, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"371346\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/228/560/\">\n    644 N.Y.S.2d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   But Plaintiffs have made no such showing here. The October 9, 2001 analyst report is the only communication between Plaintiffs and Merrill Lynch regarding Enron identified in the record. Plaintiffs provide no evidence to support the conclusions that (a) Merrill Lynch directed that report to Silvercreek\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   , so that Silvercreek in particular would rely on it, or (b) that the nature and caliber of their relationship were such that someone at Merrill Lynch would have foreseen Silvercreek's particular reliance on those generically addressed representations. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch is entitled to summary judgment on the special relationship element of Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Credit Suisse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   A different result is warranted with respect to Credit Suisse. Because the record contains evidence that Credit Suisse directly solicited Plaintiffs' Enron investments and acted as Plaintiffs' broker for their purchase of the Enron notes, a jury could reasonably conclude that Credit Suisse and Plaintiffs had a special relationship for purposes of Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Perhaps most significantly, Credit Suisse acted as a broker for Plaintiffs on specific deals involving both the 7% Notes and Zero Notes. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 119, 128.) The Second Circuit has explained that a broker's duty to its customers may be analyzed on a \"transaction-by-transaction basis, [and once triggered] the broker owes duties of diligence and competence in executing the client's trade orders, and is obliged to give honest and complete information when recommending a purchase or sale.\"\n   <em>\n    de Kwiatkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11442099\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1293/#p1310\">\n    306 F.3d at 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the fact that Credit Suisse was acting as Plaintiffs' broker for their investments in the Enron notes, it would be far from unreasonable for a jury to conclude that Credit Suisse also knew that the information about those investments it was \"providing Silvercreek ... would be used by Silvercreek in making its investment decisions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274394\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/428/#p434\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Plaintiffs have also produced evidence showing that Credit Suisse directly solicited Plaintiffs' initial purchases of the Enron Zero Notes. Specifically, there is evidence that Plaintiffs' contact at Credit Suisse, Sara Randell-with whom Plaintiffs had worked for more than two years and corresponded regularly-called Plaintiffs to recommend the Zero Notes, explaining that the notes offered \"a good yield for a good credit.\" (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 108, 681.) According to Louise Morwick, Silvercreek's portfolio manager and President (CSSUF \u00b6 8-9), it was this call from Credit Suisse that prompted Plaintiffs' decision to invest in the Zeros (CSSUF \u00b6 681). Plaintiffs began purchasing the Zeros later that same day, with Credit Suisse acting as broker. (CSSUF \u00b6 119.) In fact, Randell herself was the Credit Suisse broker who processed Plaintiffs' transactions. (CSSUF \u00b6 222.) This sequence of events provides a strong basis from which a jury could infer \"an awareness that the information [Randell] provided [would] be relied upon for a particular purpose by [Plaintiffs] in furtherance of that purpose, and some conduct by [Randell] linking [her] to [Plaintiffs] and evincing [her] understanding of [their] reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274394\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/428/#p434\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 453-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Houlihan/Lawrence, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"371346\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/228/560/\">\n    644 N.Y.S.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   554 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   A number of other courts have denied summary judgment on the special relationship element of a negligent misrepresentation claim where a plaintiff produces evidence that a defendant both directly solicited and then subsequently processed a specific deal on a plaintiff's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20837536\">\n    2013 WL 837536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (denying summary judgment where defendant \"acted as more than a mere agent\" but rather \"affirmatively solicited [plaintiffs'] investment, made numerous in-person, email and telephone communications over significant periods of time, provided individualized memoranda and, in some cases made additional overtures\");\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

If credited as true, Plaintiffs' account of Credit Suisse's direct solicitation and its subsequent role as Plaintiffs' broker for the Enron investments supports the conclusion that Credit Suisse had an \"awareness that the information [it] provided [would] be relied upon for a particular purpose by [Silvercreek].\"\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274394\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/428/#p434\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 453-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Houlihan/Lawrence, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"371346\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/228/560/\">\n    644 N.Y.S.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   554 ). Accordingly, because there is a genuine dispute of fact as to the nature of the parties' communications and business relationship, Credit Suisse's motion for summary judgment on the special relationship factor of Silvercreek's negligent misrepresentation claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Credit Suisse also moves for summary judgment on the question whether Silvercreek reasonably relied on the misrepresentations made by Randell in recommending the Enron notes. (CS Brief at 9-11.) All of Credit Suisse's challenges to Plaintiffs' evidence of its actual and reasonable reliance, however, go to the weight of the evidence rather than to its sufficiency as a matter of law. Accordingly, Credit Suisse is not entitled to summary judgment on the reliance element of Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Actual reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Silvercreek's portfolio manager and President, Louise Morwick, testified that it was a phone call from Credit Suisse broker Randell that led her to purchase the Enron Zero Notes. (CSSUF \u00b6 681;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 142-48 at 392, 457-58.) Morwick said she could recall specific conversations with Randell in which Randell represented that Enron had \"good credit\" and that its securities offered \"an attractive yield upon a good credit.\" (Dkt. No. 142-48 at 457-58;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 390-93.) She further represented that she continued to speak with Randell by phone daily throughout October 2001, and that Randell was among the brokers who during that period repeatedly told her they \"viewed [Enron] as a strong, successful business.\" (CSSUF \u00b6 686.) Silvercreek has also emphasized the importance of this continued stream of positive broker reports in the information it relied on when developing investment strategy and assessing Enron's financial viability, especially given the negative news surrounding the company. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 704-06.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   This evidence is enough to defeat summary judgment on the question of actual reliance. Credit Suisse questions whether Silvercreek's description of its decision-making process and its deponents' recollections of their conversations with Credit Suisse are accurate, complete or believable. (CS Brief at 9-10.) But it is well established that the \"weighing of the evidence, [ ] drawing of inferences ..., and [ ] assessments of [a party's] credibility[are] matters that [are] not within the province of the court on a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischl v.

Silvercreek's consistent description of its own investment strategy-primarily based on statements by the individual who purchased the relevant Enron securities directly from Credit Suisse-provides a sufficient basis for a jury to conclude that Silvercreek actually relied on Credit Suisse's positive assessments of Enron's financial stability. Though Credit Suisse's arguments as to the persuasiveness of Silvercreek's evidence may prove effective at trial, choosing between Silvercreek's account of its investment decisions and Credit Suisse's contrary assessment is not the province of this Court on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Reasonable Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Credit Suisse also moves for summary judgment on whether Silvercreek's\n   reliance on Randell's assessments was reasonable. (CS Brief at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Credit Suisse first argues that Randell's recommendation of the Enron notes was only a statement of opinion, \"mere puffery,\" or a speculative assessment about future events, such that reliance on it was unreasonable as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But the cases cited by Credit Suisse in which courts dismissed negligent misrepresentation claims based on \"puffery\" either do not describe the content of the \"puffery\" such that it can be compared to the statements here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheth v.

When representing to Plaintiffs the likelihood of their obtaining a high yield from the Enron notes, Randell also represented to Plaintiffs that Enron was a \"strong company\" and that its notes rested on a \"good credit.\" (Dkt. No. 142-48 at 392, 457-58.) And under the case law of this Circuit, offering \"misrepresentations of existing facts\"-such as stating that a situation was \"in good shape\" or \"under control\" while they allegedly knew that the contrary was true-is actionable.\n   <em>\n    Novak v. Kasaks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209912\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/300/#p315\">\n    216 F.3d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (2d Cir. 2000). Though the concept of creditworthiness necessarily involves some forward-looking assessment of a company's future performance, the status of Enron's creditworthiness in October 2001 was a present fact. So too was its status as a \"strong company.\" If representing a business's present inventory as being \"in good shape\" can constitute an actionable misrepresentation of a present fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Novak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11209912\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/300/#p315\">\n    216 F.3d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so too can statements representing that a company has \"good credit\" or is a \"strong, successful business\" at a given moment (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 681, 686). Randell's alleged representations are thus not puffery or speculative opinion, and Silvercreek's reliance on them was not unreasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Finally, Credit Suisse contends that it would have been unreasonable for Silvercreek, a sophisticated entity, to rely exclusively on Randell's \"say-so\" in making this investment. (CS Brief at 11.) But Silvercreek disputes that it relied blindly on Randell's pitch, and instead avers that it reasonably took her assessment into account \"as part of the mix of information it considered\" before investing in Enron in October 2001. (CSSUF \u00b6\u00b6 704, 706; Dkt. No. 168-18 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \"In assessing the reasonableness of a plaintiff's alleged reliance, we consider the entire context of the transaction, including factors such as its complexity and magnitude, the sophistication of the parties, and the content of any agreements between them.\"\n   <em>\n    Emergent Capital Inv.

Here, the facts most relevant to assessing these factors are genuinely disputed by the parties. For example, as discussed above, the parties genuinely dispute whether Silvercreek appropriately took account of the worrisome news regarding Enron that was being issued in October 2001,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1, as well as the precise nature of the\n   business relationship between Credit Suisse and Silvercreek,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.D.1.b. Whether Silvercreek's reliance on Credit Suisse's assessment of Enron's financial stability was reasonable given Silvercreek's sophistication and the negative information swirling about Enron is quintessentially a question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Sole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196115\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/139/618/#p643\">\n    139 F.Supp.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under New York's contextual approach, the question of what constitutes reasonable reliance is always nettlesome because it is so fact-intensive. Reasonable reliance is therefore a question normally reserved for the finder of fact and not usually amenable to summary judgment.\" (brackets, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Accordingly, the Court denies Credit Suisse's motion for summary judgment on the reasonableness of Plaintiffs' reliance on Credit Suisse's representations. And for all of the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim against Credit Suisse survives summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

(TAC \u00b6\u00b6 879-91.) Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank move for summary judgment on these claims, arguing that Silvercreek has failed to produce facts sufficient to establish that either party was an \"underwriter\" for purposes of Section 11 liability.

But Deutsche Bank contends that its role in that initial Rule 144A private placement \"cannot render Deutsche Bank an underwriter for Section 11 purposes because this offering was independent from any registered public offering by Enron.\" (DB Brief at 31.) The Court agrees.

Accordingly, when denying Deutsche Bank's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Section 11 claims, the Court emphasized one of Plaintiffs' particular allegations in their complaint, namely that \"Deutsche Bank ... solicited, offered and sold the Zero Notes to the investing public pursuant to the registration statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274394\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/428/#p434\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs have failed to produce any evidence supporting their allegation that Deutsche Bank in fact sold the Zero Notes as part of the public offering. Though Plaintiffs' summary judgment brief describes \"Deutsche's prompt post-registration sale of Zeros\" (PDB Brief at 30 (citing DBSUF \u00b6 714) ), Plaintiffs have offered no evidence to support a finding that such a sale ever actually occurred. They cite only Deutsche Bank's\n   <em>\n    private placement\n   </em>\n   memorandum regarding the Rule 144A offering (Dkt.

(PDB Brief at 29-30.) Though exhaustive, this evidence generally only goes to further highlight Deutsche Bank's key role in the initial\n   <em>\n    private\n   </em>\n   placement, which, for reasons already addressed, has no bearing on its status as an underwriter for purposes of Section 11 liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Perhaps more importantly, none of this evidence can serve as a substitute for evidence of \"actual distribution,\" which is\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   essential element of underwriter status.\n   <em>\n    In re Lehman Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874771\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/167/#p181\">\n    650 F.3d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nothing in [the Securities Act's] text supports expanding the definition of underwriter to reach persons not themselves participating in such purchases, offers, or sales, but whose actions may facilitate the participation of others in such undertakings.\").

Accordingly, there is evidence that would allow a jury to reasonably find that Credit Suisse played an actual role \"in offering or selling securities for an issuer in connection with a [public] distribution.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lehman Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874771\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/167/#p181\">\n    650 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   182 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Livent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11078204\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/151/371/\">\n    151 F.Supp.2d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing Section 11 claims against Rule 144A distributors that \"were not directly involved in the preparation of the registration statement\n   or in the subsequent exchange\" but recognizing that sellers of\n   <em>\n    registered\n   </em>\n   notes \"may stand in a very different position from [Rule 144A participants] because [they] ... sold notes directly to\" plaintiffs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   With that established, the Court concludes that Credit Suisse's role in the public dissemination of the notes is sufficient to establish its status as an underwriter. For example, the Zero Notes' public registration statement indicated that Credit Suisse, as a reseller of the notes, \"may be deemed to be [an] 'underwriter[ ]' within the meaning of the Securities Act.\" (Dkt. No. 146-57 at 30.) And the Second Circuit has previously held such a statement alone to be sufficient to establish a party's status as an underwriter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Byrnes v. Faulkner, Dawkins &amp; Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"988837\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/550/1303/#p1311\">\n    550 F.2d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311-12 (2d Cir. 1977) (construing appellants as \"participants in the ... distribution and accordingly ... underwriters\" where they \"arranged to have their stock included in one of the ... registration statements and were identified as putative underwriters in the ... prospectus\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Plaintiffs point to a number of other important roles Credit Suisse played in the public distribution of the Zero Notes, including contributing to preparation of the registration statement and having access to Enron's internal books and records for purposes of conducting due diligence. (PCS Brief at 36; Dkt. No. 146-51 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In response to all of this evidence, Credit Suisse essentially repeats arguments that the Court already addressed and rejected at the motion to dismiss stage: that Credit Suisse's minor intermediary role bridging the initial private issuance of the Zero Notes with their ultimate public dissemination is insufficient to establish that it underwrote the Zero Notes offering. (CS Brief at 38-40.) As the Court explained at that time, evidence that Credit Suisse \"indirectly participated in the purchase of the Zero Notes from Enron with a view to the [public] distribution of the Notes ... is sufficient for underwriter status because it is 'essential in the actual distribution of securities.' \"\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274394\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/248/428/#p434\">\n    248 F.Supp.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Lehman Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874771\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/167/#p181\">\n    650 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   178 ). And as the Court addressed above, Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence making such a showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Credit Suisse also emphasizes the small number of Zero Notes it purchased prior to the public offering. (CS Brief at 39.) But it points to no case supporting a theory that a minimal role in the distribution of a security is insufficient to establish underwriter status as a matter of law. Such a theory would be at odds with the plain language of Section 11, which allows for liability against \"\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   underwriter,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a)(5) (emphasis added), as well as this District's precedents interpreting the scope underwriter status,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lybrand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433368\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/200/384/#p395\">\n    200 F.Supp.2d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress enacted a broad definition of underwriter status in order to include as underwriters\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   persons who might operate as conduits for securities being placed into the hands of the investing public.\" (emphasis added, internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ). The Court declines to adopt such a theory here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's Section 11 claim against Credit Suisse survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

(TAC \u00b6\u00b6 913-24.) To establish liability for aiding and abetting violations of Texas securities law under Article 581-33F(2) of the TSA, a plaintiff must show: \"(1) the existence of a primary violation of the securities laws, (2) that the aider has a general awareness of its role in the violation, (3) that the aider gave substantial assistance in the violation, and (4) that the aider intended to deceive the plaintiff or acted with reckless disregard for the truth of the representations made by the primary violator.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Enron Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9378747\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/235/549/#p568\">\n    235 F.Supp.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 (S.D.
