Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 at \u00b6 51; Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defs.' Mem.\") (Doc. No. 154) at 1.

As support for designating TMS as an experimental and investigational treatment, CPB 469 provided a \"background section\" that summarized and discussed various scientific studies on the effects of TMS on depression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At least once a year, Aetna's policy team updated CPB 469 to reflect new research on TMS' effectiveness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' L.R. 56(a)1 at \u00b6 2; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 at \u00b6 2. Throughout the Class Period, however, CPB 469 consistently concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [T]he available peer-reviewed medical literature has not established the effectiveness of TMS in the treatment of major depression....

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Meidl has pled four counts under ERISA. In Count One, he alleges that Aetna violated ERISA's fiduciary standards under section 1104(a) of title 29 of the United States Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corr. Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 97, 98;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (requiring \"a fiduciary [to] discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries ... and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries\"). In Count Two, he asserts that Aetna violated the terms of the class members' insurance plans by improperly denying insurance claims for TMS on the basis of CPB 469.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corr. Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 103, 104. Meidl brings Count One for breach of fiduciary duty and Count Two for denial of benefits pursuant to section 1132(a)(1)(B), which authorizes a participant or beneficiary in an ERISA-covered plan to bring a civil action \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the\n   plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corr. Am. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 94, 103. In Counts Three and Four, Meidl asserts breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims for injunctive and equitable relief under section 1132(a)(3), which authorizes a participant or beneficiary in an ERISA-covered plan to \"(A) enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 107-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defs.' Mem. at 10. First, Aetna argues it is entitled to summary judgment because there is no basis in the administrative record for concluding that CPB 469 arbitrarily and capriciously classified TMS as experimental and investigational during the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Aetna argues that the class action fails as a matter of law because the TMS Class cannot satisfy the required elements for injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, Aetna argues that summary judgment is warranted as to particular segments of the TMS Class, namely: (1) class members who received \"off label\" TMS, and (2) class members whose claims are time barred by the contractual limitations periods in their ERISA plans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mem. at 8.

Thus, there is no basis for concluding that Aetna's decision to develop CPB 469 was, in any way, separate or distinct from its decision to deny individual TMS benefits on the basis of CPB 469. Instead, CPB 469 merely codified Aetna's general decision to deny TMS benefits on the grounds that TMS was experimental and investigational.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 29 (\"PX 29\") (Doc.

CPBs apply to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Aetna medical benefit plans[.]\") (emphasis added).

Admittedly, it is not clear from this testimony whether Aetna required evidence that a treatment was\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   effective than covered alternative treatments, or whether Aetna merely required evidence that a treatment was\n   <em>\n    as\n   </em>\n   effective as covered alternative treatments. A fact finder could reasonably draw either inference from Dr. McDonough's statements. Thus, resolving all ambiguities in favor of the non-moving party, the court concludes that there is an issue of fact as to whether Aetna acted arbitrarily and capriciously by imposing a superior effectiveness standard that was not found in the class members' plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Island Software &amp; Computer Serv., Inc. v.

This Charter is an internal document that provides guidance to Aetna's Clinical Policy Council, the entity responsible for reviewing and approving CPB 469. Defs.'

The Charter directs the Clinical Policy Council to consider whether the following five criteria are met when \"determining whether a medical technology is medically necessary and established\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (1) The technology must have final approval from the appropriate governmental regulatory bodies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (2) The scientific evidence must permit conclusions concerning the effect of the technology on health outcomes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (3) The technology must improve the net health outcome.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (4) The technology must be as beneficial as any established alternatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (5) The improvement must be attainable outside the investigational settings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   PX 28 at 57661-62.

The Plan Criteria make no reference to a treatment's costs, and no one would reasonably conflate a treatment's cost effectiveness with its medical effectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Likewise, the Charter's broad requirement that a treatment's benefits be attainable when \"used under the usual conditions of medical practice\" has no basis in the text of the Plan Criteria, which carefully limits the exclusion of experimental and investigational treatments to treatments that (1) lack evidence of their medical effectiveness, (2) are not approved by the FDA for their proposed use, (3) are subject to review and approval by an institutional review board, or (4) are the subject of ongoing clinical trials that meet the definition of a Phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical trial set forth in the FDA regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 228-29.

For example, Dr. McDonough testified that Aetna \"consider[s] the standard plan definition,\n   <em>\n    as well as\n   </em>\n   the criteria in our charter\" when creating a CPB. PX 4 at 158:7-12 (emphasis added). A reasonable fact finder could infer from this testimony that Aetna develops CPBs using Charter Criteria that are distinct from those included in the \"standard plan definition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Such an inference is also supported by the testimony of Dr. Cheng, who admitted that all five of the Charter Criteria must be satisfied for Aetna to conclude that a technology is \"established,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to conclude that the treatment \"has been shown by strong scientific evidence that it is safe and effective for therapeutic purposes.\" Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 (\"PX 3\") (Doc. No. 161-1) at 66:20-67:13. As noted above, there is no basis in the language of the plans to conclude that all of the Charter Criteria are included in the Plan Criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 240-41. Notably, Dr. Cheng also testified that he did not consult the plans themselves when developing and updating CPB 469,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:16-19, but instead relied on the Charter Criteria for his definition of experimental and investigational,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:23-60:9. Dr. Friedlander likewise stated that the Charter \"lays out a number of factors that the Council has to consider\" when Aetna determines whether a treatment is experimental and investigational, although he did not specify which factors in particular must be considered. Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 (\"PX 5\") (Doc. No. 161-3) at 35: 10-18. However, if all ambiguities are resolved in Meidl's favor, as they must be at this stage, this statement provides additional evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could infer that Aetna considered Charter Criteria that were not found in the Plan Criteria when developing CPB 469. Taken together, this testimonial evidence is sufficient to raise an issue of material fact as to whether Aetna acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying TMS benefits on the basis of requirements not found in the class members' plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Injunctive Relief\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Aetna also argues that summary judgment is warranted on a class wide basis because Meidl has not satisfied the legal requirements for the relief being sought by the TMS Class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Specifically, the court certified the TMS Class to seek an order requiring Aetna to reprocess class members' TMS claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Certification Ruling at 6, 52. In doing so, the court classified Meidl's requested reprocessing order as a form of retrospective injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

As the court noted earlier in its Class Certification Ruling, the record shows that Aetna uniformly denied TMS benefits to class members on the basis CPB 469.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Certification Ruling at 21 (\"[T]he defendants fail to draw the court's attention to any denials of coverage for a putative class member's TMS treatment as experimental or investigational not based on CPB 469[.]\").

Mem. at 36-39. Nor could a fact finder reasonably conclude from reading CPB 469 that lack of FDA approval was a basis for CPB 469's classification of TMS as experimental and investigational. As Aetna itself notes, CPB 469 expressly based its designation of TMS as experimental and investigational on the finding that TMS' \"value and effectiveness had not been established through reliable clinical research.\" Defs.' Mem. at 1. CPB 469 does not even hint at the possibility that TMS was classified as experimental and investigational due to lack of FDA approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DX 14 at 1060 (noting only that the FDA's clearance of TMS was based on methodologically questionable evidence of TMS' effectiveness); DX 15 at 1037 (same); DX 19 at 686-687 (same). Therefore, there is no basis in the administrative record for concluding that Aetna denied TMS benefits to some members of the TMS Class because their particular use of TMS was not approved by the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2. Contractual Limitations Periods\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Aetna also argues that summary judgment is warranted as to \"all claims barred by contractual limitations periods contained in the relevant ERISA plans.\" Defs.' Mem. at 39. Although ERISA does not specify a statute of limitations for denial-of-benefits actions, ERISA plans often contain contractual limitations provisions that establish the period of time within which a claimant may file suit in court to challenge a denial of benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heimeshoff v.

As support for its request, Aetna offers the claim histories and contractual limitations provisions of three class members to illustrate, by way of example, the existence of time barred claims in the TMS Class. Defs.' L.R. 56(a)1 at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 38; Defs.' Mem. at 39. This three-person sample, however, provides no basis for concluding that class members who are not represented in the sample are time barred by their plans' contractual limitations provisions. Instead, this sample reveals that different plans impose different contractual limitations periods.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Exhibit 58 (\"DX 58\") (Doc. No. 136-18) at 1525 (\"Any civil action must be filed within two years after the date of the decision on the last available level of appeal[.]\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Exhibit 59 (\"DX 59\") (Doc. No. 136-19) at 1967 (\"No legal action can be\n   brought to recover under any benefit after 3 years from the deadline for filing claims.\"). It further shows that different class members applied for TMS benefits at different times during the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   DX 59 at 691 (requested TMS coverage in 2012)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Exhibit 60 (\"DX 60\") (Doc. No. 136-20) at 701 (requested TMS coverage in 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In light of this variation, individualized proof is required to determine whether a particular class member's claim is barred by the contractual limitations provisions of his or her particular plan. The court may not rely on the claim history and plan provisions of one class member to determine whether another class member's claim is time barred. Doing so would contravene the Rules Enabling Act by \"giving plaintiffs and defendants different rights in a class proceeding than they could have asserted in an individual action.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1048\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As a result, there is no basis in the record for granting Aetna's request for summary judgment as to all time barred claims. If Aetna decides to raise this affirmative defense again at later stages of the litigation, it must come forward with individualized evidence as to each class member whose claim is allegedly time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The court will now address whether summary judgment is warranted as to the three class members for whom Aetna has offered individualized evidence relating to the timeliness of their suits. For simplicity, the court refers to these members as class members 1, 2, and 3. For the following reasons, the court concludes that there are issues of material fact as to whether each of these three class members are time barred by the contractual limitations provisions of their plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Class member 1's plan requires that \"[a]ny civil action must be filed within two years after the date of the decision on the last available level of appeal.\" DX 58 at 1525. If, however, class member 1 files a timely voluntary appeal with either \"the Medical Plan's voluntary external review program,\" her company's \"Benefits Department,\" or both, the contractual limitations period is tolled from the submission of the voluntary appeal until \"the date a decision is issued\" on the voluntary appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1525-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As proof that class member 1's suit is time barred, Aetna offers a report produced by a reviewer for the external review program who reviewed class member 1's voluntary appeal of her denial of TMS benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 39-40 (citing DX 58 at 588-90). Because the report is dated January 16, 2012, Aetna argues that class member 1's two-year limitations period expired no later than January 16, 2014, more than 19 months before this class action was filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   DX 58 at 588 (dated January 16, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, the external reviewer's report did not issue a decision denying class member 1's voluntary appeal. While the report recommends that class member 1's \"health plan should not cover the proposed treatment[,]\" DX 58 at 588, it does not expressly state that the class member's voluntary appeal has been denied. Resolving all ambiguities in favor of the non-moving party, a fact finder could reasonably conclude that the report did not terminate class member 1's voluntary appeal for tolling purposes because the report did not issue a decision denying class member 1's voluntary appeal. Rather, read in a light most favorable to class member 1, it recommended non-coverage to the plan administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by evidence in the record relating to class members 2 and 3's voluntary appeals. Like class member 1, class members 2 and 3 have reports\n   from external reviewers that evaluate whether their claims for TMS benefits are covered by their respective plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX 59 at 692-93; DX 60 at 702-05. However, these two class members also have \"Decision Notification\" documents that expressly codified the external review program's determination that their voluntary appeals had been denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX 59 at 691 (\"Appeal determination: Health plan denial coverage: Upheld\"); DX 60 at 701 (same). On the basis of this evidence, a fact finder could reasonably infer that the Decision Notification, rather than the report, constitutes the final decision denying a claimant's voluntary appeal. Thus, there is an issue of fact as to whether the date on the external review report for class member 1 is the date on which her voluntary appeal was denied for tolling purposes. Accordingly, there is an issue of fact as to when class member 1's contractual limitations period expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The court also concludes that summary judgment is not warranted as to class members 2 and 3, both of whom share similar contractual limitations provisions. Class member 2's plan bars him from filing a suit after three years and 90 days from \"the date of the loss causing the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX 59 at 1967 (stating that no legal action can be brought after 3 years from the deadline for filing a claim);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1968 (defining the deadline for filing a claim as 90 days after the date of the loss causing the claim). Class member 3's plan similarly bars her from filing a suit after three years and 90 days from \"the date of the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DX 60 at 1717 (stating that no legal action can be brought after 3 years from the deadline for filing a claim);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1721 (defining the deadline for filing a claim as 90 days after the date of the loss).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As evidence that class members 2 and 3 are time barred from participating in the TMS Class, Aetna points to documents in these members' appeals records that list the members' \"[d]ate[s] of the requested service\" for TMS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 40 n.28 (citing DX 59 at 690-93, DX 60 at 701). Because each member's date of requested service ended more than three years and 90 days before the filing of this class action, Aetna argues that class members 2 and 3's suits are precluded by their contractual limitations provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   However, Aetna provides no evidence that \"the date of the requested service\" referred to in these appeals records is the same as \"the date of the loss\" or \"the date of the loss causing the claim\" referred to in the class members' plans. The plan excerpts that Aetna has offered for the court's review do not provide a definition of \"the date of the loss causing the claim\" or \"the date of the loss,\" much less a definition that equates these two with \"the date of the requested service.\" Moreover, it would be reasonable to conclude on the basis of the record that \"the date of the requested service\" refers to a different date than \"the date of the loss causing the claim\" or \"the date of the loss.\" For example, a fact finder could reasonably conclude that the \"date of the loss causing the claim\" refers to the date on which the claimant paid for a treatment, while \"the date of the requested service\" refers to the date on which the claimant received a treatment or the date on which the claimant requested coverage of the service. Thus, drawing all inferences in favor of the non-moving party, the court concludes that there is an issue of fact as to whether the \"date of the requested service\" is different from \"the date of the loss causing the claim\" and \"the date of the loss.\" Accordingly, the record does not provide a basis for concluding that there is no issue of material fact as to whether class members 2 and 3 are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

However, Rule 56(a)(4) of the Local Rules of Civil Procedure of the United States District Court of Connecticut was amended on May 4, 2017, to expressly prohibit \"[m]otions to strike (a) statements made in a Rule 56(a) statement or (b) the supporting evidence[.]\" Instead, \"where a party believes that asserted facts are not supported by the evidence, or wishes to object that a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence, the party should make those arguments in its summary judgment briefing, not as motions to strike.\"\n    <em>\n     Chapco, Inc. v. Woodway USA, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522647\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/282/472/#p487\">\n     282 F.Supp.3d 472\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 487-88 (D. Conn. 2017) ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 Advisory Committee's Note (\"[T]here is no need to make a separate motion to strike. If the case goes to trial, failure to challenge admissibility at the summary-judgment stage does not forfeit the right to challenge admissibility at trial.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Second, Meidl argues that the court's consideration of his breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims are not confined to the administrative record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mem. at 13. However, this argument is moot because the court has concluded that Meidl has only alleged a denial-of-benefits claim.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    233. As Meidl concedes, the court may only consider extra-record evidence of a denial-of-benefits claim upon a showing of good cause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mem. at 13;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Halo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254492\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/42/#p60\">\n     819 F.3d at 60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[W]hen reviewing claim denials, whether under the arbitrary and capricious or de novo standards of review, district courts typically limit their review to the administrative record before the plan at the time it denied the claim.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    In his Deposition, Dr. George admitted that he had no knowledge about Aetna's internal processes or deliberations in developing CPB 469.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defendants' Exhibit 1 (Doc. No. 135) at 330:16-332:8. Thus, notwithstanding Meidl's claim that Dr. George's testimony will show that CPB 469 \"did not result from a principled reasoning process,\" Pl.'s Mem. at 13, this testimony only goes to the merits of Aetna's decision to classify TMS as experimental and investigational. It does not shed light on the process by which Aetna arrived at that decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Meidl does not argue that Aetna's conflicted role as payor and evaluator provides a basis for the good cause exception.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mem. at 13-14 (arguing for the good cause exception on the grounds that Dr. George's testimony will help the court determine \"whether Aetna acted reasonably\"). It is worth noting, however, that \"a conflicted administrator does not\n    <em>\n     per\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     se\n    </em>\n    constitute good cause,\"\n    <em>\n     Locher\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9147137\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/288/#p294\">\n     389 F.3d at 296\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and that Meidl bears the affirmative burden of establishing that a conflict of interest warrants expansion of the administrative record,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Krizek v. Cigna Grp.
