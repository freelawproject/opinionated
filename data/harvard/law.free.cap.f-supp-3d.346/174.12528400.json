BURROUGHS, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves allegations that Defendant President and Fellows of Harvard College (\"Harvard\") maintains an undergraduate admissions program that discriminates against Asian Americans in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VI\"). The remaining claims asserted by Plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions Inc. (\"SFFA\") are: \"Intentional Discrimination against Asian Americans\" (Count I); \"Racial Balancing\" (Count II); \"Failure to Use Race Merely as a 'Plus' Factor in Admissions Decisions\" (Count III); and \"Race-Neutral Alternatives\" (Count V). [ECF Nos. 1, 325]. On June 15, 2018, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on all counts. [ECF Nos. 412, 417]. The motions were opposed on July 27 and July 30, 2018 [ECF Nos. 435, 449], and reply briefs were filed on August 27 and August 30, 2018. [ECF Nos. 484, 510]. Several interested non-parties have appeared as\n   <em>\n    amici curiae\n   </em>\n   in support of or in opposition to the summary judgment motions. A bench trial on the issue of liability is scheduled to\n   begin on October 15, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 405].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the cross-motions for summary judgment are\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   on all counts without prejudice to the parties reasserting their arguments at trial, consistent with this order. The Court will also further consider the arguments raised in the amicus briefs at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February and April 2018, prior to the June 15 deadline for filing dispositive motions, the Court suggested to the parties that since the remaining claims appeared to require a fact-intensive inquiry, as well as the evaluation of conflicting expert testimony, summary judgment could be a time-consuming and duplicative effort for the parties and the Court, and perhaps not warranted in light of the upcoming bench trial. [ECF Nos. 384, 402]. Although Harvard agreed, SFFA contended that some or all of the claims could be resolved on summary judgment, while acknowledging that it would be reasonable for the Court to take any dispositive motions under advisement and proceed to trial. [ECF No. 384].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grutter v. Bollinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    539 U.S. 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (district court took cross-motions for summary judgment under advisement and conducted 15-day bench trial before ruling on the motions). The Court ultimately permitted the parties to file dispositive motions [ECF No. 387], but cautioned that if the motions presented material factual disputes, the parties should expect a summary order of denial. [ECF No. 402].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both parties have now moved for summary judgment on all counts. SFFA submitted in support of its motion a 900-paragraph statement of allegedly undisputed facts [ECF No. 414-2] (\"SFFA Facts\"), approximately 700 of which are at least partially in dispute [ECF No. 437] (\"Harvard Response\"). SFFA disputes [ECF No. 452] (\"SFFA Response\") approximately half of Harvard's 278-paragraphs of allegedly undisputed facts [ECF No. 420] (\"Harvard Facts\"), and nearly all of Harvard's 45-paragraph supplemental statement of material facts that allegedly preclude summary judgment for SFFA. [ECF Nos. 437, 511]. Further, the parties' expert witnesses-David Card [ECF Nos. 419-33, 419-37], Ruth Simmons [ECF Nos. 419-28, 419-34], Peter S. Arcidiacono [ECF Nos. 415-1, 415-2, 415-3], and Richard D. Kahlenberg [ECF Nos. 416-1, 416-2, 416-3]-have each produced multiple expert reports that raise a plethora of conflicting opinions on key substantive issues in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Except as otherwise noted, the following facts are not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Harvard's Admissions Office\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard is a liberal arts college and the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. SFFA Facts \u00b6 4. It receives federal financial assistance and is therefore\n   subject to Title VI. SFFA Facts \u00b6 9. For the Class of 2019, more than 37,000 people applied for undergraduate admission to Harvard, 26,000 of whom were domestic applicants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5. Over 8,000 domestic applicants had perfect converted GPAs and over 5,000 domestic applicants achieved a perfect math or verbal SAT score. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. Harvard offered admission to 2,003 applicants for the Class of 2019. Harvard Facts \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid at Harvard (\"Admissions Office\") is tasked with making admissions decisions. SFFA Facts \u00b6 6. This office employs approximately 40 admissions officers who, under the guidance of the Admissions Office's leadership, handle most of the day-to-day operations of the admissions program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 6, 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Applying to Harvard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Students apply to Harvard either through the Early Action program, which typically has a November 1 deadline, or through the Regular Decision program, which typically has a January 1 deadline, but the same procedures for reviewing applications generally apply regardless of whether a student has applied for Early Action or Regular Decision. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Students apply by submitting a Common Application, Universal College Application, or Coalition Application. Harvard Facts \u00b6 13. They must complete a short supplement to indicate their interest and the strength of that interest in an academic field, a career, and extracurricular activities. Harvard Facts \u00b6 14. Applicants may submit scholarly work, artwork, or recordings of music or dance performances. Harvard Facts \u00b6 15. The Common Application, Universal College Application, and Coalition Application permit all students to identify their race (and students may choose more than one), but Harvard does not require them to do so. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 16-18, 20. Applicants may also include information about their race in other parts of the application, such as in their personal essay. Harvard Facts \u00b6 17. After submitting an application, most students are interviewed in person by a Harvard alumnus who reports his or her feedback to the Admissions Office. Harvard Facts \u00b6 21. In sum, a complete application file typically includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. The applicant's name, age, sex, address, citizenship, place of birth, and race (if disclosed);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2.

Application Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Harvard organizes its review of application files into approximately twenty (eighteen domestic and two international) geographical regions referred to as \"dockets,\" which vary widely in geographic scope but cover a roughly similar number of applications. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 65-66. A subcommittee of admissions officers-usually three to six \"first readers\" that are assigned to specific areas within the docket and a senior admissions officer serving as the \"docket chair\"-is responsible for the initial evaluation of all candidates within a particular docket. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The written guidelines as to how admissions officers should review application files are contained in the Admissions Office's \"Reading Procedures,\" which are distributed to the admissions officers each year. SFFA Facts \u00b6 68. The Reading Procedures set forth, among other things, criteria for assigning numerical ratings to each application. SFFA Facts \u00b6 69. Harvard also conducts an in-person orientation and training program for all newly hired admissions officers. SFFA Facts \u00b6 70. After participating in orientation, new admissions officers are typically required to share the first 50 to 100 application files that they read with a more senior admissions officer who provides feedback on the ratings assigned by the new admissions officer. Harvard Facts \u00b6 30; SFFA Facts \u00b6 71. The work of new admissions officers is closely monitored by more senior admissions officers during their first few years of employment. SFFA Facts \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    First Reader and Docket Chair\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To begin the application evaluation process, a first reader reviews the application files from the high schools in his or her area within the docket. Harvard Facts \u00b6 41. First readers conduct the review using a \"summary sheet,\" which is a two to three-page document that is prepopulated with information from a particular student's application, including that student's high school, citizenship, test scores, GPA, class rank, and race. SFFA Facts \u00b6 74. The summary sheet also contains three blank sections that may be completed by the first reader: \"Ratings,\" \"Notes,\" and \"Reader Comments.\" SFFA Facts \u00b6 74. The Ratings section contains fourteen boxes representing the following categories in which an applicant may receive numerical scores: overall, academic, extracurricular, athletic, personal, teacher recommendation\n   (up to four possible), a school support recommendation, two staff interview ratings (overall and personal), and two alumni interview ratings (overall and personal).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   SFFA Facts \u00b6 75. The Notes section may be used to briefly summarize the application or other pertinent information, and the Comments section may be used to provide a more extensive discussion of the application. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After reviewing an application file, the first reader assigns academic, extracurricular, athletic, personal, and overall ratings to the applicant, and rates the strength of the teacher and guidance counselor letters of recommendation. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 43-45. The numerical ratings generally range between 1 and 4 in all categories, with 1 being the best rating. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. Admissions officers may add a plus or a minus to a numerical rating of 2 or 3; a 2+ is better than a 2 which is better than a 2-. Harvard Facts \u00b6 48; SFFA Response \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The academic rating summarizes the applicant's academic achievement and potential based on grades, test scores, letters of recommendation, academic prizes, and any submitted academic work. Harvard Facts \u00b6 49. The extracurricular rating captures the strength of the applicant's involvement in activities during high school and his or her potential to contribute at Harvard outside of the classroom. Harvard Facts \u00b6 53. The athletic rating takes into account the strength of the applicant's potential contributions to athletics at Harvard, as well as the applicant's athletic activity in high school. Harvard Facts \u00b6 57. According to Harvard, the personal rating \"summarizes the applicant's personal qualities based on all aspects of the application, including essays, letters of recommendation, the alumni interview report, personal and family hardship, and any other relevant information in the application,\" and admissions officers assign the personal rating based on their assessment of the applicant's \"humor, sensitivity, grit, leadership, integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness and many other qualities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. The ratings for recommendations, referred to as \"school support,\" are meant to evaluate the strength of counselor and teacher recommendations. Harvard Facts \u00b6 62; SFFA Response \u00b6 62. Finally, the overall rating is intended to summarize the strength of the application as a whole, although it is not determined by a formula and does not involve adding up the other ratings. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. Harvard instructs first readers to assign the overall rating by \"stepping back and taking all the factors into account.\" SFFA Facts \u00b6 99. Admissions officers may consider race in assigning the overall rating, but are not supposed to consider race when assigning the academic, extracurricular, athletic, and personal ratings. Harvard Facts \u00b6 119; SFFA Facts \u00b6 214; Harvard Response \u00b6 214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the first reader completes his or her evaluation, the application file may be sent to the docket chair for further review. Harvard Facts \u00b6 67. The docket chair may assign ratings in the same categories as the first reader and add written comments. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 68-69. The first reader and the docket chair's scores, as well as any comments from other readers, are reflected\n   in the application file. Harvard Facts \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Subcommittee and Full Committee Meetings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After each application has been reviewed by a first reader, the subcommittees meet to further evaluate the applications in their dockets. SFFA Facts \u00b6 113. The first reader of an application pending before the subcommittee summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of that applicant's candidacy. Harvard Facts \u00b6 72. Subcommittee members then discuss the applicant and decide as a group what recommendation and level of support to convey to the full admissions committee regarding admission. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75. Dean Fitzsimmons also allegedly visits the subcommittee meetings to support applicants on the \"Dean's Interest List,\" which is a list of applicants that may be of interest to Harvard. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 294-295; SFFA Response \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After all of the subcommittees have decided which applications to recommend for admission, the full admissions committee (approximately 40 people) meets to make the final decisions on those applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harvard Facts \u00b6 76; SFFA Facts \u00b6 125. The full committee includes, among others, all the admissions officers who read application files, as well as Dean Fitzsimmons, Director McGrath, and the Director of Financial Aid. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a full committee meeting, the first reader of the application being discussed makes a presentation to the committee, typically emphasizing the applicant's strengths. Harvard Facts \u00b6 79. After the discussion is complete, the full committee decides whether to admit, reject, or waitlist the candidate. Harvard Facts \u00b6 80. In both the subcommittee and full committee meetings, each admissions officer has one vote, and a majority vote controls whether a student is admitted, wait-listed, or rejected. Harvard Facts \u00b6 81; SFFA Facts \u00b6 128. The subcommittee and full committee members can potentially consider race as a factor in deciding which candidates to recommend or vote to admit, deny, or waitlist.

SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 138-139; Harvard Facts \u00b6 142. Admitted students have until May 1 to accept their offers of admission. SFFA Facts \u00b6 140. If there are\n   spaces available in the incoming class after May 1, the full admissions committee meets to fill the remaining spots with applicants from the waitlist. SFFA Facts \u00b6 141. Harvard also offers some applicants deferred admission for the following class year.

Harvard's Stated Mission and Pursuit of Diversity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Harvard states that its mission \"is to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society ... through ... the transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education,\" and believes that \"[t]hrough a diverse living environment, where students live with people who are studying different topics, who come from different walks of life and have evolving identities, intellectual transformation is deepened and conditions for social transformation are created.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. \"From this [Harvard] hope[s] that students will begin to fashion their lives by gaining a sense of what they want to do with their gifts and talents, assessing their values and interests, and learning how they can best serve the world.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6 83. According to Harvard, to achieve its educational mission, it \"seeks to admit a class with diverse socioeconomic, geographic, and racial backgrounds; a broad range of academic, intellectual, and extracurricular interests and talents; and a variety of different life experiences that include overcoming hardship, engaging in public service, and much more.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. In 1996, Harvard's then-President, Neil Rudenstine, drafted a report in which he explained the importance of diversity to Harvard's mission:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Our commitment to excellence also means that we will seek out-in all corners of the nation, and indeed the world-a diversity of talented and promising students. Such diversity is not an end in itself, or a pleasant but dispensable accessory. It is the substance from which much human learning, understanding, and wisdom derive. It offers one of the most powerful ways of creating the intellectual energy and robustness that lead to greater knowledge, as well as the tolerance and mutual respect that are so essential to the maintenance of our civic society.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Harvard Facts \u00b6 86; [ECF No. 419-41 at 56]. In 2015, Harvard established a Committee to Study the Importance of Student Body Diversity, chaired by Dean Khurana, which was tasked with examining how \"diversity in the student body helps catalyze the intellectual, social, and personal transformations that are central to Harvard's liberal arts and science education.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The committee endorsed former President Rudenstine's report and \"emphatically embrace[d] and reaffirm[ed] [Harvard's] long-held view that student body diversity-including racial diversity-is essential to [Harvard's] pedagogical objectives and institutional mission.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6 89; [ECF No. 419-45 at 3]. The committee's report described the ways in which student body diversity positively impacts the curriculum, residential and classroom experiences, extra-curricular activities, athletics, and other learning experiences at Harvard. [ECF No. 419-45 at 8-18]. The committee ultimately\n   concluded that student body diversity \"enhances the education of all of our students, it prepares them to assume leadership roles in the increasingly pluralistic society into which they will graduate, and it is fundamental to the effective education of the men and women of Harvard College.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6 90. The full Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously adopted the committee's report. Harvard Facts \u00b6 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In 2017, Harvard established a separate committee to Study Race Neutral Alternatives in Harvard College Admissions, which was chaired by Dean Smith, with Dean Fitzsimmons and Dean Khurana serving as the other committee members (the \"Smith Committee\"). Harvard Facts \u00b6 147. The Smith Committee was charged with evaluating whether race-neutral alternatives are available and workable for achieving the benefits that flow from student body diversity at Harvard. Harvard Facts \u00b6 151. In April 2018, after meeting seven times over the course of nine months, Harvard Facts \u00b6 154, the Smith Committee produced a report explaining that it considered social science and other literature, the Complaint and the expert reports produced in this litigation, as well as other information collected from several offices of Harvard, in reaching the following conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) If Harvard stopped considering race in the admissions process, the proportion of African American and Latin American students in the admitted class would dramatically decline, notwithstanding all the other efforts that Harvard makes to enroll a diverse class, while the proportion of white students would dramatically increase and the proportion of Asian American students would slightly increase. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 156-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) The \"significant decline in racial diversity that would flow from eliminating the consideration of race in the admissions process would prevent Harvard from achieving its diversity-related educational objectives\" because \"students in a significantly less diverse class will have diminished opportunities to engage with and learn from classmates who come from widely different backgrounds and circumstances ... [which] would leave students ill prepared to contribute to and lead in our diverse and interconnected nation and world.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (3) No combination of race-neutral practices,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   including broader efforts to recruit a diverse class; increased financial aid; further emphasis on geographic diversity; admitting more transfer students; eliminating Early Action or deferred admission; affording greater weight to applicants' modest socioeconomic background; and ceasing to consider applicants' test scores, legacy status, parents' employment at Harvard, recruited athlete status, or inclusion on the Dean's or Director's interest list,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   would practicably allow Harvard\n   to achieve the educational benefits of a diverse student body without unacceptably sacrificing other important educational and institutional objectives.

Alleged Discrimination against Asian Americans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The following facts are largely in dispute, but warrant discussion to provide a more complete view of the case. In November 2012, Harvard came under pressure to respond to allegations of perpetuating an \"anti-Asian admissions bias\" following the publication of a magazine article written by a Harvard alumnus, which described anecdotal and statistical evidence of prejudice against Asian Americans in Harvard's admissions program. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 348-357. Harvard's Office of Institutional Research (\"OIR\") conducted an analysis of the article's allegations of discrimination. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 362-364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In February 2013, the OIR produced a report showing that the admission rate for Asian Americans was highest in a simulation where the criteria for admission was academics only, and that the admission rate for Asian Americans progressively declined as more variables were added to the simulation, such as extracurricular activities, personal rating, legacy status, recruited athlete status, gender, and race. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 399-421. The OIR found that when adding the consideration of race to the admissions criteria, \"the share of Asian American students ... fall[s] by more than 8 percentage points, representing a 32 percent decrease in their share of the overall class. This ... represent[s] the largest drop of any racial group.\" SFFA Facts \u00b6 416. Dean Fitzsimmons and Dean Khurana were apparently presented with the findings in this report but neither of them requested additional research from the OIR or discussed the February 2013 report with anyone else in the Admissions Office. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 427-431, 537-543.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In a second report completed in 2013, the OIR found that non-legacy, non-athlete (\"NLNA\") Asian American applicants performed significantly better than NLNA White applicants in SAT scores, the alumni overall rating, and the academic rating, as well as slightly better than NLNA White applicants in the extracurricular rating, and the same as NLNA White applicants in the alumni personal rating, the guidance counselor rating, and teacher ratings. SFFA Facts \u00b6 438. The only category in which NLNA White applicants performed significantly better than NLNA Asian American applicants was the personal rating, and the OIR provided no explanation as to why NLNA White applicants received higher personal ratings than NLNA Asian American applicants. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 439-440. The OIR also found that NLNA White applicants were admitted at a higher rate than NLNA Asian American applicants with roughly the same academic scores, and found a negative association between being admitted to Harvard and being Asian American, although no similar link was observed with any other racial group. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 442-446, 450-51. Dean Fitzsimmons received this second 2013 report, but again did not request any additional research from the OIR or discuss the report with anyone in the Admissions Office. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 466-471. Dean Fitzsimmons and Dean Khurana were similarly nonresponsive when the OIR presented them with a separate memorandum\n   created in May 2013 that found that being Asian American was negatively associated with the likelihood of admission to Harvard. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 504-509, 513-517, 537-543.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In addition to the 2012 and 2013 OIR documents, SFFA contends that the admissions data produced in this litigation confirms Harvard's bias against Asian Americans. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 581-82. Consistent with this Court's orders, Harvard produced applicant-by-applicant admissions data for the Classes of 2014 through 2019, aggregate information on the Classes of 2000 through 2017, and 480 application files and 640 summary sheets from the Classes of 2018 and 2019. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 582-584. In analyzing this data, SFFA's statistical expert, Professor Arcidiacono, concluded that while Asian American applicants are, as a group, stronger than applicants of other racial backgrounds in the academic and extracurricular ratings, SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 595-601, and receive personal ratings from alumni interviewers comparable to White applicants, SFFA Facts \u00b6 610, they have the lowest share of applicants receiving better than 3+ on the personal ratings given by admissions officers. SFFA Facts \u00b6 609. Further, Asian Americans at every level of academic achievement receive lower personal ratings than applicants of all other racial groups. SFFA Facts \u00b6 613. Professor Arcidiacono similarly found bias against Asian American applicants in the overall ratings assigned by admissions officers, SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 624-26, and that Asian Americans were ultimately admitted into Harvard at rates lower than any other racial group from the Class of 2000 through the Class of 2019, even though Asian Americans had higher test scores than all other racial groups during this period of time. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 630-632. In short, Professor Arcidiacono concludes, based on his analysis, that the assignment of personal ratings and overall ratings is biased against Asian Americans and that all things being equal, an Asian American applicant has a lower chance of admission than a White applicant. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 656-669.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As discussed further below, SFFA's assertions are allegedly supported by other statistics, documents, and testimonial evidence of Harvard's discrimination or impermissible consideration of race in admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On November 17, 2014, SFFA filed the operative complaint asserting six causes of action based on Harvard's alleged violation of Title VI: \"Intentional Discrimination against Asian Americans\" (Count I); \"Racial Balancing\" (Count II); \"Failure to Use Race Merely as a 'Plus' Factor in Admissions Decisions\" (Count III); \"Failure to Use Race to Merely Fill the Last 'Few Places' in the Incoming Freshman Class\" (Count IV); \"Race-Neutral Alternatives\" (Count V); and \"Any Use of Race as a Factor in Admissions\" (Count VI). [ECF No. 1]. On March 11, 2016, the Court stayed this action pending the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Fisher v.

[ECF No. 146]. After the Supreme Court issued its ruling on June 23, 2016, Harvard moved to dismiss this case for lack of standing [ECF No. 187] and separately moved for judgment on the pleadings as to Counts IV and VI because those claims were inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent [ECF No. 185]. On June 2, 2017, the Court denied the motion to dismiss [ECF No. 324] but granted judgment on the pleadings for Counts IV and VI [ECF No. 325].

Harvard nonetheless acknowledges that two Standing Members, who applied and were rejected from Harvard, remain eligible for transfer admission. Harvard nonetheless argues that, based on their deposition testimony, these members have no serious intention of transferring to Harvard. When asked, \"Do you intend to apply to transfer ... to any other college or university,\" Standing Member # 1 said, \"I don't anticipate that at the moment, no.\" [ECF 419-15 at 4]. Standing Member # 2 was asked a similar question and responded, \"I mean ... this is highly speculative. You never know what the circumstances are\" that would make him or her willing to transfer. [ECF No. 419-19 at 5]. Standing Member # 2 also stated in a deposition that he or she would consider applying to transfer to Harvard \"[i]f it was not a burden.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312236\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/199/#p203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   These discrete statements, culled from the deposition transcripts, do not satisfy Harvard's heavy burden.

That member explained, \"if Harvard were to stop using its use of race and ethnicity in admissions, I would think my chances of being admitted had risen enough, because of that change, that I would apply again for transfer to see if I could get in under the new system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The testimony that Standing Member # 1 did not anticipate transferring from his or her current enrollment \"at the moment,\" while Harvard maintains its race-conscious admissions policy, presents no inconsistency with being able and ready to transfer if Harvard's admissions policy were to be materially revised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Standing Member # 2 similarly testified, \"I'm able and ready to apply to transfer [to Harvard], were it to cease the use of race,\" and further explained that \"were [Harvard] to cease the use of race or ethnicity, I think those chances [of admission] would be improved and it would be worth the effort to apply for a transfer at that point.\" [ECF No. 454-15 at 5-6]. The testimony that he or she would be willing to transfer to Harvard \"[i]f it was not a burden\" and might depend on circumstances that are \"highly speculative\" at this point, does not adequately show that this student does not seriously intend to transfer. After noting the speculative nature of the question about his or her willingness to transfer, Standing Member # 2 responded \"Yes\" when asked \"Do you think you would apply to transfer to Harvard?\" [ECF No. 419-19 at 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, Harvard has not established that the case has become moot based on the Standing Members' alleged disinterest in transferring.

On behalf of SFFA, Professor Arcidiacono concluded that the Admissions Office gives lower personal and overall ratings to Asian Americans than to any other racial group, despite finding that Asian American applicants are comparatively strong in the academic and extracurricular ratings, and that teachers, guidance counselors, and alumni interviewers score Asian American applicants roughly the same as White applicants on the personal and overall ratings. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 595-616, 624-628. He further found that Asian American applicants were admitted to Harvard at lower rates than other racial groups, and that among applicants with the same overall rating, Asian Americans were the least likely to be admitted. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 629-647. Dr. Card, on behalf of Harvard, reviewed the same data but found no negative effect of being Asian American on the likelihood of admission to Harvard, and even noted that in certain years and geographic areas, being Asian American had a positive effect on the likelihood of admission. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 216-220. To the extent that Asian Americans are admitted at lower rates or receive lower ratings than White applicants, SFFA attributes the disparity to discrimination while Harvard points to, among other things, Dr. Card's determination that the applications of Asian Americans were \"slightly less strong than those submitted by White applicants across a range\n   <em>\n    of observable\n   </em>\n   non-academic measures\" and other \"statistically unobserved factors.\" [ECF No. 435 at 10, 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   These contradictory conclusions are at least in part the result of the experts' divergent modeling choices, including as to (1) whether to pool data across admissions cycles (Harvard Facts and SFFA Response \u00b6\u00b6 233-34); (2) whether to exclude from the regression analysis the personal rating (Harvard Facts and SFFA Response \u00b6\u00b6 230-232), the applicant's intended career (Harvard Facts and SFFA Response \u00b6\u00b6 237-38), and the occupation of an applicant's parents (Harvard Facts and SFFA Response \u00b6\u00b6 235-36); and (3) whether to include in the data pool recruited athletes, legacy applicants, children of Harvard faculty and staff members, and applicants on the Dean or Director's Interest Lists (SFFA Facts and Harvard Response \u00b6\u00b6 750-58). The parties also disagree over the probative value of statistically comparing Asian American applicants to applicants of other races with the same or similar academic credentials, and whether the personal and overall ratings from the Admissions Office\n   can be meaningfully compared against the corresponding scores assigned by alumni interviewers, teachers, and guidance counselors. The credibility of the expert witnesses in making these critical modeling and analytical choices is best evaluated at the upcoming bench trial.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of Merrymeeting Bay v.

SFFA contends that in 2013, Harvard's in-house research division evaluated the treatment of Asian Americans in Harvard's admissions program and reached conclusions that were consistent with Professor Arcidiacono's analysis. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 389-390, 399-465, 492-572. Moreover, SFFA argues that Dean Fitzsimmons and Dean Khurana received the OIR's reports but took no steps to further investigate the evidence of an admissions bias against Asian Americans. SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 426-431, 468-471, 525-528. Determining the appropriate weight to attribute to the OIR's findings requires the consideration of opposing expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 435 at 23] (asserting that Dr. Card's \"far more comprehensive, informed, and reliable work\" contradicts and subverts the conclusions reached by the OIR). Moreover, while SFFA claims that Harvard's inaction in response to the OIR reports suggests an intent to \"bury\" the reports and \"kill\" an internal investigation, Harvard presents evidence that no further investigation took place because Harvard recognized that the OIR reports were preliminary and incomplete and were therefore insufficient to warrant additional inquiry. Determining whether Harvard's explanation for its response to the OIR reports is credible, or as SFFA submits, an implausible post-hoc justification in light of this lawsuit, requires the Court to assess the credibility of Harvard's witnesses and to consider expert testimony regarding the OIR reports. Drawing all inferences in favor of each non-moving party, there are disputed material facts based on Harvard's fact witnesses, the statistical evidence, and the expert opinions presented by each side that cannot be resolved before trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   SFFA's remaining non-statistical, non-expert evidence of intentional discrimination, standing alone, is insufficient to warrant summary judgment. This evidence, which includes some discrete comments in the summary sheets (SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 678-686), the fact that admissions officers more often positively characterized the racial identity of African American and Latin American applicants than that of Asian American applicants (SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 691-692), and Harvard's response to the complaints or comments of one OIR employee (SFFA Facts \u00b6 333), a few alumni interviewers (SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 325, 331), a high-school student (SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 335-336), and one Harvard alumnus who made racist statements in a letter to former President Faust (SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 341-42), does not constitute sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent for summary judgment.

According to SFFA, Harvard tracks the representation of racial groups, and uses the statistics from the prior year's class as a benchmark against which the to-be admitted class is matched. During the full committee phase of the admissions process, \"one-pagers\" are distributed to Dean Fitzsimmons and Director McGrath to make them aware of the present representation of various racial groups as compared to the prior year. Harvard allegedly then reconsiders applications from particular racial groups, if necessary to align the current class demographics with those of the prior year. The admissions committee also allegedly takes into account whether a student is from a racial group that is currently underrepresented in the prospective class when trimming the number of offers of admission during the lopping process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Harvard disclaims SFFA's theory as a skewed portrayal of its admissions process. According to Harvard, what SFFA calls racial balancing is better understood as an ordinary weighing of offers of admission against available beds, with an eye toward diversity. Harvard explains that it reviews demographic information from prior classes to estimate the likely yield of acceptances from those it offers admission, which amounts at most to paying \"some attention to numbers\" as the Supreme Court found permissible in\n   <em>\n    Grutter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    539 U.S. at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The one-pagers break down the number of applicants by race, but also by \"gender, geography, intended concentration, whether the applicant is a recruited athlete, whether the applicant's parent attended Harvard, whether Harvard waived the applicant's application fee, whether the applicant was flagged as socioeconomically 'disadvantaged' by Harvard's admissions staff, whether the applicant applied for financial aid, citizenship, [and] permanent residency.\" [ECF No. 435 at 33]. Rather than using the one-pagers to precisely match the racial demographics year after year, Harvard contends that the one-pagers are used \"to ascertain whether there are any significant trends worth noting and to make sure the Admissions Committee is not overlooking strong candidates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The lopping process is similarly a curative measure applied when, based on the likely yield rate and the available spaces in the admitted class, Harvard has an overabundance of qualified applicants to whom it has tentatively decided to offer admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   With respect to the admissions data, SFFA shows that for the classes of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, the percentage of the admitted class has remained at least somewhat consistent for each racial group: Asian Americans comprised 18% of the share of the Class of 2014, 18% of the Class of 2015, 21% of the Class 2016, and 20% of the Class of 2017. SFFA Facts \u00b6 699. A similar level of consistency was shown for other racial groups with White students comprising between 48% and 53% of the class, Native Americans between 2% and 3%, and Hispanic Americans and African Americans each between 10% and 12% over that same time period. SFFA Facts \u00b6 699. Harvard does not dispute these percentages but asserts that they actually demonstrate significant fluctuations in the admissions of various racial groups.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Harvard's view, the increase in the Asian American share of the class from 18% to 20% is a substantial \"11% increase.\" [ECF No. 435 at 30].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The resolution of Count II depends in part on the credibility of Harvard's admissions officers and leadership as to whether its admissions procedures, including lopping, reviewing one-pagers, and setting target numbers, were intended to balance the racial demographics year after year, or to merely pay \"some attention to numbers\" in enrolling a diverse student body. The class share of each racial group has not been so plainly consistent or varied over time that the Court can conclude that the numbers alone establish or refute the presence of a quota.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grutter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    539 U.S. at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/#p317\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that variation of 13.5% to 20.1% in the class shares for African American, Latin, and Native American students was \"a range inconsistent with a quota\");\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Harvard moves for summary judgment based on the consistent testimony of its admissions officers and training documents showing that Harvard considers race flexibly along with numerous other factors. Harvard further contends that its expert, Dr. Card, found that \"to be admitted to Harvard, applicants must have multiple areas of strength,\" and race alone is not a determinative factor. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 121, 122. Dr. Card also concluded that an applicant's academic, athletic, extracurricular, and personal ratings collectively explain a much larger proportion of the variability in admissions outcomes than race. Harvard Facts \u00b6\u00b6 123, 124. According to SFFA, however, Dr. Arcidiacono's reports and the OIR's research show that race plays a predominant role in the likelihood of admissions for certain groups of students, that race plays such a decisive role in the admissions chances of Hispanics and African Americans, and that \"removing all racial preferences and penalties-treating everyone as though they were white-would raise the number of Asian Americans by [40%].\" SFFA Facts \u00b6\u00b6 417-18, 448, 737-740. Like the material disputes that preclude summary judgment on Count I, the issue of whether Harvard considers race as a plus factor or more turns on the competing expert testimony regarding Harvard's admissions data, the accuracy and reliability of the OIR's research, and the credibility of the testimony of Admissions Office employees regarding the weight attributed to an applicant's race.

Dr. Card also found that even if Harvard maintained all of its existing race-neutral efforts to achieve diversity-financial aid, recruitment of first generation and economically and racially diverse applicants, and post-admission recruitment efforts-eliminating the consideration of race would cause \"the proportion of African-American and Hispanic students in the admitted class [to] decline dramatically.\" Harvard Facts \u00b6 156. According to Dr. Card's simulated models, if Harvard did not consider race, the proportion of African American students in the Class of 2019 would have dropped from 14% to 6%, and the proportion of Latin American or \"Other\" students would have dropped from 14% to 9%.

The Smith Committee and Dr. Card also found that implementing or eliminating the following race-neutral measures or existing admissions practices-(1) increased preference for modest socioeconomic background; (2) increased recruiting of socioeconomically disadvantaged students; (3) increased financial aid; (4) implementing a place-based preference similar to the top 10% plan in\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ; (5) increasing the number of transfer students; (6) eliminating the Early Action program; (7) eliminating consideration of legacy; (8) eliminating deferred admission; and (9) eliminating the consideration of test scores-would not sufficiently promote Harvard's interest in the educational benefits of diversity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   SFFA's expert, Mr. Kahlenberg, reached the opposite conclusion, finding that Harvard can easily achieve diversity by increasing socioeconomic preferences; increasing financial aid; reducing or eliminating preferences for legacies, donors, and relatives of faculty and staff; adopting policies using geographic diversity; increasing recruitment efforts; increasing community college transfers; and/or eliminating early action.

Although the Court may allow SFFA to present evidence to support these assertions at trial to some extent, there appears to be little to no connection between the allegations of racial balancing and Harvard's purchasing of \"potential applicant information\" or its mere attendance and participation in the conference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    SFFA also highlights Professor Arcidiacono's conclusion that Harvard \"maintained a floor on the admission rate for single-race African Americans in the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019,\" in which the admissions rate for single-race African Americans was \"virtually identical\" to the admission rate of all other domestic applicants.
