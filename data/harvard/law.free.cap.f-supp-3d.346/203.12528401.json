That other group included the defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   As the officers approached him, Morales fled and then resisted arrest, but was subdued by the police. He was driven to a site for a showup.

Mixed Petitions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Supreme Court has made clear that a federal district court cannot adjudicate a mixed habeas corpus petition,\n   that is, a petition containing both exhausted an unexhausted claims.\n   <em>\n    Rose v.

The petitioner may return to state court in order to exhaust his claims or may amend and resubmit the habeas petition to present only the exhausted claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306412\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/509/#p518\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As part of AEDPA, however, Congress adopted a one-year statute of limitations for the filing of fully-exhausted claims in a federal habeas petition and did not provide for the tolling of the limitations period while a habeas petition was pending in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p181\">\n    533 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181-82,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p181\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p181\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Consequently, petitioners who come to federal court with a mixed petition run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims. This is because dismissal of a timely filed federal habeas petition containing unexhausted claims after the limitations period has expired will likely mean the termination of any federal review. To remedy this problem, the Supreme Court approved a \"stay and abeyance\" procedure whereby rather than dismissing a mixed petition, a district court can stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner exhausts the unexhausted claims.\n   <em>\n    Rhines v. Weber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    544 U.S. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Once all of the claims have been exhausted, the district court can lift the stay and adjudicate the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Rhines\n   </em>\n   , however, recognized that applying the \"stay and abeyance\" procedure too frequently could undermine Congress' intent under the AEDPA to encourage finality in criminal proceedings and to streamline the federal habeas process.\n   <em>\n    Rhines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    544 U.S. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, to obtain a stay of a mixed petition, the petitioner must show that there was \"good cause\" for failing to exhaust the state remedies, the claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory tactics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While there is little authority on what constitutes \"good cause\" for failing to exhaust state remedies, the First Circuit has made clear that a decision by an attorney \"to omit some claims [in state appellate proceedings] cannot amount to good cause\" for a stay.\n   <em>\n    Clements v.

Thus, Martinez has exhausted Ground III of his claim. Martinez did not argue in his ALOFAR, however, that his due process rights were violated because of either insufficiency of the evidence for the firearm offenses or the prosecutor's closing argument (Grounds I and II of his petition to this Court) rendering this a mixed petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The First Circuit has made clear that the decision to omit claims in an ALOFAR does not constitute good cause for a stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clements\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077496\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/158/#p170\">\n    485 F.3d at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, because Martinez has failed to show good cause, I will not issue a stay and abeyance to allow him to return to state court to exhaust his claims based on Grounds I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Supreme Court has made clear that even if the district court determines that a stay is inappropriate, \"the\n   court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Rhines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    544 U.S. at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874681\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/269/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
