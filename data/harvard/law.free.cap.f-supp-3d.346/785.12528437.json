Blake, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Roxana Orellana Santos sued several municipal and federal defendants for civil rights violations stemming from her arrest and detention based on a civil immigration warrant on October 7, 2008. Initially, defendants were granted summary judgment on all claims. Ms. Orellana Santos appealed as to the two arresting deputies, the Sheriff, and the Frederick County Board of Commissioners (\"BOCC\"). The Fourth Circuit held that her seizure was unconstitutional, but because the Deputies and Sheriff were eligible for qualified immunity in their individual capacities, it affirmed in part the summary judgment ruling. The claims made against the Deputies and Sheriff in their official capacities and against the BOCC were remanded for determination of municipal liability. Now pending are Ms. Orellana Santos's motion for summary judgment as to Counts III and IV (ECF No. 182) and the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment on all counts (ECF No. 183). The issues in this case have been fully briefed, and oral argument was heard on July 10, 2018. For the reasons stated below, Ms. Orellana Santos's motion for summary judgment will be granted on the issue of the County's liability for the final policy decision made by the Sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The factual and procedural background of this case has been discussed at length in prior opinions, so this abbreviated summary includes only facts directly relevant to the pending motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos v.

(ECF No. 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 5, 2008, the Frederick County Sheriff's Office (\"FCSO\"), through Sheriff Charles Jenkins, entered into an agreement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") to have certain FCSO employees assist in immigration enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. H, Memo. Of Agreement, ECF No. 183-11.) Only those personnel trained and certified under the agreement were permitted to participate in immigration enforcement. Deputies Openshaw and Lynch were not participants in the program. The Deputies were, however, subject to a General Order issued by Sheriff Jenkins, entitled \"41.2 Patrol Operations,\" and dated June 23, 2008, permitting patrol\n   deputies to stop individuals \"when the deputy has in their possession or is aware of an outstanding arrest warrant for the individual.\" (Pl.'s Appx., Ex. 4 to Jenkins Dep. (Dec. 5, 2016) at PA067, Section 41.2.3(B), ECF No. 182-3.) The deputies could become aware of an outstanding warrant by running a check in the National Crime Information Center database (\"NCIC\"). (Pl's Appx., Jenkins Dep. (Dec. 5, 2016) at PA036. 44:17-21, ECF No. 182-3.) This database contains criminal arrest warrants, as well as ICE civil immigration removal warrants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a NCIC check identified a warrant, Sheriff Jenkins testified that \"[c]ommon practice would be to detain that individual while you confirm the warrant.\" (Pl.'s Appx. Jenkins Dep. (Dec. 5, 2016) at PA039, 56:12-17, ECF No. 182-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Appx, Lynch Dep. (Feb. 23, 2017) at PA398, 20:2-6, ECF No. 182-3.) Deputy Openshaw testified that once an active warrant is confirmed by dispatch, they are required to arrest the individual. (Pl.'s Appx, Openshaw Dep. (Feb. 23, 2017) at PA380, 14:10-15:12, ECF No. 182-3 (\"If you come in contact with somebody who has an active warrant, once you identify that that person has an active warrant you have to take action.\"); Pl.'s Appx, Openshaw Dep. (Jan. 1, 2011) at PA392, 78:19-21, ECF No. 182-3 (\"Unfortunately, once we verified that she had a warrant my hands are tied. I mean I have to take action.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 7, 2008, while on patrol, Deputy Sheriff's Jeffrey Openshaw and Kevin Lynch of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office stopped and asked Ms. Orellana Santos for identification. After approximately twenty minutes, Ms. Orellana Santos moved to leave, but Deputy Openshaw indicated that she should stay while he waited to see whether a civil ICE warrant for removal was active.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the deputies arrested and detained Ms. Orellana Santos on the basis of that civil warrant. Ms. Orellana Santos was brought to a Maryland detention center, turned over to ICE, and ultimately held in a jail in Cambridge, Massachusetts until her supervised release on November 13, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    725 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   457-58 ; June 6, 2016 Mem. Order at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 10, 2009, Ms. Orellana Santos filed this lawsuit alleging civil rights violations related to her arrest and detention. (Compl., (ECF No. 1).) Initially, summary judgment was granted for the defendants on all claims. (Feb. 7, 2012 Order, ECF No. 99.) Ms. Orellana Santos appealed her claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Deputies Openshaw and Lynch, Sheriff Jenkins, and the BOCC. (Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 111.) The Fourth Circuit held that \"absent express direction or authorization by federal statute or federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may not detain or arrest an individual solely based on known or suspected civil violations of federal immigration law.\"\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    725 F.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit ruled that \"the deputies violated Santos's rights under the Fourth Amendment when they seized her after learning that she was the\n   subject of a civil immigration warrant and absent ICE's express authorization or direction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit also held that qualified immunity barred claims against the Deputies and the Sheriff in their individual capacities. It remanded the remaining official capacity claims against the Deputies and the Sheriff, and the claim against the BOCC, to this court for determination of \"whether the deputies' unconstitutional actions are attributable to an official policy or custom of the county or the actions of a final county policymaker.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/\">\n    at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court then permitted an amended complaint and allowed discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The claims that remain before the court are as follows: count I for \"Unlawful Seizure\" against Deputies Openshaw and Lynch in their official capacities, count II for \"Unlawful Arrest\" against Deputies Openshaw and Lynch in their official capacities, count III for \"Supervisory Liability\" against Sheriff Jenkins in his official capacity, and count IV for \"Entity Liability\" against the BOCC.

(Third Am. Compl. (ECF No. 150);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   June 16, 2016 Mem. Order.) The plaintiff filed her motion for summary judgment as to counts III and IV, against Sheriff Jenkins in his official capacity and the BOCC respectively, on August 25, 2017. (ECF No. 182.) The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment on all counts and opposition to plaintiff's motion on September 22, 2017.

The plaintiff advances three theories in Count III of the amended complaint under which she seeks to establish such liability: (1) that Sheriff Jenkins promulgated an official policy as a final county policymaker, (2) that the Sheriff failed to adequately train or provide relevant guidance to his deputies, and (3) that the county ratified the Deputies' unlawful actions. Ms. Santos need only surmount the summary judgment threshold for any one of these independent bases for Section 1983 liability. Here, her first theory prevails; the second and third theory need not be addressed. As explained below, this court concludes that the constitutional violations were traceable to Sheriff Jenkins, acting as a final decisionmaker for the county regarding law enforcement policy related to immigration for FCSO. Deputies\n   Openshaw and Lynch also would be liable in their official capacities because they acted as required by the municipal policy set by Sheriff Jenkins as final policymaker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the County is liable for any damages caused by the violation of Ms. Santos's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sheriffs in Maryland may be considered either state or, in limited circumstances, county officials.

H, Memo. Of Agreement, ECE No. 183-11.) Accordingly, irrespective of Maryland case law or the common finding that a sheriff in Maryland conducting law enforcement duties is a state actor, this case requires the fine-grained context-specific analysis of policymaking authority mandated by\n   <em>\n    McMillian\n   </em>\n   and its forebears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Close inquiry finds Sheriff Jenkins as the final policymaker for Frederick County over the \"particular issue\" in question-Frederick County's participation in the 8 U.S.C. 1357(g) program. Sheriff Jenkins, on behalf of FCSO, chose to enter FCSO into the immigration enforcement agreement with the federal government. While Ms: Orellana Santos was not seized pursuant to that agreement, (the two Deputies in question were not authorized under the agreement to pursue immigration enforcement), her unconstitutional seizure and arrest are directly traceable to FCSO's participation in that agreement and FCSO's subsequent failure to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized officers in their patrol procedures. Sheriff Jenkins, as signatory on the 1357(g) agreement, was aware that only officers trained and certified under the agreement were permitted to participate in immigration enforcement. Despite this fact, he promulgated a General Order that required all patrol officers to run warrant checks on stopped individuals, and detain any individual with an outstanding warrant, regardless of whether the warrant was civil or criminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Under 8 U.S.C. 1357(g), \"the Attorney General may enter into a written [immigration enforcement] agreement with a State, or any political subdivision of a State.\" Sheriff Jenkins did not enter the state of Maryland into a 1357(g) agreement; he entered FCSO into an agreement. Under the organization of the 1357(g) program, the agreement with FCSO must then have been between ICE and a political subdivision of a State.

This localized strategy of strong immigration enforcement-which is counter to the prevailing policy of the state-is different from the general exercise of state executive authority that resulted in a constitutional violation in\n   <em>\n    McMillian\n   </em>\n   . When analyzed in turn, the persuasive factors identified in\n   <em>\n    McMillian\n   </em>\n   , particularly the jurisdictional limits of the policy and the election by county voters, weigh more heavily in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At oral argument, counsel agreed that General Order 41.2 required the Deputies to arrest Ms. Santos under the circumstances present in this case, and that the policy which caused the constitutional violation was that of not distinguishing an immigration ICE warrant for deportation from other (presumably criminal) arrest warrants. The defendants argue that the Deputies and the Sheriff did not know that civil warrants were in the NCIC database at the time of Ms. Orellana Santos's arrest. But the Sheriff's lack of actual knowledge is immaterial, because the inclusion of these civil warrants was public knowledge years before the unconstitutional arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   John Ashcroft, U.S. Att'y Gen., Prepared Remarks on the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (June 6, 2002), available at\n   <em>\n    http://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2002/060502agpreparedremarks.htm\n   </em>\n   . If he did not actually know of the inclusion of civil warrants, he very well should have. The defendants also assert that the state of Maryland, not FCSO, provides NCIC training to its deputies, so the responsibility to train its deputies on the contents of the database is not theirs. This argument fails. Only FCSO deputies were involved in immigration enforcement. As discussed above, this involvement was a local decision unique to FCSO. There is no reason for the state to train all officers on civil immigration warrants, because the state is not involved in immigration enforcement. FCSO undertook the responsibility of immigration enforcement, and knew that only certified officials would be trained by ICE. It was the sole responsibility of Sheriff Jenkins to ensure that the general orders issued subsequent to the immigration enforcement FCSO decided to undertake appropriately limited the role of the non-1357(g) deputies. Instead, the general order, as it was implemented, required non-1357(g) deputies such as Openshaw and Lynch to detain Ms. Santos based on a civil immigration warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendants also contend that FCSO did not know that local officials could not enforce civil immigration warrants until the Fourth Circuit's ruling in this case, so they could not possibly have warned their deputies. These arguments are merely attempts to apply qualified immunity to municipal claims. Qualified immunity is not an available defense to municipal defendants or government officials sued in their official capacity under Section 1983, nor it is intended to extinguish a plaintiff's opportunity to find redress for the damage of constitutional violations committed by municipalities.\n   <em>\n    Owen v.

Under the patrol order, the Deputies were\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to detain Ms. Orellana Santos when a warrant was returned in NCIC, regardless of whether it was civil or criminal in nature. When issuing these policies, specifically when entering into the 1357(g) agreement and issuing the patrol policies through which it was enacted, Sheriff Jenkins was acting on behalf of Frederick County, not\n   the state of Maryland. Therefore, Sheriff Jenkins is liable in his official capacity as the final policymaker, and Deputies Openshaw and Lynch would be liable in their official capacities because their unconstitutional actions are directly traceable to this policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

While, as discussed above, Maryland state law typically treats sheriffs and deputies as state employees, and the Sheriff's office is created by the Maryland Constitution, state law explicitly contemplates circumstances in which a Sheriff might be considered a local actor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037300\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/316/275/#p289\">\n    316 Md. at 280-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037300\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/316/275/#p289\">\n    558 A.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The remaining two factors weigh against Eleventh Amendment immunity.

Frederick County voters elect their sheriff, although the Governor has the right to fill a vacancy. Md. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 44. The county provides the bulk of the funding for the entity. If anything, state policy seems to be moving in the opposite direction from Sheriff Jenkins, with the state legislature not signaling any desire to increase immigration enforcement throughout the state. While the law enforcement function of the Sheriff's office is typically overseen by the state, when deciding whether to participate in federal immigration enforcement, Sheriff Jenkins operated independently from the state. He entered into the 1357(g) program for Frederick County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lane v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128642\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/660/185/#p197\">\n    660 F. App'x 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (4th Cir. 2016). In the narrow field of federal immigration enforcement through the 1357(g) program, FCSO acts autonomously from the State-indeed it made the election to exercise federal power in Frederick County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similarly, only Sheriff Jenkins has authority to set local immigration enforcement policy. The 1357(g) program and FCSO patrol guidelines are limited in jurisdiction to FCSO. They have no statewide effect, as Sheriff Jenkins lacks the authority to enter into such an agreement and set relevant guidelines on behalf of any other jurisdiction or the State itself. The defendants argue that they participated in an immigration enforcement action in Anne Arundel County, demonstrating the wider scope of their participation in the 1357(g) program. The fact that ICE requested their assistance, in another county only underscores the fact that the scope of the 1357(g) agreement was limited to FCSO officers-ICE could not request the assistance of Anne Arundel county officers because they did not have a 1357(g) agreement in place. More importantly, this case turns on the operation of the 1357(g) agreement in concert with FCSO patrol guidelines that failed to adequately explain FCSO's participation in the 1357(g) program and ensure that uncertified officers were not detaining individuals based solely on civil immigration warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nothing about subjecting Sheriff Jenkins and the Deputies in their official capacities to this suit undermines Maryland State sovereignty. Sheriff Jenkins, fulfilling the role to which he was elected by the people of Frederick County, made a local policy decision to enter into the 1357(g) program and to issue the general order. The County will bear any financial burden\n   of FCSO's deficiencies in patrol guidelines in connection with immigration enforcement. There is no state policy at issue in this case. The highly localized nature of FCSO's participation in the 1357(g) program, the autonomous nature of its implementation, and the county's funding of any award in this case outweigh any identification of Sheriff Jenkins and the Deputies as state employees. The Sheriff and Deputies are therefore not eligible for Eleventh Amendment immunity and the motion for summary judgment for Counts I, II, and III on that basis will thus be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Frederick County Board of Commissioners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The BOCC, while liable as the county responsible for covering Sheriff Jenkins, is not liable for Ms. Orellana Santos's constitutional violations under an independent ratification theory. As discussed above, Sheriff Jenkins acted as the final repository of county authority regarding immigration enforcement in Frederick County. The BOCC does not have adequate control over the law enforcement functions of Sheriff Jenkins or FCSO to have had the opportunity to prevent him from entering into the 1357(g) agreement or to require him to promulgate patrol policies that would have instructed non-1357(g) officers properly so as to avoid unconstitutional searches and seizures related to civil immigration warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ms. Orellana Santos argues that the BOCC's 2013 statement after the Fourth Circuit opinion was issued in this case indicates a ratification of the actions of Sheriff Jenkins and Deputies Openshaw and Lynch. The statement publicly expresses support and appreciation for FCSO and its deputies but without any reference to the actions that gave rise to this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. J, BOCC Letter, Aug. 8, 2013, ECF No. 183-16.) Even if the BOCC did appear to ratify the deputies' actions and FCSO's policies, such a statement does not change the fact that the BOCC does not have the authority to intervene in FCSO's decision to participate in immigration enforcement for the County. Therefore, their approval of actions over which they exercise no control cannot create independent liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the county is required to pay for any damages caused by the Sheriff's constitutional violations, regardless of whether the BOCC is independently liable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dotson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527514\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/920/#p924\">\n    937 F.2d at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blackburn v.

In her initial motion, Ms. Orellana Santos requested that the issue of damages be preserved for trial if liability is found.

In her deposition, she describes back pain and a stomach ailment that she claims are a result of her arrest and detention, as well as difficulty sleeping and other mental and emotional distress she has suffered since her arrest. (Pl.'s Appx, Orellana Santos Dep. at PA005-018, ECF No. 182-3.) These descriptions are more than conclusory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants argue that Ms. Orellana Santos's injuries were not caused by her arrest and detention at the hands of Deputies Openshaw and Lynch. They contend that her injuries were actually caused by the \"superseding legal acts\" of the direction of a 1357(g)-certified officer to transport Ms. Orellana Santos from the scene, and her eventual transport and detention at the direction of an ICE agent. They cite\n   <em>\n    Bodine v. Warwick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413385\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/393/#p400\">\n    72 F.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (3d Cir. 1995), and\n   <em>\n    Trask v.

Deputies Openshaw and Lynch unconstitutionally detained Ms. Orellana Santos on the basis of a civil immigration warrant. The transport and eventual detention of Ms. Orellana Santos were the direct downstream effects of that unconstitutional act. The 1357(g)-certified officer and the ICE officer who directed her transport were not independently aware of Ms. Orellana Santos's location and did not coincidentally realize the deputies had detained someone who happened to be subject to an outstanding civil immigration warrant. The instructions were issued because the deputies had already detained her and requested confirmation of the civil warrant. Emotional distress and accompanying physical ailments are the sorts of harm that can be expected to flow naturally from an unconstitutional arrest, and orders for transport and continued detention by a 1357(g)-certified officer and an ICE agent are events that would naturally flow from the confirmation of a civil immigration warrant during the course of that unconstitutional arrest. Even if the acts of the 1357(g) and ICE officers were independent and lawful, how much of the harm was attributable to the unconstitutional arrest and seizure as compared to their lawful acts would still be a genuine dispute as to material fact better left to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Ms. Orellana Santos also has made a request for declaratory relief, alleging that the policies resulting in her constitutional violations remain in place. The defendants did not address the facts supporting this argument. They merely attacked her reliance on\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908) and stated that there has not been another seizure or arrest based on an immigration\n   warrant since Ms. Orellana Santos was arrested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This fact does not preclude the possibility of another seizure occurring. Defendants failed to address whether the policies have been changed, leading the court to believe that they have not. As the facts and arguments surrounding injunctive relief do not appear not been fully developed, at best, whether declaratory relief will be awarded also will be reserved for later determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons stated above, summary judgment will be granted to the plaintiff as to Count III, for the Sheriff's actions in his official capacity and as a final policymaker for Frederick County, and granted in part as to Count IV. The defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Count IV will be granted as to the plaintiff's ratification and independent liability theories, but denied as to the County's liability for the policy decisions of Sheriff Jenkins. Summary judgment will be denied to the defendants as to Counts I, II, and III and their argument for nominal damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    By statute, NCIC is only permitted to contain criminal warrants.
