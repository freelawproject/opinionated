According to Northrop Grumman, this is one of those rare cases in which the Court may consider extra-record evidence because it was denied a fair and complete opportunity to present its arguments and facts to NASA. Dkt. 28-1 at 37-41. Because the Court concludes on the basis of the existing administrative record and the parties' agreed-upon description of relevant background information that NASA's decision to release the information contained in Clause B.7 is arbitrary and capricious, it need not reach this issue. The Court will therefore review each of NASA's asserted rationales without considering Northrop Grumman's extra-record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   NASA's first two reasons for concluding that disclosure of Northrop Grumman's proposed wrap rates would not cause the company substantial competitive harm-that Northrop Grumman's \"actual rates\" are not being disclosed, and that the actual rates cannot be derived from the release of the proposed wrap rates-are flawed for two reasons. First, although the wrap rates contained in Clause B.7 are, indeed,\n   <em>\n    proposed\n   </em>\n   rates and are not based on the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   indirect costs Northrop Grumman incurred in performing under the JWST contract, they are by no means unconnected to Northrop Grumman's actual rates. As explained above, the JWST contract was a cost-plus contract and, to control indirect costs, it included a \"negative fee incentive\" for the first eight years of the period of performance. Dkt. 18-1 at 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-7 at 97. At the end of\n   each calendar year, Northrop Grumman was required to apply its proposed wrap rate to its actual labor costs to determine its yearly costs based on the proposed wrap rate. Dkt. 18-1 at 17. For each of the first eight years of the contract, Northrop Grumman would then add this amount to the amount calculated in the prior performance years using the same methodology, and would add three percent to the cumulative \"proposed wrap rate\" cost to arrive at a \"cumulative cost cap.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. Later, Northrop Grumman would apply its actual wrap rate-which was based on its actual indirect costs-to its labor costs to arrive at its actual yearly costs, which it then added to the amount calculated for prior performance years using that same methodology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, for each performance year, the company was required to subtract its cumulative \"actual wrap rate\" cost from its cumulative, adjusted \"proposed wrap rate\" cost to calculate the \"negative fee incentive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Accordingly, to avoid the \"negative fee incentive,\" Northrop Grumman needed to ensure that its proposed wrap rate was predictive of its actual wrap rate. And, as Northrop Grumman explained in its April 7, 2017 submission to NASA, \"[b]ecause the wrap rates\" included in Clause B.7 therefore \"reveal [the company's] cost of doing business, they can be used by competitors to gain an unfair competitive advantage when bidding on competitive contracts against [Northrop Grumman].\" Dkt. 18-3 at 370 (explaining that \"competitors would know\" Northrop Grumman's \"indirect expenses applicable to each dollar of labor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, even if competitors are not able to \"extrapolate\" Northrop Grumman's \"actual rates,\" Dkt. 18-1 at 97, the proposed wrap rates are themselves \"proprietary information\" that Northrop Grumman treats as \"closely held\" and does \"not share[ ] with competitors,\" Dkt. 18-3 at 370. Because the actual rates are unknown at the time of contracting, the proposed wrap rates are one means by which the government evaluates the bidder's proposed costs. As Northrop Grumman explained in its April 7, 2017 submission, moreover, [Redacted] thus making them a potentially valuable tool for a competitor who is seeking to \"calculate [Northrop Grumman's] future bids and its pricing structure from the withheld information,\" thereby \"allow[ing] competitors to estimate, and undercut, its bids.\"\n   <em>\n    Gulf &amp; W. Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786942,1396175\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/615/527/\">\n    615 F.2d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, because disclosure of Northrop Grumman's proposed wrap rates would permit competitors to undercut Northrop Grumman's bids, NASA's first two rationales for releasing them do not withstand APA scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   NASA's third rationale-that [Redacted] Dkt. 18-7 at 97-is equally flawed. The significance of the proposed wrap rates is the role they play at the time of contracting. To be sure, a competitor might be interested to know whether Northrop Grumman's actual wrap rates triggered the negative fee incentive. That information, for example, might let Northrop Grumman's competitors infer how Northrop Grumman might change its proposed wrap rates in future bids. But the absence of that additional information does not deprive the proposed wrap rates that Northrop Grumman used-[Redacted] Dkt. 18-3 at 370-of trade secret status. [Redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Fourth, NASA reasoned that because the JWST project was a unique, \"once in a generation\" contract, it was \"unlikely\" that any Northrop Grumman competitor could use the JWST proposed wrap rate \"to gain a definitive advantage needed to secure a contract for a related space-based infrared observatory, or other Federal procurement\n   of this magnitude.\" Dkt. 18-7 at 97 n.6. That conclusion, however, failed to consider Northrop Grumman's submission stating that release of the JWST proposed wrap rates would put Northrop Grumman at a competitive disadvantage in bidding on a range of specific aerospace solicitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-3 at 371-72. Northrop Grumman supported that assertion with numerous specific examples, including [Redacted]\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 371. The company further explained that, \"given the multiple programs and opportunities that are on the horizon,\" \"[t]he threat of competitive harm is not illusory but rather distinct and real.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 372. Because NASA failed to consider these likely competitive harms, its rationale-once again-fails APA scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Fifth, NASA posited that the release of the proposed wrap rates would not cause competitive harm because competition for future contracts \"is likely to be based on a variety of factors including cost, past performance, and technical capability,\" and the wrap rate information \"is only one aspect of a myriad number of fluctuating variables relevant to a future contract award.\" Dkt. 18-7 at 97-98 n.6. This argument is similar to the reasoning the D.C. Circuit rejected in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas I\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant-NASA in that case as well-argued that \"underbidding due to the disclosure would not occur because price is only one of the many factors used by the government in awarding contracts.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669678,11662718\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/303/\">\n    180 F.3d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
