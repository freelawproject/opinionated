Plaintiffs filed a response on September 12, 2018. (ECF No. 109.) Defendants replied on September 26, 2018. (ECF No. 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the following reasons, Defendant Tyler's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs bring a class action against Shelby County and Shelby County officials Bill Oldham, Robert Moore, Charlene McGhee, and Debra Hammons, in their individual and official capacities (collectively, the \"Shelby County Defendants\"). (ECF No. 103.) Plaintiffs also sue Tyler Technologies, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs claim they were unlawfully detained at the Shelby County Jail following the County's installation of a new computer tracking system. That system included Defendant Tyler's Odyssey software. Plaintiffs bring claims against Shelby County Defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violations of Plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Plaintiffs bring negligence claims against Tyler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shelby County uses a computer system to process and track information about the arrest files, criminal cases, and court records of inmates at the Shelby County Jail (the \"Jail\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The computer tracking system organizes and manages information including inmates' posting of bond, pretrial probable cause determinations,\n   and the release of arrestees whose bonds have been posted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, Shelby County decided to replace its in-house developed computer tracking system and solicited bids from providers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Contract, ECF No. 105-2 at 927.) On July 22, 2013, Shelby County contracted with Tyler to design, install, and integrate a new court management system (the \"Contract\") that included Tyler's Odyssey software. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2016, Shelby County began implementing the new integrated criminal justice system (\"iCJIS\"), of which the Odyssey software was a central part. (Third Am. Compl., ECF No. 103 \u00b6 23.) On November 1, 2016, Shelby County stopped using its previous computer tracking system and began \"record[ing] all arrest and inmate activity by hand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) The new system and Odyssey software \"went 'live' \" on November 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By November 15, 2016, deficiencies in the system had become apparent to court staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Judge William Anderson of the Shelby County General Sessions Court characterized the failings of the new system as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I apologize for the system .... [O]ne person being in jail too long is bad enough, but 15, 20, 30 .... We expected problems but we didn't expect problems of this magnitude, where people remain and languish in jail without even getting a bond set, without having [a] court appearance set and us not even knowing how to go about solving the problem ... how do you lose somebody in the system for three weeks .... Everybody says it's the [computer] system.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the new computer system was put in place, the named Plaintiffs were allegedly kept in jail beyond the dates set for their release. Plaintiff Travis Boyd represents that he was arrested without a warrant and incarcerated on November 2, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) It took the Odyssey System seven days to show that Plaintiff Boyd was \"booked.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Only after the computer showed Plaintiff Boyd's status was he afforded a probable cause review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff Boyd was then detained two days after posting bond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Terrence Drain represents that he was arrested without a warrant and incarcerated on November 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) The Odyssey System showed Plaintiff Drain was \"booked\" five days later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Only after the computer showed Plaintiff Drain's status was he afforded a probable cause review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Plaintiff Drain was \"booked,\" his attempt to post bond was refused because bond \"did not appear in the clerk's case management software until\" three weeks later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff Jeremy S. Melton represents that he was detained, from November 10, 2016, until November 14, 2016, four days after entry of an order for his release, because the \"order was not in the Computer System.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Deontae Tate represents that he was prevented from posting bond to secure his release for five days, from November 6, 2016, to November 11, 2016, because \"he was not in the Computer System and thus could not post bond.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff Issacca Powell represents that, on his arrest on November 11, 2016, the \"computer system ... indicated that there was an active warrant for his arrest on the charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a weapon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) When he was taken before a judge eleven days after his arrest, Powell had to be \"returned to the jail because the Odyssey System did not reflect any pending case against\" him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After posting bond, Plaintiff Powell was detained for two additional days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff Cortez D. Brown represents he was detained from November 6, 2016, to November 14, 2016, seven days after the charges against him were dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff Keith Burgess represents that the Odyssey System failed to reflect that a warrant for his arrest had been recalled on November 16, 2016, resulting in his unlawful arrest and incarceration for five days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Burgess's release, the Odyssey System did not reflect the recalled arrest warrant until four months later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff Scott Turnage represents that his eighty-hour detention, beginning on February 18, 2017, arose from \"an [attachment\n   <em>\n    Pro Corpus\n   </em>\n   ] that should have already been purged from the Odyssey System[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After implementation of the new computer system, Earle Farrell, a Shelby County Sheriff's Department representative, \"acknowledged that the intake process was taking six times as long as usual.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Despite that delay, Tyler and Shelby County continued to use the new computer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On November 17, 2016, Plaintiff Powell filed a class action complaint against Defendant Oldham, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as Shelby County Sheriff. (ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 9, 2017, the Shelby County Defendants filed a consent motion to consolidate actions against Tyler and the Shelby County Defendants by the named Plaintiffs. (ECF No. 41.) The Court granted the consent motion on March 13, 2017, and directed Plaintiffs to file one consolidated complaint. (ECF No. 42.) Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint for the consolidated class action on March 24, 2017. (ECF No. 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on May 4, 2017. (ECF No. 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 9, 2018, the Court consolidated\n   <em>\n    Powell, et al. v. Oldham, et al\n   </em>\n   ., 2:16-cv-2907-SHM-tmp (W.D. Tenn.) with\n   <em>\n    Ingram, et al. v. Oldham, et al\n   </em>\n   , 2:17-cv-2795-SHM-tmp (W.D. Tenn.). (ECF No. 89.) The Court ordered Plaintiffs in both actions to file a consolidated complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 743.) Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint on July 30, 2018. (ECF No. 103.) Defendant Tyler filed this Motion to Dismiss on August 20, 2018. (ECF No. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Tyler is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and has its principal place of business in Texas.

To the extent Tyler contends that Plaintiffs' claim fails because the factual allegations in the Third Amended Complaint are untrue, Tyler's contention cannot be sustained.

Tyler contends that, under the terms of the Contract, Tyler was required to implement its Odyssey software only for the Shelby County Criminal Court and the Criminal Division of the Shelby County General Sessions Court.

In conjunction with the replacement of JSS, Shelby County will also be replacing JMS - its current Jail Management System used by the Jail and IMS - the current Inmate Management System used by the Correction\n   Center. The current JMS/IMS/JSS systems are tightly integrated with a custom written interface. The\n   <em>\n    new iCJIS will be integrated using\n   </em>\n   a service Oriented Architecture solution and an\n   <em>\n    Enterprise Service Bus solution (Info Hub)\n   </em>\n   .

Plaintiffs contend the provision supports, rather than contradicts, their allegation that Tyler was responsible for the Jail's problems. (ECF No. 109 at 1021 (citing ECF No. 103 \u00b6 42).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The quoted provision of the Statement of Work does not establish the precise nature of Tyler's involvement in the project. The Statement of Work does appear, however, to give Tyler responsibility for integrating the Enterprise Service Bus, which included the Offender Management System used by the Jail, with the Odyssey software. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Contract, ECF No. 105-2 at 945.) Plaintiffs' allegations that Tyler's Odyssey software had a role in what occurred at the Jail are not contradicted by this portion of the Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Other provisions of the Contract connect Tyler to the Jail's computer systems. The \"Integration Scope\" of the Contract provides that Tyler was to install \"the Odyssey Translation Bus, which will provide a standardized set of integrations data services ... [that] will [serve as] the interaction point between the courts' data system and the County's\n   <em>\n    Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)\n   </em>\n   , or Hub.\" (ECF No. 105-2 at 950 (emphasis added).) Tyler was to provide integration services such as \"[r]eal-time data queries from the County's\n   <em>\n    Hub/ESB to Odyssey\n   </em>\n   in ... compliant message formats\" and vice versa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) The \"compliant message formats\" were necessary to exchange information on defendant names, warrants, charges, custody status, fees, bond amount, and other data points. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. C, ECF No. 105-2 at 967-73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   These provisions of the Contract connect Tyler's Odyssey software to the ESB, one of the systems \"so integrated\" with the iCJIS's other systems that the full iCJIS could not \"go live\" without it. (Contract, ECF No. 105-2 at 948.) Tyler's responsibility for developing the ESB supports Plaintiffs' allegation that Odyssey was \"[a]t the heart of the new Computer Tracking System\" and that \"the successful integration of Odyssey was essential for the full Computer Tracking System to be operational[.]\" (ECF No. 103 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Tyler argues that, under the Contract, it had a limited role in the iCJIS. Tyler points to the section of the Statement of Work providing that \"all data translations that need to be done in order to map data from Odyssey to the Hub/ESB and other agencies integrated via the Hub/ESB will be performed by the County's System's Integrator, which at the time [the Contract] was written ha[d] yet to be awarded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (Contract, ECF No. 105-2 at 950.) Although this provision appears to contemplate that some other provider will integrate Odyssey's data exchange functions with the ESB, it does not establish that Tyler itself did not eventually perform that task. This provision also does not establish that there were no problems with Tyler's software arising from some feature other than its integration with other systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At this stage of the litigation, the Court must view the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs and resolve all factual questions in their favor. Because no provision of the Contract explicitly contradicts Plaintiffs' allegations that Tyler was involved with the events at the Jail, the Court must accept Plaintiffs' allegations as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mackley v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 921-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Tyler provided services to which Tennessee's economic loss doctrine has no application. (ECF No. 109 at 1014-15.) Plaintiffs also contend that the economic loss doctrine does not apply because Plaintiffs do not seek purely economic damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1039-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Under Tennessee law, a plaintiff injured by another's negligence is entitled to compensatory damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dedmon v.
