Forty-four other Counts fill out the controlling Second Superseding Indictment (Doc.

By Order entered January 29, 2018 (Doc. No. 344), the Court set aside the week of November 26-30, 2018 for hearings on pending motions. Upon review of the Motions that have been filed, however, it is clear that a hearing is unnecessary for many of them and they\n   are resolved in this Memorandum Opinion and Omnibus Order.

In response, the Government \"take[s] no position as to defendants' requests and submits defendants' motions to the discretion of the Court,\" (Doc.

However, rather than adopting an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   approach whereby some Defendants receive some transcripts, while others receive transcripts for different witnesses, daily transcripts will be made available for all witnesses who testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That said, the Court expects counsel to exercise discretion in ordering transcripts, so as to keep the transcription costs and/or copy costs down by requesting transcripts only where truly necessary to provide \"an adequate defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The previously-mentioned Guide to Judicial Policy also quotes a Resolution adopted by the Judicial Conference in March 1980 and modified in September 1986 that provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   That in those cases where accelerated transcript services are provided, the party from whom the request or order emanates shall pay for the original, and if the requesting or ordering party is other than defense counsel appointed under the Criminal Justice Act, the CJA counsel shall be entitled to a copy at the copy rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   That the present practice, in some districts, of routinely apportioning the total cost of accelerated transcript services equally among the parties should be abandoned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209354\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, if the Government requests daily transcripts, the costs shall be born by it, with CJA counsel responsible for paying the copy rate and thereafter seeking reimbursement from CJA funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Motions for Daily Transcripts filed by Maurice Burks (Doc. No. 563), and Derrick Kilgore (Doc. No. 637) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , as is Brandon Hardison's \"Motion for 'Real Time' Transcription\" (Doc. No. 640) to the extent he seeks daily transcripts. To the extent Hardison's request for \"real time\" relates to following the testimony during the questioning of a witness, the Court simply notes that screens are provided on counsel's table and, absent technical glitches, counsel can read along as the testimony is being transcribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Motions to Increase Peremptory Challenges\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hardison and Burks have both filed Motions for Additional Peremptory Challenges. Hardison requests that Defendants be allowed to exercise twenty (20) challenges jointly with the other defendants, with the Government being allowed to exercise twelve (12) challenges. Similarly, Burks \"requests an adequate number of peremptory strikes to eliminate biased or questionable jurors and select a fair and impartial jury,\" and \"moves the Court to increase the number of peremptory challenges to twenty (20), or to such an extent as the Court deems proper, to assure a fair trial.\" (Doc. No. 643 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in a non-capital felony case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"the government is entitled to 6 peremptory challenges and the defendant or defendants jointly have 10 peremptory challenges when the defendant is charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(b). The rule goes on to provide that \"the court may allow additional peremptory challenges to multiple defendants, and may allow the defendants to exercise those challenges separately or jointly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20L.%20Ed.%20891\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A district court's decision regarding peremptory challenges is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, so long as it \"[c]omplies with the minimum requirements of Rule 24 [.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

No. 697), the trial in this case is months away, and the Court at this point in time has no way of knowing which Defendants may go to trial and on what counts. Accordingly, a ruling on the Motions to Increase Peremptory Challenges (Doc. Nos. 639 &amp; 643) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   Said denial is\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   to raising the issue again at the Final Pretrial Conference scheduled for February 14 and 15, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Pay for Childcare Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Burks has filed a \"Motion for the Court to Pay For Care of Dependent Children and Family Members of Single Parents Who Are Selected as Jurors\" (Doc. No. 564). In it, he writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. Mr. Burks is entitled to a trial by a fair and impartial jury composed from a fair cross-section of the community pursuant to his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. In major cases generally, and particularly in cases which last as long as Maurice Burks' trial is expected to last, a large percentage of single parents, especially single African-American parents and women, are struck for cause by the Court due to the fact that they have no money to pay for alternative child care arrangements during a trial the length of Mr. Burks', or no money to pay for alternative care of dependent (usually elderly) family members during such a lengthy trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   4. The Government's interest in not causing undue juror hardship does not outweigh the Accused's constitutional rights to a fair jury trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   5. As a result of a jury selection process in which jurors who cannot afford child care are excluded, Maurice Burks may face a venire pool that is non-representative of a general cross-section of the community because certain poor and/or African-American individuals and/or women are removed due to hardships imposed by the length of the trial anticipated in Mr. Burks' case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).

Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ) for the proposition that, in the absence of payment of dependent care, the jury selection process will violate not only his \"right to a fair and impartial jury composed from a fair cross-section of the community,\" but also his right to equal protection under\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). As for funding, Burks claims the \"Court can order that the costs of such care be taxed as costs in this case, just at it can order the costs of transportation, room and board be taxed as cost for any sequestered jury\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201871\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Turning to the latter point first, the cited statute has nothing to do with paying for child or elder care in the routine case. Rather, it provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (e) During any period in which a jury is ordered to be kept together and not to separate, the actual cost of subsistence\n   shall be paid upon the order of the court in lieu of the subsistence allowances payable under subsection (d) of this section. Such allowance for the jurors ordered to be kept separate or sequestered shall include the cost of meals, lodging, and other expenditures ordered in the discretion of the court for their convenience and comfort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201871\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Even assuming that dependent care expenses comes within the ambit of \"convenience and comfort,\" no sequestration order has been entered in this Court. The remainder of the statute deals with non-sequestered juries and permits fees for such things as meals, lodging, parking, travel, and tolls, but mentions nothing about child or elder care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Funding aside, Burks has not shown that the failure to provide funding for childcare will deny him equal protection or result in him being tried by a jury that is not a fair-cross section of the community.\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   , on which he relies, applies to peremptory strikes by the government against certain classes of persons.\n   <em>\n    J.E.B. v.

Section 1961(5) provides that a:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"pattern of racketeering activity\" requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (emphasis added). This language suggests that Congress envisioned the situation where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for a racketeering act and subsequently charged with a RICO violation based on the prior conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   This interpretation of the language of RICO is fully supported by the statute's legislative history:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   It is the purpose of this Act to seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States by strengthening the legal tools in the evidence-gathering process, by establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Even before\n   <em>\n    Garrett\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   There is nothing in the RICO statutory scheme which would suggest that Congress intended to preclude separate convictions or consecutive sentences for a RICO offense and the underlying or predicate crimes which make up the racketeering pattern. The racketeering statutes were designed primarily as an additional tool for the prevention of racketeering activity, which consists in part of the commission of a number of other crimes. The Government is not required to make an election between seeking a conviction under RICO, or prosecuting the predicate offenses only.

RICO requires association and participation in an enterprise affecting interstate commerce; drug distribution does not.

Said conspiracy allegedly continued over the course of almost 13 years.

He does not explain, however, how testing the forensic evidence referred to in Clarksville Police Department (\"CPD\") reports would exonerate him or weaken the government's case. This is particularly problematic because CPD reports point to him as being a suspect in both shootings, and there is no suggestion that he was not charged because someone else was responsible.

He simply argues, with no supporting proof, that federal agents were \"well aware, long before [the instant] indictment, that Clarksville had closed the case and destroyed the evidence\"; that the U.S. Attorney's Office thus \"made the tactical decision to build a RICO case\" and add the shootings above as overt acts in the RICO conspiracy charge, \"in the hope that otherwise inadequate evidence showing Marcus Darden's involvement would be bolstered by inclusion in a much larger, wide-ranging indictment\"; and that the government \"has not, and will not, be able to show the discovery of any new evidence related to the shootings between the time the cases were closed by [CPD] and the date of the indictment.\" (Doc. No. 638 at 2, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In response, the Government represents that federal agents were unaware that the CPD had destroyed evidence in connection with the January 15, 2006, shooting until approximately July 2016, and they were also unaware that the CPD had destroyed evidence in connection with the December 15, 2007, shooting until approximately November 2017. The Government also claims that it developed new evidence in November 2017 regarding Darden's involvement in both shootings. It then superseded its original indictment, on December 14, 2017, and included those shootings as overt acts of racketeering activity in furtherance of the RICO conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As for general delay in bringing this case, the Government relies on the same representations that it made regarding a substantially similar Motion (Doc.

As this Court also pointed out in its prior Order, those reasons are more than sufficient to dispel any notion that the Government improperly delayed bringing charges for a tactical advantage.

This can be of particular concern in the context of a RICO case. As the Second Circuit observed in the context of reversing a RICO count where the alleged extortion offenses were \"not limited to\" the four extortion counts listed in the Indictment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   With the wide latitude accorded the prosecution to frame a charge that a defendant has \"conspired\" to promote the affairs of an \"enterprise\" through a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" comes an obligation to particularize the nature of the charge to a degree that might not be necessary in the prosecution of crimes of more limited scope. In this case the indictment charges a RICO conspiracy of seven years' duration carried out through various extortion offenses. The indictment puts Davidoff on notice that he will be obliged to defend against extortionate schemes directed at one company, AEI, and companies associated with it in contemplation of a merger. At trial Davidoff is then confronted with evidence of extortions aimed at entirely different companies. Though we agree with the Government that even in a RICO case it is not obliged to disclose before trial all of its evidence, we believe the trial judge exceeded his discretion in this RICO prosecution by denying a bill of particulars identifying at least the victims of discrete extortionate schemes that the prosecution intended to prove... We do not mean to imply that even in a RICO\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   case the prosecution must always disclose in advance of trial every act it will prove that may violate some criminal statute. But here it is simply unrealistic to think that a defendant preparing to meet charges of extorting funds from one company had a fair opportunity to defend against allegations of extortions against unrelated companies, allegations not made prior to trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

No. 380 at 11). The last thing Defendants need is for the Government to offer proof at trial of still other violent acts or crimes without advanced notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The \"well-established rule\" is \"that the overt act element of a conspiracy charge may be satisfied by an overt act that is not specified in the indictment,\" but this is only true \"so long as there is no prejudice to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Rios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928010\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/403/#p424\">\n    830 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   424 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While the Government has provided Defendants with what it characterizes as \"voluminous discovery\" (which some Defendants have quantified be close to a terabyte of information), the possibility exists that counsel, who obviously will be focusing on what has actually been alleged, may lose the forest for the trees.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, to ensure fundamental fairness and due process, and to eliminate a potential delay in the trial or the possibility of a mistrial because one or more Defendants is blind-sided by alleged crimes that can be easily disclosed in advance of trial, the Government will be required not only to disclose other \"crime, wrongs, or other acts\" within the meaning of Rule 404(b), but also other crime or violent acts in the form of \"overt acts\" under the RICO count that the Government intends to utilize in its case in chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This leave the question of when such disclosures should be required.

While Count Five \"identifie[d] the general geographic location and the elements of the offense sufficiently to fairly inform Defendant of the Charge and to 'protect against double jeopardy because of an inadequately described offense,\" the court nevertheless found a Bill of Particulars appropriate because of the absence of any indication of any acts taken or who was alleged to be in the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Indictment in this case does not contain the same infirmities. Not only does Count Two (1) identify the specific types of controlled substances alleged to have been trafficked by Burks, Luke and their co-conspirators - cocaine, crack cocaine, oxycodone, methadone, hydrocodone, and marijuana; the quantities of cocaine and crack cocaine trafficked - five kilograms or more of cocaine and 280 grams or more of crack; the location - the Middle District of Tennessee and elsewhere; and the duration of the alleged conspiracy - from on or about 2005 until the return date of the initial Indictment, (2) it also expressly identifies certain co-conspirators with whom Burks and Luke are alleged to have engaged in the drug trafficking conspiracy -- Marcus Darden, Lamar Warfield, Derrick Kilgore, Elance Lucas, DeCarlos Titington, Lawrence Mitchell, Lorenzo Brown, Rex Whitlock, and others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Furthermore, and even though as already noted overt acts need not be alleged or proven in a Section 846 conspiracy,\n   <em>\n    Shabani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1330519\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/10/#p11\">\n    513 U.S. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1330519\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/10/#p11\">\n    115 S.Ct. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Second Superseding Indictment\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   contains a laundry list of alleged acts by Defendants, many of which relate to drug trafficking.

On this latter point, both Burks and Luke argue the discovery that has been provided is insufficient to determine whether the double jeopardy clause serves as a bar to prosecution. Burks does so in a separately filed Motion to Dismiss that will be set for an evidentiary hearing, while Luke raises the argument in his Motion for Bill of Particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Luke's double jeopardy argument is underdeveloped.

The Court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Mutually antagonistic defenses are not prejudicial per se.

Such a risk might occur when evidence that the jury should not consider against a defendant and that would not be admissible if a defendant were tried alone is admitted against a codefendant. For example, evidence of a codefendant's wrongdoing in some circumstances erroneously could lead a jury to conclude that a defendant was guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   When many defendants are tried together in a complex case and they have markedly different degrees of culpability, this risk of prejudice is heightened.... Evidence that is probative of a defendant's guilt but technically admissible only against a codefendant also might present a risk of prejudice.... Conversely, a defendant might suffer prejudice if essential exculpatory evidence that would be available to a defendant tried alone were unavailable in a joint trial.... The risk of prejudice will vary with the facts in each case, and district courts may find prejudice in situations not discussed here. When the risk of prejudice is high, a district court is more likely to determine that separate trials are necessary, but ... less drastic measures, such as limiting instructions, often will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925396\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/534/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925396\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/534/\">\n    at 538-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925396\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/534/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   This is indeed a complex case.

Among other things, he is alleged to have traveled with others\n   to Clarksville to locate D.S., and once located, confronted, shot, and killed him over a drug debt. At the same time he allegedly killed D.S.'s girlfriend, A.W. Thereafter, Hardison is said to have given the murder weapon to another Gangster Disciples member for disposal, and also spoken to several Gangster Disciples about the murders. It is further alleged that Hardison talked with several co-Defendants and other gang members about retaliating against rival Bloods gang members and, shortly thereafter confronted and assaulted M.W., a Bloods gang member, in C-Ray's Social Club. Hardison is also charged with an array of substantive offenses based upon those overt acts including VICAR murder of D.S. (Count Five), and A.W. (Count Seven) in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1959(a)(1) ; Causing Death Through the Use of a Firearm in relation to D.S. (Count Six) and A.W. (Count Eight), in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 924(j) ; Tampering with a Witness, Victim, or Informant by Killing or Attempting to Kill A.W., in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1512(a)(1)(c) (Count Nine); and Assault Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury in Aid of Racketeering in relation to M.W., in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1959(a)(3) and 2 (Count Twelve).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Burks is also alleged to have committed murder, along with drug trafficking crimes. In the RICO count, Burks is identified as a Gangster Disciples member who attended membership meetings, and advanced the goals of the organization by (1) by possessing with intent to distribute and distributing cocaine in Hopkinsville, Kentucky on February 4, 2010, February 26, 2010, and December 17, 2010; (2) meeting with other Gangster Disciples in or near Clarksville on or about September 23, 2012 to discuss possible retaliation against members of the Bloods gang for the murder of S.F., a Gangster Disciples' associate; (3) communicating with other Gangster Disciples on or about November 3, 2012, about retaliating against members of the Bloods gang; and (4) shooting and killing M.W. inside C-Ray's, on or about November 3, 2012. He is also charged in Count Two with drug conspiracy, and in Counts Ten, Eleven, Thirteen, and Fourteen, for offenses arising from the murder of M.W., including Unlawful Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) ; Murder in Aid of Racketeering, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ; Using, Carrying, Brandishing, and Discharging a Firearm During and in Relation to, and Possessing, Brandishing, and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of, a Crime of Violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; and Causing Death through the Use of a Firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). Three others are charged with offenses relating to Burks's murder of M.W. as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   If the allegations of the Second Superseding Indictment are to be believed, Luke is not an innocent bystander either. In his Motion, Luke is quick to point out that, unlike Hardison and Burks, he is not charged with murder. However, Luke, like the other Defendants, is allegedly a member of the Gangsters Disciples and is charged with RICO conspiracy. Among the over acts attributed to him are that: (1) he possessed with intent to distribute and distributed cocaine, crack cocaine, and other controlled substances, in Clarksville and elsewhere between 2009 and 2012; (2) he and other members of the Gangster Disciples shot at, and attempted to kill, Person 10, a member of the Vice Lords gang, in Clarksville on or about June 24, 2009; (3) he and other members of the criminal organization shot at, and attempted to kill, members of the Vice Lords gang, in Clarksville on September 13, 2009, during which Person 11 was struck by bullets; and (4) he shot at, and attempted to kill, Person\n   12, in or around Clarksville on or about April 12, 2012. Luke is also charged in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine and other controlled substances alleged in Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Were the Court to grant the motions to sever, this would require a minimum of four trials. In one, trial would be held against Hardison on Counts One, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, and Twelve. A second trial involving Burks would require trial of Count One again, plus, Counts Two, Ten, Eleven, Thirteen, and Fourteen. Yet a third trial, against would involve trying Count Ones and Two again, this time against Luke. Still a fourth trial against the remaining seven Defendants would involving trying the RICO count for the fourth time, the drug conspiracy count for the third time, plus all of the other substantive counts in which Hardison, Burks and Luke are not named.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Hardison argues that, because he in jail for a long portion of the life of the alleged conspiracy, he would be subject to prejudicial spillover. This would include \"proof regarding the murder of J.H. that occurred in 2007, multiple counts of drug trafficking crimes that occurred 2014 and several instances alleging the attempted murders of multiple individuals in 2014, all of which occurred during times when [he] was incarcerated.\" (Doc. No. 642 at 5). He argues the only way to counter this would be to provide proof of his incarceration, which would not only be highly prejudicial, but also require him to present evidence in violation of his right to remain silent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The Court recognizes that a joint trial in which all Defendant are tried could result in some spillover, but \"[a] spillover of evidence between counts does not require severance unless there is 'substantial,' 'undue,' or 'compelling' prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Prejudice of that sort has not been shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Hardison's argument also fails to take into account that he is charged with a RICO conspiracy alleging that he actively participated in the ongoing affairs of a criminal organization. To the extent his claim is that he withdrew from the conspiracy, that claim, as already noted is an affirmative defense that he must prove. \" 'Mere cessation of activity is not sufficient' to establish withdrawal from a conspiracy ..., and a defendant's arrest or incarceration does not qualify as an affirmative, volitional act of withdrawal.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, he concedes that both he and the Government will present photographs and diagrams depicting the scene, and the Government represents that it has provided a great deal of discovery relating to C-Ray's, including \"multiple bodycam videos taken by a CPD detective of the area outside of C-Ray's on the night of the murder; a CPD video of the inside of C-Ray's taken during the daylight hours; hundreds of CPD photographs taken inside and outside of C-Ray's; and multiple CPD diagrams of C-Ray's.\" (Doc. No. 730 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Further, the Court cannot ignore the logistical problems such an excursion would create. On this point, the Government argues that Burks' \"proposal requires transporting the Court, twelve jurors, four (or more) additional alternate jurors, a court reporter, numerous incarcerated defendants, 15 defense attorneys, at least two prosecutors, the government's case agent, and multiple members of the United States Marshals Service (\"USMS\") to view a nightclub, presumably in the middle of the day.\" (Doc. No. 730 at 3-4). The Government also notes that it would be difficult to hide from the jury the shackles Defendants will likely need to wear if they were allowed to walk around C-Ray's during a jury view. According to the Government, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Jeff Dill has indicated that \"accommodating [Burk's] request would be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, given all of these logistical concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203077523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 4 n.1).

Nor does the Government explain why all of the Defendants and all defense counsel would need to be transported to C-Ray's, as opposed to only those involved with charges related to the murder at C-Ray's. In any event, C-Ray's, located at 2481 Fort Campbell Boulevard is approximately 60 miles from the federal courthouse in Nashville, and an hour's drive under the best of circumstances.

In response, the Government does not oppose the idea of jurors being provided a questionnaire, but objections to some questions as being \"overly intrusive,\" and others as being \"inflammatory.\" (Doc. No. 731 at 1-2). The Government also requests that, if the Court elects to use a juror questionnaire in this case, it be allowed \"the opportunity to submit its own proposed questionnaire to the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). In reply, Burks takes issue with the Government's characterization that some of the proposed questions are improper, and notes that the questionnaire was prepared by \"an eminently qualified jury consultant and contained questions that have all been used, in similar or exact form, in courts throughout the country, both federal and state, including the Middle District of Tennessee.\" (Doc. No. 771 at 2). Burks also assert that his \"jury consultant could come to Nashville during the week of November 26th ... to further explain the methodology for preparing a jury questionnaire in a case like this one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   The Court agrees with the parties that a questionnaire sent to prospective jurors would be of benefit, particularly if this case proceeds to trial in its present posture. However, the Court also believes that many of the questions are unnecessary, others are covered in the Court's standard colloquy with the jury venire, and some are intrusive. Further, the Government should be allowed input into the questions to be asked. While Burks represents that his jury consultant could be made available\n   during the week the Court has set aside for hearings, the Court is not concerned about the methodology that was employed, and finds a hearing unnecessary. Instead, the matter of a juror questionnaire will be placed upon the Court's agenda for the status conference to be held on\n   <strong>\n    November 29, 2018.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Accordingly, Burks' Motion for Jury Questionnaire (Doc.

No. 768 at 3). Assuming Burks' characterization of the reporting is accurate, Burks fails to account for the fact that any number in the increase of peremptory challenges is not due to exclusively to publicity. Instead, the increase relates to the number of Defendants, the number and nature of the charges, and the ratio set forth in Rule 24.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-273\">\n    In its response brief, the Government discusses at length the test set forth in\n    <em>\n     Blockburger v.

The Court agrees.
