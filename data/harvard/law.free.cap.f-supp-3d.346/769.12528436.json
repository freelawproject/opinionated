Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is the Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 24) filed by State Auto Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"Defendant\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and James and Susan Gerow's (\"Plaintiffs\") Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33). This Motion has been fully briefed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 24, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 41, 42) and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this breach of contract action, Plaintiffs are suing Defendant, their insurer, for Defendant's failure to pay a property damage claim that arose when Plaintiffs were no longer living full-time at the insured property. Defendant argues that it properly denied coverage for Plaintiffs' claim under the insurance policy's residence premises condition, which conditions coverage on Plaintiffs residing at the insured property. Plaintiffs disagree that the policy contains such a condition and also contest Defendant's conclusion that Plaintiffs did not reside at the insured property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The resolution of the pending Motions thus involves three major issues, which are discussed more fully below: (1) whether the Policy conditions coverage on Plaintiffs residing at the insured property; (2) whether Plaintiffs did reside at the insured property at the time their claim arose; and (3) whether Defendant waived or is estopped from asserting the residence premises condition as a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has diversity jurisdiction over this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) because Plaintiffs are citizens of different states than Defendant and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-17; ECF No. 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because this case was originally filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County, Pennsylvania, venue is proper in the Western District of Pennsylvania pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polizzi v.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 3, 2017, Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit by filing their Complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County, Pennsylvania, claiming breach of contract and statutory bad faith. (ECF No. 1-3.) Defendant timely removed to this Court on October 31, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) Defendant then filed its Answer to the Complaint on November 22, 2017 (ECF No. 6) and an Amended Answer on December 4, 2017. (ECF No. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 13, 2018, Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 24), accompanied by a Brief in Support (ECF No. 25) and a Concise Statement of Materials Facts (ECF No. 26). On July 13, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an Answer to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 30), a Response to Defendant's Concise Statement of Material Facts And Plaintiffs' Counter Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 31), and a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 32).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant replied on July 27, 2018 (ECF Nos. 35, 36). Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Reply Brief in response to Defendant's Reply Brief. (ECF Nos. 37, 38, 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 13, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed a Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33) and a Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 34).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant filed its Response and Brief in Opposition on August 10, 2018 (ECF No. 41, 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court has fully reviewed and considered all of the filings pertaining to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Partial\n   Summary Judgment. Accordingly, these Motions are now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court includes additional material facts in Part VI as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The \"Move\" From Johnstown to Connecticut\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2007, Mr. Gerow relocated with his wife and children to Johnstown, Pennsylvania for an employment opportunity. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 15; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 15.) In Johnstown, Plaintiffs lived at 769 Viewmont Street (\"Subject Property\") (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 1), which was insured by Defendant (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 2; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After Mrs. Gerow's father died on June 15, 2015, Plaintiffs decided that Mrs. Gerow would take care of her mother, Carol Zaccara, in Connecticut. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 22; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 22.) When they made this decision, Plaintiffs did not know how long they would be staying in Connecticut and whether their stay would be temporary or permanent. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 23; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In late August 2015, Mrs. Gerow and Plaintiffs' two youngest children moved\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the Subject Property and went to live at Mrs. Zaccara's home (the \"Connecticut Property\"). (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 32; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 22; ECF No. 26 \u00b6 5.) Mrs. Gerow told some neighbors that she was going to Connecticut to take care of her mother and that Mr. Gerow would be in and out. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 28; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 28.) Plaintiffs moved many of their personal belongings to Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 26 16; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 6.) Plaintiffs forwarded at least some of their mail to Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 26\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiffs' youngest child enrolled in school in Connecticut (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 8; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 24; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 24), and to complete this enrollment, Mrs. Gerow obtained a Connecticut driver's license, although Mr. Gerow did not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 24; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs did not turn off the utilities at the Subject Property. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 36; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 36.) They also never discussed renting or selling the Subject Property (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 21; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 21), and they have continued to file tax returns from the Subject Property and to bank in Johnstown. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 26; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Gerow works in the satellite industry and is a part owner of a company that performs government contracts; as a result, he spends a substantial amount of time commuting to Washington, D.C. and on occasion he stays overnight at a corporate apartment in Washington, D.C. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 17; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 17.) He travels from his place of employment to Connecticut to spend time with his family (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 9; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 9), spending three to four days per week at the Connecticut Property (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 18; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 18), and the rest of his time at the apartment in Washington, D.C. and in Johnstown. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 18; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 18.) Mr. Gerow estimated that he is at the Subject Property three to four times per month (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 18; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 18) and that he spends between 20 and 30 nights at the Washington, D.C. apartment per year (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 19; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 19). When Mr. Gerow stays at the Subject Property, he goes to the Sunnehanna Country Club, where he has been a member since 2009. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 35; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Between September 2015 and April 1, 2016, Mrs. Gerow visited the Subject Property approximately five to ten times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 11; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 11.) None of Plaintiffs' children have been to the Subject Property since the family moved to Connecticut. (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 12; ECF No. 24-5 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The August 2015 Loss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In August 2015, Plaintiffs reported a problem with the roof at the Subject Property (the \"August 2015 Loss\") to Defendant. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 29; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 29.) Defendant sent its employee, Allen Fisher, to the Subject Property to inspect the loss. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 30; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 30.) Mr. Fisher drafted a claim report, which he emailed to Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 31; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 31.) Neither Mr. Fisher nor\n   any employee of Defendant advised Mr. Gerow that there was any issue with coverage, including any issue with the absence of personal property in the dwelling. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 32; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 32.) Defendant also sent a letter and claim report to Plaintiffs with photos and a check after Mr. Fisher inspected the loss. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34; ECF No. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Subject Loss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On or about January 26, 2016, the Subject Property was damaged by a burst water pipe (the \"Subject Loss\"). (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 1.) At the time of the Subject Loss, the Subject Property was covered by a homeowners' insurance policy (the \"Policy\") issued by Defendant to Plaintiffs. (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 2; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 2.) The Policy indicates that the \"Insured location\" is the \"residence premises,\" and defines \"residence premises\" as, in relevant part, \"[t]he one family dwelling where you reside.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 24-3 at 12; ECF No. 31-1 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following the Subject Loss, Plaintiffs presented a claim under the Policy to Defendant for the damages suffered at the Subject Property. (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 31 \u00b6 4.) After investigating the claim, Defendant denied the claim because Defendant determined that Plaintiffs did not reside at the Subject Property at the time of the Subject Loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 13.) However, Defendant continued to accept Plaintiffs' premium payments until December 2016. (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 45; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 45.) Defendant's denial of coverage for the Subject Loss is at issue in the instant dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

(ECF No. 33 at 1.) Plaintiffs argue that the Subject Property was and is Plaintiffs' residence, and that even if it is not, Defendant waived and is estopped from asserting this argument.

Mr. Gerow stays three to four days per week in Connecticut, where his wife and children reside. (ECF No. 24-6 at 4; ECF No. 26 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 31 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18; ECF No. 36 \u00b6 18.)

However, the Court has not altered the spelling of the Defendant's name in the caption from that used by Plaintiffs in their Complaint. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 1.) It appears to be appropriate for the parties to address this issue through a motion to correct caption.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The Court reminds Plaintiffs' counsel to review the Practices and Procedures of Judge Kim R. Gibson, particularly those rules that deal with page limits for briefs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Practices and Procedures of Judge Kim R. Gibson, Section II.B (Aug. 23, 2017).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendant points out (ECF No. 42 at 1) that Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment was untimely, as it was filed almost a month late based on the deadlines of which the Court approved in its Initial Scheduling Order (ECF No. 17) and its Order Granting Motion to Extend Time (ECF Nos. 21-22). The Court recognizes that it could thus deny Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for failure to file in a timely manner. However, in order to rule on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court must necessarily address the issues raised in Plaintiffs' Cross Motion. The Court thus chooses to deny the Cross Motion on the merits as opposed to based on its untimeliness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The Court notes that Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 32) and Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 34) are exactly the same. Therefore, the Court will refer to both of these documents as \"Plaintiffs' Memoranda.\" By citing to one of Plaintiffs' Memoranda, the Court also incorporates the same page of the other Memorandum.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Court derives these facts from a combination of Defendant's Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 26), Defendant's Appendix of Exhibits thereto (ECF No. 24), Plaintiffs' Response to Defendant's Concise Statement of Material Facts and Plaintiffs' Counter Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 31), Plaintiffs' Appendix of Exhibits thereto (ECF No. 30), and Defendant's Responsive Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 36).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Plaintiffs dispute Defendant's use of the verb \"move.\" (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 5.) However, Plaintiffs recognize that they changed their living situation such that Mrs. Gerow went to live with her mother in Connecticut. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Plaintiffs also recognize that Mr. Gerow testified at his Examination Under Oath that he moved his belongings from Johnstown to Connecticut, although Plaintiffs dispute the accuracy of his testimony at his Examination Under Oath because he was unrepresented by counsel and \"use of the word 'moved' was initiated by State Auto's counsel.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) For ease of expression, the Court will use the word \"move\" when referring to Plaintiffs' change in living situation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendant states that Plaintiffs moved all their personal belongings to Connecticut, except for an air mattress, television, and chair. (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 6.) Plaintiffs counter that \"the Gerows did not move all of their personal property to Connecticut\" (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 6), but Plaintiffs cite to Mr. Gerow's Examination Under Oath, in which Mr. Gerow says that a lot of the furniture was moved to Connecticut and that Plaintiffs have \"moved so much\" to Connecticut. (ECF No. 31-1 at 50.) The Court construes Plaintiffs' statement as an admission that Plaintiffs moved many, but not all, of their personal belongings to Connecticut, with which Defendant appears to agree (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Defendant claims all mail is forwarded to Connecticut. (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 7; ECF No. 24-6 at 29.) Plaintiffs deny this statement (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 7), while simultaneously citing to a place in the record in which Mr. Gerow stated that mail was forwarded to Connecticut and affirmed that no mail was coming to the Subject Property, although admitting that he still had a work-related P.O. box in Johnstown to which work-related mail comes. (ECF No. 31-1 at 69-70.) Similarly, Mrs. Gerow admitted that they changed their mailing address with the post office, such that mail sent to the Subject Property would be forwarded to the Connecticut Property.

Mr. Gerow testified that the email said that the house was \"vacant\" (ECF No. 31-1 at 54), which Defendant disputes, without citing to the record (ECF No. 36 \u00b6 31). The parties do not appear to have produced the email for the Court. However, in the claim report that Plaintiffs filed as Exhibit G, Mr. Fisher states that \"[t]he house is empty, as the insured now lives near Washington, D.C. It is not vacant.\" (ECF No. 31-2 at 31.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The parties dispute the significance of this provision. Defendant claims the provision is a \"condition that requires one or both Plaintiffs to reside at the Subject Property in order for coverage to apply.\" (ECF No. 26 \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs counter that the Policy \"does not contain a 'condition' that requires one or both plaintiffs to reside at 769 Viewmont Avenue, Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\" (ECF No. 31 \u00b6 3.) Instead, Plaintiffs explain that the \"residence premises\" provision is simply a definition that does \"not constitute [a] policy condition[ ].\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Plaintiffs deny that this coverage decision was correct, but do not dispute that Defendant denied coverage and that the reason Defendant gave for denying coverage was that neither Plaintiff resided at the Subject Property.

These provisions have no relevance to the issue at hand, as the question of whether the Policy conditions coverage on residency can clearly be resolved by reference to the plain language of the Property Coverages Section of the Policy and the cases cited\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Furthermore, any reliance on the payment for the August 2015 Loss under the Policy would not have been reasonable, given that the Partial Declination of Coverage letter sent to Plaintiffs in relation to the August 2015 Loss explicitly stated that \"[i]t is possible that there are additional reasons why coverage would not apply.\" (ECF No. 31-2 at 28.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
