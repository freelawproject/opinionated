Plaintiff Pauma Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of the Pauma &amp; Yuima Reservation (\"Pauma\" or \"Tribe\") is a federally-recognized tribe that operates Casino Pauma on its reservation in Northern San Diego County. \"About 2,900 customers visit Casino Pauma each day,\" and the Casino \"employs 462 employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Pauma v. N.L.R.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n    888 F.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (9th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, Defendant UNITE HERE International Union (\"Union\"), which represents service and manufacturing employees, began an organizing drive at Casino Pauma. The Tribe claims this organizing effort involved a series of \"antics,\" including the Union inviting\n   <em>\n    The San Diego Union Tribune\n   </em>\n   to a \"staged rally.\" (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 151-54, 45:26, ECF No. 33.) There, the Tribe highlights that a casino employee allegedly spoke \"exclusively through a translator\" and \"explained that she was 'a cook in the casino's pizza restaurant' who had a '$16 hourly salary,' but nevertheless struggled to pay\n   '$260 a month for health insurance for her family' of undisclosed size.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As another tactic, Pauma alleges the Union \"went berserk,\" filing a flurry of unfair labor practice charges against Casino Pauma with the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\"). (SAC \u00b6 5.) Pauma claims that \"the one thing that all of these charges have in common is that they seek to turn Casino Pauma into a soapbox for the Union, whereby sympathetic employees can communicate the Union's message\n   <em>\n    directly to customers\n   </em>\n   in any 'guest area' of the gaming facility or associated property-whether that is within a shuttle bus, across a restaurant table, inside a family changing room, or underneath a bathroom stall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ultimately, however, the Union's charges led to the General Counsel of the NLRB filing several administrative complaints against Casino Pauma for unfair labor practices.\n   <em>\n    Pauma v. N.L.R.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n    888 F.3d at 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The General Counsel's allegations included that Casino Pauma had \"interfere[ed] with the distribution of union literature by employees near the public entrance to [the] casino,\" \"threaten[ed] employees with discipline for distributing union literature at that location,\" and \"interrogat[ed] an employee about her union activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1071 n.1.

No. 60 (Dec. 3, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Then, during the pendency of this action, the Tribe and the Union continued their dispute in the Court of Appeals. The NLRB filed a petition for enforcement of its order against Casino Pauma in the Ninth Circuit, the Tribe filed a separate petition for review, and the Union intervened in opposition to Pauma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pauma v. N.L.R.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n    888 F.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit rejected the Tribe's challenges and granted the NLRB's petition for enforcement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n    at 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Ninth Circuit upheld the NLRB's \"determination that tribe-owned casinos can be NLRA-covered employers,\" and the court concluded \"the NLRA governs the relationship between Casino Pauma and its employees.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516632\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1066/#p1070\">\n    at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the offshoot before this Court, Pauma alleges that by filing the series of unfair labor practice charges directly with the NLRB, the Union has skirted a binding dispute resolution process. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 5, 150-64.) This dispute resolution process is found in a tribal labor ordinance that the State required Pauma to enact to engage in casino-style gaming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2 &amp; n.1.) The Tribe requests that this Court rein in the Union by ordering it to comply with the dispute resolution process and pay Pauma \"the costs involved in litigating\" the labor charges filed with the NLRB. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prayer \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) The Union, on the other hand, argues this ancillary labor dispute is an \"improper collateral attack on NLRB proceedings,\" an effort \"to circumvent Ninth Circuit review\" of the NLRB's order discussed above, and the product of \"procedural gamesmanship.\" (ECF No. 34-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It appears the reason the Tribe and the Union's dispute has spilled over into this Court, however, is because the Tribe is also suing two other defendants-the State of California and Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. (collectively, \"State\"). Pauma tries to pull the State into the fray by alleging the State has failed to take \"reasonable efforts to ensure\" the Union would comply with the dispute resolution process, including by failing to \"direct[ ] [the Union] to first file any such unfair labor practice claims through\" that process, as opposed to proceeding directly before the\n   NLRB. (SAC \u00b6 285.) The State moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing Pauma fails to demonstrate a justiciable controversy between these two parties. (State's Mot., ECF No. 36-1.) The Union similarly moves to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. (Union's Mot., ECF No. 34-1.) Pauma opposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opp'n to State's Mot., ECF No. 38; Opp'n to Union's Mot., ECF No. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pauma's detailed pleading interweaves a retelling of the history of tribal-state compacting in California, exposition on the NLRB's jurisdictional jurisprudence, and colorful criticisms of the Union's efforts to organize workers at Casino Pauma. But the Court is unconvinced by Pauma's attempt to construct a justiciable controversy against the State to invoke federal jurisdiction. At most, Pauma's factual allegations demonstrate the State has declined to participate in the Tribe's labor dispute, has taken \"no official position on the matter,\" and has rejected Pauma's request to voluntarily agree \"to be bound by a judgment issued by the Court in this case.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 168, 171.) These allegations do not reveal an actual controversy between Pauma and the State. And the Court discerns no independent basis to exercise jurisdiction over the Tribe's remaining declaratory relief and breach of contract claims against the Union. Consequently, for the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the State's and the Union's motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As will be seen, Pauma claims this case turns on a model tribal ordinance that is an addendum to a tribal-state gaming compact. Pauma and the State of California entered into this gaming compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202701\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 21.

In 2000, Pauma sought to improve its members' circumstances by opening a tribal gaming facility. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 111-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) To do so, the Tribe entered into a tribal-state gaming compact with the State of California under IGRA. (Tribal-State Compact Between the State of California and the Pauma Band of Mission Indians (\"Pauma Compact\"), SAC Ex. 1, ECF No. 33-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The terms of the Pauma Compact are not unique. In 1999, the State of California and numerous tribes negotiated a form compact-the \"1999 Compact.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyote Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d at 1101-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (detailing the course of negotiations). Pauma's agreement is an executed version of the 1999 Compact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 68-85, 114.) When the State and various tribes were negotiating the 1999 Compact, a point of contention was the collective bargaining rights of employees at tribal gaming facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-76.) The Union opposed the approval of any gaming compacts that did not include desired protections for workers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) The State's negotiator believed the issue of collective bargaining rights could be \"work[ed] out directly with the Union.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) However, the initial discussions between the negotiating tribes and the Union \"were unfruitful\" because of the Union's efforts to invalidate a voter initiative concerning tribal gaming. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the negotiation deadline for the 1999 Compact neared, the State presented the tribes with its \"final compact offer.\" (SAC \u00b6 74.) \"Since the tribes had been unable to agree upon labor relations provisions with the Union,\" the State's offer included a provision requiring the tribes to provide an \"agreement or other procedure acceptable to the State for addressing organizational and representational rights of Class III Gaming Employees and other employees associated with the Tribe's Class III gaming enterprise.\" (SAC \u00b6 75;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pauma Compact \u00a7 10.4.) If the tribes failed to do so by a set deadline, the 1999 Compact provided the agreement would be rendered null and void. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pauma Compact \u00a7 10.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Fifty-seven tribes participating in the negotiations signed letters of intent to execute the compacts ... in accordance with the State's request.\" (SAC \u00b6 76.) \"With that, the signatory tribes continued to negotiate collective bargaining rights for casino employees with the Union,\" with the aim of reaching an agreement by the 1999 Compact's deadline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Model Tribal Labor Relations Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The result of the tribes and union representatives' efforts is the Model Tribal Labor Relations Ordinance dated September 14, 1999 (\"Tribal Labor Ordinance\" or \"Ordinance\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (SAC \u00b6 78;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tribal Labor Ordinance, Attachment to Pauma Compact Add. B, SAC Ex. 1 at 1-50.) The Tribal Labor Ordinance provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Eligible Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, to join, or assist employee organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Tribal Labor Ordinance \u00a7 4.) Further, the Ordinance defines unfair labor practices for the tribe and labor organizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5-6.) It also provides for alternative dispute resolution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.) Specifically, the Ordinance states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   All issues shall be resolved exclusively through the binding dispute resolution mechanisms herein, with the exception of a collective bargaining negotiation impasse, which shall only go through the first level of binding dispute resolution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13(a).) If the informal portion of the dispute resolution process is unsuccessful, the tribe and the labor organization are to submit their dispute to arbitration before a mutually agreed upon arbitrator or several arbitrators from a ten-member \"Tribal Labor Panel\" created under the Tribal Labor Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13(c)(1).) Other topics addressed by the Ordinance include procedures for union elections, access to eligible employees, and decertification of certified unions.

Pauma's Adoption of the Tribal Labor Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pauma was not one of the tribes that participated in the negotiation of the 1999 Compact and the Tribal Labor Ordinance. (SAC \u00b6 115.) Consequently, when Pauma entered into the Pauma Compact in 2000, the Tribe did so via executing a form version of the 1999 Compact \"through a simple exchange of letters with the Office of the Governor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.) Addendum B to the Pauma Compact states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In compliance with Section 10.7 of the Compact, the Tribe agrees to adopt an ordinance identical to the Model Tribal Labor Relations Ordinance attached hereto, and to notify the State of that adoption no later than May 5, 2000. If such notice has not been received by the State by May 5, 2000, this Compact shall be null and void. Failure of the Tribe to maintain the Ordinance in effect during the term of this Compact shall constitute a material breach entitling the State to terminate this Compact. No amendment of the Ordinance shall be effective unless approved by the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (SAC Ex. 1 at 1-49.) Both the State and Pauma executed Addendum B to the Pauma Compact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Pauma provided notice to the State that on April 27, 2000, the Tribe \"adopted the Tribal Labor Relations Ordinance pursuant to Section 10.7 of the\" Pauma Compact-satisfying the condition mentioned in Addendum B above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-51.) Although the Union allegedly negotiated the content of the Tribal Labor Ordinance with other tribes, the Union is not a signatory to the Pauma Compact or its Addendum B containing the Model Tribal Labor Relations Ordinance to be enacted as tribal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-41, 1-49.) Rather, the tribal-state gaming compact was \"entered into on a government-to-government basis by and between\" Pauma and the State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, having entered into the Pauma Compact to satisfy IGRA's requirements to conduct Class III gaming activities, Pauma opened a gaming facility on its reservation in Pauma Valley the following year. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Labor Dispute at Casino Pauma\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Over a decade later, the Union engaged in the aforementioned effort to unionize\n   workers at Casino Pauma. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 144-56.) As part of its efforts, the Union allegedly sought to allow Casino Pauma workers to use \"card check election procedures\" to decide whether to make the Union their representative. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 134, 145, 150-51.) Pauma, however, informed the Union \"that any representational effort would have to take place\" according to \"secret ballot election\" procedures contained in the Tribal Labor Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Then, on May 25, 2012, a Union director invoked the dispute resolution process under the Tribal Labor Ordinance, and the Union later proceeded to seek appointment of an arbitrator, but the Union subsequently withdrew its request for arbitration under Pauma's Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Tribe claims the Union then \"went berserk, filing\n   <em>\n    nine\n   </em>\n   unfair labor practice charges against Pauma directly with the NLRB.\" (SAC \u00b6 5.) In doing so, Pauma alleges the Union \"abandoned the 'binding dispute resolution mechanism' \" contained in the Tribal Labor Ordinance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) And, because the Union has opted to pursue its unfair labor charges against Pauma with the NLRB instead of the dispute resolution process, Pauma claims it has incurred \"at least $400,000\" in legal fees and expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 162.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Pauma's Attempt to Involve the State\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In September 2016, Pauma's counsel sent a letter to the State of California regarding \"the Union's non-compliance with\" the Tribal Labor Ordinance. (SAC \u00b6 167.) In a subsequent meeting at the State Capitol, Pauma's counsel \"requested the State's assistance in holding the Union to the terms of the [Tribal Labor Ordinance] or otherwise devising a fix for the solution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) \"In response, the Office of the Governor's Senior Advisor for Tribal Negotiations Joginder Dhillon explained that the State did not have an official position on the matter and thus would not get involved at the time, though he would communicate possible solutions should he think of any.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Pauma's Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Pauma filed this action on October 27, 2016, against the State and the Union. In its initial Complaint, the only claim Pauma pled against the State was for declaratory relief. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 148-54, ECF No. 1.) The Tribe alleged an actual controversy exists regarding the Tribal Labor Ordinance because Pauma is \"arguing for the dispute resolution procedure in the\" Ordinance, the Union is arguing for \"the NLRA,\" and the State is purportedly \"feigning indifference despite demanding that the signatory tribes agree to the [Tribal Labor Ordinance] in the first place.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In Pauma's Second Amended Complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pauma supplements its pleading with allegations arising from a meet-and-confer meeting required by this Court's Standing Order for Civil Cases. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 170-73.) Under this Court's Standing Order, \"[a]ny party contemplating the filing of any noticed motion before this Court must first contact opposing counsel to discuss thoroughly-preferably in person-the substance of the contemplated motion and any potential resolution.\" During such a conference, Pauma alleges \"counsel for the State questioned the Court's jurisdiction,\" including by explaining the State's\n   \"perception that Pauma's suit was really one against the Union, which meant that the State should not be a party to the suit especially since Pauma had not alleged a breach of compact claim against the State.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171.) \"Nevertheless, in an attempt to eliminate the need for the State's motion to dismiss, counsel for Pauma agreed to dismiss the State [ ] from the suit if [it] stipulated to be bound by the order issued by the Court on the declaratory relief claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The State declined to \"enter into such an agreement in order to secure [its] dismissal from the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on this conduct, Pauma alleges the State breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the Pauma Compact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 280-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, Pauma joins the Union in its declaratory relief claim. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 187-94.) Pauma also pleads a series of claims alleging the Union has purportedly breached the Pauma Compact by not adhering to the dispute resolution process in the Tribal Labor Ordinance that was enacted by Pauma and appended to the Pauma Compact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 195-279.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The State now moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss Pauma's claims against it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (State's Mot. 1:2-25, 5:21-11:6, ECF No. 36.) The Union similarly moves to dismiss Pauma's claims involving the Union.

The\n   crux of the Tribe's action is that the Union is not abiding by the Tribal Labor Ordinance's alternative dispute mechanism. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4-8.) The Union has instead allegedly circumvented the Ordinance by repeatedly filing unfair labor practice charges \"directly with the NLRB.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 185, 192, 199, 206, 213, 220, 227, 234, 241, 248, 255, 263.) Accepting the Tribe's allegations as true, it is clear that there is a dispute between the Tribe and the Union over the enforceability of the Ordinance's alternative dispute mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The same cannot be said with respect to the State. At the threshold, the State is absent from Pauma's description of the actual controversy in its pleading:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   This action presents an actual and live controversy as to whether the [Ordinance] obligates the Union to resolve any work related disputes - including unfair labor practice charges - through the binding dispute resolution process set forth within the ordinance rather than the administrative courts of the NLRB, and whether Pauma has and will continue to sustain damages as a result of the Union's refusal to abide by the terms of an agreement that it negotiated and accepted. The district court has the power to remedy this dispute in accordance with the Prayer for Relief, infra.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (SAC \u00b6 13.) Further, in considering the remainder of the Tribe's pleading, Pauma does not allege facts demonstrating the State has taken an adverse position against the Tribe with respect to the Tribal Labor Ordinance. Rather, Pauma alleges that after the Tribe sent a letter to the State and met with it in the State Capitol, the State informed the Tribe that \"the State did not have an official position on the matter and thus would not get involved at the time.\" (SAC \u00b6 168;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 269.) That is the only concrete factual allegation regarding the State's conduct prior to the filing of this action. There is no allegation that the State controls the Union or has aided the Union in filing unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB. There is similarly no allegation that the State has taken any action whatsoever against Pauma regarding the Ordinance during the Tribe's ongoing dispute with the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court recognizes that a model of the Tribal Labor Ordinance is incorporated into Pauma's Compact with the State. Under Section 10.4 and Addendum B of the Pauma Compact, the Tribe was required to adopt the Tribal Labor Ordinance. It did. If Pauma fails to \"maintain the Ordinance in effect during the term of [the] Compact,\" the State has the power to terminate the Compact on account of the Tribe's \"material breach.\" But, again, there is no claim or evidence that the State has threatened to terminate the Compact or otherwise taken an adverse action against the Tribe. The gravamen of Pauma's pleading is that the Union-not Pauma-has failed to adhere to the Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Pauma attempts to demonstrate an actual controversy in its opposition, but the Court is unconvinced. The Tribe leans on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   , arguing that Pauma \"is in the same position as the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   , as both are 'coerced' contracting parties who file suit to determine their rights after being faced with the pre-suit predicament of abandoning said rights or risking prosecution.\" (Opp'n to State's Mot. 6:11-14.) Yet, an examination of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   bolsters this Court's conclusion-not Pauma's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner and respondent entered into a patent license agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p126\">\n    549 U.S. at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p126\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the similarities end there. Pauma does not allege the State has taken action to enforce the Compact against the Tribe or committed conduct that the Tribe views \"to be a clear threat to\" do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p126\">\n    549 U.S. at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p126\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pauma's theory is that\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   is analogous because the Tribe claims it risked prosecution if it did not \"comply with the NLRB's procedures and orders\" after the Union chose to allegedly abandon the Tribal Ordinance's dispute resolution mechanism. (Opp'n to State's Mot. 6:25-28.) \"Given the contempt powers of the NLRB,\" Pauma contends it-like the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   \"had to bring suit to ameliorate a big and quickly devolving quandary created by the Union's coercive actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7:5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Tribe's comparison does not survive scrutiny. Pauma claims it is threatened by the contempt powers of the NLRB, but Pauma is not suing the NLRB. It is suing the State of California. These arguments do not support that \"there is a substantial controversy ... of sufficient immediacy and reality\" between Pauma and the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p126\">\n    549 U.S. at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p126\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the Court is unpersuaded by Pauma's attempt to analogize this case to\n   <em>\n    MedImmune\n   </em>\n   's circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Tribe also attempts to use the State's opinion that there is no actual controversy to create one. Pauma argues the State's \"impassioned defense of this suit shows\" the State \"is heavily invested in the outcome of this case and acting in concert with the Union.\" (Opp'n to State's Mot. 4:15-18.) The Court disagrees. The State has filed a motion to dismiss arguing first and foremost that there is no case or controversy between it and the Tribe. The State's belief that there is no controversy does not create one. In sum, Pauma's factual allegations fail to show a justiciable controversy to support the Tribe's declaratory relief claim against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Given that there are insufficient factual allegations to demonstrate a justiciable declaratory relief claim, the Court inevitably reaches the same conclusion for Pauma's nebulous claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In support of this claim, Pauma seeks to use a court-mandated meet-and-confer session to inject an actual controversy into this lawsuit. As mentioned, Pauma alleges that after it filed its initial Complaint, the parties participated in a\n   meet-and-confer session required by this Court's Standing Order for Civil Cases to discuss an anticipated motion to dismiss by the State. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 170-73.) There, \"counsel for the State questioned the Court's jurisdiction\" and \"explained its perception that Pauma's suit was really one against the Union, which meant the State should not be a party to the suit especially since Pauma had not alleged a breach of compact claim against the State.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171.) Pauma's counsel then \"agreed to dismiss the State [ ] from the suit if [it] stipulated to be bound by the order issued by the Court on the declaratory relief claim,\" but the State declined \"to enter into such an agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Pauma uses this meet-and-confer meeting in its Second Amended Complaint to try to stitch together a justiciable controversy by adding a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the Pauma Compact. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 280-86.) Pauma claims the State's (i) lack of an official position on the Tribe's dispute with the Union, (ii) unwillingness to voluntarily participate in this lawsuit, and (iii) decision to decline Pauma's dismissal offer demonstrates the State has breached Pauma's \"reasonable expectations\" under the Pauma Compact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 284.) Pauma also claims the State has failed \"to take reasonable efforts to ensure that its privy in interest the Union would comply with the [Tribal Labor Ordinance], even if that simply meant directing it to first file any such unfair labor practice claims through the procedure in the [Tribal Labor Ordinance] while the declaratory relief claim in this matter was being adjudicated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 285.) Yet, again, there is no allegation that the State has aided the Union or that the State has the power to \"direct[ ]\" the Union to do anything. This effort to use a court-mandated meet-and-confer session to transmute an inchoate declaratory relief claim into a justiciable breach of contract claim is not convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Regardless of the legal theory employed, when the Court examines the factual allegations in Pauma's pleading regarding Pauma and the State, the Court does not discern an actual case or controversy between these parties. Pauma has the burden of demonstrating subject matter jurisdiction, which includes a justiciable controversy, but it does not meet this burden. Consequently, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the State's motion to dismiss Pauma's action against it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Union's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Having dismissed Pauma's claims against the State for lack of jurisdiction, the Court considers whether it has jurisdiction over Pauma's remaining claims against the Union. Aside from seeking comparable declaratory relief, Pauma is suing the Union for breach of the Tribal Labor Ordinance, with the Tribe characterizing its claims as being for breach of the Pauma Compact. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 195-279.) In its own motion to dismiss, the Union argues that there is no independent basis to exercise jurisdiction over Pauma's claims against the Union. (Union's Mot. 6:14-9:5.) Relatedly, the Union argues that if the Court dismisses the Tribe's claims against the State for lack of jurisdiction, there is no basis to invoke supplemental jurisdiction over the Tribe's remaining claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12:3-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court agrees that there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over Pauma's claims against the Union. In making this determination, the Court recognizes the potential obstacles to Pauma bringing \"breach of compact\" claims against the Union. For example, the Union is not a signatory to the Pauma Compact or the agreement's Addendum B that attaches the Tribal Labor Ordinance to be adopted by Pauma.

Finally, the plain language of the Pauma Compact requires the Tribe to adopt and maintain the Tribal Labor Ordinance as tribal law to address \"organizational and representational rights of Class III gaming Employees.\" (Pauma Compact \u00a7 10.7, Add.
