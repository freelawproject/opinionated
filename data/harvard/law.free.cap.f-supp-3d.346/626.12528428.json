( '828 patent, cols. 53:25-60, 54:37-56) Likewise, the Abstract begins by stating that \"[a] social networking system, method and device provides a social network environment in which one user subscribes to a newsfeed or ticker related to another user.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Abstract) Indeed, even Plaintiff describes its invention in the '828 patent as reciting \"online social networks which allow users to subscribe to news items posted by users with whom they are associated [and] the use of real-time news feeds and tickers for presenting such news items.\" (D.I. 15 at 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 18 at 6 n.4) Facebook is correct that dependent claims 12, 13, 14, and 19 are directed to the same abstract idea as the independent claims; simply enumerating different types of groups (claims 12 and 19), requiring confirmation that the first user account is affiliated with the group (claim 13), and reciting that the first real-time news item further comprises \"first content\" from the \"first user account\" (claim 19) do not make a material difference. ( '828 patent, cols. 53:61-54:12, 54:57-61) Dependent claim 20 recites additional limitations directed to \"generating revenue\" from providing an advertisement, collecting and selling information about users and user activities, processing a first user-to-user payment, or processing a first user-to-user sale.

Step One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   At step one, Defendants argue that the asserted claims of the '176 patent are directed to the abstract idea of promoting a news item based on its popularity. (D.I. 9 at 12) In response, Plaintiff does not suggest that the claims are directed to a different concept. Indeed, Plaintiff describes the claims of the '176 patent as \"provid[ing] real-time newsfeeds or tickers in which the status of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     news items are promoted based on their measure of popularity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   computed based on approvals of such items and displayed in indicia on a computer display.\" (D.I. 15 at 4) (emphasis added) Plaintiff's argument for why the claims of the '176 patent are not directed to an abstract idea is, instead, that the claims purportedly solve the technical problem of \"information overload\" - which \"causes the most relevant information to particular users to get lost\" - \"with specific novel implementations of the solution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants that promoting information based on its popularity is an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314980\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/709/#p715\">\n    772 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '176 patent, col. 54:1-28; 55:13-37) The Court agrees with Facebook that the \"character as a whole\" of these claims is directed to the abstract idea of promoting information based on popularity. Here again, as described above in the Court's discussion of the '828 patent, information overload is not a problem newly-arisen with the advent of the internet, but instead is one \"as old as human commerce itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Telebuyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204493045\">\n    2015 WL 4493045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12. The alleged solution to this problem claimed in the '176 patent simply uses conventional computer hardware and software. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '176 patent, cols. 5:65-6:8) As described above, news tickers have long been known as a vehicle for providing news, and there is nothing specialized about a computer network analyzing and publishing information, including information that is tailored for a particular user, or processing URLs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204493045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , cols. 5:65-6:12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In sum, the claims, when considered in conjunction with Plaintiffs proposed claim constructions, merely add conventional computer components to the known concept of the promotion of information based on its popularity. The '176 patent claims are directed to an abstract idea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Step Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   At Step two, there is just enough in the record that, when considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, indicates that these claims may contain an inventive concept. At this stage of the proceedings, the Court cannot say that the ordered combination of the claims - in describing measuring the popularity of information based on feedback from users to promote the status of such news items in a real-time newsfeed or ticker and displaying to users such popularity - does not amount to a non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Unlike the asserted claims of the '828 patent, which generically and without detail claim the use of a real-time news ticker in a social network environment, the claims of the '176 patent provide more details about how it is that the real-time news ticker will display information. That is, users will provide feedback on information submitted by other users of the claimed system through, for example, voting on such information (claim 6), liking submissions (claim 14), and voting on a URL and a word (claim 21), with the results dictating the publication of the information via the real-time newsfeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants argue that the claims of the '176 patent fail to \"recite [a] specific or discrete implementation\" of the abstract concept of promoting news items based on popularity. (D.I. 9 at 18) But this seems to ignore the fact that the claims require the promotion of news items based on their popularity as voted on by users of the system vis-\u00e0-vis a real-time news ticker component. The Federal Circuit has explained that \"a new combination of old steps is patentable, as is a new process using an old machine or composition,\" such that \"subject matter eligibility must exist even if it was obvious to use the old steps with the new machine or composition.\"\n   <em>\n    Ultramercial, Inc. v.

( '176 patent, col. 4:60-65) This method failed to capture\n   the difference between a positive and negative reference, so \"[w]hat is needed ... is a ranking methodology based upon the actual opinions of the user community rather than upon hit-or-miss surrogates for these opinions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 5:4-6) Later, the specification discusses in more detail how the invention improves over the prior art relevancy ranking methodology by creating a database of word votes (which is a pairing of a word and a URL), which is then populated over time through user input and is searchable to provide the most relevant documents pertaining to the term or terms searched. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , col. 40:13-35) Claim 21, for example, appears to recite an application of this concept, and includes additional details as to how information is promoted based on popularity.

Indeed, aside from the references to \"social network\" in the '828 patent's title and Abstract, the term and its variations do not appear again until the recitation of the claims. A \"ticker\" is only briefly discussed in the specification, and is described as an \"optional feature\" that can be added on to a toolbar to which a \"user[ ] can subscribe so as to be presented with scrolling headlines that are provided by a chosen source.\" ('828 patent, col. 30:59-62;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1128\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , col. 7:16-18) The specification earlier acknowledges that internet toolbars \"whereby features are included in or added to a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, are known.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , col. 5:40-43) The asserted claims do not recite a toolbar (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    D.I. 9 at 4), and there is no reference to a toolbar in Plaintiff's construction for \"real-time [news] ticker\" (D.I. 15 at 10).
