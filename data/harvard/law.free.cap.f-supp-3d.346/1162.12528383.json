For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion to Reconsider (ECF No. 110) is denied, and Plaintiffs' Motion to Reconsider (ECF No. 112) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Five police officers brought this action against Sun-Times Media, LLC (\"Sun-Times\"), a Chicago newspaper, for obtaining personal information about them from state motor vehicle records and publishing that information in its coverage of a politically-charged homicide investigation. In April 2004, David Koschman died after an altercation with R.J. Vanecko, nephew to Richard M. Daley, then-Mayor of Chicago. The subsequent Chicago Police Department (\"CPD\") investigation resulted in no charges against Vanecko because no eyewitness positively identified him. Not relevant to this case, but certainly noteworthy, is that after the CPD failed to bring charges, a special prosecutor was appointed to investigate Koschman's death. The investigation led to Vanecko's indictment and charge of a single count of involuntary manslaughter. Vanecko pled guilty in January 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Sun-Times published a series of investigative reports criticizing the CPD's investigation and failure to bring charges against Vanecko. One article in the series is at the center of this case. On November 21, 2011, the Sun-Times published an article titled, \"Daley Nephew Biggest Guy on Scene, But Not in Lineup,\" which described how the lineup contained only men who closely resembled Vanecko. The Sun-Times accused the CPD of manipulating\n   the lineup to lead to misidentification and thus stop charges from being filed. The article included two lineup photos: the first lineup comprising fillers-Plaintiffs-and the second lineup comprising Vanecko's friends present at the scene of the crime. Alongside the photos, the Sun-Times published a graphic that identified Plaintiffs in the first lineup by name and birthdate, as well as by height, weight, hair color, and eye color (collectively \"the Information\"). Plaintiffs allege that the Sun-Times violated the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (\"DPPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202721\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by (1) obtaining personal information from their motor vehicle records and (2) disclosing that information to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Sun-Times moved to dismiss that claim, arguing that the DPPA does not prohibit the type of information disclosed by the Sun-Times and that even if it did, the DPPA's prohibitions as applied violated the First Amendment. The Court denied the Sun-Times' Motion to Dismiss but granted an interlocutory appeal to the Seventh Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Dahlstrom v. Sun-Times Media, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342621\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/39/998/\">\n    39 F.Supp.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. 2014). The Seventh Circuit affirmed this Court's ruling, holding that: (1) the Information constituted \"personal information\" under the DPPA; (2) the DPPA's prohibition on obtaining personal information did not warrant heightened First Amendment scrutiny, and, as such, was rationally related to the government's legitimate interest; and (3) the DPPA's prohibition on disclosing personal information was content-neutral, and passed muster under intermediate scrutiny by furthering important government interests unrelated to suppression of free expression and not restricting more speech than was necessary to further those interests.\n   <em>\n    Dahlstrom v. Sun-Times Media, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n    777 F.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2015). In other words, the DPPA, as applied, did not violate the First Amendment in prohibiting the Sun-Times from either obtaining the officers' personal information from motor vehicle records or subsequently disclosing that information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After remand, the Sun-Times filed its Answer to the Complaint, pleading nine affirmative defenses. Plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings and to strike the affirmative defenses. The Court granted Plaintiffs judgment on the pleadings as to the disclosure claim, but denied it as to the obtainment claim, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Sun-Times' best argument is that at the time it obtained the Plaintiffs' personal information it did not have the line-up photographs to compare the fillers with Vanecko. It appears that the Seventh Circuit may well in fact recognize a \"balancing\" test so that under certain circumstances the press would be allowed to obtain personal information while investigating a matter of public significance and the invasion of privacy was not particularly great. Recall that there are two separate acts here that arguably violate the DPPA. First, obtaining the information, and, second, its publication. Although the record is silent as to the date the Sun-Times obtained the personal information from the Secretary of State, the implication from the pleadings is that it did not have access to the line-up photos at the time it obtained the personal information. Thus a balancing could arguably come out in favor of the Sun-Times for the act of obtaining the personal information. However, at the time of its publication, the Sun-Times did have the photographs so that the personal information at the time of publication was, as the Seventh Circuit found, \"largely cumulative.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Dahlstrom v.

The Parties' Motions to Reconsider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs' and the Sun-Times' arguments for their respective Motions to Reconsider substantially overlap and so will be addressed together. As already described, the Court granted Plaintiffs judgment on their disclosure claim, but not on their obtainment claim. Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to judgment on both, however, and that this Court erred by applying a higher scrutiny balancing test-as opposed to a rational basis test-to the obtainment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct. The Seventh Circuit applied the balancing test to the disclosure claim because of the First Amendment implications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dahlstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n    777 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   949 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki v.

But the Seventh Circuit distinguished the First Amendment concerns at play with disclosure from those at play with obtainment stating, \"the First Amendment does not guarantee the press a constitutional right of special access to information not available to the public generally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 946 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pell v.

Thus, the Seventh Circuit ruled that because Plaintiff's obtainment claim constituted \"a limitation only on access to information,\" it should be judged by the rational basis standard and does not require a heightened scrutiny balancing test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519385\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/817/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519385\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/817/#p833\">\n    at 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court's earlier ruling failed to trace that distinction. The Court's earlier reasoning applied the balancing test applicable to the disclosure claim to the obtainment claim as well, even though the First Amendment implications are not present in the latter. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs' Motion is well taken. Whether the Sun-Times obtained Plaintiffs' personal information before or after the Sun-Times received the photographs is irrelevant to the obtainment claim because heightened scrutiny does not apply. The appropriate standard is rational basis, which requires that the law bear \"a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Educ.

In other words, the DPPA reflects the government's legitimate interest in public safety, and such interest is rationally related to the DPPA's prohibition on obtaining personal information from driving records. By applying the correct level of scrutiny, the Court finds that its prior determination on the obtainment claim was misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the Court's acknowledgment that it erred on the obtainment claim analysis does not necessarily get Plaintiffs over the finish line. The Sun-Times raises several arguments against judgment on the pleadings for Plaintiffs which fall into three categories: (1) the Sun-Times' reliance on the Illinois Secretary of State's (\"Secretary\") authorization to disclose the Information; (2) the Supreme Court's recent decisions in\n   <em>\n    Packingham v.

Natural Resources Defense Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) ; (3) in the alternative, the Sun-Times was entitled to rely on the Secretary's implied representation of the lawfulness of disclosing the Information; and (4) the Sun-Times could not have \"knowingly\" violated the DPPA because it relied on the Secretary's authorization of the Information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning to the first argument, the Sun-Times offers the declaration of Donna Leonard, the executive counsel of the Illinois Secretary of State, which asserts that the Secretary disclosed the Information to the Sun-Times based on the Secretary's policy that the Information was not \"personal information\" under the DPPA. The Sun-Times argues that it cannot be held liable where it relied on the Secretary's determination that the Information was not covered under the DPPA. However, the DPPA says otherwise. The Secretary might have violated Section 2721(a) -which prohibits the Secretary from \"knowingly disclos[ing]\" personal information-but its violation does not immunize the Sun-Times from liability under Section 2722(a)-which prohibits any person from knowingly obtaining or disclosing personal information from a motor vehicle record for any non-permitted use. Put simply, an initial violation by one party does not negate subsequent violations by another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dahlstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n    777 F.3d at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that here, \"there is no intervening illegal actor: [the] Sun-Times itself unlawfully sought and acquired the Officers' personal information from the Secretary ... and proceeded to publish it\").

First, the Sun-Times offers the depositions of Tim Novak and Chris Fusco-two of its own reporters-who assert that the Information was necessary to contrast two lineup photos: the lineup with fillers and another with Vanecko's friends present during the night of Koschman's death. The Sun-Times argues that these depositions demonstrate that publishing the Information was a far greater matter of public significance than the Seventh Circuit concluded. Second, the Sun-Times asserts that Plaintiffs' depositions reveal that none of the officers admit to privacy concerns related to the publication or disclosure of the Information. The Sun-Times argues that these officers' depositions thus diminish the government's alleged interests in the balance. In sum, the Sun-Times contends that the proffered discoveries now tip the balance of interests in its favor. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Sun-Times fails to proffer any arguments or evidence that controverts the Seventh Circuit's balancing of the interests at issue. As the Seventh Circuit elaborated in detail:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Although the Sun-Times article relates to a matter of public significance - the allegation that the [CPD] manipulated a homicide investigation - the specific details\n   at issue are largely cumulative of lawfully obtained information published in that very same article, and are therefore of less pressing public concern than the threats of physical violence in\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki\n   </em>\n   . While Sun-Times provided details of the Officers' physical traits to highlight the resemblance between the \"fillers\" and Vanecko, most of the article's editorial force was achieved through publication of the lineup photographs that Sun-Times obtained through its FOIA request - the value added by the inclusion of the Officers' personal information was negligible. Each Officers' height is evidence from the lineup photographs, while their weights and ages are relevant only to the extent that they increase the Officers' resemblance to Vanecko - a resemblance that the photographs independently convey. And, although identifying the Officers' hair and eye colors may add some detail to the published black-and-white photographs, their personal information is largely redundant of what the public could easily observe from the photographs themselves. Therefore, Sun-Times's publication of the Officers' personal details both intruded on their privacy and threatened their safety, while doing little to advance Sun-Times's reporting on a story of public concern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Dahlstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n    777 F.3d at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sun-Times argues that the Seventh Circuit failed to consider that the Information was published to compare the first lineup with a second. On this score, the Court notes that the second lineup photo with Vanecko's friends fails to include the type of information provided with the first lineup and at issue in this case (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , birthdate, height, weight, hair color, and eye color). Regardless, the Court fails to see how the Sun-Times' proffered evidence changes the Seventh Circuit's analysis. With or without the Information, the Sun-Times' readers may infer similar findings from viewing the two lineup photos side-by-side: (1) that the \"fillers\" very much resembled Vanecko in physical appearance in the first lineup photo, and (2) the second lineup photo, where Vanecko and his friends are sitting down, conceals physical disparities in height and weight. The inclusion of the Information, even after considering the second lineup photo, is \"largely cumulative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The fact that the police officers did not admit to any privacy concerns from the publication of the Information is irrelevant. The government's interests in promulgating a law has nothing to do with whether those interests are maintained or realized by those the law happens to protect. Additionally, other interests, such as \"removing an incentive for parties to unlawfully obtain personal information in the first place\" and \"minimizing the harm to individuals whose personal information has been illegally obtained\" counsel in favor of the government, regardless of whether the privacy interests are heeded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984869\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/937/\">\n    at 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court thus concludes that the Seventh Circuit's analysis controls and the Sun-Times has failed to show that there has been a shift of balance in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court finds no basis for reconsideration in light of the newly-produced evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration (ECF No. 112) is granted, and Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration (ECF No. 110) is denied.
