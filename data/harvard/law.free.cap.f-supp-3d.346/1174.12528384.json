[24, \u00b6 15.] ICE Chicago and its agents are responsible for the policies and practices related to the arrest and detention of individuals for prosecution in removal proceedings within that area. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants Elaine Duke, Thomas Homan, and Ricardo Wong are the Acting Secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), Acting Director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), and Director of ICE Chicago, respectively. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.] Defendants Duke and Homan are responsible for, among other things, the policies and practices of ICE related to the arrest and detention of individuals for prosecution in removal proceedings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.] Defendant Wong is responsible for, among other things, the development and implementation of ICE Chicago's policies and practices related to the arrest and detention of individuals for prosecution in removal proceedings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.] Each is sued in his or her official capacity. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Chavez was born in Guatemala in 1984 and entered the United States with his mother as a Lawful Permanent Resident (\"LPR\") in 1991. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.] His mother became a U.S. citizen in 1999 through the naturalization process. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.] Because Chavez was an LPR, 14 years old, and in his mother's legal and physical custody, he became a U.S. citizen by law no later than February 27, 2001. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.] Since Chavez was at all times pertinent to this litigation a U.S. citizen, ICE had no lawful authority to arrest or detain him or subject him to removal proceedings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Rolle was born in Jamaica in October 1970 and entered the United States as a LPR in March 1988. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.] When he entered the United States in March 1988, Rolle's mother was a naturalized U.S. citizen. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.] Because Rolle was an LPR, 17 years old, and in his mother's legal and physical custody, he became a U.S. citizen by law upon his entry. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.] Given that Rolle is a U.S. citizen, ICE has no lawful authority to arrest or detain him or subject him to removal proceedings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that ICE Chicago detains thousands of people each year, often waiting days or weeks before commencing removal proceedings. [24, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 20,47, 49.] Even after the official commencement of proceedings, Defendants allegedly force many detainees to wait in custody for additional weeks before seeing a judge for the first time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 20.] During this period,\n   ICE does not provide the detainee: (1) a sworn, particularized statement of probable cause; (2) a determination of probable cause before a detached and neutral judicial officer; or (3) a hearing before an immigration judge regarding the charges against them, the availability of attorney representation and other rights, and judicial review of their continued custody. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Instead, according to Plaintiffs, ICE Chicago typically serves detainees with an I-200 administrative warrant after they are brought into ICE custody. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.] Such warrants are not reviewed or approved by a detached and neutral judicial officer, nor supported by a sworn, particularized showing of probable cause. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Rather, the warrant purports to be a based on the arresting officer's finding of probable cause. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ex. A.] Plaintiffs allege that these practices and policies are insufficient to meet Defendants' responsibilities under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and violate Plaintiffs' Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that on or around March 9, 2017, ICE Chicago assumed physical custody of Chavez after issuing an immigration detainer to a Kentucky law enforcement agency that previously had held him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.] When the instant lawsuit was filed on March 27, 2017 [1], Chavez had been in ICE custody for 18 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.] While in ICE custody, Chavez received two different Notices to Appear (\"NTA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was mailed an I-200 administrative warrant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.] As of the initiation of this lawsuit, however, ICE Chicago had not filed an NTA against Chavez with the immigration court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ICE Chicago assumed physical custody of Rolle on or around June 28, 2017 [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40], and issued him an NTA the same day, [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.] ICE Chicago never informed Rolle if, or when, it filed the NTA with an immigration court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As of Rolle's intervention in this case on August 21, 2017 [see 20], no immigration court had scheduled a hearing in his case. [24, \u00b6 42.] The Court infers from Plaintiffs' complaint that as of the date of the Court's approval of his intervention on September 5, 2017 [see 23], Rolle remained in custody at ICE Chicago's contract facility, Kenosha County Detention Center in Kenosha, Wisconsin. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Chavez filed the initial complaint in this case seeking to represent himself and a class of similarly situated individuals on March 27, 2017. [See 1.] Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on May 30, 2017. [See 11.] Shortly thereafter, Chavez filed an agreed motion to amend the complaint. [See 14-15.] The Court granted the motion [16], and Chavez filed his First Amended Complaint on June 6, 2017. [See 17.] On August 21, 2017, Rolle moved to intervene. [See 21.] After the parties stipulated to his intervention [see 22], the Court granted the motion on September 5, 2017. [23.] Thus, on September 19, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (the \"Operative Complaint\"). [See 24.] The Operative Complaint brought claims against Defendants for failing to meet their obligations to Plaintiffs under the INA (Count I) and violating Plaintiffs' Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights (Counts II-III). [See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ] Like the initial complaint, the Operative Complaint also sought to represent the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All persons who are detained under the authority of ICE within the Chicago Area of Responsibility, where ICE has not initiated removal proceedings by filing a Notice to Appear with the immigration court and has not initiated another form of removal proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants then filed the instant motion to dismiss, arguing that the Court lacks jurisdiction or, in the alternative, that the Operative Complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted. [See 27, 27-1.] Plaintiffs filed a response [34], two briefs regarding supplemental authority [40, 45], and Defendants have filed a reply [54].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint [24] under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(1) motion seeks dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. If a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the allegations regarding subject matter jurisdiction, the Court accepts all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.

Moreover, the fact that Plaintiff class members could seek relief in a different forum is not part of the analysis.

None of the cases cited by Plaintiffs to support the notion that judicial review is \"essential as a check on both mistake and power\" address probable cause hearings. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Corley v.

Plaintiffs also cite numerous cases for the proposition that notice and the opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner [34, at 27 (collecting cases) ], but nowhere in the operative complaint do they allege facts that suggest why or how the statutorily required procedures set out above are insufficient or how a judicial officer would be superior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the Court finds\n   Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that show there is a high risk that Plaintiffs will be erroneously deprived of liberty without the additional procedural safeguards they seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The third factor-whether ICE would be burdened by additional procedural protections-also weighs against Plaintiffs' claims. As explained above, federal law already requires an examining officer to provide all the items sought by the Plaintiffs-a probable cause hearing, information regarding the charges against them, information about their due process rights, and a bond hearing. Given Congress's broad power over naturalization and immigration,\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174582\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/67/#p79\">\n    426 U.S. at 79-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174582\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/67/#p79\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the fact that statutorily required procedures already provide for the safeguarding of Plaintiffs' rights means that additional procedures would certainly burden ICE. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ali v. Achim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1499392\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/342/769/#p775\">\n    342 F.Supp.2d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 (N.D.

Thus, the third factor weighs heavily against the imposition of additional procedures, especially considering the possible costs. [See 27-1, at 22-23.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The fact that ICE allegedly detained Plaintiffs for 18 and 54 days respectively without filing their cases before an immigration judge raises serious questions about the efficiency of ICE's procedures. Plaintiffs understandably feel that they should have been released, released on bond, or formally charged on a more expeditious basis, and they may well have a point for consideration by Congress and the Executive Branch. Nonetheless, as explained above and in Section III(B)(2), the Supreme Court and other courts repeatedly have held that the political branches have wide latitude to determine what procedures immigration detainees must be afforded. Consequently, based on the allegations currently before the Court, Plaintiffs have not stated a claim that the statutory and regulatory procedures in place violate Plaintiffs' right to procedural due process under the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   due process calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

As Plaintiffs repeatedly assert in their operative complaint, the putative class never entered removal proceedings [24, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 41, 45], rendering \u00a7 1229(b)(1) inapplicable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    While an identical provision now exists at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.41\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , that provision falls under Justice Department regulations, rather than those of the DHS.

Consequently, any such officer would not be protected by qualified immunity.\") Nothing in Plaintiffs' allegations, however, suggests they seek to represent a class of American citizens who have been mistakenly or maliciously detained by ICE with full knowledge of the detainee's citizenship.
