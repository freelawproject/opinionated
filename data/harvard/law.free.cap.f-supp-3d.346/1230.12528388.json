(\"UEH\") bring this antitrust case against defendants Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (\"CBOT\") and Chicago\n   Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (\"CME\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct to block plaintiffs from successfully entering the U.S. Treasury futures and options exchange market. Pending before the Court are: (1) defendants' motion for summary judgment [708]; and (2) plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment [712]. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants defendants' motion [708]. The Court denies plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment [712] as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Chronology\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. CBOT's Launch Of U.S. Treasury Futures And Options Trading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the 1970s, CBOT created and launched what later became its flagship product: futures contracts on U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. Futures and options contracts can be traded in the United States only on an exchange like CBOT that is approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") as a designated contract market. R. 742 \u00b6 1 (Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' L.R. 56.1 Statement of Additional Facts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    2. CBOT-Eurex License Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the 1990s, UEH's parent Eurex Frankfurt AG (\"Eurex\") developed an all-electronic trading exchange in Europe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. CBOT licensed Eurex's electronic trading platform in October 1999, and the parties signed a non-compete to prevent Eurex from, among other things, offering U.S. Treasury futures itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; R. 731 \u00b6 6 (Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' L.R. 56.1 Statement of Facts). The parties entered into a new license agreement in July 2002. R. 731 \u00b6 6. That agreement was set to expire on December 31, 2003, and the non-compete was set to expire on January 30, 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In early January 2003, CBOT notified Eurex that it intended to terminate the license agreement the day it was set to expire (December 31, 2003). R. 742 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Eurex's Plan To Launch USFE As A Competing Exchange\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both CBOT and Eurex made public announcements on January 10, 2003. R. 731\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. CBOT announced that it had entered into a contract to use a different trading platform after December 31, 2003 when its licensing agreement with Eurex expired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. And Eurex announced its intent to launch a U.S. Treasury futures and options exchange, USFE, to compete head-to-head with CBOT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8. The planned launch date for Eurex's competing exchange was February 1, 2004, the earliest date possible under the non-compete agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While planning for its U.S. launch, Eurex created a business case defining the two most likely outcomes as: (1) winning the entire futures market by 2007; or (2) failing and quickly exiting from the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The business case assumed a \"binary outcome\" was most likely because \"the nature of ... the futures business is that [in] any one product, there is a tendency to concentrate the market or liquidity into one market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eurex cited \"the 'network effect' of CBOT's large volume\" as a \"barrier to entry\" into the U.S. Treasury futures market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. In a March 17, 2003 presentation, Eurex assessed the probability of USFE's success at \"10%, however increasing to 50% if achieving mile-stones.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Defendants' executives readily acknowledged the business threat posed by USFE's planned entry into the market, including in light of Eurex's low-cost, all-electronic trading platform (which market participants were familiar with, having used it during the years that CBOT licensed it). R. 742 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    4. CBOT And Eurex's Competing Clearing Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   All futures contracts and options traded on an exchange must be submitted to a clearinghouse for clearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. A clearinghouse is a financial institution formed to facilitate the exchange of transactions. It stands in between the two firms participating in a trade and guarantees all trades it clears, and its purpose is to reduce the risk of a firm failing to honor its obligations. Eurex and CBOT separately began negotiations with two clearinghouses for their competing exchanges: (1) defendant CME; and (2) the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (\"BOTCC\"), which was CBOT's prior clearinghouse. R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. BOTCC was an independent corporation not owned by CBOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During CBOT's negotiations with BOTCC, CBOT requested that BOTCC act as an exclusive clearinghouse for CBOT's key products, including U.S. Treasury futures and options, but BOTCC was resistant. R. 742 \u00b6 24. Prior to this, CBOT and BOTCC never had a written agreement, and there was no restriction on BOTCC's ability to provide clearing services for other exchanges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CBOT encountered less resistance in its request for exclusivity from CME.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. In a March 25, 2003 email summarizing the negotiations, CBOT explained: \"CME wants flexibility in providing clearing services for other exchanges, however, CBOT would have exclusivity for the core products .... Only concern is with respect to anti-trust considerations but CME intent is to grant us exclusivity.\" R. 733 Ex. 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From the time the buyer or seller of a futures contract opens the contract until the counter-party closes it, the contract is considered \"open.\" Contracts that are outstanding at the clearinghouse-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that have not been offset by delivery-are called \"open interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 742 \u00b6 1. As part of CBOT's negotiations with CME, they debated whether a bulk transfer of open interest from BOTCC to CME would be possible as part of a CBOT-CME agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Defendants understood that \"interjecting CFTC into the process\" by submitting rules for \"approval of the CFTC\" could reduce risk and \"act[ ] as an insulator against liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants began discussions about this with the CFTC in April 2003. R. 731 \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 16, 2003, CBOT entered into a clearing services agreement (\"clearing link\") with CME set to begin on January 2, 2004. R. 742 \u00b6 25; R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Under that agreement, CME could provide clearing services for products competing with CBOT products only after first giving 30 days' notice to CBOT, at which time CBOT had the right to terminate the agreement. R. 731 \u00b6 14. Although this provision was not framed in terms of exclusivity, construing emails in the light most favorable to plaintiffs supports an inference that defendants had an internal understanding that CME would grant CBOT exclusivity. R. 742 \u00b6 25. CBOT subsequently attempted to acquire BOTCC, but BOTCC refused CBOT's acquisition overture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 20, 2003, USFE and BOTCC signed a letter of intent to enter into a clearing services agreement. R. 731 \u00b6 16. The parties dispute the extent to which USFE was already committed to or leaning towards BOTCC at the time defendants announced their clearing link. R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; R. 742 \u00b6 25. USFE and BOTCC's plans raised a concern for defendants that if USFE gained access to BOTCC before open interest was transferred to CME, \"CBOT's customers could effectively become Eurex US customers without the need to change any clearing procedures.\" R. 742 \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    5. CBOT And CME's Submission Of Clearing Link And Open Interest Transfer For CFTC Approval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants' clearing link agreement required them to \"draft and submit to the CFTC for approval rules that provide for the clearing of CBOT products at the CME clearing house ... and facilitate the transfer of open interest in CBOT [p]roducts from BOTCC to CME.\" R. 731 \u00b6 17. On June 3, 2003, CME submitted a request for the CFTC to approve proposed rules to implement the clearing link.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. On June 13, 2003, CBOT submitted a request for the CFTC to approve a proposed rule (\"Regulation 701.01\") requiring transfer of CBOT members' open interest from BOTCC to CME.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20; R. 742 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32; R. 733 Ex. 162.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although the CFTC had no obligation to publish these rule submissions or to provide an opportunity for public comment, on July 8, 2003, the CFTC made defendants' proposed rule changes available for comment on the CFTC website by July 14, 2003. R. 731 \u00b6 21; R. 742 \u00b6 29. This was far shorter than that 45-day review period allowed (but not required) by a commission rule. R. 742 \u00b6 29. CBOT had requested quick CFTC approval of the proposed rules in June 2003, citing a provision in the clearing link agreement allowing CME to walk away from the agreement by July 15, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . However, CME's Board Steering Committee had decided on July 7, 2003 to allow the walkaway provision to lapse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During the review period between July 8 and July 14, 2003, numerous industry participants, including USFE and BOTCC, submitted comment letters. R. 731 \u00b6 22. USFE's letter raised antitrust concerns, explaining that \"an analysis of the anti-competitive impact of the [open market transfer rule] CB[O]T Regulation 701 under the factors of section 15(b) of the [Commodity Exchange Act ('CEA') ] precludes the CFTC from approving it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Other market participants likewise raised competition and market-based concerns in their comment letters. R. 742 \u00b6 30. USFE and other market participants also requested that the CFTC extend the comment period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The CFTC did not extend the comment period. On July 15, 2003, CFTC staff provided a 17-page memorandum addressing the proposed rules and comment letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R. 731 \u00b6 24; R. 742 \u00b6 32. That memorandum explained that the comment letters had raised the concern that the proposed rules \"would violate the obligations of [CBOT] and the Commission in light of the antitrust provisions of the Act,\" including \"Section 15(b).\" R. 731 \u00b6 24. CFTC staff\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   acknowledge[d] that these rules relate to important policy and legal issues of market structure and competition that the Commission has been addressing since June, 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, ... 'despite all the discussion about alternative clearing models embracing choice in one form or another, to-date no alternatives to the use of a single dedicated clearinghouse exist and none have been proposed in an implementable form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. CFTC staff recommended approving the rules, including Regulation 701.01, \"[i]n order to move forward to implement the Link in an orderly manner, and to enhance legal certainty concerning the procedures to implement the Link.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CFTC staff subsequently explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The staff recognizes that the Clearing Services Agreement between CBOT and CME could appear to raise antitrust issues. However, the staff believes that any potential antitrust issues are outweighed by the benefits to be gained including potential clearing efficiencies, significant cost savings for members and customers, and systemic risk abatement.... On balance, the staff believes that ... the Commission's approval of the CBOT as DCO would not be inconsistent with the Commission's obligation under Section 15(b) of the CEA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On July 15, 2003, the CFTC unanimously approved the clearing link and open interest transfer rules submitted by defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. The same day, the CFTC issued a press release announcing the approval and stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [T]he policy and legal issues involved have been well known to interested parties since they were initially raised at the CFTC Clearing Roundtable held almost a year ago. CBOT, CME, and the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation have consulted widely with their members\n   and the Commission about this project and submitted to the Commission an agreed transition schedule on June 13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Under the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission is not obligated to publish rule submissions of self-regulatory organizations. Nevertheless, based upon the many expressions of interest in this matter, the Commission decided to provide a short comment period....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The rules are necessary for the orderly implementation of the Link and will provide continuity of financial integrity and customer protection in the futures markets. The Commission believes that the Link and these rules further the Commodity Futures Modernization Act's goal of supporting innovation in the futures industry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Commission's decision was based upon the information before it, including comment letters from several interested parties. The Commission is aware of public and industry interest in related policy issues regarding market structure and competition, and looks forward to hearing more on these issues. The Commission believes, however, that this broader dialogue should not impede the planning necessary to move forward to implement the Link in an orderly manner. The Commission believes it is of paramount importance to enhance legal certainty concerning the procedures to implement the Link.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    6. USFE's CFTC Application And Preparation To Enter The Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Knowing that it needed CFTC approval to become a designated contract market (\"DCM\") before it could launch, USFE pre-filed its DCM application with the CFTC in July 2003. R. 742 \u00b6 15. USFE attended meetings with the CFTC that month to discuss its application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 3, 2003, USFE, Eurex, and BOTCC officially entered into their clearing services agreement. R. 731 \u00b6 39. That agreement prohibited BOTCC from making USFE's contracts \"fungible with contracts traded on exchanges other than [USFE] or Eurex\" without prior written consent of USFE.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . If the agreement was terminated, USFE could require BOTCC to \"facilitate the transfer of open positions and collateral with respect to [USFE] Contracts as to which [BOTCC] maintain[ed] open positions\" to another clearing service provider.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. In other words, the agreement gave USFE the right to transfer open interest in USFE contracts to another clearinghouse upon termination, just as CBOT had arranged to do with CME. In the wake of USFE's clearing services agreement with BOTCC, CBOT proposed crediting the account of any BOTCC member who became a CME-CBOT clearing link member with \"the net book value ($16,628 per share) of up to 150 shares of the clearing member's BOTCC stock.\" R. 742 \u00b6 33; R. 733 Ex. 189.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Around the same time, USFE entered into a regulatory services agreement with the National Futures Association (\"NFA\") for the NFA to perform market and trade practice surveillance for USFE for an initial term of three years. R. 731 \u00b6 42. Prior to this agreement, defendants made efforts to hamper an agreement between USFE and the NFA, including by arguing that the NFA should be precluded from providing regulatory oversight services to USFE on numerous grounds that were ultimately rejected by the CFTC. R. 742 \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On September 16, 2003, USFE filed its formal DCM application with the CFTC. R. 731 \u00b6 44; R. 742 \u00b6 16. Shortly after USFE's September 16, 2003 application, defendants pursued separate FOIA requests regarding the application and requested extensions of the CFTC comment period until 45 days after receipt of the requested FOIA documentation. R. 742 \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   By regulation, USFE's application was initially eligible for fast-track, sixty-day review. R. 731 \u00b6 44; R. 742 \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the CFTC removed USFE's application from fast-track review on October 14, 2003, with the stated intent \"to ensure that it ha[d] an adequate opportunity to consider fully the issues presented by [USFE's] application.\" R. 731 \u00b6 44. The same day, the CFTC postponed a hearing on USFE's application originally set for October 16, 2003 before the House Agriculture Subcommittee. R. 742 \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The hearing before the House Agriculture Subcommittee was rescheduled for November 6, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. At that hearing, the CFTC Chairman testified that because USFE's application was \"large\" and \"extensive,\" the CFTC had determined that it would be \"very difficult to get to a point where we are comfortable within [the 60 day, fast-track] time frame.\" R. 731 \u00b6 45. But he also testified that the application \"include[d] all general information required by our rules to be considered complete.\" R. 742 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   During the review period, CFTC staff themselves raised numerous issues with USFE, sending over 75 questions (in at least four sets) for USFE to answer regarding its application. R. 731 \u00b6 48. The CFTC sent copies of USFE's application to the Federal Reserve and the Department of Treasury on November 3, 2003, and the Treasury and Federal Reserve submitted their comments on December 18 and 19, 2003, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CFTC also made non-confidential portions of USFE's application publicly available on its website for comment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. CBOT and CME separately submitted a series of comment letters raising concerns with USFE's application. R. 742 \u00b6 19. Several of defendants' comments focused on discrepancies between USFE's public marketing and what was disclosed in USFE's application. Although the application represented that all USFE-listed contracts would be cleared by BOTCC, USFE was publicly marketing a \"global clearing link\" that would allow products to be cleared at either BOTCC or Eurex Clearing, the latter of which was not Commission-registered. R. 731 \u00b6 50. The application also did not mention a rebate plan that USFE was publicly marketing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Additionally, defendants raised an issue regarding USFE's one-member Board of Directors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On December 9, 2003, the CFTC announced that it would hold a hearing on USFE's application on December 17, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54; R. 742 \u00b6 20. Later that day, CME and CBOT submitted nearly identical letters to the CFTC stating that they had previously scheduled meetings that conflicted with the December 17 hearing and requesting that that hearing be rescheduled (a) based on the conflict and (b) to address questions raised at the November 6, 2003 House Agriculture Subcommittee hearing.

Evidence Related To Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Just before and after USFE's launch, USFE executives observed that CBOT's price cuts stole momentum and eliminated USFE's competitive advantage. R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75-80;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78 (USFE executive on April 24, 2004: \"[T]he market got what it wanted: Lower prices and an irreversible trend towards electronic trading.

Relying on these observations by USFE executives and defendants' expert testimony, as well as the fact that USFE's launch occurred only seven days after the planned date, defendants attribute USFE's failure to legitimate competition, including CBOT's new, more efficient electronic trading system and CBOT's price cuts that eliminated USFE's competitive advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, attribute USFE's failure to delay tactics on the part of defendants, which they claim resulted in traders not being technologically ready or able to trade with USFE at its launch. R. 742 \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40. Plaintiffs rely on documents indicating that potential customers delayed because of regulatory uncertainty surrounding CFTC approval of USFE's application, as well as testimony from plaintiffs' expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

On July 2, 2010, Judge Zagel granted defendants' motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs' predatory pricing theory (filed while discovery was ongoing). R. 416. Judge Zagel concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   CBOT has put forth uncontested facts to show that its prices for U.S. Treasury derivative exchange services exceeded its average variable cost ... [and] also its average total cost. Accordingly, I find that Defendants' pricing was above every measure of cost appropriate for a predatory pricing analysis and grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of predatory pricing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Two years later, on August 3, 2012, Judge Zagel granted in part and denied in part another motion for partial summary judgment by defendants (again filed while discovery was ongoing). R. 445. In that motion, defendants tested three of plaintiffs' remaining theories of liability. Plaintiffs' first theory was that defendants obstructed the regulatory approval process in order to hamstring USFE's launch. Judge Zagel found this theory foreclosed by the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which \"extends absolute immunity under the antitrust laws to businesses and other associations when they join together to petition legislative bodies, administrative agencies, or courts for action that may have anticompetitive effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Mercatus Group, LLC v.

Judge Zagel found that \"in weighing USFE's DCM application, the CFTC was acting in a legislative capacity,\" and that defendants' efforts to influence\n   the CFTC were shielded by\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   immunity. R. 445 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On a motion for reconsideration, Judge Zagel afforded plaintiffs a narrow opportunity to proceed on their regulatory delay theory. He concluded that \"it was error not to consider Defendants' [December 9, 2003] letters to the CFTC separately from the other lobbying activity.\" R. 460 at 1.

This means that under\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs cannot invoke the fraudulent misrepresentation prong of the sham exception to antitrust immunity under\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206944\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/834/#p841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206944\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/834/#p841\">\n    at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the fraudulent misrepresentation prong \"does not apply at all outside of adjudicative proceedings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants argue that the other prong of the exception-described in\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   as the \"sham lawsuits\" prong (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206944\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/834/#p841\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 842 )-does not apply in the legislative context either. As defendants point out, the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   said \"sham lawsuits\"-not \"sham proceedings.\" Defendants claim this choice of words means that the \"sham\" prong, like the fraudulent misrepresentation prong, does not apply at all in the legislative context. As defendants point out, a contrary conclusion \"would ... lead to the anomalous result that\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   immunizes deliberate lies to the CFTC and Congress [in legislative proceedings], but leaves unprotected petitioning through the ordinary channels of legislative and regulatory process\" as long as they qualify as a baseless \"sham.\" R. 739 at 4. Indeed, prior to\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs alleged a fraudulent misrepresentation theory ( R. 56 \u00b6\u00b6 46-47), but after\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   and Judge Zagel's rulings that the CFTC proceeding was legislative, plaintiffs now describe defendants petitioning as a \"baseless\" sham proceeding rather than as \"fraudulent misrepresentation.\" It makes little sense to allow a claim to survive based on a simple change of adjectives like this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds that by using the term \"sham lawsuits,\" the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   likely did not mean to entirely foreclose antitrust actions based on pure procedural abuse in the legislative context.

That is not what the evidence shows here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Defendants correctly argue as a threshold matter that the December 9, 2003 scheduling letters cannot be considered objectively baseless because they succeeded in obtaining legitimate government action. The letters asked the CFTC to: (1) reschedule the December 17 public hearing on USFE's application so defendants' principals could participate (citing previously scheduled board meetings on December 16, \"follow-up special strategy meetings\" for CBOT on December 17 and 18, and \"meetings with CME clearing firms and other CME customers in New York\" for CME on December 17 and 18); and (2) respond to questions raised by House Agriculture Subcommittee members on November 6, 2003. R. 731 \u00b6 55; R. 733 Exs. 120-121. The CFTC responded favorably to both requests. The CFTC explained that it was cancelling the December 17 hearing based on \"scheduling conflicts of some market participants,\" and it replaced the public hearing with a new comment period to respond to questions raised at the House hearing. R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants further argue that the letters were not objectively baseless because they reflected a true scheduling conflict that prevented defendants from attending the hearing, which they had a clear interest in attending. Plaintiffs dispute whether there is evidence of an actual scheduling conflict, saying there is no evidence the conflicts described in the letters actually happened. To begin, however, even if statements in the letters were false, false representations are fully insulated in the legislative context under\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Moreover, plaintiffs misrepresent the facts. In support of their claim of a genuine scheduling conflict (R. 731 \u00b6 55), defendants cite: (1) an internal CME email on October 22, 2003 to numerous CME executives titled \"December 16, 2003 Board Meeting\" that describes event details (R. 718 Ex. 69); (2) a November 19, 2003 internal CBOT email explaining \"The December 2003 Board of Directors meeting will be held on Tuesday, December 16, 2003\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 70); (3) December 16, 2003 CME board meeting minutes (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 71); (4) December 16, 2003 CBOT board meeting minutes (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 72); (5) an itinerary for a CBOT executive's speaking event in New York from December 15-17 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 73); and (6) deposition testimony from a CME employee describing the long-scheduled December 16 CME board meeting in New York, followed by client visits and receptions involving \"[a]lmost the entire board\" on December 17 and 18 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 74 at 264:18-266:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Clearly, the board meetings were long scheduled and took place on the December 16 date listed in defendants' letters. And there is unrefuted evidence that follow up CME meetings took place on December 17 and 18. The exhibits do not appear to corroborate the \"follow-up special strategy meetings\" on December 17 and 18 mentioned by CBOT in its letter, but it is clear that at least one CBOT executive was tied up in meetings in New York during those days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiffs emphasize that defendants' letters are nearly identical, and that defendants' counsel has conceded the letters were the product of coordinated efforts. But that does not make them an objectively baseless abuse of process. They were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiffs also focus on the larger set of defendants' petitioning, claiming that the CFTC disagreed with all of it, and\n   it was a baseless sham.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , however, all of this petitioning aside from the letters already has been immunized. As the Seventh Circuit instructed in\n   <em>\n    Mercatus\n   </em>\n   , the court extracts \"any conduct that is immunized\" under\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   from its assessment of \"the evidence of the remaining challenged conduct in the aggregate to see if it is sufficient to support antitrust liability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206944\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/834/#p841\">\n    641 F.3d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' attempt to shoehorn into their regulatory delay claim ample evidence that Judge Zagel already excluded as immunized runs afoul of this instruction in\n   <em>\n    Mercatus.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , even if it had not already been immunized, defendants' other legislative petitioning does not meet the very high bar for objective baselessness in the legislative context. The CFTC agreed with or held USFE to its proposed \"undertakings\" to address a number of defendants' comments and concerns, including defendants' objections to USFE's one-member board, USFE's proposed global or cross-border clearing link, and USFE's proposed incentive programs. R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 48, 50-52, 62, 68-69. CME's Chairman noted that defendants' efforts succeeded because USFE \"will not be able to implement any cross border clearing link without approval,\" meaning that competition would occur \"on a level playing field.\" R. 733 Ex. 133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Moreover, defendants are correct that the fact that the CFTC staff addressed all of the issues raised by defendants speaks to their substantiality. The CFTC did not even address many of the other comments filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 718 Ex. 67. The Court therefore concludes as a matter of law that defendants' conduct did not rise to the level of objective baselessness, a standard that is \"virtually impossible\" to meet in the legislative context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Subjective Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In discussing their regulatory delay theory, plaintiffs focus heavily on evidence of defendants' subjective intent without grounding that discussion in the governing legal standards. Plaintiffs try to put the December 9 letters in the context of \"a larger course of conduct designed to delay USFE's entry,\" relying on the coordination and intent-related evidence summarized above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 732 at 28-29. But because the Court concludes that defendants' challenged activity was not objectively baseless, it does not reach the issue of defendants' subjective motivation under\n   <em>\n    PRE\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    508 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true that after the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000, the CFTC no longer has to \"approve most contract market rules.\" R. 733 Ex. 184.

Application Of Implied Immunity Doctrine Here\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Turning to the application of implied immunity principles to the facts here, the Court agrees with defendants that on the spectrum set forth in the SEC cases ranging from mere acquiescence to formal approval of defendants' challenged conduct, this case falls on the latter end. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , the CFTC formally approved defendants' clearing link and open interest transfer. This clear, affirmative approval goes beyond actions of the SEC in\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NASD\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   that were found to warrant immunity. Also, unlike in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , the CFTC's formal approval was subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act just like the SEC's actions in\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   -the factor that the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   described as \"extremely important.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n    977 F.2d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the four-part test from\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse\n   </em>\n   confirms the appropriateness of finding implied immunity here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    First factor (regulatory authority to supervise activity).\n   </strong>\n   The first factor is easily satisfied. The CFTC has had authority to review and approve exchange rules since its creation in 1974 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7a-2(c) ), and specifically to regulate the clearing of futures transactions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17 C.F.R. Part 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    Second factor (evidence that agency exercises regulatory authority).\n   </strong>\n   The second factor also is easily met. The CFTC exercised its regulatory authority to approve the very rules with respect to the clearing link and open interest transfer that plaintiffs challenge, and it has routinely approved DCM rules since its creation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CFTC Industry Filings, Rules &amp; Rule Amendments, https://www.cftc.gov/IndustryOversight/IndustryFilings/index.htm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The CFTC also exercised its regulatory authority in this area when considering market structure and competition issues related to defendants' rules in the year preceding those rules' approval. In its June 2002 report, the CFTC acknowledged the potential benefits of mandated fungibility (essentially, the scenario USFE demands in this case), but warned that it \"could decrease the potential reward [for an exchange from developing a new product] and therefore decrease the incentive for innovation,\" and could \"subject[ ] clearing organizations to one other's credit risk involuntarily.\" R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. The CFTC made clear when it approved defendants' rules that it had been considering \"the policy and legal issues involved\" for the past year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The CFTC later concluded when subsequently approving CBOT's DCM application that \"any potential antitrust issues are outweighed by the benefits to be gained including potential clearing efficiencies, significant cost savings for members and customers, and systemic risk abatement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The CFTC thus clearly exercised its regulatory authority in the area of defendants' challenged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    Third factor (a resulting risk of conflicting guidance).\n   </strong>\n   The Court further finds that plaintiffs' challenge places the CEA and the antitrust laws in an actual irreconcilable conflict because the CFTC expressly approved defendants' rules as consistent with the CEA, notwithstanding possible anticompetitive effects. The CEA assigns to the CFTC the responsibility to \"take into consideration the public interest to be protected by the antitrust laws and endeavor to take the least anticompetitive means of achieving the objectives of [the CEA]\" when approving a contract market rule.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). And the CFTC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   explicitly did so here. The CFTC allowed a comment period during which USFE and others submitted objections to the rules (and particularly Regulation 701.01 regarding the open interest transfer) based on \"anti-competitive impact.\" R. 733 \u00b6 23. In approving the rules, the CFTC explained: (1) that the comment letters had raised the concern that the proposed rules \"would violate the obligations of [CBOT] and the Commission in light of the antitrust provisions of the Act\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24); (2) that the CFTC had considered these comment letters and had been considering the \"market structure and competition\" issues involved since June 2002 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25); and (3) that the CFTC ultimately found that \"no alternatives to the use of a single dedicated clearinghouse exist\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) and that defendants' rules \"support[ed] innovation in the futures industry\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). Indeed, the conflict created by recognizing an antitrust claim would be even stronger here than in\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse\n   </em>\n   because it would be an actual conflict with the CFTC's assessment, including its balancing of antitrust risk against other factors, rather than a hypothetical one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573288\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/264/\">\n    551 U.S. at 281-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573288\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/264/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth factor (whether conflict affected practices lying squarely within regulated area).\n   </strong>\n   Finally, the Court finds the conflict affects the practices of DCMs and clearing organizations, and those practices lie at the heart of the CFTC's oversight responsibilities, as the many statutory provisions and rules addressing those practices show.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (CEA's core principles for DCMs);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7a-1(c) (CEA's core principles for clearing organizations); 17 C.F.R.

R. 732 at 44. The important point, however, is that the CFTC did rule on it here. And it did so as part of its broader consideration of whether to keep a single clearinghouse model or adopt a model with more fungibility and open access clearing. The open interest transfer defendants sought was directly related to the single clearinghouse model. In light of that model, not transferring would mean leaving the open interest at CBOT's previous clearinghouse (BOTCC) that would now become USFE's clearinghouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The CFTC evaluated in 2002-2003 and then again in 2009 whether to move to a model more akin to securities markets where contracts are fungible between competing exchanges and open access clearing is mandated, and it declined to change the model. R. 731 \u00b6\u00b6 31-35, 38. The Court therefore finds that the conflict between the CFTC's approval of the open interest transfer and recognizing an antitrust claim based on that transfer falls squarely within an area the CEA regulates (clearing organization and DCM practices).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Beyond the\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse\n   </em>\n   analysis, plaintiffs' opposition latches onto the language in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , that \"outside the context of a pervasive regulatory scheme, [implied] immunity is proper when the relevant agency's scrutiny and approval of the challenged practice is active, intrusive and appropriately deliberative.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n    977 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1167 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , 422 U.S. at 689-91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9664\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/659/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiffs argue that rather than being active and appropriately deliberative, the CFTC's review of defendants' rules, and particularly the open interest transfer rules, was \"cursory and haphazard\" as a result of defendants' own actions. R. 732 at 37. But a test that takes a deep dive into the factual nuances of the CFTC's review to determine if it was sufficiently deliberative is not the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The four-part test in\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse\n   </em>\n   is the law. As defendants emphasize, in the sentences immediately following the sentence on which plaintiffs focus, the\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   court added: \"Put another way, an antitrust court, before relinquishing jurisdiction over allegedly anticompetitive activities, must be convinced that the agency has exercised its independent judgment in reflecting upon and approving the activity at issue. Moreover, the availability of judicial review, even if not the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of immunity, is extremely important.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n    977 F.2d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , there is no doubt that the CFTC exercised its independent judgment in reflecting on and approving the activity in question-it expressly approved it. Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   court contrasted the mere acquiescence to an emergency rule in that case with \"[t]he Commission's [formal] approval or disapproval of [exchange] rules.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n    at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And unlike in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   , judicial review was available here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Read in proper context, the Court believes that the \"active, intrusive and appropriately deliberative\" inquiry is short-circuited in cases where an agency gives express approval. It was because the CFTC in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   had merely acquiesced to the challenged conduct that the court undertook deeper scrutiny to determine whether the CFTC had in fact \"exercised ... independent judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In any event, even if a more detailed assessment of the CFTC's review is appropriate, that does not change the Court's conclusion. Plaintiffs first try to establish that the shortened review period was based on a misrepresentation by CBOT. They cite an email reporting that CBOT's general counsel \"noted\" to the CFTC in June 2003 \"that there was a walkaway provision in the [clearing link agreement] as of mid-July based on obtaining regulatory approval\" for \"rule changes.\" R. 733 Ex. 165. Plaintiffs explain that CME's CEO had expressed its intent in a July 7, 2003 board meeting to let the \"walk-away option\" \"lapse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517934\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/1147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 167 at 4. Notably, however, the CME board meeting summary does not indicate that CBOT or its general counsel was aware of CME's position on the walk-away option. Plaintiffs further say the CFTC relied on CBOT's misrepresentation about the walk-away option to shorten the anticipated 45-day period for public comment to four days. They cite comments from CFTC members complaining about the short timeframe resulting from the mid-July deadline. R. 733 Ex. 166; R. 733 Ex. 173.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Ultimately, however, regardless of the duration of the CFTC's review period or the cause of that duration, plaintiffs ignore the broader backdrop of consideration by the CFTC of competition and antitrust issues imposed by the single clearinghouse model. And they ignore that the CFTC actively solicited comment letters-despite the fact that it was not required to do so-and considered them when approving the rules. CFTC staff acknowledged and weighed the antitrust and competition objections raised and concluded that there were no viable alternatives to the \"single dedicated clearinghouse\" model. R. 733 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   At bottom, this was not a situation like in\n   <em>\n    American Agriculture\n   </em>\n   of nonpublic review and no express approval. This was a case of express CFTC approval, after a year's worth of considering related competition issues, all of which was subject to Administrative Procedure Act review that plaintiffs did not seek. R. 731 \u00b6 28. Thus, the Court agrees with defendants that the CFTC's decision approving the clearing link and open interest transfer are implicitly immune from antitrust scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Actionability Under Antitrust Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Defendants have an alternative basis for summary judgment on plaintiffs' liquidity deprivation theory based on the clearing link agreement and open interest transfer: that it is not actionable under the antitrust laws. Defendants note that even now, thirteen years after this theory first appeared in plaintiffs' second amended complaint, plaintiffs have not identified the specific antitrust doctrines on which they rely in support. And that is because, defendants say, this theory contravenes basic antitrust principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Because the parties raise different arguments with respect to the open interest transfer and the clearing link components of this theory, the Court considers them separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Transfer Of Open Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Defendants contend that plaintiffs' transfer of open interest theory assumes that CBOT should have left open positions in the CBOT Treasury futures contracts at BOTCC so that USFE could use them to attract liquidity in its new copy-cat futures contracts. The Court agrees with defendants that such an assumption runs headlong into the basic antitrust principle that there is \"no duty to aid competitors\" in light of the \"uncertain virtue of forced sharing.\"\n   <em>\n    Verizon Commc'ns, Inc. v.

For starters, if plaintiffs are correct that separate and independent contracts existed between BOTCC and traders, then any breach of those contracts would result in separate claims between BOTCC and the traders irrelevant to the antitrust claim before this Court. Moreover, the undisputed facts are that the CFTC approved the open interest transfer proposed by CBOT. Plaintiffs offer no legal support for the proposition that CBOT had no right to direct where the open positions in the contracts were cleared. Plaintiffs' position is particularly ironic given that USFE negotiated a term in its agreement with BOTCC to do precisely what CBOT had done in the event of termination: transfer open interest in USFE contracts to another clearinghouse. R. 731 \u00b6 40. USFE sought this requirement because \"[i]n the case of changing a clearinghouse, it is important for the exchange to have a smooth transition and a functioning market over that change.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206944\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/834/#p841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was (and still is) the prevailing regulatory structure, and USFE negotiated for it in its own clearing services agreement.

Taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs: (1) CBOT attempted to get exclusivity with BOTCC and later to acquire BOTCC to try to shut it down, and (2) defendants misrepresented the NFA's lawful capacity to contract with USFE, including threatening to sue to invalidate the NFA-USFE agreement. R. 742 \u00b6\u00b6 24-34, 39-40.
