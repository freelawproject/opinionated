BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Cares Community Health provides a variety of services to people in the Sacramento, California, area regardless of their ability to pay. Cares also operates a pharmacy there that offers prescription drugs under Medicare Part D, and a federal program enables Cares to procure those drugs from manufacturers at a discount. Cares, however, does not necessarily retain the benefit of that discount; rather, at least one insurance company has altered its contract with Cares to reimburse it at a discounted rate. As a result, Cares has now sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and certain officials, contending that the Government has ignored a statutory duty to regulate those contracts in order to require companies to pay Cares the market rate for discounted drugs. Defendants now move to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), and 12(b)(7). Finding that Cares has standing but has failed to state a claim, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court will provide some brief background on the Medicare Part D program and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) - of which Cares is an example - before delving into the facts of this particular dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Statutory Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Medicare Part D subsidizes prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-101(a)(1). To administer Part D, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) contracts with private entities known as Part D plan \"Sponsors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395w-115. The Government contracts only with those Sponsors, and not directly with pharmacies, to deliver Part D benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395w-27(a). Sponsors then enter into contracts with pharmacies to reimburse them for providing prescription drugs to Part D beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395w-104(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FQHCs receive grants from the Government to provide health-care services to communities that HHS has designated \"medically underserved.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 254b, 1396d(l)(2)(B) ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(aa)(4)(A)(i).

To summarize, it provides that FQHCs must be paid \"not less than\" non-FQHC entities for Medicare services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-27(e)(3)(A). CMS has\n   implemented this FQHC payment requirement by promulgating regulations providing that \"[t]he contract between the [Sponsor] organization and CMS must specify that ... [t]he [Sponsor] organization must pay a[n] [FQHC] a similar amount to what it pays other providers for similar services.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.527\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The Government briefly rejoins that Cares lacks standing with respect to any contract to which it is not a party, since injury-in-fact contemplates not injury to third parties but personal injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Plaintiff, however, describes only its own monetary losses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 40-42. To the extent the Government's argument here addresses an implication in Cares's pleading that non-parties' injuries ought also to be redressed in this suit, the Court will consider that issue in the following section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Causation and Redressability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants maintain at greater length that Cares cannot show the existence of the second two requirements here - namely, causation and redressability. In doing so, the Government makes four principal arguments: first, any economic injury is traceable to a third party's conduct, not to the Government's; second, any declaration by the Court that CMS has failed to act on a non-discretionary duty would not redress Cares's economic injury; third, the Court cannot enjoin the Government from entering into future contracts without the payment requirement because Cares has not established the harm will recur; and finally, Cares's injury is not redressable because, to the extent it seeks modification of all contracts between CMS and Part D plan Sponsors, the Court cannot alter contractual obligations of non-parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MTD at 11-12 &amp; n.6, 14-16. The Court will address these arguments in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As to the first, the Court finds that Cares's injury is sufficiently caused by government action for the purposes of standing. Defendant is correct that the injury Plaintiff alleges - namely, losing several thousand dollars per working day,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 41 - is a result of\n   <em>\n    Humana\n   </em>\n   's decision to modify the contract. The core of the Complaint, nevertheless, is that Humana's modification would be unlawful if CMS had complied with a mandatory duty to require a higher rate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17, 33, 39. Although it is well established that a heightened showing is necessary when \"a plaintiff's asserted injury arises from the [G]overnment's allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of\n   <em>\n    someone else\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that standard has been met here. \"[A] party has standing to challenge government\n   action that permits or authorizes third-party conduct that would otherwise be illegal in the absence of the Government's action.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wrestling Coaches Ass'n v. Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5662160,9259709\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/930/\">\n    366 F.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 940 (D.C.

The converse is also true. In other words, had Defendants taken the action that Cares alleges is legally required, Humana's downward modification of the contract rates would be illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Government insists that \"it is entirely plausible that Humana is paying Cares lower Part D rates not because\" CMS failed to require Humana to pay higher rates, \"but rather because Humana understands that Part D drugs do not qualify as 'FQHC services' to which the FQHC payment requirement even applies.\" Def. MTD at 12. This argument holds little water because it presumes the Government's success on the merits where, in evaluating standing, the Court must presume Cares will prevail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Waukesha v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323378,3718053\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/228/\">\n    320 F.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003). HHS also urges that \"the Amended Complaint is devoid of any facts ... supporting an inference that Humana would change its behavior and pay Cares higher Part D rates if CMS took the ... action that Cares demands.\" Def. MTD at 11-12. Yet Plaintiff is entitled to assume Humana would not take \"the extraordinary measure of continuing [its] injurious conduct in violation of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Renal Physicians Ass'n v. U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487081,3563411\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1267/\">\n    489 F.3d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1275 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). For the same reason, Defendants' second contention - namely, that an order from the Court finding that CMS had unlawfully failed to act would not redress Cares's economic injury - is unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   HHS's third argument -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Cares has not adequately pled future injury to support an injunction as to future contracts - fares little better. As an initial matter, should Cares prevail on its statutory claim and obtain an order declaring CMS has a legal obligation to enforce the payment requirement as to Part D, such an injunction would seem unnecessary. To the extent that Cares's pleading of ongoing injury may be relevant to its ability to get any form of relief, the Court finds its allegations adequate. Plaintiff identifies a quandary, explaining that its \"experience with Humana is an apt demonstration of the result of CMS's interpretation that the FQHC payment requirement is not applicable to Part D.\" Am. Compl., \u00b6 40. Given that it follows from the Amended Complaint that Cares will continue to enter into contracts of this type, additional specificity on its part is not required for the Court to conclude that Plaintiff's injury will not cease with the expiry of this particular contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government's final argument, however, is more persuasive. It contends that the Court does not have the power to \"take such actions as may be necessary\" to enforce the payment requirement as to existing contracts, as Cares requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MTD at 14-15. At the very least, it is not clear to the Court what actions it might take to revise every existing contract, including those binding exclusively non-parties. Cares must demonstrate standing for each form of relief it seeks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env'l Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    528 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and it has not done so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To sum up, then, Cares has adequately demonstrated the three requirements to support standing for each form of relief it seeks, except as to its requested modification of existing contracts. The Court now turns to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    APA Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Cares contends that CMS has breached a clear and discrete statutory duty to include the payment requirement and has therefore either unlawfully withheld agency action or, alternatively, acted arbitrarily and capriciously by entering into Part D contracts without the payment requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (Pl. Opp.) at 20. Defendants respond that Cares has not identified any non-discretionary duty CMS has breached because the proposition that the FQHC payment requirement must be included in Part D contracts or that the payment requirement applies to Part D drugs is \"wrong as a matter of law.\" Def. MTD at 22. Having examined the statutory scheme, the Court agrees with the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First and foremost, the text of the payment requirement does not contemplate prescription drugs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A contract under this section with [a Sponsor] organization shall require the organization to provide, in any written agreement described in section 1395w-23(a)(4) of this title between the organization and a [FQHC], for a level and amount of payment to the [FQHC] for services provided by such health center that is\n   <em>\n    not less than\n   </em>\n   the level and amount of payment that the plan would make for such services if the services had been furnished by a[n] entity providing similar services that was not a [FQHC].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-27(e)(3)(A) (emphasis added). The provision thus makes clear that an FQHC must be paid \"for services provided by such health center ... not less than the level and amount of payment\" that would be rendered for similar services provided by a non-FQHC entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-27(e)(3)(A). In other words, reimbursement cannot be made at a discounted rate. The statute defines \"[FQHC] services\" as \"preventative primary health services\"; \"physicians' services and such services and supplies ... if furnished as an incident to a physician's professional service\"; and \"services furnished by a physician assistant,\" nurse practitioner, clinical psychologist, or a clinical social worker and \"such services and supplies furnished as an incident to his service.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(aa)(1)(A)-(C), (3). As \"incident to his service,\" the statute means \"services and supplies (including drugs and biologicals which are not usually self-administered by the patient) furnished as an incident to a physician's professional service, of kinds which are commonly furnished in physicians' offices and are commonly either rendered without charge or included in the physicians' bills.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395x(s)(2)(A). This definition of services excludes prescription drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff rejoins that the definition of services in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x should not be controlling because the payment requirement quoted above from \u00a7 1395w does not explicitly refer to \"[FQHC] services,\" but rather to \"services provided by [an FQHC],\" a different formulation that it believes is broader and more general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 11-12. Although Plaintiff is correct that the \u00a7 1395x definition is specifically of \"FQHC services\" and that the statute in other places does use that specific phrase rather than the iteration used in the payment requirement,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(2), the Court concludes that the slight variation in phrasing cannot bear the weight of Plaintiff's argument. The statute does not separately define services; rather, it lists categories of them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(b), (h), (m), (s). In other words, there is no more general statutory definition of \"services\" on which Plaintiff can rely. It is logical, given that structure, to apply the statutory definition\n   of \"FQHC services\" to the linguistic synonym \"services provided by an FQHC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Cares's strongest argument is based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-112(b)(3)(D) - the statutory provision that applies the FQHC payment requirement, along with the other elements of \u00a7 1395w-27(e), to Part D contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 16-17. It elaborates that \u00a7 1395w-112(b)(3)(D) modifies some of the \u00a7 1395w-27(e) provisions in their application to Part D, but does not modify the payment requirement, indicating the Congress intended the payment requirement to apply to Part D unchanged.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The problem for Plaintiff is that \u00a7 1395w-112(b) does not alter the statutory definition of\n   <em>\n    services\n   </em>\n   , which excludes Part D drugs. Cares replies that so interpreting the incorporation provision would create a superfluity problem insofar as the incorporation of \u00a7 1395w-27(e)(3)(A) to Part D would have no practical effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Of course, Plaintiff does not dispute that there are many contractual terms enumerated in \u00a7 1395w-27(e) besides the subsection at issue that do apply to Part D. To the extent Cares is correct that the incorporation of the payment-requirement provision specifically would have no effect, however, the possibility of some amount of surplusage is not enough to defeat the plain text of the provision, which limits its applicability only to services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407533\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/371/#p385\">\n    568 U.S. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407533\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/371/#p385\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407533\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/371/#p385\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). \"Particular[ly]\" here, \"where the surplus words consist simply of a numerical cross-reference,\" it is not appropriate to allow a general rule against surplusage to defeat the clear reading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chickasaw Nation v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    534 U.S. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    122 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108010\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/84/#p94\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court need not discuss at great length Plaintiff's next argument, which concerns statutory purpose. Cares contends that Congress intended FQHCs, not Plan D Sponsors, to internalize the benefit of discounted prescription drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp at 13. While that argument may be intuitive enough, nowhere does a hook for it appear in the statute. Congress could easily have implemented some provision to ensure that FQHCs retained the discount in the Part D context. That much is clear because Congress did something similar for Part C by providing for a so-called \"wrap-around\" payment. Medicare must reimburse FQHCs for the services they provide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (a)(3)(A). To the extent that FQHCs may be paid less by an insurance company administering Part C than it would be paid under Parts A and B, HHS pays FQHCs a wrap-around payment to make up the difference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   (a)(3)(B), 1395w-23(a)(4). No similar payment exists for Part D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff offers a textual basis for its purpose argument, it relies on a different statute: the 340B discounted-prescription-drug program. Cares contends that, as a condition of its participation in the 340B program, it may not transfer to an insurer the benefits it receives, nor may it apply any discounts when collecting fees so as not to subsidize other healthcare payors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 15-16. The provisions on which Cares relies, however, do not sweep so broadly. Participants in the program may not resell the\n   <em>\n    drugs\n   </em>\n   they receive, but the statute does not broadly proscribe transferring a\n   <em>\n    benefit\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 256b(a)(5)(B). And the latter provision is simply an application criterion for the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 254b(k)(3)(G)(ii)(II). These scattered references in a separate statute are insufficient to salvage Plaintiff's reading of the FQHC payment requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion and dismiss\n   Plaintiff's Complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
