Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Flechtheim, a pioneer collector and promoter of modern art, operated galleries in\n   D\u00fcsseldorf and Berlin during the 1920s and 1930s (Compl. \u00b6 48), and represented a range of notable artists, including Max Beckmann, Paul Klee, and Juan Gris (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47). Among his collection were the paintings contested in this case (the \"Paintings' \"), including six works by Beckmann (\n   <em>\n    Duchess of Malvedi\n   </em>\n   (1926),\n   <em>\n    Still Life with Cigar Box\n   </em>\n   (1926),\n   <em>\n    Still Life with Studio Window\n   </em>\n   (1931),\n   <em>\n    Dream-Chinese Fireworks\n   </em>\n   (1927),\n   <em>\n    Champagne Still Life\n   </em>\n   (1929),\n   <em>\n    Quappi in Blue\n   </em>\n   (1926) ); one work by Gris (\n   <em>\n    Cruche et verre sur un table\n   </em>\n   (1916) ); and one work by Klee (\n   <em>\n    Grenzen des Verstandes\n   </em>\n   (1927) ). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon their rise to power in March 1933, the Nazis began a policy of \"Aryanization\" - the state-sponsored takeover of Jewish businesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65, 73.) On March 30, 1933, Alex V\u00f6mel - who was the employee in charge of Flechtheim's D\u00fcsseldorf gallery and a member of the Brownshirts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 50) - announced \"that his gallery would be opening 'in the previous premises of the Flechtheim Gallery.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Around the same time, Nazis \"stormed an auction that had been organized by Flechtheim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Recognizing the danger he faced, Flechtheim fled to Paris in May 1933. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 810.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the summer of 1933, \"[i]n order to avoid insolvency as a direct result\" of Nazi persecution, \"Flechtheim was forced to place his property at the disposal of\" Alfred Schulte (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85), whom Plaintiffs describe as a \"Nazi tax advisor\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). Schulte \"officially took possession of all of Flechfheim's belongings and subsequently sold a good deal of [them] to the benefit of Flechtheim's German creditors and the Nazi state's authorities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85.) Simultaneously, V\u00f6mel sold much of Flechtheim's collection through Christopher Bernoulli, \"a Swiss art dealer ... [, thereby] converting for his own profit what clearly belonged to\" Flechtheim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) Plaintiffs allege that although Flechtheim was able to move a portion of his collection abroad before his business was taken, the Paintings at issue here remained in Germany. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Nevertheless, it is unclear whether V\u00f6mel, Schulte, or someone else disposed of the Paintings; Plaintiffs merely allege that the Paintings were sold in Germany after Flechtheim's flight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Flechtheim apparently never returned to Germany, dying in London in 1937. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Paintings are now in the possession of BSGS, which \"oversees Bavaria's public collections of artworks on display in [its] museums both in[side] and outside of Munich....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) The six paintings by Beckmann were donated to BSGS in 1974 by G\u00fcinther Franke, who claimed to have acquired the paintings \"in 1932 or 1933.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) Plaintiffs assert that Franke's claim is false, and that Franke succeeded to the paintings from V\u00f6mel, Schulte, or someone else as a result of the persecution of Flechtheim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) Plaintiffs do not attempt to explain how BSGS came into possession of the Gris and Klee paintings, but assert that the two works \"changed hands because of Nazi persecution of their owner [in or after] 1933,\" implying that BSGS received the paintings from whomever obtained them during the 1930s (or the successor to that person). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing a complaint on December 5, 2016, asserting\n   claims of replevin, conversion, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and bailment under the common law. (Doc. No. 1.) On November 15, 2017, Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201602\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1611.

LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the context of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the party seeking to invoke the Court's jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction exists.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

The parties do not dispute that Bavaria is a political subdivision of a foreign state and that it is therefore covered by the FSIA.

And although Plaintiffs describe a pattern of Nazi propaganda attacking Flechtheim and allege that he fled Germany after recognizing that \"his situation was hopeless, as a specific and direct result of the Nazi state's desire and effort to deprive him of the means to survive economically\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81), Plaintiffs also allege that Flechtheim placed his property at Schulte's disposal due to economic duress (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"to avoid insolvency\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85), and never allege that Schulte participated in the government's campaign against Flechtheim. Plaintiffs' allegations here are very different from those in Nazi art cases in which courts have allowed claims to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philipp v.

Kingdom of Spain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050167\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/1019/#p1021\">\n    616 F.3d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021-22 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (allowing a suit to proceed under the takings exception where the plaintiff's ancestor was forced to sell a painting to \"an agent of the Nazi government\"). Thus, because Plaintiffs have not sufficiently invoked the takings exception to the FSIA, their Complaint must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although morally unsatisfying, the Court's conclusion is consistent with the structure of the FSIA, which provides foreign states with a broad grant of immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3735797,3770399\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/1066/\">\n    672 F.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (D.C.

Naturally, the Court is sympathetic to Plaintiffs' moral claim to the Paintings: Flechtheim was deprived of treasured works of art as a direct consequence of the Nazi regime's indefensible and unspeakable Aryanization policies. There is no doubt that the economic opportunism of men like V\u00f6mel and Schulte would not have been possible without the Nazi government's promulgation of racist laws and genocidal practices that deprived Jews of the most basic economic and human rights. Surely, it would not be hard to justify and articulate an exception to the FSIA that created a carve-out for victims like Flechtheim and his heirs to take action against the downstream beneficiaries of such policies. Nevertheless, Congress has chosen not to enact such an exception, and it is not the Court's proper place to create one, particularly in light of the \"[d]eference to the foreign policy of the political branches\" required in the FSIA context.\n   <em>\n    Sampson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11103382\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/1145/#p1155\">\n    250 F.3d at 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court reluctantly concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to hear this case and that Defendants' motion to dismiss must be GRANTED.
