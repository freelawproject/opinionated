(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 6; Dkt. 9). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion\n   (Dkt. 6) is granted in part, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 9) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her application for DIB on May 1, 2014. (Dkt. 4 at 16, 94).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, on May 5, 2014, Plaintiff protectively filed an application for SSI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 180-81). In her applications, Plaintiff alleged disability beginning May 10, 2013, due to right shoulder injury and weakness; left shoulder injury; carpal tunnel syndrome in her right and left wrists; anxiety; and depression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 94, 180-81). Plaintiff's applications were initially denied on September 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105-110). At Plaintiff's request, a hearing was held before administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") Lynette Gohr in Buffalo, New York, on February 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-80). Plaintiff appeared with her attorney and testified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the hearing, Plaintiff's disability onset date was amended to June 4, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). On March 23, 2017, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-28).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last meets the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2018. (Dkt. 4 at 18). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since May 10, 2013, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy - status post surgeries, and degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of depression and anxiety were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.02B and 12.04 in reaching her conclusion, as well as the effect of Plaintiff's obesity as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform less than the full range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), because Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   is able to lift and/or carry fifteen pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, stand and/or walk for six hours in an\n   eight-hour workday, and sit for six hours in an eight-hour workday.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

In arriving at this determination,\n   the ALJ considered: records from Northwest Community Health Center from July 2013 to September 2013, where Plaintiff underwent outpatient counseling and psychotropic medication management, but discharged against medical advice; an August 2014 consultative psychological examination by Susan Santarpia, Ph.D., who assigned Plaintiff no mental work-related function limitations, other than a mild limitation in performing complex tasks independently; the opinion of a reviewing psychological consultant, Dr. Kamin, who opined that Plaintiff had no severe mental impairments ; and records from a consultative internal medicine examiner, Hongbiao Liu, M.D., who stated that Plaintiff likes to read, and is able to cook twice per week, clean the house, do laundry, and go shopping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21).

She was not aware that her voicemail box is full and stated she will [begin] to delete old messages.\"). In December 2015, Ms. Januale reported that Plaintiff called her very upset, and reported that \"during her one day experience at the VA hospital, that she got a vibe that they were lying to her. She began to explain how she 'feels things' and that she cannot help it. She wanted a copy\n   of all information that was recorded during her externship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 476).

Plaintiff further testified that the training made her \"anxious\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55), and that her vocational counselor said that she was not ready to work, because she needed mental health counseling (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43, 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court recognizes that Plaintiff's vocational records are not afforded any special weight,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manni,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201066667\">\n    2017 WL 1066667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2040000\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

However, the records from ACCES-VR are replete with information, including complaints from Plaintiff and observations from vocational professionals, relating to Plaintiff's mental health and her ability to process information and work. Indeed, as explained above, the ACCES-VR records show that Plaintiff was unsuccessful at learning new skills or dealing with work-related stress, and eventually had to stop services due to her alleged anxiety. The ALJ's complete failure to discuss these records-which are favorable to Plaintiff-was error. The ALJ was required to explain her reasons for failing to credit the information contained in Plaintiff's vocational records relating to Plaintiff's mental health issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manni,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201066667\">\n    2017 WL 1066667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2040000\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

These vocational records contain information that have a direct bearing on, and are highly relevant to, Plaintiff's ability to work. Because these records were not addressed by the ALJ, the Court cannot conclude that his determination that Plaintiff's mental impairments were non-severe is supported by substantial evidence. On remand, the ALJ is directed to address the information contained in these records, as well as consider whether Plaintiff's lack of treatment, and failure to follow through on treatment, resulted from her alleged mental health condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.

However, despite this contention, there is nothing in the written determination that leads the Court to conclude that the ALJ meaningfully considered Plaintiff's alleged mental health conditions in the remaining analysis. Indeed, all of the discussion relating to the assessment of Plaintiff's residual functional capacity focuses on Plaintiffs physical, rather than mental, impairments.
