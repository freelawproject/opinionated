The infant, A.F., and her mother, Yael Fogel (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), brought this diversity action against Sorin Group USA, Inc.; CarboMedics, Inc.; and Sorin Group Canada, Inc. (collectively, \"Defendants\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for injuries allegedly caused by the prosthetic Mitroflow Aortic Pericardial Heart Valve (the \"Valve\") that failed. Defendants have moved to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants are the manufacturers, sellers, and distributors of the Valve, which is a Class III medical device regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (\"MDA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 48, Doc. 1. In late 2006 and through 2007, Defendants submitted an application and several amended applications for premarket approval of the Valve, which is the process by which the FDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49-50. As part of that process, Defendants submitted numerous types of information, including details on the device's components and manufacturing process, proposed indications for use that listed \"no contraindications,\" and a clinical study of 699 patients that did not include any patients under the age of 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2007, the FDA conditionally approved the Valve for commercial distribution subject to a number of requirements, including reporting to the FDA instances of adverse effects of the device in patients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Pursuant to that conditional approval, Defendants began distributing the Valve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After its release, some patients who received the Valve experienced symptoms of valve deterioration and malfunction of the\n   \"leaflets,\" a component of the Valve that controls the flow of blood, as has been documented in medical and scientific literature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75. In the spring of 2013, a child died after her Valve, implanted two years earlier, was severely obstructed and deteriorated due to excessive calcification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that upon learning of these adverse events, Defendants failed to timely report the information to the FDA and attempted to conceal it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. For example, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants followed up on only a small number of 211 adverse event reports that they received, deflected blame for most of these adverse events, delayed production of adverse event reports to the FDA, and submitted insufficiently detailed annual reports that minimized problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nonetheless, Plaintiffs allege that the evidence of Valves prematurely failing led Defendants to seek to change the product, and ultimately to discontinue the previous version.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 72, 74. On July 1, 2013, Defendants applied to the FDA to change the Valve's manufacturing process to include an anticalcification treatment called phospholipid reduction treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. On April 18, 2014, the FDA approved these changes to the Valve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.F. is an infant born with cardiac birth defects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. On August 5, 2013, about a month after Defendants applied to change the Valve but before the new version was approved, A.F. underwent surgery at New York Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center to replace her pulmonary heart valve with the Valve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 59-60. Because the implanted Valve was the prior version, it did not have the anticalcification treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60, 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two years later, A.F.'s Valve prematurely failed due to deterioration and stiff leaflets that obstructed the flow of blood, causing drops in the level of oxygen in her blood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-71. Although these conditions increased the risk of surgical complications, on November 16, 2015, A.F. again underwent surgery to replace the failing Valve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 77. A.F. suffered complications, including a bilateral stroke causing partial paralysis of the left side of her body and seizures, resulting in permanent physical and mental injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 4, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the instant action, asserting claims for negligence, strict products liability, negligent failure to warn, and loss of A.F.'s services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-143. Plaintiffs assert their state-law claims \"only to the extent that they are parallel to and not different from or in addition to the requirements of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.
