Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Lori D. Justice purchased an automobile from Thornhill Ford Lincoln in Logan, West Virginia on August 13, 2014. Compl. \u00b6 4. \"As part of the purchase transaction, [Justice] also purchased so-called 'Gap Insurance' from Thornhill, through Defendant CNA National Warranty Corporation. [Justice] paid Nine Hundred 00/100 Dollars ($900.00) to CNA National Warranty Corporation for the insurance coverage.\" Compl. at \u00b6 5. CNA National Warranty Corporation (hereinafter \"CNA Warranty\") \"was not licensed to sell insurance at any time by the West Virginia Offices of the Insurance Commissioner.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.

Justice does not claim that any incident occurred resulting in the total loss of her vehicle, or\n   that she has otherwise attempted to obtain benefits from her Gap Insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 9, 2017, Justice filed a class action in the Circuit Court of Logan County, West Virginia individually and on behalf of \"[a]ll West Virginia consumers who purchased 'gap insurance' offered by CNA National Warranty Corporation and were charged a premium.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Justice claims that CNA Warranty violated West Virginia Code \u00a7 33-3-1 by selling Gap Insurance without a license, and that this unlawful sale violates the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (\"WVCCPA\"), W. Va. Code \u00a7 46a-2-127, barring unfair or deceptive debt collection practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1, 13, 14.

Thus, reading the above definitions together, the inquiry becomes whether CNA Warranty engaged in \"debt collection\" when it sold Gap Insurance to Justice; that is, whether CNA Warranty collected a \"claim\" from a \"consumer.\" Because a \"claim\" must be \"of a consumer,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578923\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/194/770/#p777\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8578923\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/194/770/#p777\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the inquiry collapses into the following issue: whether CNA Warranty's sale of Gap Insurance involved or gave rise to a \"claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A \"claim\" is, in turn, essentially defined as an \"obligation\" to pay a \"debt\" \"arising out of\" a \"transaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of those four terms is statutorily defined. The Supreme Court of Appeals instructs that \"[e]ach word of a statute should be given some effect and a statute must be construed in accordance with the import of its language. Undefined words and terms used in a legislative enactment will be given their common, ordinary and accepted meaning.\" Syl. Pt. 4,\n   <em>\n    Osborne v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11385481\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/211/667/\">\n    211 W. Va. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11385481\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/211/667/\">\n    567 S.E.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A superficial reading of the four undefined terms suggests that CNA Warranty's sale of Gap Insurance is outside the scope of the statute. The sale was a point of sale or point of purchase exchange, meaning Justice made a one-time, upfront payment\n   in exchange for the Gap Insurance. No other payment was required. A simultaneous exchange of this character does not invoke an impression of debt collection in the normal sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nevertheless, Justice argues that a \"claim\" encompasses a point of sale exchange. Justice analogizes this scenario to that in\n   <em>\n    Bass v. Stolper, Koritzinsky, Brewster, and Neider, S.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916424\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1322/\">\n    111 F.3d 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1997), a case decided under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , where a dishonored check arising from a supermarket transaction was held to be a \"debt\" under the statute. The court stated: \"As long as the transaction creates an obligation to pay, a debt is created. We harbor no doubt that a check evidences the drawer's obligation to pay for the purchases made with the check, and should the check be dishonored, the payment obligation remains.\"\n   <em>\n    Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916424\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1322/\">\n    111 F.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, those facts are not on point here, where payment was made simultaneously with the receipt of the Gap Insurance. A more relevant illustration was considered by this court in its decision in\n   <em>\n    Hinkle v. Matthews\n   </em>\n   , wherein the plaintiff offered the following scenario as an example of debt creation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Suppose, for argument's sake, a person makes a point of sale purchase at any every day retailer. After the sales person rings up the purchase, she \"solicit[s]\" a \"claim\" by telling the consumer what amount is \"due,\" and the consumer pays for the purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this illustration, however, no debt is created. If the consumer decides at the point of sale not to make the purchase and leaves the goods on the counter, no debt is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Justice nonetheless looks for support in the debt collection provisions' repeated used of the word \"any,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46A-2-122, and the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals \"that the word 'any,' when used in a statute, should be construed to mean, in a word, any.\" (ECF # 16 at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8581001\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/164/763/#p769\">\n    164 W.

The statutory definition of both the terms \"debt collection\" and \"claim\" include the word \"any\" as set forth in section 46A-2-122. Justice draws the conclusion \"that the Legislature's use of the word 'any' requires application of the WVCCPA to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   obligations arising from a transaction, whether that obligation is paid for at the point of sale or at a later time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   CNA Warranty counters that, if Justice's argument were accepted by the court, this \"would be an absurd result\" where \"every single business that operates in West Virginia will be deemed a debt collector pursuant to the WVCCPA.\" (ECF # 23 at 6; see also ECF # 16 at 5.) Instead, CNA Warranty urges that the \"correct interpretation is that without a deferred payment, balance due, delinquent payment, or continuing obligation of some sort there is no 'claim' under the WVCCPA.\" (ECF # 23 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To begin, the court returns to the fundamental definition of \"claim\" under the WVCCPA's debt collection provisions: an \"obligation\" to pay a \"debt\" \"arising out of\" a \"transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46A-2-122(a), (b). In legal parlance, a \"debt\" - the term of most import here in parsing a debt collection statute - is a \"[l]iability on a claim; a specific sum of money due by agreement or otherwise.\" Debt,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). The ordinary meaning of \"debt\" is \"something owed; obligation,\" or \"a state of being under obligation to pay or repay someone or something in return for something received; a state of owing.\" Debt,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   , https://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/debt. These definitions indicate that the plain\n   meaning of \"debt\" contemplates money due to another as a result of a prior agreement or exchange. Thus, payment in a point of sale exchange, as is the case here, is not payment of a \"debt\" or a \"claim\" inasmuch as payment is simply required to complete the exchange, if the payor\n   <em>\n    chooses\n   </em>\n   to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The remaining three terms support that conclusion. \"Obligation\" is vaguely defined and generally means a duty to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obligation,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ; Obligation,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the legal definition acknowledges that \"[t]he word has many wide and varied meanings. It may refer to anything that a person is bound to do or forbear from doing.\" Obligation,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   . \"Transaction\" and \"arise,\" however, provide more clarity. \"Transaction\" is defined as \"[t]he act or an instance of conducting business or other dealings; esp[ecially], the formation, performance, or discharge of a contract.\" Transaction,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Transaction,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   (meaning \"something transacted; especially an exchange or transfer of goods, services, or funds\"). And \"arise\" means \"[t]o result (from).\" Arise,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Arise,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   (meaning \"to originate from a source\"). Thus, a debt \"arising out of\" a \"transaction\" indicates that a \"claim\" follows the formation of a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Reading the four above definitions together, a \"claim\" is fairly and most logically read as a duty to pay money resulting from a prior contract or agreement. Correspondingly, a point of sale exchange does not give rise to a \"claim\" where payment is simultaneously made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court's conclusion is illustrated by basic contract principles.

Only then is there a contract upon which the retailer could collect on a subsequent duty to pay, if any such duty exists. Under a point of sale contract, however, there is no additional duty to pay and, as a consequence, no \"claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Turning to the circumstances of the present case, it is a general tenet of contract law that \"[t]he offeror is the master of his offer.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 30 cmt. a (Am. Law Inst. 1981). As such, the offeror may invite or even require a particular mode of acceptance, and further may impose the terms of acceptance within the offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=131%20S.E.%20253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30 cmts. a-c. Here, by making the $900 payment, Justice accepted the contract for Gap Insurance. Justice's agreement with CNA Warranty was thus a point of sale exchange. Accordingly, because she had no duty to pay CNA Warranty any money as a result of a prior purchase of Gap Insurance, CNA Warranty's sale of Gap Insurance is not a \"claim\" under the WVCCPA's debt collection provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Justice seeks support in case law parsing the WVCCPA and the federal FDCPA. Before turning to those cases, the court notes that none of the cases cited by Justice and CNA Warranty address the point of sale issue here, and the court's own thorough search did not yield any on-point opinions. This is unsurprising with respect to the FDCPA because, as Justice\n   points out, \"the FDCPA, unlike the [WVCCPA], does not apply to original creditors, but only to entities that are acting to collect debts on behalf of others or who have purchased defaulted debt.\" (ECF # 16 at 5 n. 3.) As for West Virginia and the remaining jurisdictions with similar debt collection provisions, the point of sale issue has not been addressed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As for the FDCPA, in\n   <em>\n    Pollice v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   held that \"the plain meaning of section 1692a(5) indicates that a 'debt' is created whenever a consumer is obligated to pay money as a result of a transaction whose subject is primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/\">\n    225 F.3d at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Arguably, the word \"whenever\" could be read as intending to encompass point of sale exchanges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Justice contends that the Supreme Court of Appeals has indicated support for her position. In\n   <em>\n    Dan's Carworld, LLC v. Serian\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Appeals held that \"when a consumer purchases a motor vehicle from a dealership, and the dealership accepts the trade in of another motor vehicle as payment, or partial payment, of the purchase price of the vehicle being purchased, subsequent efforts by the dealership to collect from the consumer any amounts due the dealership by virtue of the dealership's payment of the loan secured by the trade-in vehicle must comply with the [ WVCCPA].\" Syl.

Thus, Justice argues, the efforts to collect the debt do not have to \"occur subsequently to the creation of the obligation, but [rather, the court] recognized that a claim is created upon purchase.\" (ECF # 16 at 7, n. 5). And so it did - by virtue of the prior agreement for the purchase of a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dan's Carworld\n   </em>\n   , Syl.

Thus homeowner association fees, which Justice notes \"constituted the attempted collection of a [WV]CCPA 'claim' \" (ECF # 16 at 7, n. 4), could arguably be construed as a point of sale exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   These cases do not conflict with the court's decision here. In\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit acknowledged that the obligations at issue resulted from a prior agreement: homeowners agreed to make periodic payments in the future in exchange for ongoing water and sewer service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/\">\n    225 F.3d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
