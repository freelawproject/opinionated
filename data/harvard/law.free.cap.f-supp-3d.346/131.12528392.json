MCFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises from a flood caused by a ruptured sewer line, which made premises owned by Ward Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church unusable for Delores McGee and the child development facility she operated. Ms. McGee seeks damages from the Church and Erie Indemnity Company on various legal theories. But the lease between the Church and Ms. McGee waives \"all claims\" to the maximum extent permitted by law, and Ms. McGee's noncontract claim for gross negligence is insufficient. Ms. McGee also improperly names Erie Indemnity Company as a defendant. Erie Indemnity is not the insurer under Ms. McGee's insurance contract but the insurer's attorney-in-fact. The Court will therefore grant the Church's Motion for Summary Judgment, Erie Indemnity's Motion to Dismiss, and Ms. McGee's Motion to Dismiss the Church's counterclaims based on the same suit-waiving lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2012, Ward Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Church leased a building in the northeast quadrant of the District of Columbia to Ms. McGee, who was doing business as Emergent Preparatory Academy II. Second Am. Compl. (Am. Compl.) \u00b6 9; Lease Agreement, ECF No. 30-3 at 4 (Lease). The Academy was a school for infants and children ages two to twelve. Am. Compl. \u00b6 9. The lease was for five years and was governed by District of Columbia law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. Ms. McGee paid a $4,500 security deposit and made rent payments of $4,000 per month thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With about a month remaining on the lease in May 2017, tree roots ruptured a sewer line, leading to sewage causing severe damage to the building's walls and floors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. Ms. McGee immediately notified the Church.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education issued an abatement order the next day that required the Academy to cease operations immediately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The abatement order remained in effect until \"specified remediation services were performed, including air quality services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But if the remediation did not start within two days, Ms. McGee would have to surrender her operating license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A remediation services company told Ms. McGee that the affected walls and floor would need to be replaced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. McGee claims that the Church had \"prior, actual knowledge of the sewer line's dangerous condition because of numerous other sewage backups,\" one of which required \"installation of a sewer cleanout line for regular maintenance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. That cleanout line, she says, was not \"properly maintain[ed].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. McGee maintained an insurance policy, covering January 2017 to January 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. She alleges that the \"only parties to the Policy are [Ms.] McGee and [Erie] Indemnity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The Policy states that Erie Indemnity Company serves as the attorney-in-fact for Erie Insurance Exchange and its subscribers, and that the Exchange is one of two \"Member Companies\" within the Erie Insurance Group-the other being Erie Insurance Property and Casualty Company. ECF No. 31-2 at 11-12 (page numbers created by the Court's Case Management/Electronic Case Filing System (CM/ECF) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the flood, Ms. McGee says that Erie Indemnity would not authorize insurance payments for the state-required mediation, although it paid the remediation company to remove damaged items.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Ms. McGee paid a plumber to fix the sewer line.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. McGee also claims that Erie Indemnity promised to replace her personal property but has since refused to pay for her damages under her insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. With no insurance payments forthcoming, Ms. McGee and the Church disagreed about who should pay for remediation; each claimed that the other was responsible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. The Lease obligated the Church as landlord to \"restore the damage to the Premises\" after a \"fire or other casualty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Ms. McGee claims that this obligation applied to the sewage damage and that the Church never intended to comply, even on the day the contract was signed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In any event, the remediation services were not performed, and Ms. McGee lost her operating license for the Academy on May 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Two days later, she repudiated the Lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In September 2017, Ms. McGee wrote a letter demanding \"a pro-rated refund of the rent paid for May 2017, and her full $4,500 security deposit,\" which the Church ignored.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. With her business shut down, Ms. McGee incurred severe losses, including over $300,000 in business losses, and monthly storage costs of $1,316.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Ms. McGee eventually received insurance payments of $44,000 for personal property damage and $50,000 for business losses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. She alleges that her damages exceed these levels and that Erie Indemnity violated the insurance policy terms by refusing to compensate her for the full effect of the flood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The operative complaint makes claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, against both the Church and Erie Indemnity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-62. Against the Church only, Ms. McGee also\n   brings claims for gross negligence and conversion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-71. In response, the Church filed a counter-claim for $75,000, claiming that Ms. McGee violated the lease by underpaying her rent, not paying required utility bills, and failing to repair the premises. Counterclaim, ECF No. 16-1. The Church has also moved for summary judgment, claiming that the lease contains a full waiver of \"all claims\" between the parties and that Ms. McGee's non-contract claims fail on their own terms. For its part, Erie Indemnity moves to dismiss, arguing that Ms. McGee has named the wrong insurance entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To prevail on a motion for summary judgment, a movant must show that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Mot. Summ. J. 6. That waiver is expansive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [I]f and to the extent that applicable law permits a full waiver of claims between landlords and tenants in leases such as this Lease, then Landlord and Tenant waive all claims against the other ... for any loss, damage or injury, notwithstanding the negligence of either party in causing a loss or the availability of insurance proceeds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lease \u00b6 4.4. The waiver is preceded by a long discussion of how \"Landlord and Tenant ... acknowledge that the use of insurance is the best way to protect against loss,\" and an agreement that \"in the event of loss or damage ... such loss\" will be satisfied first from insurance proceeds, then from \"additional insurance proceeds that would have been paid to the party\n   suffering the loss ... had the insurance required ... been carried by such party,\" and \"\n   <em>\n    finally\n   </em>\n   , by the third party (provided such third party is not an agent or employee of Tenant) causing the loss or damage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The paragraph never mentions recovery between Landlord and Tenant in a contract suit. In short, the parties intended to waive all contract claims against each other.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ms. McGee makes various attempts to escape this language. None succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, she argues that the waiver does not apply to the sewer line, because the entire Lease applies only to the \"Premises,\" a defined term that includes only the \"Building ... the land, and the ground on which the Building sits.\" Opp. Mot. Summ. J. at 6, ECF No. 30. Assuming for purposes of argument that Ms. McGee is right that the Lease and its waivers exclude the sewer line from the \"Premises,\" her contract claims would\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   fail. The waiver extends to \"all claims ... for any loss, damage or injury\" that might arise \"in ... this Lease.\" Lease \u00b6 4.4. Thus, Ms. McGee has waived all lease-based contract claims. All that remains is to figure out which claims are contract claims and dismiss them. It is irrelevant that some waived claims might be factually linked to a something outside the contract, such as a non-leased appurtenance. This argument is a red herring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. McGee's second argument is that the liability waiver is unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. 7. She argues that \"disclaimers of strict liability are not enforceable,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p247\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.35 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Potomac Plaza Terraces v.

Implying that the Church violated this statute by failing to clean up the sewage, Ms. McGee argues that the liability waiver is unenforceable, since it would absolve the Church of liability for a strict liability offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This argument has so many holes it is hard to count them. First, the District of Columbia \"has long employed an 'objective law' of contracts,\" under which the plain meaning of the contract language governs \"unless there is fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    Abdelrhman v. Ackerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7305509\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/76/883/#p888\">\n    76 A.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888 (D.C. 2013). Without fraud,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   duress, or mutual mistake, the waiver's plain language is fully binding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdelrhman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7305509\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/76/883/#p888\">\n    76 A.3d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Child Development Facilities Act binds Ms. McGee's conduct as the party licensed to run a child development facility,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the Church's conduct as landlord. Reply in Support of Mot. Summ. J. 4-5 (Reply Mot. Summ. J.);\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2051 (requiring a license, and authorizing regulation of licensees). Third, strict liability is a products liability concept from torts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Soft Sheen Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7915305\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/486/712/#p720\">\n    486 A.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 720 (D.C. 1985) (\"a plaintiff could recover if he established, first, that the product was defective ... and second,\n   that as a result of the defect, the product caused injury.\"). Ms. McGee cites no authority applying the concept in the context of a lease. In sum, Ms. McGee's strict liability argument is not strictly relevant, and the liability waiver stands unrebutted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Ms. McGee points out that the District of Columbia law allows waiver of negligent conduct, but not \"gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional conduct.\" Opp. Mot. Summ. J. 10 &amp; n.50 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carleton v. Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8412289\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/901/174/#p181\">\n    901 A.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181 (D.C. 2006) ). In addition to her gross negligence claim, she tries to finagle her way out of the waiver of\n   <em>\n    contract\n   </em>\n   claims by asserting that the Church intentionally failed to clean up the sewage or maintain the sewer line.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. But even if Ms. McGee could show that the Church committed reckless or intentional misconduct, the rule that she cites allows recovery only under those theories in the\n   <em>\n    tort\n   </em>\n   context. Ms. McGee's own citations make this clear.\n   <em>\n    Carleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8412289\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/901/174/#p181\">\n    901 A.2d at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Courts do not enforce agreements to exempt parties\n   <em>\n    from tort liability\n   </em>\n   if the liability results from that party's own gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional conduct.\") (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). This rule cannot save Ms. McGee's contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the Lease waived all contract claims, the Church is entitled to summary judgment on those four counts: declaratory relief, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and conversion. All seek to enforce the Lease and so sound in contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

The goal of the exchange is for an individual or entity to obtain insurance by entering into a pool of subscribers who all agree to insure one another, subject to certain conditions. Thus, in a reciprocal insurance exchange, each subscriber is\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   an insurer and an insured.... The association is not operated for profit, but acts through a person or corporation serving as attorney-in-fact for the organization. Although the powers of the attorney-in-fact may vary from exchange to exchange, the role is largely administrative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    James G. Davis Const. Corp. v.

Md. 2013) (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This background makes the relevant legal relationships-and Ms. McGee's Policy-clear. Erie Indemnity, as attorney-in-fact, conducts the business of Erie Insurance Exchange and its subscribers, and Ms. McGee has agreed to allow Erie Indemnity to play this role:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Your signing the \"Subscriber's Agreement,\" which includes a limited power-of-attorney, permits Erie Indemnity Company, as Attorney-in-Fact, to make reciprocal insurance contracts between\n   you and other Subscribers and otherwise manage the business of the Erie Insurance Exchange. This power-of-attorney applies only to your insurance business at the Exchange and is limited to the purposes described in the \"Subscriber's Agreement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Policy, ECF No. 31-2 at 12. For \"policies issued by\n   <em>\n    Erie Insurance Exchange\n   </em>\n   ,\" Erie Indemnity is allowed to keep 25% of the premium ... as compensation for ... acting as Attorney-in-Fact ... managing the business and affairs of Erie Insurance Exchange ... and ... paying general administrative expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. In simple terms, Erie Insurance Exchange issues the policies, using subscribers' premiums to pay claims and expenses. Erie Indemnity serves as attorney-in-fact for the Exchange and its subscribers. Unfortunately for Ms. McGee, that makes Erie Indemnity a non-party to this contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ms. McGee counters by arguing that Erie Insurance Exchange\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   enter into contracts, and so Erie Indemnity must be \"the real party in interest.\" Opp. Mot. Dismiss 11. She cites one of Erie Indemnity's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which it states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   By virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have the ability to enter into contractual relationships and therefore Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange for all claims handling services, investment management services, and certain other common overhead and service department functions in accordance with the subscriber's agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ECF No. 11-1 at 5. Ms. McGee focuses on the phrase \"the Exchange does not have the ability to enter into contractual relationships,\" but the larger context makes clear that the Exchange has only a\n   <em>\n    practical\n   </em>\n   inability to enter into contracts, not a\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   inability. The Exchange is \"an unincorporated association of ... subscribers, who exchange risks among themselves.\"\n   <em>\n    James G. Davis Const.

Without a corporate structure or employees, the entity has nobody to put pen to paper. That is the role played by Erie Indemnity. The SEC filing goes on to say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Our [Erie Indemnity's] primary purpose is to manage the affairs at the Exchange for the benefit of the policyholders. The Exchange is our sole customer and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange. We have no direct competition in providing these services to the Exchange.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ECF No. 11-1 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ms. McGee's next argument is based on the Policy. She highlights the fact that the contract includes \"a limited power-of-attorney among the Subscribers and the Erie Indemnity Company, as Attorney-in-Fact,\" and infers that this makes Erie Indemnity a party to the contract. Opp. 10 (citation omitted). That may be true in the barest and most technical sense: Erie Indemnity has contracted to become attorney-in-fact for all the Exchange's subscribers. But Ms. McGee has won the battle and lost the war. She is suing Erie Indemnity Company to enforce the Policy, in search of insurance payments that only the\n   <em>\n    insurer\n   </em>\n   can be liable for.
