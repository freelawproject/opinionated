Lee, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Michael Rose and Timothy Stratton played football for Purdue University from 1996 to 2001. Purdue is in the Big Ten Conference (\"Big Ten\"), a Division I conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\"NCAA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Over the course of their college football careers at Purdue, Rose and Stratton experienced thousands of repetitive concussive and subconcussive impacts to their heads. Now they are dealing with debilitating neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive impairments due to repetitive brain trauma. As a result, Rose and Stratton, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, have sued for negligence, fraud, breach of express and implied contract, and unjust enrichment, alleging\n   that the NCAA and the Big Ten were uniquely aware of the risks of repetitive brain trauma and, yet, exposed players to those risks with no regard for players' health and safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The NCAA and Big Ten have moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6). In addition, the Big Ten has moved for a more definitive statement under Rule 12(e). For the reasons herein, the motions are granted in part and denied in part [12][16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Rose and Stratton at Purdue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each Saturday during football season, millions of fans watch college football games from their couches or in packed stadiums throughout the United States. Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 1. Nearly one hundred thousand college football players compete each year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rose played the position of linebacker for Purdue from 1996 to 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Weighing just over 200 pounds, Rose was small for his position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. But what Rose lacked in size, he made up in intensity, once earning him the title of Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stratton played the position of tight end for Purdue from 1998 to 2001.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86. By the end of his college career, he was the school's all-time leader in receptions, with 204 in total.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Neither Rose nor Stratton had ever experienced a concussion before playing college football. However, while playing for Purdue in practices and games, both were subjected to thousands of impacts greater than 10 g's (\"g\" being a measure of gravitational force, where 1 g is equal to the force of gravity at the Earth's surface).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 80, 85, 89, 94. Generally, the majority of football-related hits to the head exceed 20 g's, and some approach 100 g's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the time that Rose and Stratton were playing football at Purdue, the Big Ten and the NCAA did not inform them of an epidemic that was slowly injuring and killing student athletes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The Big Ten and the NCAA knew that repetitive subconcussive and concussive impacts to football players' heads created a serious risk of neurodegenerative disorders and diseases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 56-65. But Defendants did not change their concussion treatment protocols until 2010, several years too late for Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Now, long after their college football days have concluded, Rose and Stratton suffer from neurodegenerative diseases and disorders caused by repetitive brain trauma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-83, 89-92. Rose deals with ringing in his ears, memory loss, depression, and abrupt and uncontrollable mood swings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. Stratton struggles with headaches, migraines, ringing in the ears, memory loss, depression, and anxiety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants' Roles in Safeguarding the Health and Safety of Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The NCAA was created in 1906 in response to the excessive brutality and alarming rate of head injuries in college football.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Thus, the NCAA's original purpose was to create and enforce rules to protect young people from head injuries resulting from dangerous athletic practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To this end, the NCAA Constitution states that its primary principle is to ensure that: \"Intercollegiate athletics programs shall be conducted in a manner designed to protect and enhance the physical and educational well-being of student\n   athletes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. To carry out this goal, the NCAA promulgates and implements standard-sport regulations and requirements, such as the NCAA Constitution, Operating Bylaws, and Administrative Bylaws, which provide detailed instructions on game and practice rules pertaining to player well-being and safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, the NCAA publishes a Sports Medicine Handbook (\"Handbook\") annually.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The Handbook includes official policies and guidelines for the treatment and prevention of sports-related injuries, as well as return-to-play guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These policies and guidelines recognize that \"student-athletes rightfully assume that those who sponsor intercollegiate athletics have taken reasonable precautions to minimize the risk of injury from athletics participation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a member conference in the NCAA, the Big Ten is required to comply with, administer, and enforce all applicable NCAA rules, regulations, policies, and guidelines to protect the health and safety of Purdue University football players, including Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39, 41. Furthermore, the NCAA promises to assist the Big Ten in its efforts to fully comply with NCAA rules and regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. As compared to Plaintiffs and other Purdue University football players, the NCAA and the Big Ten are in a superior position to know of and to mitigate the risks of concussions and traumatic brain injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Symptoms and Treatment of Concussive and Subconcussive Impacts to the Head\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When someone suffers a severe impact to the head, they may exhibit: (1) dizziness; (2) tiredness; (3) nausea; (4) vomiting; (5) headaches; (6) blurred vision or light sensitivity; (7) slurred speech; (8) difficulty concentrating or decision-making; (9) difficulty balancing or lack of coordination; (10) unexplained anxiety or irritability; or (11) memory loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Symptoms may last for one or two weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. A concussed player, however, may not recognize the signs of a concussion, and the symptoms themselves may prevent him from recognizing he has suffered a concussion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After a person experiences a concussion, his or her brain needs time to heal to prevent long-term damage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. After diagnosing a patient with a concussion, doctors generally prohibit him or her from returning to normal activities for a few weeks after a concussion, due to the brain's particular vulnerability to further injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Individuals who do not recover from a concussion within a few weeks are diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The symptoms of post-concussion syndrome can last for months or can be permanent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When a football player experiences minor, subconcussive brain trauma, he may not exhibit symptoms of a concussion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. However, even minor brain trauma may eventually lead to neuropathological and neurophysiological alterations, including neuronal damage, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brainstem evoked potentials, and reduced speed of information processing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Studies Establishing the Dangers Associated with Football-related Brain Trauma\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs cite numerous studies regarding the risks associated with football-related brain trauma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-67. Plaintiffs allege that the NCAA and the Big Ten were in a comparatively superior position than football players to know about these studies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For example, in 1952, an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine recommended a three-strike rule for concussions in football, which recommended that players cease to play football\n   permanently after the third concussion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. In a 1967 study, Drs. Hughes and Hendrix examined how severe impacts affected brain activity in football players by utilizing electroencephalograms (\"EEGs\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Shortly thereafter, doctors identified a potentially fatal condition known as \"Second Impact Syndrome,\" referring to a condition when additional injury to an already-concussed brain triggers swelling that the skull cannot accommodate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition, studies conducted by Boston University concluded that repeated concussions trigger progressive degeneration of brain tissue and lead to an increased risk of depression, dementia, and suicide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. Furthermore, autopsies of former football players' brains have shown that 96% of National Football League (\"NFL\") players had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (\"CTE\"), a debilitating condition found in those with a history of repetitive brain trauma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. CTE was found in 79% of all autopsied brains of former players who played at any level of football.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, numerous other studies have been published in medical journals warning of the dangers of single concussions, multiple concussions, and football-related head trauma from multiple concussions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. For instance, studies have shown that repetitive subconcussive and concussive impacts to the head create a serious risk of long term effects, including memory loss, dementia, depression, CTE, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other related diseases and symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. As a result of these and numerous other studies, medical professionals began recommending changes to the game of football and how concussion-related injuries should be handled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that, despite the scientific evidence throughout the years regarding concussions, the NCAA did not conduct its own concussion-related studies until 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. One of these studies concluded that football players who had previously sustained a concussion were more likely to have future concussion-related injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Another NCAA study concluded that collegiate football players \"may require several days for recovery of symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and postural instability after [a] concussion,\" and that concussions are \"followed by a complex cascade of ionic, metabolic, and physiological events that can adversely affect cerebral function for several days to weeks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. Nevertheless, the NCAA and the Big Ten did not change their concussion treatment protocols until 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Claims and Defendants' Rule 12 Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs have filed a six-count complaint, asserting state common law claims of negligence (Count 1), fraudulent concealment (Count 2), breach of express contract (Count 3), breach of implied contract (Count 4), breach of express contract as third-party beneficiaries (Count 5), and unjust enrichment (Count 6). The Big Ten moves to dismiss the complaint based on the statute of limitations and raises additional arguments as to the fraudulent-concealment, breach-of-implied-contract, and unjust-enrichment claims.

Discovery will also shed light on whether neurodegenerative disorders and diseases are latent conditions caused by the occurrence of injuries of which a reasonable person should have been aware, as the Big Ten asserts. Here at the pleading stage, however, the alleged facts and disputed issues stand in stark contrast to\n   <em>\n    Golla\n   </em>\n   , which was a summary judgment case.

The Big Ten argues that, to the extent that Plaintiffs intend to rely upon the doctrine of fraudulent concealment to extend the two year limitations period, they cannot do so because they have not pleaded the fraudulent concealment exception with particularity as required by Rule 9(b).
