BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before a new pharmaceutical drug can come to market, testing must prove it to be both safe and effective. Plaintiff Center for Responsible Science believes that the Food and Drug Administration's informed-consent regulation governing these initial human tests does not sufficiently warn participants of the dangers they face. CRS thus proposed that the FDA amend its regulation to add three additional disclosures, but the Agency demurred. Plaintiff then turned to the courts. It filed a one-count Complaint under the Administrative Procedure Act against Scott Gottlieb, the FDA's current commissioner, asking the Court to require what CRS could not convince the Agency to adopt. The threshold question - and the one that ultimately trips Plaintiff up - is whether it can invoke this Court's jurisdiction. Once before, this Court found that CRS had failed to sufficiently demonstrate Article III standing, but sent it back to the drawing board instead of dismissing the case. CRS now returns with added detail. Its Amended Complaint, however, still falls short of establishing the organizational injury necessary for this suit to continue. As round two thus yields the same result, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Only a brief rehearsal of the facts is necessary to tee up the sole jurisdictional issue at play. For a deeper dive into the governing regulatory scheme and requested disclosures that color this case, the Court directs interested readers to its first Opinion on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Responsible Sci. v. Gottlieb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525311\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/5/#p6\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6-8 (D.D.C. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FDA regulations require that certain information \"shall be provided to each subject\" of a clinical trial within the Agency's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.25\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Simply put, CRS believes that these disclosures are not enough. It contends that participants should be warned that testing drugs on laboratory animals - which generally precedes clinical trials involving humans - can be a poor predictor of safety and efficacy in human subjects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 (Pl. Opp.) at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   So CRS took action. Armed with its criticism, Plaintiff submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA in May of 2014 requesting that the Agency amend its disclosure requirements for human subjects in clinical trials to provide three additional warnings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 (Am. Compl.), \u00b6 37. Paraphrased, these warnings would disclose that prior animal tests may not be predictive of safety in humans and that, in the past, participants died during clinical trials as a result of ingesting the tested drugs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.25\">\n    , \u00b6 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The warning would also caution participants that the drug may not be effective in treating their condition even if that efficacy was shown in animal-based tests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant denied the Petition. It reasoned that the requested modification was overbroad, since the disclosures were relevant only to drug trials, but the regulations cover all clinical trials. The FDA also decided that these additions would preclude needed flexibility in informed-consent disclosures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.25\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 152, 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unhappy with this response, CRS filed suit under the Administrative Procedure Act. It alleged that the Agency's rejection of its Petition was arbitrary and capricious as well as beyond the FDA's statutory authority. In the first round of this litigation, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's Complaint without reaching the merits of its contention, finding that CRS had not cleared the first hurdle of any suit in federal court: demonstrating Article III standing. Open to the possibility that Plaintiff's deficiency could lie in the inartfulness of its pleading rather than a lack of interest in the case, the Court granted CRS a second bite at the apple and permitted leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Responsible Sci.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525311\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/5/#p6\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CRS now returns with a beefed-up Complaint. It provides the Court with additional detail concerning both its mission and the actions it has taken relevant to the challenged conduct. Established in 2012, Plaintiff is a \"non-profit watchdog group\" whose mission serves to \"promote advances in regulatory science.\" Am. Compl., \u00b6 1. Although its interests are broad ranging, CRS realizes this mission in part by promoting \"safer, more effective outcomes during human trials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 191. To perform this function, it monitors clinical trials for deaths and other serious adverse events and provides education to various stakeholders interested in human test methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4, 192. CRS's staff consists of one full-time, salaried employee and one part-time volunteer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CRS also provides more detail on the actions that it alleges its employee took in response to the FDA's denial of the Citizen Petition. These actions fall, roughly, into three buckets. First, this employee - Tamara Drake - has been compiling data of adverse events in clinical trials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 198. Plaintiff does not hide, however, that Drake has long performed this task, dating back to before the denial of the Citizen Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, Drake began compiling a list of all clinical trials that were either in the process of recruiting human participants or planned to begin recruiting shortly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 198. Unlike the aggregation of adverse events, she did not begin this task until after the FDA's denial of CRS's\n   Citizen Petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl. Opp. at 26. Starting in May 2018, approximately one year after the denial of the Citizen Petition, but only two weeks after this Court first dismissed CRS's Complaint for lack of standing, Drake also began contacting the principal investigators of these trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 198; Pl. Opp. at 27. She urged each investigator to voluntarily adopt the disclosures that the FDA had decided not to require.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 198. Only a small percentage of investigators have responded to CRS's outreach efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, and finally, CRS points to public education. Through press releases and other mechanisms (which it has not specified), CRS has notified the public and other stakeholders of the FDA's denial of the Citizen Petition and the \"limitations of animal testing.\" Am. Compl., \u00b6 204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Once again, Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) because, the Agency says, CRS's Amended Complaint still does not establish that it has Article III standing. So once more into the breach of organizational standing ventures the Court. This time, like King Henry V's final assault on Harfleur, proves the last. Despite its renewed efforts, CRS's alleged injury does not clear Article III's bar, which precludes it from maintaining this challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In evaluating Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Court must \"treat the complaint's factual allegations as true ... and must grant plaintiff 'the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sparrow v.

But the flagging reader need not despair, for not much need be said about the two following prongs. The tests for causation and redressability mirror, with little added gloss, the requirements for a non-organizational plaintiff who attempts to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts.

Although CRS primarily presses one argument - namely, that it is injured because it has turned its attention to urging principal investigators to provide the warnings that the FDA refused to require - two other allegations of injury still linger within the Amended Complaint. To get to the root of the issue, the Court thus first clears away\n   this underbrush. CRS's focus, as it turns out, is prudent: neither of these two other allegations requires much more than a passing glance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First up is Plaintiff's point in the Amended Complaint that, as a consequence of the FDA's denial of its Citizen Petition, CRS has been \"forced to pay its one full-time employee to spend significant time identifying and aggregating data on clinical trials in which there have been deaths and serious adverse events.\" Am. Compl., \u00b6 198. The Government posits that this activity cannot possibly serve as CRS's injury-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (Def. MTD) at 15-16; ECF No. 18 (Def. Reply) at 4-6. Its ink, however, ultimately need not have been spilled: the parties are in agreement here. In its Opposition, CRS eschews any reliance on \"compiling the chart of clinical treatment-related deaths\" as the basis for its Article III injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 42. This concession is logical. Nowhere in its Amended Complaint (or Opposition, for that matter) does CRS sufficiently draw out the connection between the FDA's conduct and CRS's action. Plaintiff does not allege, for instance, that there would be fewer adverse events in clinical trials if investigators provided warnings about the limitations of animal testing. Nor is it intuitively clear why that would be the case. With this gap in the logical chain, the Court is unable to conclude that CRS's actions are \"in response to, and to counteract the effects of\" Defendant's challenged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Equal Rights Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091105,3555010\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1136/\">\n    633 F.3d at 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Plaintiff's brief, with refreshing honesty, makes clear that its employee engaged in this activity well before the FDA denied its Citizen Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CRS's allegation of injury stemming from its public-education initiatives, although not conceded, fares no better. Plaintiff asserts that it has diverted resources \"to notifying the public and other stakeholders, through press releases and other mechanisms, of the denial of the Petition and the limitations of animal testing.\" Am. Compl., \u00b6 204. Such activity, however, can only constitute an injury-in-fact if it subjects the organization to \" 'operational costs beyond those normally expended' to carry out its advocacy mission.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769742,3716054\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/6/\">\n    667 F.3d at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Taxpayers Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415956,5709591\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1428/\">\n    68 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1434 ). This is where the argument stumbles. CRS's self-described advocacy mission includes \"provid[ing] education to various stakeholders regarding the availability of human-relevant tests methods.\" Am. Compl., \u00b6 192. The educational campaign here appears part and parcel of that mission, and the record indicates that the current activity does not extend beyond what it does in the normal course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For instance, the Government points out, and Plaintiff does not dispute, that CRS engaged in various public-education initiatives regarding the limitations of animal testing well before the denial of the Citizen Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MTD at 17-18; Def. Reply at 13-14. Of course, any notification about the denial of the Citizen Petition occurred after the actual denial. But the general rule is that such additional notifications, when consistent with the organization's advocacy mission, cannot alone confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting as insufficient plaintiff's assertion that it \"would have to increase the resources that it spends on educating the general public and its members\" regarding the effect of the challenged agency action);\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Taxpayers Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415956,5709591\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/1428/\">\n    68 F.3d at 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that organization's \"self-serving observation that it has expended resources to educate its members and others regarding [the challenged law] does not present an injury in fact\").

Compl., \u00b6 204. That is not enough. Such a conclusory statement cannot save the day when the record reveals the educational campaign at issue to be functionally similar to the organization's normal-course campaigns independent of the challenged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With those two asserted injuries out of the way, the Court can turn to the allegation with the most meat, and the one that CRS urges most actively. Plaintiff alleges that its sole full-time employee has turned her attention to finding clinical trials that are (or are soon to be) recruiting participants and urging the principal investigators of such trials to adopt the disclosures that the FDA refused to require by denying the Citizen Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 198; Pl. Opp. at 35. CRS says that this activity has precluded the employee from undertaking a variety of other initiatives - unrelated to animal-testing disclosures - that it would like her to pursue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Running this argument through the two-step test articulated by the D.C. Circuit, however, leaves no room for intuition. Simply put, it does not clear the first hurdle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is settled law in this Circuit that an organizational plaintiff must first show that the challenged conduct made its activities more difficult.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    797 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1094 ;\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As its Amended Complaint expounds, now in considerable detail, CRS engages in a number of educational and advocacy initiatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 186-92. Satisfying standing thus requires that Plaintiff show that its\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to engage in these tasks has been impaired. This CRS has not done. Nowhere does Plaintiff satisfactorily explain how, as a result of the FDA's denial of the Citizen Petition, it has become \"more difficult\" for CRS to perform any of these educational or advocacy operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BMC Marketing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839001,5706570\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/1268/\">\n    28 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1276 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring that challenged conduct \"inhibit[ ]\" the organization's \"daily operations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   CRS offers two responses. It first points out that Drake (Plaintiff's sole employee) must now urge principal investigators of clinical trials to adopt the disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 35, 38; Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 198-203. This activity has been made more difficult, CRS says, for had the FDA required the disclosures CRS wants, there would be no need for Drake's endeavors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 203. Second, CRS switches gears and contends that the challenged conduct instead inhibits Plaintiff's other advocacy initiatives - unrelated to disclosures about animal testing in drug trials - that it planned to pursue absent the FDA's action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 35, 38; Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 206-12. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Start with the timeline underlying Plaintiff's alleged injury. Driven by its mission, CRS filed a Citizen Petition seeking to codify certain disclosures within the FDA's informed-consent regulations. When the Agency refused, Plaintiff took up the mantle and began directly urging investigators to include these disclosures. Nowhere in this account does CRS allege any activity predating the denial of its Citizen Petition that is made more difficult by the denial of the Petition. At the time of the FDA's denial, the only item impaired was CRS's desire that human participants in clinical trials be given information about the limitations of animal testing. Without more, that is not enough because a \"conflict between a defendant's conduct and an organization's\n   mission is alone insufficient to establish Article III standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Treasury Employees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7643984,3697996\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/1423/\">\n    101 F.3d at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To borrow applicable language from another district court analyzing this same body of law, \"[i]t is clear from the Circuit's holdings ... that having a concrete injury to an organization's interests means that the challenged activity must hamper the organization's ability to do what it does, and that complaining that the organization's ultimate goal has been made more difficult is not sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    New England Anti-Vivisection Soc'y v. United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272277\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/142/#p166\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (D.D.C. 2016) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Turning next to the post-denial conduct - i.e., Drake's efforts at contacting clinical trials - it would seem anomalous for a party to be able to build a program in response to an agency's action, then achieve Article III standing by alleging that the agency's action impaired that program's operation. It is not at all clear, moreover, that the FDA's action does, in fact, inhibit Plaintiff's activity in the manner intended by the D.C. Circuit. CRS does not allege, for instance, that it is \"deprived ... of key information\" necessary to urge investigators to adopt the desired disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor does it contend that the FDA's action cuts off a means of performing this task.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant's conduct may create a need for CRS's program; it does not make the program more difficult. In sum, the Agency's denial of the Citizen Petition has no doubt frustrated CRS's goal that every clinical participant receive a warning about the limitations of animal testing, but it has not impeded Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to engage in its advocacy and educational functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But wait, retorts CRS: its activities\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   been impeded because it has diverted resources away from other functions it would like to perform. These functions, it says - including, among other things, initiatives regarding skin sensitization and eye irritation and a new petition demanding FDA transparency - have thus been thwarted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This second argument also lands wide of the mark. Plaintiff confuses the two prongs of the injury-in-fact inquiry. That CRS has diverted resources (in the form of Drake's time) is certainly relevant to step two - \"whether the organization used its resources to counteract that harm,\"\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   919 - but comes into play only after Plaintiff shows an initial impairment to its programs. Put otherwise, an organization can only divert resources to counteract \"that harm\" once there is a harm to counteract. The diversion itself cannot alone constitute the harm. Holding otherwise would be hopelessly circular. The law here, too, is clear: organizational standing is not based on \"diversion of resources from one program to another, but rather on the alleged injury that the defendants' actions themselves had inflicted upon the organization's programs.\"\n   <em>\n    BMC Marketing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839001,5706570\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/1268/\">\n    28 F.3d at 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (interpreting\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p379\">\n    455 U.S. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p379\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Acad. of Oral Medicine &amp; Toxicology v.

Plaintiff must show, therefore, that something about the challenged action itself - rather than the organization's response to it - makes the organization's task more difficult.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New England Anti-Vivisection Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272277\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/142/#p166\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"organizational standing requires more than a sincere and strong objection to the challenged government action and a stated intention to use the organization's resources to oppose it\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   One factual point bears mentioning. In the controlling cases in which courts have found organizational standing satisfied, the activity impaired and the conduct challenged bore a close connection. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   , housing discrimination impaired the organization's counseling and referral services for homeseekers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p379\">\n    455 U.S. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p379\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   , the USDA's refusal to apply an animal-welfare statute to birds impeded PETA's educational and advocacy initiatives on behalf of birds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the case here. CRS's argument attempts to connect the FDA's refusal to amend informed-consent regulations regarding the limitations of animal testing to initiatives having nothing to do with these regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 211. Its thwarted initiatives include \"a petition and guidance related to skin sensitization\" and \"an amendment to a skin and eye irritation petition to include a discussion of new technology.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, Plaintiff presents a pure diversion case. This, too, separates CRS from the territory controlling law has deemed sufficient for organizational standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Placing this case within the factual contexts charted by past cases further confirms the Court's conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Court of Appeals hinged its standing decision on two harms directly attributable to the challenged conduct. The court concluded that USDA's refusal to apply an animal-welfare statute to birds - the action challenged by PETA - \"deprived PETA of key information that it relies on to educate the public\" and thus directly impeded PETA's ability to perform its public-education services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, USDA's refusal precluded PETA from \"filing complaints with the USDA,\" which cut off a means by which PETA advanced its mission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772067,4331462\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1087/\">\n    at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CRS makes no such allegation here: as mentioned above, the FDA's refusal does not limit any flow of information or means of redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Along the same line, in the bulk of cases satisfying organizational standing, the plaintiff organization engaged in direct services to individuals that were made more difficult by the challenged action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p379\">\n    455 U.S. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305645\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/363/#p379\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Abigail Alliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757032,3560061\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/129/\">\n    469 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   132-33 ;\n   <em>\n    BMC Marketing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839001,5706570\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/1268/\">\n    28 F.3d at 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, CRS provides no such direct services and thus cannot claim that the FDA's denial of the Citizen Petition impaired its daily operations in the same manner as this line of cases. If CRS had alleged, for example, that it provided direct services to clinical participants - perhaps, for example, by providing some independent review of each trial to these members or clients - this might be a different case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Instead, the cases in which courts have failed to find standing more closely track the circumstances here. In\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch\n   </em>\n   , for example, the D.C. Circuit rejected as insufficient the plaintiff's claim that, following the FDA's refusal to provide particular poultry-inspection services, it would \"increase the amount of resources that it spends encouraging its members ... to avoid poultry\" that had been subject to an insufficient inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, like this one, the organization directed its resources to mitigating a risk that it thought the government should have exercised more diligence in preventing. District courts in this Circuit have similarly and repeatedly concluded that a mere diversion of resources to advance the advocacy mission of an organization is insufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cigar Ass'n of Am. v. U.S. Food &amp; Drug Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%2054\">\n    323 F.R.D. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    New England Anti-Vivisection Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272277\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/142/#p166\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   165-66 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Veterans Legal Servs. Program\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204435175\">\n    2016 WL 4435175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Given this law, the Court sees its conclusion as inescapable: CRS does not allege a constitutionally sufficient injury-in-fact to invoke jurisdiction. Its claim cannot proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Adding a belt to these suspenders, the Court also has reservations about Plaintiff's assertion of causation. After losing the first round, CRS apparently went back to the drawing board not only to add detail to its Complaint, but also to review the actions it could take to allege standing. Plaintiff, again with appreciated candor, admits that it did not start contacting principal investigators until May 2018 - over a year after the denial of the Citizen Petition, yet a mere two weeks after this Court dismissed its Complaint but granted leave to add further detail about the actions CRS took in response to the Agency's challenged conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Responsible Sci.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525311\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/5/#p6\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   10 ; Pl. Opp. at 27. This timing casts a dark shadow over CRS's allegation that its conduct is \"fairly traceable\" to the challenged action of Defendant - i.e., the denial of the Citizen Petition, as opposed to the Court's granting of the FDA's initial motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With that, this challenge comes to an end. In its first Opinion, the Court noted that \"at a minimum, the organization must allege that discrete programmatic concerns are being directly and adversely affected by the agency's inaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Responsible Sci.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525311\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/5/#p6\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).
