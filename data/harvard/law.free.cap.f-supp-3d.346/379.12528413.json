Petitioner is currently in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") pursuant to 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1225(b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). As of the date of this opinion, Petitioner has been detained without bond for nearly ten months at the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 3, 23). For the reasons set forth below, the Petition is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner, a native of Trinidad and Tobago, arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on October 16, 2017. (Pet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   at \u00b6 24). Petitioner presented himself for inspection and sought admission on a non-immigrant visa. (Valdez Decl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Upon inspection, officers found approximately 4.7 pounds of cocaine in Petitioner's luggage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). Petitioner was then paroled into the United States for criminal prosecution. (Pet. at \u00b6 25). On November 13, 2017, Petitioner was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for importation of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 19, 2017, Petitioner was taken into ICE custody and placed in removal proceedings. (Pet. at \u00b6 25). Shortly thereafter, Petitioner filed a motion in his criminal case for an order requiring the Government to choose between: (1) releasing him from ICE custody and pursuing the criminal case against him; or (2) dismissing the criminal indictment and pursuing removal proceedings. (Opp. at 7). On January 26, 2018, Petitioner's request was granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The government notified the district court that ICE did not intend to release Petitioner from immigration custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8). The district court therefore dismissed the criminal indictment against Petitioner with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 29, 2018, Petitioner first appeared in immigration court and was assigned\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   counsel. (Pet. at \u00b6 28). Petitioner's counsel sought and received an adjournment for investigation and preparation of Petitioner's case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On March 7, 2018, Petitioner submitted an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). According to Petitioner's asylum application, he fled Trinidad under threat of death by area gang members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). In addition, on May 11, 2018, Petitioner filed a motion seeking termination of his removal proceedings, arguing that the Department of Homeland Security failed to meet its burden to sustain the sole charge of his removability: that Petitioner is an \"alien who the consular officer or the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe is or has been an illicit trafficker in an uncontrolled substance ....\" (Petition at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 14, 2018, Petitioner appeared with counsel for what was scheduled as a hearing on the merits of his asylum application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). However, the immigration judge instead set a briefing schedule on Petitioner's motion to terminate, adjourned proceedings to June 21, 2018 for a decision on the pending motion to terminate, and adjourned the individual merits hearing to July 12, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thereafter, on June 21, 2018, the immigration court denied Petitioner's motion to terminate removal proceedings. (Opp. at 8). On July 12, 2018, the immigration judge again adjourned the merits hearing until August 15, 2018. (Docket No. 20). However, on August 15, 2018, the immigration judge notified Petitioner's counsel that a decision on the asylum application was not yet ready and scheduled another hearing for September 19, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On September 19, 2018, the immigration judge indicated on the record that \"a decision was not ready, because he had neglected to assign the case to a law clerk, and thus no work had been done on the decision.\" (Urban Decl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   at \u00b6 4). On October 9, 2018, Petitioner's counsel received a phone call from the clerk at the immigration court. (Docket No. 23). The clerk indicated that the immigration judge had canceled Petitioner's hearing scheduled for October 10, 2018 because a decision would not be ready. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The clerk noted that a decision might be mailed in the next week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

[whether] those detained under the statute, as applicants for admission,\n   possess some rights under the Due Process Clause which may be impugned should detention under the statute become unduly and unreasonably prolonged.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner argues that his prolonged detention under \u00a7 1225(b) without an individualized custody determination hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (Petition at \u00b6 38; Reply\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 5). The Government, on the other hand, maintains that as an arriving alien, Petitioner lacks \"the same constitutional protections as individuals who have entered the United States.\" (Opp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 11). Consequently, the Government asserts that Petitioner's continued detention without a bond hearing does not violate the Due Process Clause. (Opp. at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has resolved the broad question of whether an arriving alien detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. Section 1225(b) is entitled to a bond hearing when his or her detention becomes unreasonable in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Brissett v. Decker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526643\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/444/#p450\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). In fact, courts in this district disagree on whether \"arriving aliens\" detained pursuant to Section 1225(b) have any Due Process rights. Although an arriving alien's Due Process rights may be limited in certain respects, this Court agrees with those courts that \"have found that such individuals have Due Process rights that require courts to consider challenges to the length of their detentions.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203991497\">\n    2018 WL 3991497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (listing cases). Given the particular circumstances presented here, namely Petitioner's prolonged detention and the immigration court's responsibility for continued delays, the Court finds that Petitioner's continued detention without a bond hearing has become unreasonable. Therefore, the Court finds that Petitioner's Due Process rights require that he be afforded an individualized bond hearing during which the Government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that his continued detention is justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To be clear, the Court's decision should not be read to suggest that Petitioner's continued detention is no longer justified; this issue is for the immigration judge. Nor should this Court's decision be read to imply that the Government's rationale for detaining arriving aliens is irrelevant. To the contrary, the Court's holding merely recognizes that on the facts presented, the Due Process Clause entitles Petitioner to an individualized bond hearing before an immigration judge who can assess whether he presents a danger or flight risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Petitioner's case has since been adjourned on three additional occasions: twice because the decision was not yet ready, (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203991497\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Docket No. 23), and once because the case was inadvertently not assigned to a clerk, (Docket No. 22). \" '[A]lthough an alien may be responsible for seeking relief, he is not responsible for the amount of time that such determinations may take.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sajous\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357266\">\n    2018 WL 2357266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ly v.
