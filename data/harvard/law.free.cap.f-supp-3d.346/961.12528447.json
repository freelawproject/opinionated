As to the Complaint's\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   thirteen pleaded Counts, most are time-barred, several rely on statutes that are not enforceable through a private cause of action, and another is inadequately pleaded.

Huang also asserts multiple Kentucky-law claims, including: common-law privacy invasion (Count VI), a KRS 164.283 violation (Count IX), breach of contract (Count XI), violations of Article II &amp; III of the Commonwealth's constitution (Count XII), and an untethered Count for punitive damages (Count XIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Huang bases his claims on the following allegations:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   -- In September 2011, Defendant Dunatov (then-Dean of the med school) told another student that Huang was struggling academically, had inadequate grades,\n   and failed to attend a learning skills workshop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   -- Sometime in 2012, Defendant Laurich (then-faculty at the med-school) falsely claimed Plaintiff was asleep in class. When Plaintiff denied the claim, Laurich replied, \"Well, your eyes were significantly shut.\" Plaintiff and, in Huang's view, other students perceived Laurich's response as intending an aspersion on Plaintiff's East Asian ethnicity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   -- In (approximately) 2013, the University established a \"Student Ethics Council\" (the SEC) to which it conferred authority over functions previously reserved to University personnel. On October 22, 2013, the SEC president wrote Plaintiff a warning that directed him to enter the classroom using the back entrance if he arrived late for class. The SEC purportedly allowed four Caucasian class members late entry through the front entrance with no adverse consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   -- On November 21, 2013, Plaintiff posted a warning about potential campus gang activity on Facebook and stated: \"You can guess at their demographic.\" On November 25, 2013, the SEC-misquoting Plaintiff as stating \"I bet you can guess their demographics\"-charged Huang with making a racially-centered, derogatory, and unprofessional comment unbecoming a future doctor. Defendant Dunatov denied Plaintiff's appeal and equated the violation to a prior student's posting of a female patient's genitalia on Facebook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   -- In May 2014, Plaintiff (without reasonable notice or opportunity to prepare) failed a mandatory remedial Internal Medicine exam, purportedly based on eighty PowerPoint packets and a 6,400-page textbook. Approximately 20% of the exam addressed electrocardiograms-a topic covered in only one PowerPoint packet. The remedial exam did not coincide with the regular semester's instruction content. Based on Plaintiff's failed examination, Defendant Soletz (then-Dean of Promotions and Matriculation) recommended Huang's dismissal from the med school. Defendant Buser (then-Dean of the med school) upheld Soletz's decision on appeal and advised Huang that KYCOM would dismiss him unless he voluntarily withdrew.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 6-5 (Pl's Ex. E - Buser's July 25, 2014, letter to Huang). Dean Buser also explained that he would not give Plaintiff a favorable recommendation to any other med school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   -- On a July 25, 2014, phone call, Defendant Buser advised Plaintiff that he had previously assisted a Caucasian student, who failed courses for three straight years at the University's med school, to enroll at another school. Buser claimed that he would not offer Huang similar aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   -- On August 26, 2014, Plaintiff took the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX) level-one exam.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 6-7 (Pl's Ex. G). However, COMLEX invalidated Plaintiff's minimal passing score after the Defendant University notified the administering board of Plaintiff's withdrawal. The University permitted one of Huang's Caucasian, but otherwise similarly situated, classmates to take the COMLEX exam four times. The classmate has since graduated from the University's med school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   -- When Plaintiff completed his second year of med school, KYCOM considered Huang and seven of his classmates marginal academically. The University allowed the six Caucasian students in this cadre immediately to repeat their second-year classes; the University notified the other two academically marginal students, Plaintiff and another Taiwanese student, that they would not receive the same opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   -- Beginning in 2012, Plaintiff retained counsel and attempted to resolve his dispute with the University. On July 19, 2012, the University's then-counsel invited\n   Plaintiff's counsel to discuss the issues. A September 14, 2016, letter from the University Defendants' current counsel to Kentucky's Council on Post-Secondary Education (CPE)-responding to Plaintiff's complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 16-2-stated the University's denial of forcible withdrawal and discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    B. Posture\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Church and University Defendants, separately, pursue dismissal. DE 8 &amp; 10 (Motions). The motions stand fully briefed and ripe for review. DE 12 &amp; 13 (Responses); DE 14 &amp; 16 (Replies);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 11 (University Defendants approving Church Defendant's DE 8 effort). The Church Defendant principally pursues dismissal on the following basis: \"Huang's Amended Complaint simply contains no substantive factual allegation concerning the A Corporation that even remotely suggests [it] is liable to Huang for the harms he alleges.\" DE 8-1 at 3. The University Defendants argue for dismissal under a variety of theories including statutes of limitations, absence of a private cause of action, and simple inadequate pleading.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 10. Ultimately, the Court finds the motions well-founded, Plaintiff's responses unavailing, and dismissal of the targeted claims warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    C.

THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the dismissal stage, the Court accepts as true that the Church Defendant is in some way \"affiliated\" with the Defendant University. Defendant's motion-stated contrary factual claims are, thus, irrelevant to the Court's 12(b)(6) analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, the \"affiliation\" contention is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   material factual allegation Plaintiff directs to the Church Defendant. [Indeed, Plaintiff does not individually depict the Church as a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 6 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-13.] Huang's bare claim of \"affiliation\" states no plausible entitlement to relief, under any pleaded theory, against the Church Defendant. Thus, the Court dismisses the Plaintiff's claims as to that entity under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff contends that \"in many instances the terms 'affiliate' and 'affiliated' describe a corporate connection that is legally cognizable[.]\" DE 13 at 7. True enough, as a general proposition. However, Huang's definitional theory ultimately offers him no aid. Plaintiff's argument, at\n   most, establishes the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   that circumstances could theoretically confer meaning on the term \"affiliated\" to make a legally significant connection. Yet, Huang entirely fails to connect that bare prospect to the reality of his Complaint,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he does not explain how the pleaded \"affiliation\" allegation supports or implies an actionable claim against the Church Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

After four years of such discussions, the University's then counsel, Josh Salisbury, in a letter dated September 14, 2016, advised Plaintiff's counsel that the University's position was that \"the University did not force Mr. Huang to withdraw from the KYCOM program or discriminate against him\" and that \"[t]he university of Pikeville requests that this Complaint be disposed of following review of this Response and the attached documentation.\" The letter further stated: \"Nothing about the information or arguments presented above should be construed as a waiver or any defense or argument to which the University may be entitled.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   DE 6 at \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.

The record, at this point, does not allow the Court to reach a reasoned decision on Plaintiff's non-specific amendment request-which is not, in its current form, a motion properly before the Court.
