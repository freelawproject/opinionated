Plaintiff Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the insurer of the owners and managing agents of the Stoney Creek Center, contends Defendant Selective Insurance Company of America, the insurer of Business 21, LLC-a tenant in the Stoney Creek Center and Harold Sacks's employer at the time of the accident-is obligated to defend and indemnify Liberty Mutual's insureds in the underlying action as additional insureds under the policy Selective issued to Business 21. Both parties have moved for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, Selective's motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2014, Harold Sacks, an employee of Business 21 Publishing, LLC, was seriously injured during a break from work when he slipped and fell on a defective sidewalk at the Stoney Creek Center, the shopping center where Business 21 was a tenant. Prior to his fall, Sacks used the sidewalk where the accident took place approximately twice a week for six to seven years. Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2014, Sacks and his wife filed a negligence action against six entities affiliated with the Stoney Creek Center-AMC Delancey Stoney Creek Associates, L.P.; AMC Delancey Stoney Creek Partners, L.P.; AMC Delancey Stoney Creek LLC; AMC Delancey Group, Inc.; Metro Commercial Real Estate, Inc.; and Metro Commercial Management Services, Inc. (the Underlying Defendants)-seeking damages for injuries Sacks sustained as a result of his fall and his wife's loss of consortium. According to the complaint in the underlying action, the defective sidewalk where Sacks fell had a piece of concrete missing and a \"crack/hole/depression,\" creating a tripping hazard for pedestrians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Underlying Compl. \u00b6 14. The Sackses further alleged the Underlying Defendants and their agents, servants, workmen, and/or employees were on notice of the dangerous condition of the sidewalk, yet failed to remedy the safety hazard, and were therefore negligent with respect to the condition of the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Underlying Defendants referred the slip and fall action to Liberty Mutual, their general liability carrier. In July 2014, Liberty Mutual tendered defense and indemnification of the matter to Selective, Business 21's insurer, asserting that Selective was obligated to defend and indemnify the Underlying Defendants as additional insureds on the policy Selective issued to Business 21. At the time of the accident, Business 21 occupied two adjacent units in the Stoney Creek Center. Under the terms of its lease with AMC Delancey Stoney Creek Partners, L.P., Business 21 leased the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    DEMISED PREMISES\n   </em>\n   . [AMC] hereby demises and lets to [Business 21] and [Business 21] hereby Leases and takes from [AMC], upon the terms and conditions of this Lease, the Demised Premises now, or to be erected in and as a part of the Shopping Center, the Demised Premises consisting of a second floor office having a width and depth measured approximately from the exterior of outside wall(s) and/or the center line of the interior wall(s) together with the right to non-exclusive use, in common with others, of all such automobile parking areas, drive ways, footways and other facilities designed for common use and as may be installed or changed from time to time to [AMC], in the Shopping Center, subject, however to the terms and conditions of this Lease and to the Rules and Regulations for the use thereof as may be prescribed from time to time by [AMC]. If the demising walls of the Demised Premises are already constructed as of the date of this Lease, the dimensions and size of the Demised Premises as set forth on the Data Sheet will be controlling despite minor variations ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pl.'s Mot. Ex. A, at 5. Business 21 was responsible for \"all work, improvements and modifications within or about the Demised Premises,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, and for providing \"prompt written notice of any accident, fire or damages occurring on or to the Demised Premises and/or common areas or common facilities of the Shopping Center,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Business 21 was also required to maintain broad form comprehensive public liability insurance naming the landlord and its managing agent as additional insureds with minimum limits of $2 million per accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Business 21 obtained a Businessowners Coverage insurance policy from Selective (the Selective Policy) which provided coverage for additional insureds. The Selective Policy defined additional insureds as \"any person or organization whom you have agreed in a written contract, written agreement or written permit that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on your policy,\" but only with respect to \"[b]odily injury ... caused, in whole or in part by your ongoing operations performed for that person or organization, 'your product' or premises owned or used by you.\" Pl.'s Mot. Ex. B-4, at 34. In its tender request, Liberty Mutual maintained the Underlying Defendants were entitled to coverage as additional insureds\n   under the Selective Policy, noting the underlying action involved claims by a Business 21 employee. Selective denied the tender request because \"there [was] no evidence that [the] loss arose out of the operations of Business 21 ....\" Def.'s Mot. For Summ. J. Ex. F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to bringing a negligence action against the Underlying Defendants, Harold Sacks also brought a claim pursuant to the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act against Business 21, which Business 21 tendered to Selective. Selective's Workers' Compensation department investigated the incident, determined that Sacks was using the sidewalk within the course of his employment with Business 21 at the time of his fall, and paid him benefits for his injuries. In its claims file for the incident, a Selective designee, Donna Herbert, acknowledged the Sackses could not directly sue Business 21 because Harold Sacks's Workers Compensation Act claim, which was reviewed and handled by Selective, immunized Business 21 from any direct tort liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Selective denied Liberty Mutual's tender request, Liberty Mutual continued to defend the Underlying Defendants in the underlying action and also brought the instant declaratory judgment action. While this action was pending, Liberty Mutual settled the underlying action. Liberty Mutual now seeks a declaratory judgment that Selective (1) had a duty to defend and indemnify the Underlying Defendants as additional insureds under the Selective Policy, and (2) must reimburse Liberty Mutual for the defense costs and indemnity it paid in connection with the underlying action, as well as all counsel fees and costs associated with the incident and Selective's denial of coverage. After this Court denied Selective's motion to dismiss, the case proceeded to discovery. Following discovery, both parties have moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Summary judgment shall be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The interpretation of this phrase depends on what Selective and Business 21 intended to mean by \"premises.\" As the parties demonstrate,\n   there is a potential ambiguity because \"premises\" may mean either: (A) the internal operating space of Business 21, or (B) the internal operating space of Business 21 and the right to use the common areas. Because the Selective Policy does not expressly define \"premises\" and due to the potential ambiguity, the Court looks to the dictionary definitions of \"premises\" to inform its interpretation of the Selective Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The 11th edition of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides four definitions for \"premises,\" including\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [a] property that is conveyed by bequest or deed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [b] a specified piece or tract of land with the structures on it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [c] a building, buildings, or part of a building covered by or within the stated terms of a policy (as of fire insurance); or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [d] the place of business of an enterprise or institution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition, the 10th edition of Black's Law Dictionary defines \"premises\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [1] [t]he part of a deed that describes the land being conveyed, as well as naming the parties and identifying relevant facts or explaining the reasons for the deed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [2] [a] house or building, along with its grounds; esp., the buildings and land that a shop, restaurant, company, etc. uses ...

These definitions, however, do not aid in interpreting the Selective Policy because they do not indicate whether \"premises\" is typically defined to encompass a lessee's secondary rights, such as the right to use a common area. As a result, because there remains a possible ambiguity in the Selective Policy, the Court must look to the surrounding context to resolve the question of whether there is an ambiguity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, the existence of ambiguity in an insurance policy cannot be resolved without looking to the context of the underlying dispute.\n   <em>\n    Lititz Mut.

[AMC] hereby demises and lets to [Business 21] and [Business 21] hereby Leases and takes from [AMC], upon the terms and conditions of this Lease,\n   <em>\n    the Demised Premises now, or to be erected in and as a part of the Shopping Center\n   </em>\n   , the Demised Premises consisting of a second floor office having a width and depth measured approximately\n   <em>\n    from the exterior of outside wall(s) and/or the center line of the interior wall(s)\n   </em>\n   together\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   the right to non-exclusive use, in common with others, of all such automobile parking areas, drive ways, footways and other facilities designed for common use and as may be installed or changed from time to time to [AMC], in the Shopping Center, subject, however to the terms and conditions of this Lease and to the Rules and Regulations for the use thereof as may be prescribed from time to time by [AMC]. If the\n   <em>\n    demising walls of the Demised Premises\n   </em>\n   are already constructed as of the date of this Lease, the\n   <em>\n    dimensions and size of the Demised Premises\n   </em>\n   as set forth on the Data Sheet will be controlling despite minor variations ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. A, at 5 (emphasis added). This language demonstrates a separation between the Demised Premises-the internal operating space where Business 21 operated-and the non-exclusive right to use the common areas-which came in an addition to the Demised Premises.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063984\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/953/#p957\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The remaining portions of the lease agreement further support this interpretation because: (1) Business 21 was not responsible for maintenance of the common areas, Def.'s Mot. Ex. C, at 3; (2) the drawings depicting the Demised Premises only reference and show the interior space of that Business 21 had the exclusive right to use,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063984\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/953/#p957\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. C; and (3) the lease agreement repeatedly uses \"within\" when referring to the Demised Premises,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063984\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/953/#p957\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A. Hence, the plain language of the lease agreement demonstrates that \"premises\" refers to Business 21's internal operating space only and does not encompass Business 21's right to use the common areas. In sum, because the Selective Policy refers to the lease agreement, it follows that Business 21 and Selective intended \"premises\" to have the same meaning as set forth in the lease agreement-Business 21's internal operating space-and therefore the Selective Policy language of \"premises owned or used by [Business 21]\" is unambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Applying this interpretation, Selective did not have a duty to defend the Underlying\n   Defendants because they were not additional insureds under the Selective Policy. As set forth in the underlying complaint, Sacks was injured while walking on the sidewalk located outside of Business 21's internal operating space. Consequently, the accident resulting in bodily injury did not occur on the \"premises owned or used by [Business 21]\" and the Underlying Defendants were not additional insureds under the Selective Policy. Therefore, because there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Sacks's accident occurred off the \"premises,\" Selective is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, having found that Selective had no duty to defend the Underlying Defendants, it follows that Selective also did not have a duty to indemnify the Underlying Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143551\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/660/#p673\">\n    814 F.3d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because an insurer's duty to defend its insured in a lawsuit is broader than its duty to indemnify, it necessarily follows that it will not have a duty to indemnify an insured for a judgment in an action for which it was not required to provide defense.\" (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court will grant Selective's motion for summary judgment and enter judgment in favor of Selective on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, a court must \"view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must make all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\"\n    <em>\n     Hugh v.

Here, if \"premises\" were defined to include Business 21's non-exclusive right to use the shopping center's common areas, the Underlying Defendants would be able to seek indemnity under the Selective Policy if an employee or patron of another store was injured in the common area. This \"blank check\" indemnity is neither a reasonable interpretation of the Selective Policy, nor is it the probable intent of Selective or Business 21.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Minges Creek\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063984\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/953/#p957\">\n     442 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    958 ;\n    <em>\n     Beazer Homes Corp. v.
