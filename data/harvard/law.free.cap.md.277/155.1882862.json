Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 32. Following a non-jury trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Liss, J.), Brooks was convicted of breaking the building at the Two Guys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Department Store (\u201cTwo Guys\u201d), located at 2401 Belair Road, in Baltimore City, on July 29, 1973, with intent to feloniously steal therefrom. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>25 Md. App. 194, 333 A. 2d 352 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">When, at about 2:30 a.m., on July 29, 1973, the burglar-alarm system in the department store was activated, representatives of the American District Telegraph Company (ADT), and patrol officers of the Baltimore City Police Department, responded. Douglas L. Kane, an ADT employee, told the trial court that upon his arrival, the building appeared \u201csecure from the outside,\u201d but that within a matter of minutes, alarms were noted emanating from ultrasonic equipment in the area of the jewelry department and the location of the safes, indicating that \u201cthere was something moving around.\u201d Officer William Childs, of the Baltimore City Police Department, testified that from his inspection of the exterior of the building he saw \u201cno evidence of anyone [having] gained entrance;\u201d that from the \u201clooks of everything on the outside, the exterior, the doors, [that] everything was secured.\u201d Over objection, he was permitted to express the conclusion that \u201cthey [had] secreted themselves inside the building.\u201d The police notified Joseph Thornton, a supervisor for \u201cTwo Guys,\u201d and he came to the premises. Because the police believed the intruders might have weapons, they armed themselves with shotguns, and accompanied by K-9 dogs, searched the store following Thornton\u2019s arrival. A number of rifles, which had been chained within a display gun rack, had been forcibly removed; several glass jewelry display cases had been broken open, and a large quantity of watches and other jewelry was discovered piled on the floor nearby. After a search of about 35 minutes, Brooks and two juveniles were detected by the dogs, secreted in separate shoe cases, about 20 feet from where the jewelry was found. When thus apprehended, the appellant was awake and uninebriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">During the course of Officer Childs\u2019 testimony, several photographs were introduced into evidence. One photograph, taken from the exterior, showed a large cylindrical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>incinerator with a metal access door, and a large metal sleeve connecting it to what was described as the incinerator room.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A second photograph showed a pried-open door leading from the shoe department to the incinerator room; this depicted a padlock intact in the hasp, but showed that the flap and hinge pin had been pulled from the mount which had secured it to the edge of the stile of the door \u2014 as if from force applied from without. Officer Childs testified that this door provided \u201ca possible exit through the inside out of the building,\u201d as well as a means of ingress from the exterior to the shoe department.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">It was stipulated in the trial court that if Thornton were called as a witness, he would testify that the department store was closed at the end of its regular business hours on the evening of July 28th; that at that time nothing was in disarray; that the building was completely secured, and that the merchandise therein exceeded $700,000.00 in value. It was further stipulated that his testimony would verify that the door to the incinerator room was locked, that the photographs accurately depicted the conditions observed by him and that neither the defendant nor anyone else had permission to then be upon the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">When the trial resumed, after a delay of several weeks, the appellant, unsuccessful in that interval in securing the appearance of the two juveniles who had been arrested with him,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified as the sole witness in his behalf. As he related it, the events of the evening commenced about 8 p.m. after he had imbibed about a \u201cpint and a half of bourbon and rum;\u201d that, while sitting on the steps at his mother\u2019s home, he was approached by two friends \u2014 16 and 17 years of age, respectively \u2014 and asked them \u201cto take [him] home.\u201d Hailing a taxicab, the three, instead of going to Brooks\u2019 residence, disembarked at the Two Guys Department Store, after a ride of only six or seven blocks. After Brooks paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>cab fare, he went \u201cto the back of the store and got something to eat;\u201d his friends, who were to keep him company, told him to sit down in the shoe department. Brooks, feeling tired, got in on the shelf and went to sleep; sometime later, after the store had closed, when his companions awakened him, he dismissed them as not wishing to be disturbed. It was his testimony that when he was next roused from his slumber by his friends, he \u201cheard a loudspeaker saying \u2018come out;\u2019 \u201d sensing then that he was in trouble, he returned to the shelf in an attempt to hide.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Brooks further stated that when he \u201cheard someone trying to get in the back door, that\u2019s what made [him] get back in the shelf;\u201d he denied the possession of any weapons or burglary tools and denied as well any knowledge of the removal of the jewelry or guns from their respective displays \u2014 while he was asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Obviously unimpressed by the account given by the appellant as to how he came to be within the store, the trial judge, in entering a verdict of guilty, stated: \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word Mr. Brice [Brooks] said.\u201d This rejection of the appellant\u2019s credibility was further expanded when the trial court (after having obtained a pre-sentence report), imposed sentence. The trial judge in those proceedings, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201cThis defendant, as far as he is concerned, got on that stand and lied and committed perjury. <em>I don\u2019t for a minute believe his story. </em>I point out to you <em>this place was broken into and he was caught red-handed, </em>and there is no question about that, and instead of admitting as to what he has done, he comes in here and tries to tell me a story that he was drunk the night before and fell asleep sitting on a chair in the shoe department and <em>nobody saw him when they closed the place up. ... I don\u2019t believe a word of that.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">It was in this posture that the case was reviewed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Court of Special Appeals, where Brooks contended that \u201cthere was not sufficient evidence of the essential element of \u2018breaking\u2019 to convict [him] of storehouse breaking.\u201d That Court, apparently leaving unnoticed the trial court\u2019s rejection of the appellant\u2019s prevarication, and its finding that the \u201cplace was broken into,\u201d considered the question posited before it to be: \u201cwhether an individual who enters a store while it is open to the public for business, secretes himself therein and then is apprehended after the closing hour under circumstances which indicate an intent to steal, can be convicted of storehouse breaking [under Maryland] Code Art. 27, \u00a7 32.\u201d 25 Md. App. at 195, 332 A. 2d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Art. 27, \u00a7 32, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cEvery person, his aiders, abettors and counsellors, who shall be convicted of the crime of <em>breaking </em>a storehouse, . . . warehouse or other outhouse ... in the day or night . . . with the intent to steal, take or carry away the personal goods of another of the value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more therefrom, shall be guilty of a felony,. . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, recognizing that the term \u201cbreaking,\u201d as used in \u00a7 32, is to be given its common law meaning, and that such breaking may be either \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cconstructive,\u201d as \u201cwhere one gains entrance by trick, fraud, artifice, deception or similar means,\u201d concluded, in affirming the conviction, that the \u201cappellant\u2019s failure to leave the premises when the store closed for business made his original entrance a constructive, illegal breaking and entering, <em>ab initio\u201d </em>25 Md. App. at 197-98, 333 A. 2d at 353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">We agree with the basic premise that the term \u201cbreaking,\u201d as used in Art. 27, \u00a7 32, as an element of that statutory offense, has the same meaning as it has as an element in common law burglary; and that the term \u201cbreaking\u201d may be satisfied where it is shown that there has been an \u201cactual\u201d breaking, or where the breaking occurred \u201cconstructively,\u201d through an entry gained by artifice, \u201cby fraud, [by] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>conspiracy (with those within) or [by] threats.\u201d See <em>Williams v. State, </em>205 Md. 470, 477, 109 A. 2d 89, 93 (1954); <em>Reagan v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 262, 267-68, 234 A. 2d 278, 281 (1967); <em>Jones v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 356, 359-60, 234 A. 2d 625, 627 (1967); <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 682, 690, 272 A. 2d 824, 828 (1971). <em>See also </em>Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d ed. 1969), Ch. 3, \u00a7 1A, pp. 194-95; Clark and Marshall, <em>A Treatise On The Law Of Crimes, </em>(7th ed. 1967); \u00a7 13.03, pp. 996-98; 2 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>(Anderson ed. 1957) \u00a7\u00a7 414-15, pp. 38-40; Hochheimer, <em>Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure </em>(2d ed. 1904) \u00a7 277, p. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In concluding that the \u201cbreaking\u201d by the appellant had been \u201cconstructive,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals drew heavily upon the holdings in <em>Levesque v. State, </em>63 Wisc. 2d. 412, 217 N.W.2d 317 (1974), where the appellant had entered a sandwich shop shortly before closing, had secreted himself in the ceiling in the men\u2019s room, and then, after the premises had been closed, emerged from his hiding place to take money from an unlocked safe. He was apprehended by the police, hiding under a kitchen counter, with the loot in hand. The Wisconsin statute, there invoked, contained an element quite different from the \u201cbreaking\u201d required to gratify the common law, as well as Art. 27, \u00a7 32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals also cited <em>State v. Keys, </em>244 Ore. 606, 419 P. 2d 943 (1966), where the defendant entered public telephone booths, and \u201cwith a peavey,\u201d broke open the coin boxes and removed the monies therefrom. In affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction for violating an Oregon statute, the Supreme Court of Oregon recognized that the statute \u201cenlarge[d] the scope of constructive breaking as known to the common law to include \u2018[e]very unlawful entry,\u2019 \u201d and found the phone booths to be within the protection of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 244 Ore. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>610, 419 P. 2d at 945. Cited as well was <em>State v. Pierce, </em>14 Utah 2d. 177, 380 P. 2d 725 (1963), where the.defendant was found to have constructively broken into a motel by trick \u2014 the display of a fictitious driver\u2019s license and the uttering of a forged check \u2014 and then to have stolen a television set therefrom. <em>Compare </em>however <em>State v. Newbegin, </em>25 Me. 500 (1846); <em>People v. Kelley, </em>253 App. Div. 430, 3 N.Y.S.2d 46 (1938); <em>Miller v. State, </em>136 Tex. Crim. 345, 125 S.W.2d 596 (1939); <em>Malloy v. State, </em>58 Tex. Crim. 425, 126 S. W. 598 (1910); <em>Smith v. State, </em>60 S. W. 668 (Tex. Crim. 1901); <em>St. Louis v. State, </em>59 S. W. 889 (Tex. Crim. 1900). <em>See also </em>Annot., <em>Burglary </em>\u2014 <em>Entry With Consent, </em>93 A.L.R.2d 531 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Although the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals may have an appropriate application in a given case, in the evidentiary posture in which this case reaches us \u2014 with the finding of fact by the trial court that the \u201cplace was broken into,\u201d and the judicial recognition of the appellant\u2019s mendacity, we find here no reason to pass upon the correctness of the conclusion reached by that court that \u201cthe appellant\u2019s failure to leave the premises when the store closed for business, made his original entry a constructive, illegal breaking.\u201d We thus leave for another day, and for other factual findings, the resolution of the question: whether or not one, who enters premises lawfully, such as an invitee, and then, possessing an intent to steal, or commit a felony, manages by stealth or artifice, to remain upon the premises, after the termination of the lawfulness of his presence, can be guilty of either common law burglary, or of the statutory offense proscribed by Art. 27, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">When, pursuant to Maryland Rule 772, a criminal case, tried without the intervention of a jury, comes before us as to factual findings by the trial court, our review is governed by Rule 886. <em>See State v. Devers, </em>260 Md. 360, 272 A. 2d 794 (1971); <em>Greene v. State, </em>229 Md. 432, 184 A. 2d 621 (1962). Upon such review, unless the finding of fact by the trial judge is shown to be clearly erroneous \u2014 with \u201cdue regard ... to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses\u201d \u2014 that finding will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>disturbed. <em>Tucker v. State, </em>244 Md. 488, 224 A. 2d 111 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U. S. 1024 (1967); <em>Holtman v. State, </em>219 Md. 512, 150 A. 2d 223 (1959). Our function is merely to decide whether there was sufficient evidence, or proper inferences from the evidence, from which the trier of fact could properly draw the conclusion of the appellant\u2019s guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>238 Md. 643, 210 A. 2d 399 (1965); <em>Gibson v. State, </em>238 Md. 414, 209 A. 2d 242 (1965); <em>Howell v. State, </em>233 Md. 145, 195 A. 2d 592 (1963). <em>See also McDuffie v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 190, 268 A. 2d 590 (1970), articulating the same scope of review, under Rule 1086, when such a case is before the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It goes without saying, that the credibility of the witnesses was for the court, sitting without a jury, as the trier of facts. <em>Johnson v. State, supra; Corbin v. State, </em>237 Md. 486, 206 A. 2d 809 (1965); <em>McDowell v. State, </em>231 Md. 205, 189 A. 2d 611 (1963); hence, there was no requirement that the trial court give credibility to the exculpatory testimony of the appellant. <em>Bird v. State, </em>231 Md. 432, 190 A. 2d 804 (1963); <em>Jones v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 468, 275 A. 2d 508 <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 747 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Nor was the trial court required to give evidentiary weight to the opinion voiced by the ADT employee, Kane, that the building was \u201csecure from the outside,\u201d nor to the conclusion stated by Officer Childs, tlmt because the building appeared to him to be \u201csecure from the outside,\u201d that the appellant, and his confederates, \u201chad secreted themselves within the building.\u201d <em>See Garrison v. State, </em>272 Md. 123, 321 A. 2d 767 (1974); <em>Dunn v. State, </em>226 Md. 463, 174 A. 2d 185 (1961); <em>Ward v. State, </em>219 Md. 559, 150 A. 2d 257 (1959). Neither of those witnesses detailed in the trial court, either the scope or extent, of the inspection they made of the exterior of the building; there was no testimony from either, that the exterior, in the incinerator area, had been at all scrutinized. Save for Officer Childs\u2019 speculation, there was no evidence, either direct or inferential, that the pried-open door, shown in the photograph, had been broken in an attempt to exit the premises. Officer Childs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>acknowledged that the door was a means of ingress from the exterior of the building into the shoe department. In view of the physical evidence, as shown in the photographs, and the trial court\u2019s rejection, on grounds of credibility, of Brooks\u2019 account, the trier of fact was not required to accept such opinion evidence as a probative basis for a finding that the appellant had entered the department store as a business invitee and had secreted himself therein before closing hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>231 Md. 278, 189 A. 2d 623 (1963), our predecessors, in finding that there had been an \u201cactual breaking,\u201d by the opening of closed shutters, to satisfy that element in a conviction for burglary, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201cHochheimer, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d Ed.), \u00a7 277, p. 310, states: \u2018Actual breaking means unloosing, removing or displacing any covering or fastening of the premises. It may consist of lifting a latch, drawing a bolt, raising an unfastened window, turning a key or knob, pushing open a door kept closed merely by its own weight.\u2019 \u201d 231 Md. at 280, 189 A. 2d at 624.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>See also Sparkman v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 527, 532, 240 A. 2d 328, 331 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Upon our review of the record, pursuant to Rule 886, we are satisfied that there was evidence, and the proper inferences which could rationally be drawn by the trial court from that evidence, that an \u201cactual\u201d breaking of a \u201cfastening of the premises,\u201d which was intact when the store closed, had taken place when the door leading to the shoe department had been pried open. There was further evidence from the asportation of the rifles and jewelry from the places where they had been respectively displayed, that the appellant, who was characterized by the trial court as \u201ccaught red-handed,\u201d possessed an intent to steal from the department store goods of the value of more than $100.00. We are thus satisfied that the trial court could fairly find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant was guilty of violating Art. 27, \u00a7 32. For these reasons, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>upon a basis that the appellant committed a \u201cconstructive\u201d breaking, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\">. We note that pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.
