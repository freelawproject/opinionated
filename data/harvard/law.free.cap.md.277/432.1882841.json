Smith, J., dissents and filed a dissenting opinion at page 465 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">In this case, we are called upon, for the purpose of venue, to locate the boundary line between two counties separated by a navigable river; at issue is whether the boundary line between Wicomico and Somerset Counties, at the confluence of the Wicomico and Nanticoke Rivers, runs along the mid-point of the geographic center of the water area of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Wicomico River, or whether it is fixed by the thalweg of the channel of the Wicomico River, located southward of its geographic center line.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The factual posture in which this boundary dispute arose involved the dredging of oysters, by the use of patent tongs, upon two natural oyster bars, the Great Shoals Bar, located at the mouth of the Wicomico River, and the Middleground Bar, located at the mouth of the Nanticoke River, where those rivers converge to form Tangier Sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Maryland Code (1974), Natural Resources Article, \u00a7 4-1011 (a), prohibits the use of patent tongs to catch oysters in the waters of Wicomico County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cCounty waters\u201d are defined in \u00a7 4-1001 (d), of the same article, as \u201cthe waters lying within the territorial limits of any county in the state as defined by th\u00e9 charts of the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments'.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In late November and early December, 1974, enforcement officers of the appellant, Department of Natural Resources, (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), apprehended a number of oystermen, including the appellee, Eldridge R. France \u2014 who was cited several times \u2014 using patent tongs on the Great Shoals and Middleground oyster bars and charged them with violating \u00a7 4-1011 \u2019 (a) of the Natural Resources Article. When \u25a0 the appellee, as the first of the alleged offenders, was brought to trial in the District Court for Wicomico County, the charge against him was dismissed, upon a finding that those portions of the two bars on which the patent tonging had occurred, were located within Somerset County, as shown on the topographic maps, prepared by the Maryland Geological Survey, and were not. geographically within Wicomico County. . ,</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">On December 13, 1974, the Department, acting on behalf of the State, instituted, an action in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, which sought a declaration that \u201cthe proper and constitutional boundary between the waters of Wicomico County and Somerset County, for purposes of Title 4 of the Natural Resources Article, is that established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>by the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments;\u201d as ancillary relief, the complaint sought that the appellee, and \u201cother holders of licenses to take oysters for commercial purposes by use of patent tongs during the 1974-1975 oyster season\u201d be enjoined from \u201cthe taking of oysters by the use of patent tongs . . . from the waters of Wicomico County as defined by the Charts of the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments.\u201d The appellee countered with a cross-Bill of Complaint, praying that the Department be enjoined from \u201cissuing summons[es] or other charging documents requiring the presence of the Cross-Complainant in the District Court for Wicomico County . . . for offenses allegedly occurring within the territorial limits of Somerset County ... or the prosecution thereof in the District Court for Wicomico County.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">When the matter was heard in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County (before Duer, C. J. and Pollitt, J.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court ruled that \u201cthe proper boundary between the waters of Wicomico County and Somerset County, for the purposes of the Natural Resources Article is the channel of the Wicomico River as designated in Article XIII, Section 2, of the Constitution of Maryland, and as shown on the Oyster Survey [Charts] of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments,\u201d and that an injunction would issue \u201cprohibiting the taking of oysters by the use of patent tongs, in Wicomico County waters, as shown on [those] maps.\u201d The trial court further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>held that \u201cthe jurisdiction of counties on navigable waters was, for the purposes of service of process, as shown on the topographic maps prepared and distributed according to the provisions of those Sections [82-84} of Article 75\u201d and that it would enjoin the appellant, or any \u201cother law enforcement agency, from bringing prosecution in these cases in Wicomico County because the District Court of Wicomico County has no jurisdiction, the proper place for any prosecution for any violation of the law south of this line [as] shown on the topographic maps being in Somerset County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The circuit court, by its decree (a) enjoined the appellee and all other holders of patent tong licenses, from \u201ctaking . .. oysters by the use of patent tongs in the waters of Wicomico County as shown on the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments;\u201d and (b), declared that \u201cthe proper boundary between Wicomico County and Somerset County <em>for the purposes of service of process </em>is as shown on the county maps of Wicomico and Somerset Counties, issued under [the] authority of the Laws of Maryland, 1896, Chapter 51, and the Laws of Maryland, 1898, Chapter 129 [as set forth in Art. 75, \u00a7 83]\u201d (emphasis added), and enjoined the appellant and its agents, \u201cfrom instituting [the] prosecution of any person in the District Court for Wicomico County ... for any offenses .. . alleged to have occurred within the territorial limits of Somerset County ... as shown on said [topographic] maps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The Department appealed to the Court of Special Appeals from the second portion of the decree. It asserted that the trial court was in error in holding that the jurisdictional boundary line between the two counties was as shown on the topographic maps (to be the geographic center of the river), within the provisions of Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), Art. 75, \u00a7 \u00a7 82-84, and, urged a construction of the word \u201cchannel\u201d to mean the \u201cnatural channel,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the deepest part of the river, contending that the true boundary line, in accordance with Article XIII, Section 2, of the Maryland Constitution, and the provisions of Art. 75, \u00a7 81, was the mid-channel line of the Wicomico River.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Department of Natural Resources v. France, </em>28 Md. App. 110, 344 A. 2d 193 (1975), pointing out that the appellee had been enjoined from using patent tongs in the waters of Wicomico County, and that the State\u2019s Attorney of Wicomico County had agreed to hold in abeyance the cases involving other oystermen, pending final decision in these proceedings, found that the injunction against the Department, contained in the second portion of the decree, was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201ctoo broad,\u201d and vacated it. That court was further of the view that the declaration made by the circuit court as to the boundary between the two counties was correct, but, limited as it was \u201cfor the purposes of service of process,\u201d was \u201ctoo restrictive.\u201d The court, noting that pursuant to Maryland Rule 104 a, process issued from any court may be served on the party named therein wherever he may be found, \u201cwhether in or out of the said county,\u201d and that the principal issue involved the proper <em>venue </em>for the trial of the appellee for violations of \u00a7 4-1011 (a) of the Natural Resources Article, modified the second portion of the trial court\u2019s decree to read as follows: \u201cThe proper boundary between Wicomico and Somerset County <em>for purposes of venue </em>is as shown on the county map of Somerset County issued under authority of the Laws of Maryland, 1896, Chapter 51, and the Laws of Maryland, 1898, Chapter 129 . ..\u201d (emphasis added) As modified, the decree was affirmed. Finding that a review of the case was \u201cdesirable and in the public interest,\u201d pursuant to Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-203, we granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In 1704, the Provincial General Assembly, by the enactment of Chapter XCII, confirmed as \u201cfirm and stable forever\u201d the \u201cseveral Divisions and Partitions\u201d made by the Act of May 8, 1695, which created Prince George\u2019s County, and the \u201cseveral other Divisions and Partitions, Lines and Land-Marks, [which] were made, relating to the Bounds of both\u201d Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties, which were created by the Act of April 16, 1698. The Act of 1704 then went on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cIII. And whereas there are several Counties that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>are divided by navigable <em>Rivers, </em>and no Rule yet made how far the Jurisdiction of each County shall extend on the River; BE IT THEREFORE ENACTED <em>by the Authority aforesaid, </em>That every County lying on any navigable River, in this Province, shall extend its Jurisdiction From the Shore <em>to the Channel of such River that divides the County; </em>and <em>be divided From, the other County by the Channel of the said River. </em>And that where any Ship or Vessel shall ride at Anchor in the Channel of such River, Process may be served on board said Ship, by the Officer of either County that can first serve it. But when moored by any Hold on the Land, shall be supposed to lie in That County to whose shore she is Fastened, if moored.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Section III of Chapter XCII of the Acts of 1704 has remained virtually unchanged, except for those changes made by the General Assembly in 1860, when it adopted a Code of Public General Laws. Today it is codified as Art. 75, \u00a7 81, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\u201c\u00a7 81. Jurisdiction of county lying on navigable <em>river.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201cEvery county lying on any navigable river- <em>in this State </em>shall extend its jurisdiction from the shore to the channel of the river that divides the counties <em>eoccept where a dividing line has been fixed in such river by law, </em>and where any ship or <em>other </em>vessel shall <em>be in said river, </em>process may be served on board the said ship <em>or vessel </em>by the officers of either county that can first serve it; but <em>if she is moored or fastened to the land on either side of said river, then she </em>shall be <em>considered as in the county </em>to whose shore she is fastened.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The statute so provided when, by Article XIII, Sections 2-5, of the Constitution of 1867, provision was made for the creation of Wicomico County, the second youngest county in the State.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wicomico County is the only county in the State whose boundaries are fixed by the Constitution; carved from what was a part of Worcester and Somerset Counties, the boundaries of Wicomico County are fixed by Article XIII, Section 2 of the Constitution, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">\u201cBeginning at the point, where Mason and Dixon\u2019s line crosses the <em>channel ofPocomoke River, </em>thence following said line to the <em>channel of the Nanticoke River, </em>thence with the <em>channel of said river </em>to Tangier Sound, or <em>the intersection of Nanticoke and Wicomico Rivers, </em>thence up the <em>channel of the Wicomico River </em>to the mouth of Wicomico Creek, thence with the <em>channel of said creek </em>and Passerdyke Creek to Dashield\u2019s, or Disharoon\u2019s Mills, thence with the millpond of said mills and Branch following the middle prong of said Branch, to Meadow Bridge, on the road, dividing the Counties of Somerset and Worcester, near the southwest corner of the farm of William P. Morris, thence due east to the Pocomoke River, then with the <em>channel of said river </em>to the beginning,. . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The first case which discusses the Act of 1704, Ch. 92, is <em>Raah v. State, </em>7 Md. 483 (1855). In that case, the appellant, indicted in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City for receiving stolen goods, upon affidavit had his case removed to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. After a verdict of guilty, he filed a motion in arrest of judgment contending that the latter court had no jurisdiction to try his case, since it was not a court of a county \u201cadjoining the city of Baltimore, to which alone the judge of the Criminal Court [of Baltimore] was required by the constitution to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the cause.\u201d At issue was: \u201cWhether Anne Arundel county adjoins the city of Baltimore?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In overruling the motion, Judge Brewer, of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, prefaced his opinion by stating: \u201c[w]here the counties are divided by streams not navigable, in analogy to grants, each of the adjoining counties runs to the <em>middle of the stream. </em>* * * The same rule may possibly obtain as to navigable rivers; of that, however, I doubt.\u201d 7 Md. at 484.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (emphasis added). After reviewing the enactments by which the various counties of the State, then in existence, had been created, he pointed out that the Act of 1704, Ch. 92, confirmed the division between Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties, as made by the Act of 1698, and that the Act of 1704, \u201cestablishing a rule as to the jurisdiction of counties binding on navigable rivers\u201d was not confined in its application to counties then mentioned in the Acts of 1695 and 1698, but \u201c[i]t must have been then contemplated to lay off <em>other counties,\u201d </em>and that \u201cthe object of the Act of 1704\u201d \u201cseems to be to <em>establish a rule </em>applicable to all <em>similar cases.\u201d </em>7 Md. at 486-87. (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">That court, then finding that the Act of 1726, Ch. 1, had repealed so much of the Act of 1698 as added the south side of the Patapsco River to Baltimore County, and had fixed the boundary of Anne Arundel County as lying on the south side of the Patapsco and running with that river, reasoned that \u201cif the Act of 1704 applies to counties subsequently laid off, [that Act] carries it [the boundary of Anne Arundel County] to the <em>middle of the stream, </em>and at any rate would leave to Baltimore County only half of the river, precisely the same as if a law bounded it on the north side.\u201d 7 Md. at 488 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Pointing out that the Act of 1816, which engrafted portions of Baltimore County onto the limits of Baltimore City had fixed the boundary of the City, \u201con the <em>main branch </em>of the Patapsco River \u2018and running with and bounding on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the main branch\u2019 \u201d of that river, and had included \u201call the land on the south side of the old city limits, which was in Baltimore county,\u201d Judge Brewer concluded that the city boundary \u201c[r]unning with the river, if the county ran with the river, . . . would certainly give to the city all the rights of the county connected with the land, which would carry the city <em>to the middle of the river </em>so far as it extended on it, which right [as to navigation] is indispensable to the city.\u201d 7 Md. at 492. (emphasis added). In holding that Anne Arundel County thus adjoined Baltimore City, the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court was of the view that the \u201cidea of Anne Arundel county holding the land on one side of the river and the city of Baltimore on the other, while Baltimore county held <em>the middle of the stream, </em>is neither a useful, practical, nor liberal construction of the Acts of the Legislature.\u201d 7 Md. at 492. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Although the Patapsco was a navigable river, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, though undertaking to give effect to the Act of 1704, contrary to that court\u2019s original premise, characterized the boundary between Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County to be \u201cthe middle of the stream\u201d \u2014 as if the Patapsco were a non-navigable river \u2014 rather than to the \u201cchannel\u201d of that river, in accordance with the express terminology in the Act of 1704.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Our predecessors in <em>Raab, </em>in reversing, disagreed with the view that Baltimore City, by the Act of 1816, had acquired jurisdiction \u201cas far as the channel\u201d over that portion of the Patapsco River lying between it and Anne Arundel County. Pointing out that that statute, fixing the annexed portion of Baltimore City, limited its boundaries as \u201con the main branch of the Patapsco river, and running with and bounding on the said main branch,\u201d the jurisdiction of the City was confined to the limits prescribed, \u201c[and] part of the river at least was left within [the jurisdiction] of Baltimore county;\u201d there was thus an intervening jurisdiction between the City and Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Although our predecessors were of the view that a resolution of the issue there involved did not depend upon the Act of 1704, the Court did not embrace the lower court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>view that the boundary of Anne Arundel County was the \u201cmiddle of the stream\u201d of the Patapsco River, but referred instead to the \u201cchannel\u201d of that river as constituting the boundary between Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties. Judge Tuck, who delivered the opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">\u201cIt is manifest that the river [Patapsco], after this Act, [Act of 1726] remained as it had been for many years, within the limits of Baltimore county, and that the jurisdiction of these counties adjoined on its southern shore, unless affected by the Act of 1704, ch. 92, . .. and, under this Act, if applicable, the river, as far as the <em>channel, </em>remained in Baltimore county, and subject to the jurisdiction of its courts. * * * We are of the opinion, that the present case does not depend on that Act of Assembly, for the reason about to be stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cIt is clear that the Act could have had no other effect than to enlarge the limits of Anne Arundel county to the <em>channel, </em>and that it did not extend the line of Baltimore county into the river. If it operated on these counties at all, its effect was to restrict the southern line of Baltimore county to the <em>channel, </em>and not to assign to it any jurisdiction not previously possessed. Before the Act, this county had within its limits all the river, and afterwards, at least as far as the <em>channel.\u201d </em>7 Md. at 497-98. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In <em>Acton v. State, </em>80 Md. 547 (1895), the appellant was charged in Anne Arundel County in a criminal information with a violation of the Sabbath, \u201cat a building erected in the waters of a navigable river .. . the Patapsco River ... on the south side of the channel of said river, and distant less than one hundred yards of the land shore ... of [said] county.\u201d Contending that the site where the alleged offense was committed was not within the limits of Anne Arundel County, the defendant pleaded a want of jurisdiction; the State\u2019s demurrer to the plea was sustained. In affirming, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Judge Page, writing for our predecessors, quoted from Judge Tuck\u2019s opinion in <em>Raab v. State, supra, </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">\u201cSo that, under this decision, <em>[Raab v. State], </em>it is clear that if the Act of 1704, ch. 92, is applicable, the jurisdiction of Anne Arundel County must extend to the <em>channel </em>of the river, and will include all that space which lies between the limits of Anne Arundel County as described in the Act of 1727, and the <em>channel. </em>And we are of the opinion that <em>such is the proper application of that Act.\u201d </em>80 Md. at 549 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The Court further adopted \u201cthe views so well expressed by Judge Brewer in his opinion ... in the lower Court in <em>Raab v. State, supra,\u201d </em>that \u201cthe object of the Act of 1704, although it refers only to the counties already laid off, seems to be to establish a rule applicable in all similar cases.\u201d Eschewing the use of the term \u201cmiddle of the stream\u201d as the boundary of Anne Arundel County, the Court, applying the Act of 1704, firmly established that such boundary extended to the \u201cchannel\u201d of the Patapsco River, when it further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cThis Act [1704] has been codified . .. and differs from the Act as originally passed, only in the respect that it is not made to apply \u2018where a dividing line has been fixed in such river by law.\u2019 No such line has been fixed with respect to Anne Arundel. By the adoption of the Code <em>this section became the law of the State, </em>and is now applicable, whatever may originally have been the design of those who enacted it, <em>to every county lying on navigable rivers in the State, except \u2018where a dividing line has been fixed in such river by law.\u2019 \u201d </em>80 Md. at 550 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The appellant, in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>106 Md. 561, 68 A. 6 (1907), challenged the validity of tax assessments by the City upon piers built by it, which extended from the shore or bulkhead line, out over the waters of the Patapsco River, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>contending upon the holdings in <em>Raab v. State, supra, </em>that jurisdiction over the river, out from the shoreline, continued to remain with Baltimore County. Pointing out that under Ch. 129 of the Acts of 1862, the owners of land binding on the water had the right to make improvements by the construction of wharves, piers, etc., out from the shore and that such improvements belonged to the owners of the land \u201cas incident to their respective estates,\u201d our predecessors held that such piers were subject to taxation by the City and not within the jurisdiction of Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Noting that in <em>Raab v. State, </em>the boundary of Baltimore City had been limited to the shore along the Patapsco River, and that in <em>Acton v. State, </em>the boundary of Anne Arundel County had been established at the \u201cchannel\u201d of- the Patapsco, the Court, in an opinion by Chief Judge Boyd, although expressly not overruling the decision in <em>Raab, </em>nonetheless embraced the view, which had been stated by Judge Brewer (in the lower court in <em>Raab), </em>that the boundary of Baltimore City should likewise be held to extend into the Patapsco River, so as not to cut off so important a city as Baltimore from control and jurisdiction of the waters of such a navigable river.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Chief Judge Boyd stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201c[In <em>Raab v. State,] </em>[o]ur predecessors held that after the Act of 1726 the river remained, as it had been for many years, within the limits of Baltimore County, except so far as affected by the Act of 1704, ch. 92, which provided that every county lying on any navigable river in the province should extend its jurisdiction from the shore to the <em>channel </em>of such river, and be divided from the other county by the <em>channel. </em>Our predecessors did not pass on the Act of 1704, but held that the river was still in Baltimore County at least as far as the <em>channel, </em>and was subject to the jurisdiction of its Courts. In <em>Acton v. State, </em>80 Md. 547, we held that the jurisdiction of Anne Arundel County did extend to the <em>channel </em>of the Patapsco river \u2014 the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>which had been left open in Raab\u2019s case. If we were construing the Act of 1704, .. . without regard to the decision in Raab\u2019s case, we would be inclined to adopt a similar view to that of Judge Brewer, who decided in the lower Court that by the Act of 1816, ch. 209, the jurisdiction of Baltimore City extended to the middle of the river, because he thought that when that part of Baltimore County was added to the city, it could not have been intended by the Legislature to leave under the control of the county the water from the shore to the middle of the river, and as the policy of the State, as declared by the Act of 1704, was to extend the jurisdiction of counties to the <em>channels </em>of navigable rivers it should likewise be construed to apply to Baltimore City. When Baltimore City was vested with control over the land to the shore it does seem to be singular that an important city like it was then, with the prospect of becoming much more so as it has, <em>should he limited to the line on the shore while the counties could go [to] the channel. </em>But without overruling that case, ... it is clear that <em>Raab v. State, </em>does not conflict with what we have said above.\u201d 106 Md. at 572-73, 68 A. at 11. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In sustaining the constitutionality of Ch. 82 of the Acts of 1918, which annexed a portion of Anne Arundel County to Baltimore City, our predecessors, in <em>McGraw v. Merryman, </em>133 Md. 247, 104 A. 540 (1918), noted that the boundary of Anne Arundel County ran to \u201cthe current of the river.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chief Judge Boyd, who also authored that opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201c[I]t was decided in <em>Raab v.

(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">It is noteworthy that in <em>Barnes, </em>our predecessors, although taking cognizance of the provisions in Ch. 487 of the Act of 1908, nonetheless pointed out that the jurisdiction of counties, bordering upon navigable waters, extended \u201cto the center of the <em>channel\u201d </em>of those waters, rather than \u201cto the center of the waters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In upholding the declaration made by the circuit court that \u201c[t]he proper boundary between Wicomico County and Somerset County ... is as shown on the [topographical] county map of Somerset County,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals prefaced its holding by quoting the definitions of \u201cchannel,\u201d \u201cmain channel\u201d and \u201cnatural channel,\u201d set forth in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rev. 4th ed. 1968), and the definitions of \u201cchannel,\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1967). Concluding from these definitions that the term \u201cchannel\u201d could denote the \u201cbed in which the main stream of a river flows\u201d or \u201cthe line delineating the deepest part of a river where the main current flows,\u201d the court adopted the former, or middle-of-the-river meaning. Although recognizing that the word \u201cchannel,\u201d \u201cwhen employed in treating of subjects connected with the navigation of rivers and bays, indicates the line of deep water which vessels usually (but not always) follow,\u201d that court, citing <em>Dunleith &amp; Dubuque Bridge Co. v. County of Dubuque, </em>55 Iowa 558, 8 N. W. 443 (1881) (which was later rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Iowa v. Illinois, </em>147 U. S. 1 (1893)), expressed the view that a line fixed in the deepest part of a river where the main current flows \u201c[a]s a precise boundary line between counties, however, ... is all but illusory and fosters uncertainty where certainty should exist.\u201d 28 Md. App. at 117, 344 A. 2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">From these premises, that court, in holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>boundary between the two counties was the geographic mid-line of the Wicomico River, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cIt seems to us more likely that the framers of the 1867 Constitution used the word channel in its primary sense as meaning the great body of water between the banks of the river, and that, by analogy to the common law rule pertaining to non-tidal stream boundaries, the intended boundary was a line running along the middle of the river.\u201d 28 Md. App. at 117, 344 A. 2d at 199.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In support of its conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals drew upon the phrases \u201cto the middle of the stream\u201d and \u201cto the middle of the river,\u201d as used by Judge Brewer in the lower court opinion in <em>Raab v. State, supra, </em>and the citation of his opinion and the use of the term \u201cto the middle of the river\u201d set forth in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, supra; </em>without reference to the term \u201cto the current of the river\u201d as used in <em>McGraw v. Merryman, supra, </em>that court was of the view that the term \u201cchannel,\u201d as set forth in the Act of 1704, and as used in the opinions of this Court in <em>Raab, Acton </em>and <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad, </em>had been used synonymously with the term \u201cmiddle of the river.\u201d Finding that \u201cdoubt and uncertainty\u201d had been created with respect to the jurisdictional boundary of Baltimore City by the decision in <em>Raab, </em>the court surmised that it was \u201cmore than a coincidence\u201d that the legislature enacted Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1908 in response to the language of Chief Judge Boyd in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad, </em>and that that statute manifested the clear legislative intention that \u201cchannel\u201d was to be used in its primary sense \u2014 as the geographic middle of the river \u2014 and that \u201c \u2018the jurisdictional boundary between counties separated by navigable waters\u2019 is the geographical center between the banks of those waters, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018the center of said waters.\u2019 \u201d It found this view to be \u201cconsistent with the lower court\u2019s opinion in <em>Raab </em>mentioned with such approval by Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Judge Boyd in <em>Western Maryland, supra.\u201d </em>28 Md. App. at 122-23, 344 A. 2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In arriving at the result reached, the Court of Special Appeals found it to be immaterial whether the Act of 1704, or the Act of 1908, was applicable \u201cfor in our opinion a proper interpretation of each reaches the same result: The jurisdiction of each county extends to the middle of the river, regardless of the location of the deep-channel line.\u201d 28 Md. App. at 119, 344 A. 2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We do not agree either with the rationale or the conclusion reached by the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">At the outset, it seems to us that no analogy can be drawn to the common law rule pertaining to non-tidal stream boundaries in undertaking to fix a boundary upon navigable waters. Although it is true \u201cthat a grant, by the owner of the bed of a non-navigable stream, of land <em>bounding thereon, </em>conveys, even without express language, ownership to the middle of the stream.\u201d <em>Linthicum v. Shipley, </em>140 Md. 96, 99, 116 A. 871, 872 (1922); <em>Day v. Day, </em>22 Md. 530 (1865); <em>Browne v. Kennedy, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 195 (1821), a person owning land, abutting on navigable water, where the land under the navigable water is owned by the state, owns title only to the high water mark \u2014 subject of course to certain riparian rights as an incident to his ownership of such land. <em>Van Ruymbeke v. Patapsco Industrial Park, </em>261 Md. 470, 475, 276 A. 2d 61, 64 (1971); <em>Toy v. Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co., </em>176 Md. 197, 206, 4 A. 2d 757, 762 (1939); <em>Smoot Sand and Gravel Co. v.

Eldridge, </em>230 Md. 441, 446, 187 A. 2d 674, 676 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Although we recognize that the term \u201cchannel,\u201d in connection with water courses, has at times been referred to as \u201cthe bed in which the main stream of a river flows,\u201d or \u201cthe hollow bed where a natural body, or stream of water runs or may run,\u201d where navigable waters are concerned, the term more appropriately refers to that portion of the waters on which vessels move and \u201cthe deeper part of a river, where the main current flows, or which affords the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>best passage\u201d for vessels. <em>See The Oliver, </em>22 F. 848, 849 (E.D. Va. 1885); <em>The Northern Queen, </em>117 F. 906, 915 (W.D.N.Y. 1902) (where \u201c[a] \u2018channel\u2019 is defined ... to be \u2018the deeper part of a river, or of an estuary, bay, etc., where the current flows, or which is most convenient for the track of ships.\u2019 \u201d); <em>The Sarah v. Bellais, </em>52 F. 233, 235 (5th Cir. 1892) (where it was held that \u201c[t]he term \u2018channel\u2019 is properly applied to the portion of the bed of a river or canal which furnishes uninterruptedly, through its course, the deepest water ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In our appraisal of the term \u201cchannel,\u201d as used in the Act of 1704, Ch. 92, we think it is here of significant importance to point out the observation made by our predecessors, in <em>Toy v. Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co., supra, </em>that a channel, in navigable waters, is a \u201chighway by water\u201d of commerce. Judge Parke, for our predecessors, there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cTo the extent of its public use in the transportation by boat of person and property, the channel of Back Creek was a highway by water, although it was not actually adapted for passage by any but small craft, such as row boats and small launches, but to that extent it continued to serve a limited public purpose while its waters in the canal bore the vessels engaged in general commerce and transportation.\u201d 176 Md. at 206, 4 A. 2d at 762.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">It seems clear that the Act of 1704 was passed at a time when the primary means for the transportation of goods over extended distances within the Colony, and the principal means of communication between its populated areas, were these \u201chighways of water.\u201d From our reading of Judge Brewer\u2019s trial court opinion in <em>Raab, </em>and from the opinion by Chief Judge Boyd in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad, </em>we are persuaded that the underlying concept, in each of those opinions, was a recognition of the need for Baltimore City to have such a \u201chighway of water\u201d for its commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">It was undoubtedly in recognition of such water-borne commerce that the General Assembly, in enacting Ch. 92 of the Act of 1704, intended to carry the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>counties, bordering on navigable rivers, to the channel of such rivers, where a \u201cShip or Vessel shall ride at Anchor,\u201d and to provide for the service of process upon vessels, within the navigable portions of such rivers, <em>i.e., </em>the channels, by an officer of either of the bounding counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">In a case involving an issue substantially similar to that presented here, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, in <em>Warren v. Thomaston, </em>75 Me. 329 (1883), was confronted with interpreting a statute which fixed the boundary line between the towns of Warren and Thomaston. The Maine legislature, in 1864, using language similar to that used in Article XIII, Section 2 of our Constitution (fixing the boundaries of Wicomico County), undertook to fix the \u201ctown line between the towns of Thomaston and Warren,\u2019 \u201d as follows: \u2018 \u201c[beginning in the centre of the channel of Oyster river, below Elder point, near the head of tide water, where the town lines now cross said river, and following down said river in the channel to the channel of Georges river; thence down said channel, till it intersects the town line where it crosses said Georges river.\u201d \u2019 At issue was whether the boundary of the two towns was the central line of the Georges river or the channel thereof. That court, in holding that the channel of the river fixed the boundary, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u2018The line, in the case under consideration, runs not by Georges river, but to and then down its channel. <em>The channel is the deepest part of the river. It is the navigable part </em>\u2014 <em>the water road over which vessels pass and repass. It is the highway of commerce. </em>Had the line run to the river and down the river, the boundary would have been the thread of the stream \u2014 the <em>filum aquae. </em>But, the thread of a stream is the middle line between the shores, irrespective of the depth of the channel, taking it in the natural and ordinary stage of the water. The channel and the thread of the river are entirely different. The channel may be one side of the thread of the river or the other. The legislature exclude[d] the idea of the thread of the river as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>boundary and established] a totally different one \u2014 the channel of the river.... Hence, not the river, but the channel is made the boundary, so that the burden resting upon these towns may thus be equalized.\u201d 75 Me. at 332 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Drawing an analogy to grants of land bounded on a highway, the court further stated: \u201c[w]hether the highway be by land or water, the same rule of construction must apply. When the river is a boundary, the thread of the stream is the dividing line. When the channel, as here, is the boundary, the thread of the channel is constituted the boundary. The <em>Cold Spring Iron Works v. Tolland, </em>4 Cush. 492.\u201d 75 Me. at 332-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">By a comparison of the boundary issue presented in <em>Warren v. Thomaston, supra, </em>with the issue to be resolved in this case, it would appear, under the holdings by the Maine court, that if the Constitutional Convention of 1867, when it adopted Article XIII, sec. 2, fixing the boundary of Wicomico County, had intended that the geographic middle of the Wicomico River be the boundary between Somerset and Wicomico Counties, it would have provided that the boundary of such county would run \u201cto the [Wicomico] River\u201d and \u201cup [that] River,\u201d rather than have chosen the term \u201cup the channel of the Wicomico River.\u201d This same reasoning is equally applicable to the enactment of Ch. 92 of the Act of 1704, when the General Assembly used the terminology \u201cto the channel of such river that divides the counties.\u201d <em>Compare Taylor v. State, </em>79 Md. 130, 28 A. 815 (1894), in connection with the bounds of Talbot County, fixed by Ch. 3, of the Act of 1706, as \u201con the north side of Great Choptank River\u201d and \u201cup said River to Tuckahoe Bridge;.. . and from thence down the south side of Wye River to the mouth thereof, and from thence down the bay (including Poplar Island)...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Another case strikingly similar upon its facts is <em>Pratt v. State, </em>5 Conn. 388 (1824). Pratt, while taking oysters in the channel of the Connecticut River, about 20 rods from its eastern bank and about 100 rods from its western shore, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>charged in a criminal information with having assaulted a constable of the town of Lyme, who undertook to arrest him upon a writ of attachment. Challenging the jurisdiction of the court, Pratt asserted that he was not, at the time of his arrest, within the limits or jurisdiction of the town of Lyme. The Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, finding that the patent of Lyme, granted in 1685, bounded it <em>\u201cWesterly on the channel of [the] Connecticut river,\u201d </em>and that the patent of Saybrook, in the same year, bounded it <em>\u201con [the] Connecticut River, on the </em>east\u201dconcluded that Saybrook was \u201cbounded by <em>the margin\u201d </em>of the river and that the offense committed by Pratt, <em>\u201cin the channel of the river, </em>between the two towns,\u201d \u201cwas not within the patented limits of either town.\u201d The court further held however that \u201cthe jurisdiction of <em>Lyme, </em>so far as [it] relatefd] to the service of process and enforcement of the laws,\u201d from \u201cantient and invariable and undisputed usage,\u201d extended \u201cto the <em>centre of the channel </em>[of the Connecticut River]\u201d and that the constables of Lyme had the right to serve legal process at the place of the alleged assault. 5 Conn. at 390-91. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In a most noteworthy case where a similar issue was raised, concerning the boundaries of the States of Iowa and Illinois, upon the Mississippi River, the United States Supreme Court held that their boundary was not the geographic midline between the banks of that river, but rather was the thalweg, or the middle of the main navigable channel of that river.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Mr. Justice Field, writing for the Supreme Court in <em>Iowa v. Rlinois, supra, </em>established what has become well known as the \u201cthalweg doctrine,\u201d when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cWhen a navigable river constitutes the boundary between two independent States, the line defining the point at which the jurisdiction of the two separates is well established to be the middle of the main channel of the stream. The interest of each State in the navigation of the river admits of no other line. The preservation by each of its equal right in the navigation of the stream is the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>of paramount interest. It is, therefore, laid down in all the recognized treatises on international law of modern times that the middle of the channel of the stream marks the true boundary between the adjoining States up to which each State will on its side exercise jurisdiction.\u201d 147 U. S. at 7-8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Expressly rejecting the view adopted by the Iowa Supreme Court in <em>Dunleith &amp; Dubuque Bridge Co. v. County of Dubuque, supra, </em>(cited by the Court of Special Appeals), the Court quoted with approval from the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>Buttenuth v. St. Louis Bridge Co., </em>123 Ill. 535, 548, 17 N. E. 439, 444 (1888), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201c \u2018It is the free navigation of the river \u2014 when such river constitutes a common boundary, that part on which boats can and do pass, sometimes called \u201cnature\u2019s pathway\u201d \u2014 that States demand shall be secured to them. When a river, navigable in fact, is taken or agreed upon as the boundary between two nations or States, the utility of the main channel, or, what is the same thing, the navigable part of the river, is too great to admit a supposition that either State intended to surrender to the State or nation occupying the opposite shore the whole of the principal channel or highway for vessels and thus debar its own vessels the right of passing to and fro for purposes of defence or commerce. That would be to surrender all, or at least the most valuable part, of such river boundary, for the purposes of commerce or other purposes deemed of great value, to independent States or nations.\u2019 \u201d 147 U. S. at 13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In concluding that \u201cthe boundary line between the State of Iowa and the State of Illinois is the middle of the main navigable channel of the Mississippi River,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201c[W]e are of [the] opinion that the controlling consideration in this matter is that which preserves to each State equality in the right of navigation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the river. We therefore hold, in accordance with this view, that the true line in navigable rivers between the States of the Union which separates the jurisdiction of one from the other is the middle of the main channel of the river. Thus the jurisdiction of each State extends to the thread of the stream, that is, to the \u2018mid-channel,\u2019 and, if there be several channels, to the middle of the principal one, or rather, the one usually followed.\u201d 147 U. S. at 13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The \u201cthalweg doctrine\u201d was similarly applied in <em>Louisiana v. Mississippi, </em>202 U. S. 1 (1906) where the Court held that \u201cthe deep water channel sailing line,\u201d in the waters of Lake Borgne, was the boundary between those two states. <em>See also Arkansas v. Tennessee, </em>246 U. S. 158 (1918) (where the boundary had been specified as \u201calong the middle of said Mississippi River\u201d); and <em>Whiteside v. Norton, </em>205 F. 5 (8th Cir. 1913), where a portion of the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota was fixed as the \u201cmain channel of the St. Louis River,\u201d and that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201cIf this, then, be the St. Louis river, not only is the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota declared by legislative enactment to be the middle of its main channel \u2014 as that channel then existed \u2014 but the doctrine of the \u2018thalweg,\u2019 meaning the middle, or deepest, or most navigable, channel, is applicable in determining the line of boundary between the two states.\u201d 205 F. at 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">It appears to us that such considerations as \u201cthe preservation by each [of the bounding jurisdictions] of its equal right in the navigation of a stream\u201d and the preservation of the \u201cfree navigation of the river\u201d were of primary importance in the Province in 1704, when the 11 existing counties, all upon tidewater, were bounded by navigable rivers and were economically dependent on those rivers as \u201chighways of water\u201d for their economic survival.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>thus seems clear that it was the intent of the General Assembly, by the express use of the term \u201cchannel,\u201d when it enacted Ch. 92 of the Acts of 1704, to extend, and to insure, the jurisdiction of every county, bounding on a navigable river, to the thalweg, or the middle of the main navigable channel of every such river which constituted a boundary between counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The General Assembly patently did not intend that the navigable channel in such a river should lie wholly within the jurisdiction of one or the other of the counties on opposite shores \u2014 a result which could conceivably occur \u2014 should such boundary be fixed at the geographic mid-point between the banks of such a river. It appears to have been in recognition of such mutual jurisdictional rights by the bounding counties, in the use of the channel of such a river, that the Act of 1704 provided for . the service of process, by the officers of either of such bounding counties, upon a vessel \u201cridfing] at Anchor in the Channel of such River.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Although the language used in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, supra, </em>appears to be in conflict with the use of the term \u201cchannel,\u201d as used in <em>Raab v. State, supra, </em>and in <em>Acton v. State, supra, </em>and in conflict with the phrase \u201cthe current of the river,\u201d as used in <em>McGraw v. Merryman, supra, </em>as we read those cases, they support the concept that when our predecessors used the term \u201cchannel,\u201d they intended it to mean not the geographical middle of the Patapsco River, but rather \u201cthe deeper part of the river, where the main current flows\u201d and \u201cwhich affords the best passage\u201d for vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">When the statute was codified in 1860, the legislature, by engrafting upon the original enactment the limitation \u201cexcept where a dividing line has been fixed in such river by law,\u201d made allowance for those counties \u201cbordering upon the Potomac River.\u201d <em>See Barnes v. State, supra. </em>It also appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that allowance was made for those counties, binding on navigable rivers which had prior thereto been created, sometimes by an Order, or a Proclamation by the Governor, sometimes by an Order of the Council and more often, by Acts of the General Assembly. <em>See Maryland Manual </em>(1973-74) pp. 867-870 (in connection with the origin of the various counties of the State).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">When the framers of the Constitution of 1867 created Wicomico County, and carved it out of what previously had been Worcester and Somerset Counties, they were obviously cognizant of the provisions in the Act of 1704, then codified as Art. 75, \u00a7 90, and mindful of the use of the term \u201cchannel\u201d as used by our predecessors, in 1855, in <em>Raab v. State, supra, </em>in connection with the boundary line in the Patapsco River. When they chose specifically to fix the boundary as \u201cto the channel of the Nanticoke River\u201d (separating Wicomico and Dorchester Counties) (rather than as proposed to the \u201cmiddle\u201d of that river) and \u201cthence with the channel of [the Nanticoke River] to Tangier Sound, or the intersection of [the] Nanticoke and Wicomico Rivers, thence up the channel of the Wicomico River to the mouth of Wicomico Creek, [and] thence with the channel of said creek,\u201d etc., (separating Wicomico and Somerset Counties); and when they further fixed the boundary in part (separating Wicomico and Worcester Counties) at \u201cthe channel of the Pocomoke River\u201d and \u201cwith the channel of said river,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the framers obviously intended to preserve and to insure the jurisdiction of each of those four counties to the channels of the three named rivers and to continue the mutual rights of navigation in those rivers which, as they had in Colonial times, in 1867, continued to play a significant role, as \u201chighways of water\u201d to counties bounding on navigable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>rivers. <em>See Iowa v. Illinois, supra; Buttenuth v. St. Louis Bridge Co., supra; </em>and <em>Warren v. Thomaston, supra. See also </em>10 Op. A. G. 75 and 81 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">It thus seems clear to us that Article XIII, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution intended to fix the boundary between Wicomico and Somerset Counties at the middle of the channel in the Wicomico River and to extend it, in that line, to its intersection, in Tangier Sound, with the middle of the main channel of the Nanticoke River.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As we see it, this interpretation of the term \u201cchannel,\u201d as used in the Act of 1704 and in Article XIII, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, is unaffected by the language used in Section 1, Ch. 487 of the Act of 1908, now codified as Art. 75, \u00a7 82, which was applied both by the trial court and by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We do not agree with the surmise that Ch. 487 of the Act of 1908 was enacted in response to the decision in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad </em>and to remove the \u201cdoubt and uncertainty\u201d which the lower court found had been created by the decision in <em>Raab v. State, supra. </em>It would appear that that statute was enacted in response to the problem demonstrated by the decision in <em>Taylor v. State, </em>supra, where the place at which the appellant was taking oysters with a \u201cscoop\u201d \u2014 \u201copposite Tilghman Island\u201d and \u201cinland from a line drawn from Sharp\u2019s Island to Poplar Island,\u201d \u2014 was held not to be within the boundaries of Talbot County, but outside thereof and upon the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Such a view is in accord with that adopted by the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County in <em>State v. Thomas </em>(No. 50, Criminal Trials, 1957), where Chief Judge Horney (later a Judge of this Court), in holding that Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1908 extended the jurisdiction of Queen Anne\u2019s County over the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, between the westerly shore of Kent Island and the center of the Bay, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201cThe Laws of 1704, Ch. 92, <em>supra, </em>settled only the extent of county jurisdiction over navigable <em>rivers. </em>From 1704 to 1908 the question of jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>navigable <em>waters </em>of the State, other than <em>rivers, </em>remained in doubt. In order to remove all doubt which until then existed \u2018as to the jurisdiction of certain counties situated on all navigable <em>waters </em>of the State\u2019 as declared in its preamble, the Acts of 1908, Ch. 487, <em>supra, </em>indubitably extended the jurisdiction of Queen Anne\u2019s County over a portion of the waters of Chesapeake Bay.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In acquitting the defendant of a violation of the clamming laws, Judge Horney pointed out that the maps, prepared by the Maryland Geological Survey, in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, pursuant to Ch. 51 of the Acts of 1896, and Ch. 129 of the Acts of 1898 (as referred to in Art. 75, \u00a7 83), showed \u201cthe boundary of Queen Anne\u2019s County as extending to approximately the center of the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d <em>See also Barnes v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">It is a fundamental principle that the law does not favor repeals by implication, <em>Waye v.

Although concededly the term \u201crivers\u201d would be embraced within the generic term \u201cwaters,\u201d in its most comprehensive sense, in our view the provisions of Ch. 92, of the Act of 1704, as codified in Art. 75, \u00a7 81, must be considered as the operative specification for fixing the boundary between counties divided by navigable <em>rivers. </em>Chapter 487, of the Acts of 1908, as codified in Art. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 82-84, providing for the fixing of jurisdiction of counties \u201cbounded at any point by navigable waters,\u201d as a general enactment, must be held to affect \u201conly such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions\u201d of Art. 75, \u00a7 81. Thus, inapplicable to the fixing of boundaries between counties upon navigable <em>rivers, </em>\u00a7 82 pertains otherwise to establishing the jurisdictional limits of counties, bounding at any point upon navigable <em>waters </em>\u2014 such as upon the waters of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">When Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1908 was enacted, there was neither a reference to Ch. 92 of the Act of 1704, nor any suggestion in the title or preamble of the latter statute of any intention to repeal the earlier Act, or that it was to become a substitute for the statute enacted two centuries earlier. We find no irreconcilability or repugnancy in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>provisions of the two enactments; in our view the two statutes relating respectively to the jurisdiction of counties on navigable <em>rivers </em>which separate them, and to the jurisdiction of counties which are bounded <em>at any point </em>on navigable <em>waters, </em>can be construed together, so that they will harmonize with each other and be consistent with their respective objects and tenor. We conclude that Art. 75, \u00a7 81, as we construe it, is controlling in fixing the boundary between two counties upon a navigable <em>river, </em>at the middle of the channel of that river, except where a dividing line has been otherwise fixed by law. We construe the provisions of Art. 75, \u00a7 82, pertaining to the extension of the jurisdiction of counties, bounded <em>at any point </em>on navigable <em>waters, </em>and fixing such a boundary at \u201cthe center of said waters,\u201d to be here inapplicable where the boundary between the counties is a navigable river.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We thus hold that under the provisions of Art. 75, \u00a7 81, as we have construed the term \u201cchannel,\u201d and by virtue of Article XIII, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution, the boundary between Wicomico and Somerset Counties is the thalweg, or middle of the channel of the Wicomico River, and continues on that line to the point where that channel, in Tangier Sound, intersects the middle of the main channel of the Nanticoke River.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The location of the navigable channel of the Wicomico River, in the area under dispute, was identified on hydrographic maps prepared by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and its predecessors, which were offered in evidence in the trial court. These hydrographic maps dated 1857, 1901-02 and 1973, established that in the area under dispute, the natural channel of the Wicomico River had not changed significantly in 116 years. A transparency of the channel, shown on the 1857 chart, when superimposed upon the 1973 chart, demonstrated that the channel had not shifted since 1857. The boundary line between the two counties, as depicted on the hydrographic charts of the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments, including a chart prepared in 1961, followed the natural channel of the Wicomico River, and showed that the Great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Shoals and the Middleground Oyster Bars are on the Wicomico County side of the channel of the Wicomico River.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">There was testimony in the trial court from a waterman who had harvested oysters in the waters of the Wicomico River for over 70 years, that historically, he, and his peers, had considered the areas where these oyster bars were located, to be within the boundary of Wicomico County. There was additional evidence that for a period of 20 to 30 years, the Department of Natural Resources, for the purpose of the planting and seeding of oysters, had considered the disputed area to be within Wicomico County.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On the other hand, the topographic maps, prepared by the Maryland Geological Survey, which were admitted into evidence pursuant to Art. 75, \u00a7 83, portrayed only the geographic features of the counties lying landward of the highwater mark of the River. Such maps do not depict channels, shoals, or other underwater geographic features, as do hydrographic charts. No hydrographic data is used in their preparation, except a delineation of the shoreline, and occasionally the location of a large permanent structure, located within the water, such as a lighthouse, which has geographic significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">It must here be observed that the Great Shoals lighthouse, established as a \u201ctriangulation point\u201d by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in 1901, is recorded among the records of the United States Department of Commerce to be located \u201cin Wicomico County,\u201d and that hydrographic charts prepared by the United States Coast and Geodetic survey, showing the lighthouse to be north of the channel of the Wicomico River, also locate it within Wicomico County. On the other hand, the topographical maps prepared by the Maryland Geological Survey, which originate from a 1903 United States Geological Survey map, place the lighthouse, located upon the Great Shoals, and northward of the channel of the Wicomico River, to be south of the mid-river line and thus in Somerset County.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Similarly, the topographic maps, undertaking to lay out the boundary between the counties, do not follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>channel of the river, but depict it as passing in the geographic mid-point of the river, a significant distance north of the channel, with the result that a portion of both the Great Shoals and Middleground Oyster Bars geographically are located southward of the mid-line of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We think it was error for the trial court to have used the topographical maps, prepared pursuant to Ch. 51 of the Laws of Maryland, 1896, and Ch. 129 of the Laws of Maryland, 1898, in determining the boundary between the two counties; that court should have relied upon the hydrographic charts of the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments, depicting as they do, the channel of the Wicomico River, as the boundary between the two counties, for the purpose of determining venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the second paragraph of the trial court\u2019s Order of December 23,1974, as modified by the Court of Special Appeals, must be vacated; and in substitution therefor, that paragraph shall read: \u201cThe proper boundary between Wicomico and Somerset Counties, for the purposes of venue, is as shown on the charts of the Oyster Survey of 1906 to 1912, and its amendments, depicting the channel of the Wicomico River.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed; case remanded to that court with directions that the case he remanded to the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for the passage of an order, in accordance with the order set forth above; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">.

On December 10, 1974, the appellee, France, and a number of other licensed oystermen, filed a Bill of Complaint in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, alleging that despite the ruling by the District Court for Wicomico County, (as to venue) the Department\u2019s \u201cofficers . . . have continued to wrongfully harass, hinder and interfere with [them] in their daily occupation, by ordering them to cease their lawful tonging of oysters and have continued to arrest [them] and issue summonsfes] for them to appear in the District Court for Wicomico County . . . knowing [that] the alleged offenses and act[s] . . . took place in Somerset County . . . and that the District Court for Wicomico County will not hear the cases involving the alleged offenses because of lack of proper venue.\u201d The appellee and the other complainants sought to enjoin the Department from such further conduct.

XIII, \u00a7 2 specifying the boundaries of that county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">The majority opinion is based upon the premise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">\u201cthat such considerations as \u2018the preservation by each [of the bounding jurisdictions] of its equal right in the navigation of a stream\u2019 and the preservation of the \u2018free navigation of the river\u2019 were of primary importance in the Province in 1704, when the 11 existing counties, all upon tidewater, were bounded by navigable rivers and were economically dependent on those rivers as \u2018highways of water\u2019 for their economic survival. It thus seems clear that it was the intent of the General Assembly, by the express use of the term \u2018channel,\u2019 when it enacted Ch. 92 of the Acts of 1704, to extend, and to insure, the jurisdiction of every county, bounding on a navigable river, to the thalweg, or the middle of the main navigable channel of every such river which constituted a boundary between counties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cThe General Assembly patently did not intend that the navigable channel in such a river should lie wholly within the jurisdiction of one or the other of the counties on opposite shores \u2014 a result which could conceivably occur \u2014 should such boundary be fixed at the geographic mid-point between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>banks of such a river. It appears to have been in recognition of such mutual jurisdictional rights by the bounding counties, in the use of the channel of such a river, that the Act of 1704 provided for the service of process, by the officers of either of such bounding counties, upon a vessel \u2018rid[ing] at Anchor in the Channel of such River.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Such a premise equates counties with sovereign nations or with other states of the United States. All of the reading I have been able to do on the subject indicates that our counties and their powers were based upon the system prevailing in England at the time of the first settlements. None of the authorities I have reviewed show any legislative power in a county prior to 1776. From the adoption of our Constitution of that year until the advent of \u201chome rule,\u201d a comparatively new doctrine in Maryland, counties never had legislative powers. Wicomico County has had \u201chome rule\u201d only since 1964. Somerset County has never had it.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Prior to the passage of Chapter 129 of the Acts of 1862, about which I shall have more to say, \u201cit had been held that the Lord Proprietary became vested under the Charter of Maryland with title to the soil under navigable waters, that he could convey title thereto and that the State succeeded to these rights. <em>Browne v. Kennedy, </em>5 Harris &amp; J. 195 [(1821)].\u201d <em>Wagner v. City of Baltimore, </em>210 Md. 615, 622, 124 A. 2d 815 (1956) . Accretions to land on navigable waters did not become the property of the abutting land owners. Consequently, patents are to be found among the patent records of this State issued to property owners on rivers of the State covering accretions to their land. What was Code (1957) Art. 54, \u00a7 45, prior to its repeal by Chapter 241 of the Acts of 1970, provided under the 1862 enactment that \u201c[t]he proprietor of land bounding on any of the navigable waters of this State sh[ould] be entitled to all accretions to said land .. ..\u201d In that circumstance, with Maryland as sparsely settled as it was in 1704 and all authority concentrated in the Lord Proprietor or the Royal Governor (depending upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>just what year is involved) and the Provincial General Assembly, of what possible concern to a county was the precise location of its boundary line? Of one thing we may be sure, that is that the county as such was without power to interfere with navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">I find it much more reasonable to believe that Chapter 487 of the Acts of 1908 was enacted in response to the decision of this Court in <em>Western Maryland Tidewater Railroad Company v. Baltimore City, </em>106 Md. 561, 68 A. 6 (1907) (actually decided November 13, 1907), than in response to the decision in <em>Taylor v. State, </em>79 Md. 130, 28 A. 815 (1894), 14 years before the passage of that act. I do not believe the position I take here is to the slightest degree inconsistent with the opinion of Chief Judge Horney in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>No. 50, Criminal Trials, (1957) in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">I note that the majority apparently is of the view that the term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as used in the 1908 act does not include the term \u201cnavigable river\u201d as used in the 1704 act. \u201cNavigable waters\u201d is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rev. 4th ed. 1968) as \u201c[t]hose waters which afford a channel for useful commerce.\u201d <em>Wagner </em>is clear authority for the proposition that in this State the test for determining navigability is \u201cwhether or not the waters in question are tidal.. . .\u201d 210 Md. at 624. The position of the majority that the term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d does not embrace a \u201cnavigable river\u201d is inconsistent with many of the prior holdings of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Van Ruymbeke v. Patapsco Ind. Park, </em>261 Md. 470, 475, 276 A. 2d 61 (1971); <em>Owen v. Hubbard, </em>260 Md. 146, 152-53, 271 A. 2d 672 (1970); and <em>Wagner v. City of Baltimore, supra. </em>In <em>Wagner </em>the Court had before it the proper interpretation to be given to Chapter 129 of the Acts of 1862 which was concerned with the rights of \u201cproprietor[s] of land bounding on any of the <em>navigable waters </em>of this State,\u201d (Emphasis added.) providing, among other things, for such proprietors \u201cto be entitled to the exclusive right of making improvements into the waters in front of [their] said land,\u201d and that \u201cno patent shfould] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>[thereafter issue for land covered by <em>navigable waters.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The controversy there involved neither the Chesapeake Bay nor the Atlantic Ocean, but the Patapsco River. Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e there said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">\u201cWhere a stretch of river is navigable lengthwise, we think that all of the waters between the opposite shores or banks are comprehended within the term \u2018navigable waters\u2019 as used in Chapter 129 of the Acts of 1862.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Thus, it would seem to me that any river which is navigable would fall within the term \u201cnavigable waters\u201d as expressed in the 1908 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In 1908 the session laws do not seem to have been put together in the same manner as they are today with chapters following in numerical order. Chapter 487 was placed under the heading \u201cArt. 75.] Pleadings, Practice and Process at Law.\u201d Also passed in that year by Chapter 408 and placed under the heading of \u201cArt. 27.] Crimes and Punishments.\u201d was a new section, designated \u00a7 433 A, now Code C1957) Art. 27, \u00a7 590, providing that a \u201cperson who may commit any crimes ... on or at the boundary or divisional line between any of the counties in this State, or so near thereto or where the exact location of such boundary is so uncertain as to render it doubtful in which county the offense was committed, then the county which first assumes jurisdiction by issuing process for the arrest and prosecution of the offender shall have jurisdiction to charge, present, indict, try, convict and sentence; and in such case it shall be only necessary for the State to establish the venue alleged in the information, warrant or indictment, by proving that the offense was at or on the boundary of the county wherein the accused is being tried, or was so near thereto or the location of the boundary is so uncertain as to render it doubtful in which county the crime was committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">I think Chapter 487 was enacted for the purpose of provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ing a common sense method of determining county lines for the purposes of litigation without the necessity of a complicated survey and the production of expert witnesses. Likewise, Chapter 408 was intended to provide a common sense method for prosecution where the exact situs of a crime in relation to a county boundary was uncertain.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">. I have found no dictionary giving a primary meaning to the word \u201cchannel\u201d disagreeing with that above. <em>E.g., </em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. unabridged 1959) is identical with that cited from Webster above. Other authorities give the primary meaning as: The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Diction ap (1971), \u201cThe hollow bed of running waters ..Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary of the American Language (college ed. 1953), \u201cThe bed of a running stream, river, etc.\u201d; The Concise Oxford Dictionary (5th ed. 1964), \u201cNatural or artificial bed of running water\u201d; The Penguin Dictionary of English (1964), \u201criver bed\u201d; and The American College Dictionary (1964), \u201cthe bed of a stream or waterway.\u201d Moreover, 14 C.J.S. <em>Channel </em>(1939) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">\u201cIt has been said that the word is a generic term applicable to any watercourse, whether a river, creek, slough, or canal; and that its precise meaning depends upon the context m which it is used, two lines of definitions being generally recognized, the one, employed in boatmen\u2019s parlance, as meaning the course where the water is deepest and the navigation safest; <em>the other, in geographical usage, </em>designating the depression of a bed, below permanent banks, wherein waters flow and which may be sometimes full and sometimes not.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 397.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">It certainly is in \u201cgeographical usage,\u201d not in \u201cboatmen\u2019s parlance,\u201d that the term is used in defining the boundaries of a county, whether that definition be in the Constitution or in a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
