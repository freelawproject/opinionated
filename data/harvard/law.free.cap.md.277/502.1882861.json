Murphy, C. J., dissents and filed a dissenting opinion at page 517 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">This appeal stems from a proceeding to enforce a subpoena duces tecum issued by the State of Maryland Commission on Human Relations (the commission) directing the A. S. Abell Company, publisher of the Baltimore Sun newspapers, and its personnel manager (collectively referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to herein as appellants) to produce certain employment records in connection with a preliminary investigation then being conducted by the commission into alleged discriminatory practices. When appellants failed to produce the records on the designated date, the commission successfully petitioned the Circuit Court of Baltimore City (Ross, J.) for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena. After an appeal was taken from that order, we granted a writ of certiorari prior to a consideration of the case by the Court of Special Appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Between October 1973 and August 1974, four persons filed complaints with the commission alleging various discriminatory practices by appellants in their employment policies. Allegations in the complaints ran the gamut from specific instances of discrimination based on sex, race and religion to general charges made on behalf of certain groups or classes. These complaints were brought to the attention of appellants in November 1974 when they apparently received copies from the commission together with requests for information pertaining to personnel policies. When the requests were not met to the satisfaction of the commission, one of its staff members forwarded an \u201cinterrogatory,\u201d containing a series of questions, in connection with each of the complaints. Appellants, through counsel, objected at this point to the requests for information, primarily on the grounds that the four complaints were couched in general and conclusory language and thus failed to comply with the statutory requirement that \u201cthe particulars\u201d of each complaint be set forth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Appellants\u2019 objections triggered an elaborate exchange of correspondence between their counsel and counsel for the commission in which each outlined at great length the merits of his client\u2019s position. Commission counsel at one point proposed as an alternative that, if response to the interrogatories appeared too burdensome to appellants, an investigative unit be permitted <em>\u201ca </em>site inspection,\u201d which might include \u201ca review of relevant files and interviews with company officials.\u201d Appellants declined this offer on the basis that, in any event, inadequate particularization of the charges prevented \u201cpreparation\u201d for the suggested site inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Ultimately, the chairman authorized in writing <em>\u201ca </em>preliminary investigation\u201d pursuant to Maryland Code (1957,1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b), citing receipt by the commission of \u201creliable information\u201d that appellants \u201cha[d] been engaged, or [are] engaging in discriminatory practices within the scope of Article 49B . ...\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a renewed request to obtain the previously sought information proved unsuccessful, the chairman signed the subpoena duces tecum which precipitated this dispute. The subpoena directed appellants to produce an assortment of records and documents relating to their recruitment, hiring and promotion policies. When appellants refused to comply with the subpoena, the commission filed a petition in the circuit court recounting the efforts that had been made to obtain the desired information and requesting enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In ordering production of the documents sought in the subpoena, Judge Ross interpreted \u00a7 14 (d) of Art. 49B as authorizing the use of subpoenas in the preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>investigation stage preceding the issuance of a formal complaint. Appellants attack this decision on three grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">I That the commission lacks the power to issue subpoenas in connection with a preliminary investigation conducted pursuant to \u00a7 12 (b) of Art. 49B and prior to the filing of a formal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">II That absent compliance with the requirement of particularity applicable to complaints of alleged discrimination, the commission cannot compel production of documents by subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">III That \u00a7 12 (b) requires a determination, which was not made here, that the information received by the commission is \u201creliable\u201d before it can initiate a preliminary investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">In <em>Okla. Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U. S. 186, 208, 66 S. Ct. 494, 90 L. Ed. 614 (1946), the Supreme Court articulated a threefold test for determining the validity of a subpoena issued by an administrative agency: Whether the inquiry is authorized by statute, the information sought is relevant to the inquiry, and the demand is not too indefinite or overbroad. It is the first requirement, statutory authority, that appellants contend is lacking here. They maintain that the subpoena power of the commission does not extend to a preliminary investigation, but is available only for an investigation conducted pursuant to \u00a7 13 or in connection with a hearing under \u00a7 14 of Art. 49B following the issuance of a formal complaint, <em>i.e. </em>a complaint which is sufficiently particularized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>That the Legislature may validly confer upon administrative agencies such as the Human Relations Commission the power to compel production of information for purposes of preliminary investigation is well settled. <em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U. S. 632, 642-43, 70 S. Ct. 357, 94 L. Ed. 401 (1950); <em>Vulcan, Inc. v. Md. Home Imp. Comm\u2019n, </em>253 Md. 204, 210, 252 A. 2d 62 (1969). We look first, then, to the applicable statute to determine whether it authorizes issuance of the subpoena duces tecum in question here. Section 14 (d) of Art. 49B, entitled \u201cPower of Commission to administer oaths, etc.; subpoenas,\u201d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">\u201cIn the <em>administration and enforcement </em>of the provisions of <em>these several subtitles, </em>the Commission has power to administer oaths and to issue subpoenas, to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records and documents relevant or necessary for <em>proceedings </em>under the <em>particular subtitle. </em>...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The statute then provides that enforcement of a subpoena, in the event of refusal to comply, may be sought in the circuit court, which, upon a finding that the matters or documents sought are \u201crelevant or necessary for the <em>proceedings </em>of the Commission,\u201d may compel obedience under the penalty of contempt, (emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Appellants advance two arguments in support of their contention that \u00a7 14 (d) does not contain the authority attributed to it by the commission. First, they say, the subpoena power is granted only to the commission itself, whereas it is the commission\u2019s staff that is authorized by \u00a7 12 (b) to conduct the preliminary investigation for which the subpoena is sought here. The short answer to this argument is that it was the commission chairman, who, after authorizing the preliminary investigation in accordance with \u00a7 12 (b), signed the subpoena duces tecum on behalf of the commission. Thus it is the commission, not its staff, which authorizes the issuance of subpoenas in connection with preliminary investigations. As the presiding officer of the commission, and the only member \u00a1permitted by law to be compensated for his services, the ^chairman was logically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>contemplated by the Legislature to be the person who would execute such papers on behalf of the commission when such issuance has been authorized. <em>Cf. Kansas Commission on Civil Rights v. Carlton, </em>216 Kan. 735, 533 P. 2d 1335, 1338-39 (1975). Nothing in \u00a7 14 (d) requires the individual members of the commission to sign all subpoenas issued in its name.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Secondly, it is argued that the only \u201cproceedings\u201d for which subsection (d) authorizes subpoenas are the investigation prescribed by \u00a7 13 and the \u00a7 14 hearing. This contention that the subpoena power is limited to the post-complaint investigation and hearing stages finds no support in the language of \u00a7 14 (d) itself. First, the opening sentence, \u201cIn the administration and enforcement of the provisions of these several subtitles,\u201d suggests a distinction between the \u201cadministrative\u201d and \u201cenforcement\u201d functions of the commission. Since only \u00a7\u00a7 12-16 of Art. 49B are grouped under the \u201cenforcement\u201d subtitle, the General Assembly apparently intended to extend the use of subpoenas even to areas beyond enforcement investigations and hearings. One such area is suggested by \u00a7 3 which empowers the commission, \u201c[w]henever any problem of racial discrimination arises, [to] hold an investigatory hearing\u201d for the purpose of promptly resolving the problem \u201cby the gathering of all the facts from all the interested parties and making such recommendations as may be necessary.\u201d The \u201cenforcement\u201d subtitle, in any event, is merely one of five subtitles contained in Art. 49B.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Even more significant, in terms of the statutory language, is the use of the word \u201cproceedings\u201d in \u00a7 14 (d) rather than \u201chearings.\u201d In our view, this further reflects an intent on the part of the Legislature to authorize subpoenas beyond the narrow limits urged by appellants. Administrative investigations, a vital part of the administrative function, are commonly referred to as \u201cproceedings.\u201d <em>See </em>1 K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 3.01 (1958). The word \u201cproceedings\u201d is a term of broad scope, encompassing both the investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and adjudicative functions of an administrative agency. <em>United States v. Fruchtman, </em>421 F. 2d 1019, 1021 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U. S. 849 (1970); <em>Rice v. United States, </em>356 F. 2d 709, 715 (8th Cir. 1966). Our conclusion that the word \u201cproceedings\u201d was used in its broad sense here is reinforced by the provision in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 244 (c), which, in defining the term \u201ccontested case,\u201d clearly ascribes a somewhat broader meaning to the term \u201cproceedings\u201d than to \u201can agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We find no support for appellants\u2019 position in <em>State, Colo. Civil Rights Com\u2019n v. Adolph Coors Corp., </em>29 Colo. App. 240, 486 P. 2d 43, <em>cert. denied, </em>Colo. Sup. Ct. (1971), or in <em>Pennsylvania H.R. Com\u2019n v. United States Steel Corp., </em>458 Pa. 559, 325 A. 2d 910 (1974), where the courts were faced with a similar question. Although in both cases the courts found the requisite statutory authority lacking, the statutes in question differed markedly from Art. 49B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>surprisingly, therefore, in view of the statutory language confronting those courts, they concluded in each instance that the subpoena power was not available in the preliminary investigation stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In <em>Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Kansas Com\u2019n on Civil Rts., </em>214 Kan. 120, 519 P. 2d 1092, 1095 (1974), however, where the relevant statutory provision bore a striking resemblance to the Pennsylvania statute, the Supreme Court of Kansas, in the face of a contention similar to that advanced here, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cGeneral tenets of administrative law recognize that an agency charged with investigatory duties to ferret out violations of the law can issue subpoenas and make such investigations, even though no formal administrative hearing be pending.\u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Kansas court reasoned that the specific statutory mention of the subpoena power in connection with a scheduled formal hearing should not be read to exclude that power in the preliminary investigation stage, since the power to investigate \u201cnecessarily implies the use of . . . subpoena authority.\u201d <em>Id. See Nevada Com\u2019n on Equal Rights of Citizens v. Smith, </em>80 Nev. 469, 396 P. 2d 677, 679 (1964); <em>Application of Broido, </em>40 Misc. 2d 419, 243 N.Y.S.2d 101, 104 (1963). As Mr. Justice Jackson said for a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., supra, </em>338 U. S. at 642-43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cThe only power that is involved here is the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>to get information from those who best can give it and who are most interested in not doing so. Because judicial power is reluctant if not unable to summon evidence until it is shown to be relevant to issues in litigation, it does not follow that an administrative agency charged with seeing that the laws are enforced may not have and exercise powers of original inquiry. It has a power of inquisition, if one chooses to call it that, which is not derived from the judicial function. It is more analogous to the Grand Jury, which does not depend on a case or controversy for power to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because it wants assurance that it is not. When investigative and accusatory duties are delegated by statute to an administrative body, it, too, may take steps to inform itself as to whether there is probable violation of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">What appellants overlook, in our judgment, is the emphasis which Art. 49B places upon the investigatory function of the commission. Section ,12 (b) requires a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d before the commission may issue a complaint, and \u00a7 13 (a) requires a further investigation by the staff \u201c[a]fter the filing of any complaint.\u201d In requiring the commission to conduct a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d to satisfy itself as to the reliability of the information received from an individual, the Legislature took pains to insure that no potential respondent would ever be subjected to a commission complaint without a \u201cpreliminary investigation,\u201d even though \u00a7 13 (a) mandates a further investigation. Also, the Legislature undoubtedly recognized that discrimination, in its many forms, is frequently practiced in a subtle manner. Without the right to compel production of evidence, the commission\u2019s power to investigate unlawful discriminatory practices would be reduced to a meaningless gesture.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We hold, therefore, that the Human Relations Commission possesses statutory authority to issue a subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>duces tecum in connection with a preliminary investigation under Art. 49B, \u00a7 12 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The argument that appellants were not provided the \u201cparticulars\u201d required by \u00a7 12 (a) is, at least in part, attenuated by our holding that subpoenas may be issued during the investigative stage preceding the filing of a formal complaint. In essence, appellants contend that since the four individual complaints are defective due to the absence of the necessary particulars, the commission is not empowered to issue the subpoenas. This argument misconceives the role of the administrative complaint and the relationship between the investigative and adjudicatory functions of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Notwithstanding the \u201cparticulars\u201d requirement, a complaint filed with the commission under \u00a7 12 (a) merely triggers the investigative process. If, as we have seen, the commission then wishes on the strength of such a complaint to issue a complaint in its own name, it must first conduct a preliminary investigation. In any event, an investigation is mandated by \u00a7 13 (a) \u201cafter the filing of any complaint,\u201d and it is only after the results of that investigation are reduced to written findings that the statute requires notice to be given the respondent against whom the complaint has been made. A finding of probable cause to believe that a discriminatory act within the scope of Art. 49B has been committed may then produce an agreement through conciliation or alternatively may result in service of the complaint upon the respondent with written notice requiring him to answer the charges contained therein at a public hearing. In this case, as we have emphasized, the proceedings have barely reached the \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d stage contemplated by \u00a7 12 (b), which must precede the filing of a formal complaint by the commission. Nor, of course, have any of the steps outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 14 been initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The question, therefore, is whether the complaints filed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the four individuals pursuant to \u00a7 12 (a) must meet the \u201cparticulars\u201d requirement before the commission may conduct a preliminary investigation. We do not think so. Pursued to its logical conclusion, the argument advanced by appellants would mean that a formal complaint, at least one capable of meeting the \u201cparticulars\u201d test, must be filed prior to the commencement of a preliminary investigation. This notion is at odds with the carefully conceived scheme enacted by the Legislature, authorizing the commission to make the inquiry necessary to determine whether more formal proceedings are in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In enacting the enforcement subtitle of Art. 49B, the Legislature recognized that complaints would frequently be filed by individuals unschooled in the legalistic complexities of the pleading process. It was never intended, therefore, that such administrative complaints should be required to pass muster at the threshold. It was assumed that the investigative process would flesh out the charges made by the individual before the respondent was initially called upon to answer them. <em>Cf. Graniteville Co. (Sibley Div.) v. Equal Employ. Op. Com\u2019n, </em>438 F. 2d 32, 37-39 (4th Cir. 1971). This contrasts with the more exacting requirements applied to pleadings filed in judicial proceedings. Consequently, most of the authorities relied upon by appellants to support their position are inapposite since they involved, not administrative complaints, but civil actions filed in federal courts under the Federal Civil Rights Act and were thus subject to the rubrics of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Nor do <em>Pennsylvania H.R. Com\u2019n v. United States Steel Corp., </em>and <em>State, Colo. Civil Rights Com\u2019n v. Adolph Coors Corp., </em>both <em>supra, </em>heavily relied upon by appellants, afford support for their position. As we observed earlier, in both cases the applicable statute tied the subpoena power to the hearing stage, and this goes far to explain the result reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>by the two courts. In <em>United States Steel, </em>the commission had already issued its formal complaint, which was found wanting in the \u201cparticulars\u201d requirement. Similarly in <em>Coors, </em>the Colorado commission had there scheduled the complaint for hearing after attempts at conciliation had failed. It was not until notice of the hearing had been given that the subpoena in controversy was issued and only at that point was the complaint challenged as lacking in \u201cparticulars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">Moreover, the posture in which this case reaches us is far different from that which prevailed in <em>Ferguson v. United Parcel Serv., </em>270 Md. 202, 311 A. 2d 220 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U. S. 1000 (1974), and in <em>St. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. Malakoff, </em>273 Md. 214, 329 A. 2d 8 (1974). In each of those cases, we were confronted with decisions of the commission in the quasi-judicial role envisioned by the hearing provisions of \u00a7 14. As <em>Ferguson </em>clearly demonstrates, it is at the adjudicatory stage of the administrative proceeding that the parties must be accorded such traditional elements of fair play as notice of charges and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The distinction we make here was also drawn in <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry. Co. v. Kansas Com\u2019n on Civil Rts., </em>215 Kan. 911, 529 P. 2d 666, 673 (1974), in which the court noted that the term \u201chearing\u201d refers to quasi-judicial proceedings where the \u201ctraditional safeguards\u201d of fairness must be observed, while the same test need not be met in the \u201cnonjudieial\u201d investigative stage. It is only when the conciliation process prescribed by \u00a7 13 fails and the hearing stage contemplated by \u00a7 14 is invoked that the investigative yields to the adjudicative function. <em>See Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Lopez, </em>216 Kan. 108, 531 P. 2d 455, 462 (1975). Only at that juncture must the charges be capable of withstanding attack for lack of particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The power to conduct the preliminary investigation and to issue the subpoena duces tecum, therefore, cannot be denied because of any possible lack of particularity in the four individual complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">For their final argument, appellants contend that \u00a7 12 (b), which provides for a preliminary investigation upon receipt by the commission of \u201creliable information from any individual,\u201d must be read to require \u201cthat such reliability be established as a prerequisite to a preliminary investigation ... ..\u201d In essence, this amounts to a contention that the commission is charged with finding \u201cprobable cause\u201d before it may institute a preliminary investigation. To that extent, the short answer is that no such requirement appears in \u00a7 12; it is expressly provided in \u00a7 13 (b) that a finding of probable cause to believe that a discriminatory act has been committed be made, but only after the completion of all investigations and the filing of a formal complaint. Section 12 (b) can only be read to mean that receipt of. reliable information and a preliminary investigation are together preconditions to the filing of a formal complaint, not that a determination of reliability is a prerequisite to the preliminary investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The statutory scheme aside, the cases afford no support for appellants\u2019 position. The determination whether the information received from individuals is \u201creliable\u201d can only rest within the sound administrative discretion of the commission. <em>See Application of Waterfront Com. of New York Harbor, </em>32 N. J. 323, 160 A. 2d 832, 838-39 (1960); <em>cf. Vulcan, Inc. v. Md. Home Imp. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>253 Md. at 210. As we said in <em>Sollins v. Baltimore County, </em>253 Md. 407, 411, 252 A. 2d 819 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201c \u2018It is a well established principle that where the action of an administrative agency is within the scope of its delegated authority, and does not affect the vested rights of liberty or property, the Court will not review its exercise of discretion unless its power was fraudulently or corruptly used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Clearly, there was no abuse of discretion here where the commission has received four separate complaints which appellants now concede were sufficient to warrant a preliminary investigation. As a practical matter, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>difficult to see how reliability of the information received can be reasonably established without the preliminary investigation mandated by \u00a7 12 (b). To accept appellants\u2019 argument would require that yet another investigative layer be read into \u00a7 12 (b) to serve the narrow function of enabling the commission to ascertain whether the information was sufficiently \u201creliable\u201d to justify a \u201cpreliminary investigation,\u201d clearly an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We hold, therefore, that the circuit court acted properly in ordering production of the documents and information specified in the subpoena duces tecum served upon appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\">.

J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ajv\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">While I agree completely with the majority that \u201cthe Legislature may validly confer upon administrative agencies such as the Human Relations Commission the power to compel production of information for purposes of preliminary investigation,\u201d I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that the Legislature has in fact granted such authority to the Commission in the conduct of the \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d mandated by Code, Article 49B, \u00a7 12 (b). In holding that the Commission has the power to issue subpoenas in connection with a \u00a7 12 (b) \u201cpreliminary investigation,\u201d the majority overlooks the statutory framework which evidences a clear statutory purpose to grant subpoena power to the Commission only <em>after </em>the filing of a complaint by either an aggrieved person under \u00a7 12 (a) or by the Commission itself under \u00a7 12 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">This case originally involved four complaints filed pursuant to \u00a7 12 (a) by individuals alleging discrimination by The A. S. Abell Company. The Commission attempted to obtain detailed data from the personnel manager, Mr. Banach; on advice of counsel, he refused to supply the data on the ground that the complaints lacked the particularity which \u00a7 12 (a) requires. With these complaints in hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>however, and based in particular on the information contained in the Swagger<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Dickman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> complaints, the Commission decided to utilize the alternative procedure available to it under \u00a7 12 (b); that subsection requires a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d by the Commission\u2019s staff as a condition precedent to the filing of a complaint by the Commission on its own motion. As part of this \u201cpreliminary investigation,\u201d the Commission issued a subpoena duces tecum which it deemed authorized by \u00a7 14 (d). Therefore, the central issue in the case became whether \u00a7 14 (d) provided for the issuance of a subpoena in a \u00a7 12 (b) \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">That each part or section of a statute should be so construed that all its parts harmonize with each other and are consistent with the statute\u2019s general object and scope is well settled. <em>Associated Acceptance Corp. v. Bailey, </em>226 Md. 550, 556, 174 A. 2d 440 (1961); <em>Pittman v. Housing Authority, </em>180 Md. 457, 464, 25 A. 2d 466 (1942). \u201c[I]f there is no clear indication to the contrary and it is reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Police Commissioner, </em>211 Md. 357, 361, 127 A. 2d 625 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">When these principles are applied to the statutory scheme of \u00a7\u00a7 12-14, it is plain that the Commission\u2019s subpoena power does not attach until after a proper complaint is filed under \u00a7 12 (a) or 12 (b). The statutory scheme provides for investigation, conciliation, and hearing processes for alleged instances of discrimination. We are here concerned with the investigation process, for which \u00a7\u00a712 and 13 provide dual procedures. First, if an individual files a particularized complaint under \u00a7 12 (a), \u00a7 13 (a) instructs the Commission\u2019s staff to then make a \u201cprompt investigation and ascertainment of the facts,\u201d and it is authorized by \u00a7 14 (d) to issue subpoenas in aid of its investigation. The \u00a7 12 (b) procedure, under which the Commission proceeded in this case, is activated by the reception of \u201creliable information\u201d (as determined by the Commission), which need not be in the form of a particularized complaint. Before a \u00a7 13 staff investigation is warranted, however, \u00a7 12 (b) requires a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d by the Commission\u2019s staff to determine whether the information warrants the filing of a complaint by the Commission itself. That the \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d mandated by \u00a7 12 (b) is not the same as the \u201cprompt investigation\u201d of \u00a7 13 is wholly apparent. The \u00a7 13 investigation occurs \u201cafter the filing of <em>any </em>complaint.\u201d Since the \u00a7 13 investigation would follow <em>after </em>a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d and the Commission\u2019s filing of a \u00a7 12 (b) complaint, by permitting the subpoena power to be used in a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d <em>prior </em>to the filing of a Commission complaint the majority has rendered the full-blown \u00a7 13 investigation nugatory and duplicitous. To avoid this needless result, the Court should have recognized that the subpoena power attached only to a post-complaint \u00a7 13 investigation; the pre-complaint \u00a7 12 (b) \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d would consist of staff appraisal of the information which the Commission received and its suitability for incorporation into a particularized Commission complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">That the statutory scheme does not properly permit the \u00a7 14 (d) subpoena power to attach to a \u00a7 12 (b) \u201cpreliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>investigation\u201d is also indicated by the history of \u00a7 12 (b). That subsection was not enacted until 1969, six years after the enactment of \u00a7 12 (a). See Chapter 153 of the Acts of 1969. It was intended to permit the Commission to initiate action when it received reliable information not cast in proper complaint form under \u00a7 12 (a), or information provided by persons other than those authorized to file complaints of discrimination under \u00a7 12 (a). Just as the Commission is not invested with subpoena power prior to the jurisdictional basis of the filing of an individual\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 12 (a), neither does it have any subpoena power prior to the jurisdictional basis of the filing of the Commission\u2019s own complaint under \u00a7 12 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"AYV\">Support for this interpretation is further provided by the origin of the \u00a7 14 (d) subpoena power and its placement by the Legislature within the statutory scheme. Section 14 (d) was enacted into law in 1963, concurrently with \u00a7 12 (a) and \u00a7 13. See Chapter 228 of the Acts of 1963. At that time the subpoena power could only attach to a \u00a7 13 investigation (after a particularized individual complaint was filed), since \u00a7 12 (b) did not exist before 1969. That \u00a7 14 (d) continued after 1969 to apply only to \u00a7 13 investigations following the filing of a formal complaint is indicated by its continued placement within \u00a7 14, which is focused entirely on the hearing process, from preparation for a public hearing in \u00a7 14 (a) to Commission review of the hearing tribunal in \u00a7 14 (g). Thus, the word \u201cproceeding\u201d in \u00a7 14 (d) is clearly limited by its origin and placement to post-complaint \u201cprompt investigations\u201d under \u00a7 13, and does not extend to the \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d of \u00a7 12 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKK\">The majority\u2019s contrary interpretation ascribes to the General Assembly an intent to create needless duplication of Commission investigations, and injects the subpoena power into an area where it was not intended to apply. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-5\">. The Swagger complaint, in its entirety, states: \u201cThe company hires and retains fewer minority group people than could be reasonably expected in the community which has approximately <em>1/t </em>minority population. Women employees are retained in lower-paid and least responsible positions compared with male employees. Employees who are black or otherwise obviously members of racial minorities or of other national origin are in lesser-paid or less responsible positions compare [sic] with whites. The company has relatively very few supervisors who are women or racial minority members and the few they have supervise other women or minority members. The company indicates it will not change the practices in hiring and promotion which have led to these conditions. Prom personal knowledge, I feel the A. S. Abell Co. has discriminated in hiring &amp; promotion, to the detriment of employees, based on sex, race or national origin. I represent members and people eligible for membership in the Washington-Balto. Newspaper Guild.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">. The Dickman complaint, in its entirety, stated: \u201cI believe the A. S. Abell Co. has discriminated in the areas of race and sex involving hiring, promotion, transfer, on-the-job segregation. The general policies and practices of the company do not reflect the statements put forth in an affirmative action program published January, 1974. Although the company has said it would make efforts to change such practices that have continued for decades, no major improvements have occurred. The discriminatory practices are continuing. I am bringing these charges on behalf of the fair employment practices committee of the Baltimore-Washington Newspaper Guild as the chairperson of the committee and on personal knowledge of discrimination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">.
