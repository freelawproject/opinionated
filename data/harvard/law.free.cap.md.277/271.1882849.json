In the early 1950\u2019s, the State Roads Commission converted what was originally a two-lane road to a four-lane separated thoroughfare. In this dualizing process the present southbound lanes were constructed some distance westward of the original highway, thus creating a median area, ranging in width from 50 to 500 feet \u2014 with a fairly typical width of 300 feet \u2014 which extends from property occupied by a Howard Johnson\u2019s Restaurant (on the north), in the vicinity of New Cut Road, near Glen Burnie, to the county line (on the south), at the Patuxent River.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Since the highway construction, older residences within the median have continued to be occupied; although several \u201csample\u201d homes, used to advertise and sell prefabricated dwellings have been therein erected, no new residential construction has taken place in the median. From the very nature of this enclave, there had been substantial commercial development within the median up until 1973, and the properties therein came to enjoy commercial zoning classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">On May 24, 1973, Bill No. 59-73 was submitted to the County Council, proposing a comprehensive rezoning for the Fourth Tax Assessment District and the adoption and application of new zoning maps to the Alternate Zoning Regulations contained in the Anne Arundel County Code. The import of the Bill, as submitted, basically \u201cdown-zoned\u201d the commercial properties located within the median to R1 (Residential) classifications; it proposed as well the down-grading of the commercial properties, along the eastern and western boundaries of Route 3 to R1 and RA (Residential Agricultural) classifications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Prior to the submission of the Bill, and prior to the release of the proposed legislation to the public on April 3, 1973, the County\u2019s Office of Planning and Zoning, the sponsor of the legislation and the originators of the map revisions, conducted three public hearings within the affected district. Announcements of such meetings were placed in three local newspapers, the <em>Villager, </em>the <em>Maryland Gazette </em>and the <em>Anne Arundel Times, </em>all having a general circulation within the county. Mrs. Marian J. McCoy, the County Planning and Zoning officer, in the lower court, gave testimony that a general announcement had as well been sent out</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201c[t]o as many people that we could find from the tax records [so] that, if their property was affected, . .. they would basically know, at least as far as the <em>suggested </em>maps were concerned that they should take some interest in the process. . . . Basically, a notice went out advising [that] the property was being suggested from such-and-such a classification to such-and-such a classification, and that information was available at our office, including, if they wished, a list of what the permitted uses were in that particular classification.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The reason for the proposed \u201cdown-zoning\u201d of the properties, within the median, and along the Route 3 corridor, from commercial to residential, according to the testimony of Mrs. McCoy, was because \u201cin the light of dangerous traffic conditions along Route 3, it would be in the best interests of the health, safety and general welfare of the County.\u201d She further testified that the Planning Board \u201cwanted to certainly not see any <em>further </em>commercialization along the Highway until something was done in order to correct what they considered to be a very dangerous condition due to the traffic and the accident rates that they became familiar with.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">After the public hearings conducted by the Office of Planning and Zoning, the comprehensive zoning ordinance, with accompanying maps \u2014 apparently unchanged as a result of the hearings \u2014 was submitted to the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Council. The Council conducted eight public hearings on the proposed legislation. As a result of those hearings, various councilmen proposed a total of 145 amendments to the Bill and its accompanying maps. Four additional public hearings were held by the Council on the proposed amendments, and on August 6, 1973, those 145 amendments to the comprehensive zoning plan and accompanying maps were adopted. As amended, Bill No. 59-73 was passed by the Anne Arundel County Council on August 20, 1973 and submitted to the then County Executive Joseph Alton.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 405 (h) of the Anne Arundel County Charter, granting the county executive the right \u201cto veto, in his discretion, ordinances of the County Council . . . and to return the same to the Council . .Mr. Alton, on August 30, exercised his veto prerogative as to 87 of the proposed 145 amendments, concurred in the remaining 58, and on August 31, 1973, returned Bill No. 59-73 to the Council. The Council sustained the executive\u2019s veto as to 31 of the amendments it had adopted, and overrode the veto of the remaining 56. Thus, the proposed comprehensive zoning ordinance, as proposed in Bill No. 59-73, was finally enacted by the County Council on September 4, 1973, with 114 amendments and map changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Disagreeing with the Council\u2019s legislative wisdom, certain citizen groups and civic associations, undertaking to act pursuant to Section 308 of Article III of the Anne Arundel County Charter and Article XVI of the Constitution of Maryland, circulated petitions in the form required by Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 33, \u00a7 23-3, and obtained the signatures of the requisite number of registered voters to bring to referendum 41 specifically selected amendments of the 114 adopted by the Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The 41 amendments petitioned to referendum affected the zoning on 42 tracts of land. Twenty-six of the amendments (Nos. 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 58, 80, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 96, 97, 100, 113, 136, 137, 140, 141, 143 and 145) related to properties wholly within the median strip between the roadways of Route 3; one amendment (No. 86) involved two properties, with the same ownership, one lying within the median strip and the other, opposite thereto, fronting on the westernmost side of the highway\u2019s southbound lanes; nine amendments (Nos. 34, 42, 56, 59, 68, 72, 105, 106 and 144) pertained to properties fronting entirely on the westernmost right-of-way line of the southbound lanes and five of the amendments (Nos. 49, 55, 75, 77 and 79) had to do with properties fronting entirely on the easternmost right-of-way line of the highway\u2019s northbound lanes. The last amendment on referendum (No. 73) involved the zoning of two contiguous properties \u2014 10 miles distant from Route 3 \u2014 located on Brockridge Road, near Maryland City, in Laurel, but within the Fourth Tax Assessment District of Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">As introduced, the ordinance undertook to \u201cdown-zone\u201d every commercially used property within the median to that of R1 (Residential). Amendment No. 44 changed that proposed residential use to C2 (Commercial, office); amendments Nos. 46 and 140 changed such proposed use to a classification of C3 (General Commercial), as did amendment No. 80, for a portion of the tract covered by it. All the remainder of the amendments, as to properties within the median, changed the proposed residential classification to C4 (Highway Commercial). Thus, the amendments, as affecting the properties within the median, retained the zoning uses in effect prior to the introduction of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Pursuant to amendment No. 56, property on the west side of the highway, proposed for an RA (Residential Agricultural) classification, was changed to a Wl-B (Industrial Development) use; a Wl-B classification, proposed for another of the parcels on the west side of the highway, by amendment No. 144, was changed to C2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(General Commercial). Under amendments Nos. 34 and 72, a proposed R1 (Residential) classification was changed to R5 (Residential), for other lands abutting the westernmost side of the southbound highway lanes. The five properties fronting on the easternmost northbound lane of Route 3, proposed for RA (Residential Agricultural) classifications, by amendments Nos. 49, 55, 75, 77 and 79, were changed to that of C4 (Highway Commercial). The property in Laurel \u2014 10 miles distant from Route 3 \u2014 classified as R5 (Residential) in the original ordinance, was changed by amendment No. 73 to that of Cl-A (Neighborhood Commercial). These amendments, as to properties outside the median, undertook as well to retain substantially the same zoning uses to which they had theretofore been entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">It must here be observed that both amendments Nos. 96 and 36 undertook to classify as C4 the property of the J. F. Johnson Lumber Co., located within the median. While amendment No. 96, which was petitioned to referendum, embraced as well four or five properties contiguous to the lumber company, amendment No. 36, not on referendum, related solely to that company\u2019s property. Notwithstanding the results of the referendum as to amendment No. 96, the J. F. Johnson Lumber Co. obtained a judicial determination, unopposed by the County, that, pursuant to amendment No. 36, its property had acquired a C4 classification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It was with this factual background that the County Council formulated the question to be submitted on referendum and certified it to the Board of Supervisors of Elections as \u201cQuestion D.\u201d The Supervisors adopted the wording of the question, as submitted, for inclusion as a ballot item on the voting machines for the general election to be held on November 5, 1974. The ballot question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>undertaking to submit to the voters all 41 amendments to the ordinance enacted by the Council was to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">\u201cQUESTION NO. D</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALu\">REFERENDUM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">To rezone certain parcels of land in the median strip, the west side of the southbound lane and the east side of the northbound lane of Route 3; and to rezone one parcel of land on the west side of Brockridge Road near Ellen Street; all parcels of which are in the Fourth Assessment District and which were rezoned by virtue of amendments to Bill No. 59-73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AGAINST THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As \u201cQuestion D\u201d however was actually placed on the voting machines, as a ballot label, the question, as worded, is followed by only the two words \u201cFOR\u201d and \u201cAGAINST,\u201d rather than giving the electorate the option to vote \u201cFOR THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL\u201d or \u201cAGAINST THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">On October 4, 1974 \u2014 32 days before the election \u2014 Thomas J. McDonough and his wife, the owners of property within the median to which amendment No. 113 related, together with 20 other owners of properties, both within and without the median, affected by 20 of the other <em>amendments</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(the appellees and cross-appellants here), filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the Board of Supervisors of Elections (Supervisors), subsequently amended to include Anne Arundel County, Maryland, (the County), (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>appellants and cross-appellees here), which sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The complainants sought an injunction restraining the Supervisors from placing the 41 amendments and \u201cQuestion D\u201d on the ballot; they also sought a judgment declaring: (a) that Section 308, Article III of the Charter of Anne Arundel County was unconstitutional, as contrary to the provisions of Articles XVI and XI-A of the Constitution of Maryland, as well as the Express Powers Act, Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 25A; (b) that none of the provisions contained in Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 33, \u00a7\u00a7 23-1 through 23-11, purported to delegate or to permit the filing of a referendum petition with respect to an ordinance of the County Council of Anne Arundel County; (c) that the purported description of the amendments as proposed in \u201cQuestion D\u201d was \u201cinapplicable, deceptive, and will result in an unfair and defective election upon the purported referendum;\u201d (d) that all 41 of said amendments \u201cmay not be lumped together under one heading and subject to one vote for all 41 .. . zoning amendments as a group;\u201d (e) that since the legislation purported to establish a comprehensive zoning map for the Fourth Assessment District and pertained to only a portion of the County, such referendum was being improperly addressed to the voters of the whole County, and (f) that the effect of such referendum would violate the complainants\u2019 rights under \u00a7 40 of Article III of the Constitution of Maryland, Art. 23 of the Declaration of Rights, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Because of the proximity of the scheduled general election, at the time the County was impleaded, and the mechanical and logistical problems attending the preparation of the voting machines (called to the court\u2019s attention by the Attorney General), the lower court (Childs, J.), passed an order on October 17, 1974 postponing the trial until November 13, 1974, but providing therein that all issues were: \u201cpreserved for the court\u2019s consideration and upon decision are to have the same force and effect as if heard and decided prior to . . . the election of November 5, 1974.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>action by the trial court was in accord with our holdings in <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>230 Md. 18, 185 A. 2d 385 (1962) and in recognition of the complainants\u2019 apprehension that their rights might be prejudiced by a post-election trial, since in <em>Dutton v. Tawes, </em>225 Md. 484, 491, 171 A. 2d 688, 690 (1961) this Court had \u201cclearly recognized [the] difference between the effect given to modal provisions of the election laws before [an] election and the effect of the same provisions [when viewed] after election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Though forewarned of the complainants\u2019 objections, both legal and factual, no steps were taken to restate the content of \u201cQuestion D.\u201d During the calendar week prior to the election, the Supervisors' published in four newspapers of general circulation within the County, a specimen ballot as it would appear on the voting machines, including the text of \u201cQuestion D.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Anne Arundel County League of Women Voters published a sample ballot in its official newspaper, undertaking to give an account of all candidates and referendum issues. Twenty-three thousand copies of the League\u2019s newspaper were distributed to various post offices, banks, libraries and stores within the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On October 15, 1974, Mr. Alton, as the out-going County Executive, upon his official stationery, mailed a personal letter to each taxpayer within the County, at addresses taken from County tax assessment records, and enclosed therein an \u201cexplanation\u201d of the local questions.

width=\"1162\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Although the proponents of the referendum, in their circulated petitions, had set forth verbatim each of the 41 amendments \u2014 though illegible except with the use of a magnifying glass \u2014 neither the newspaper of the League of Women Voters, nor the Board of Supervisors of Elections, nor the County Executive undertook in any way to apprise the electorate of either the specific content or the nature of any one of the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">When the voters throughout Anne Arundel County went to the polls on November 5, 1974, they cast 36,656 votes \u201cagainst\u201d Question D, while 11,314 voters cast ballots \u201cfor\u201d the question. The practical result of the voters\u2019 choice was to negate the effect of the 41 amendments, which had rejected the zoning recommended by the Office of Zoning and Planning, as submitted in the original ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">When the matter came before the Circuit Court for hearing, the chancellor (Wray, J.) pointed out that \u201c [p]ursuant to Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, the voters of Anne Arundel County adopted a Charter .. . Sec. 308 (a) provides that \u2018The people of Anne Arundel County reserve to themselves the power known as \u201cThe Referendum\u201d, by petition to have submitted to the registered voters ... any ordinance or part of any ordinance ....\u2019\u201d Declining to hold Sec. 308 unconstitutional, the lower court expressed the view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cNowhere in this section, in the Charter, in an ordinance, in the Maryland Code, or in the Maryland Constitution is there set out any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>requirement of publication or other notice of the County\u2019s local laws to the electorate so that the electorate may know that there is to be a referendum and have a reasonable chance to find what it is about. This is a fatal flaw. . .. Due process of law \u2018is not confined to judicial proceedings, but extends to every case which may deprive a citizen of life, liberty, or property, whether the proceeding be judicial, administrative or executive in its nature,\u2019 <em>Ulman v. Baltimore, </em>72 Md. 587 (1890), at page 593. The essence of due process is notice. The due process rights of the Complainants are not protected where there is no publication or other reasonable notice provision with respect to a referendum, so that reasonably well-informed voters may be assured. The procedural requirements of a law providing a referendum are mandatory where the attack upon it is made before an election, <em>Dutton v. Tawes, </em>225 Md. 484 (1961). The Respondents can not be made to comply with mandatory procedural requirements with respect to publication and notice when the law affords no procedural requirements. (Even if the rule were substantial compliance, there is no law against which to measure the Respondents\u2019 acts to determine substantial compliance.) It follows that the result of the vote of the people of Anne Arundel County on 5 November 1974 on Question D is a nullity.\u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A decree was entered on December 12, 1974 declaring the result of the vote on \u201cQuestion D\u201d to be \u201ca nullity and of no effect\u201d and ordering Anne Arundel County to \u201cproceed administratively in accordance with ordinance [No.] 59-73 as enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The County and the Supervisors filed an appeal; the complainant property-owners filed a cross-appeal. While the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, we granted certiorari pursuant to Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In support of their contention that the chancellor was in error, the appellants assert that the provisions in Sections 16-6 (a) and (b), 23-1 (a), 8-5 (a) and 2-10 (a) in Art. 33 pertain to the publication and notice of local questions petitioned to referendum by county voters and that those provisions were gratified with respect to \u201cQuestion D.\u201d Alternatively, they argue, should such sections in Article 33 be inapplicable, that actual notice given to the electorate fully satisfied the rights of the complainants to \u201cdue process\u201d of law. Collaterally, in urging us \u201cto decide all of the legal issues raised below by the appellees,\u201d they argue that the 41 amendments were properly submitted as a single ballot question, that the question as placed on the ballot \u201cwas sufficiently fair and informative,\u201d that the issue was \u201cproperly submissible to the entire county,\u201d and that even if the results of the election \u201cdown-zoned the complainants\u2019 properties,\u201d the appellees were not deprived of their property in violation of their constitutional rights. The property owners, in their cross-appeal, point out that the chancellor \u201cdid not grant every part of [their] request for declaratory and other relief\u2019 and here reassert each of the contentions raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">At the threshold of these questions, we point out that \u201c[t]he Referendum, broadly speaking, is the reservation by the people of a State, or local subdivision thereof, of the right to have submitted for their approval or rejection, under certain prescribed conditions, any law or part of a law passed by the law making body....\u201d See <em>Beall v. </em>State, 131 Md. 669, 678, 103 A. 99, 102 (1917), where the history of the right of referendum and the abuses it was designed to abolish were discussed. <em>See also Board of Education of Frederick County v. Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Frederick, </em>194 Md. 170, 177, 69 A. 2d 912, 915 (1949). Ordinarily, a referendum is limited to legislative matters, although the adoption of a charter, charter amendments and local laws authorizing the issuance of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness clearly come within its ambit. Rezoning, pursuant to a comprehensive plan, has been held to be a legislative function. <em>Board of County Commissioners for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Edmonds, </em>240 Md. 680, 684, 215 A. 2d 209, 211 (1965); <em>Board of County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>235 Md. 151, 158, 200 A. 2d 670, 674 (1964). Thus, it would appear \u2014 other considerations aside \u2014 that legislation, adopting a comprehensive zoning, generically should come within the scope of the right of referendum, to the extent that it might be legally invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In support of the chancellor\u2019s reasoning, the property owners basically contend that Section 308 (a) of Article III of the Anne Arundel County Charter, whereby \u201cthe people of Anne Arundel County reserve[d] to themselves the power [of] \u2018The Referendum\u2019 \u201d transcends the power authorized by Article XI-A of the Constitution, as well as that contained within the Express Powers Act (Code, (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Article 25A) and is in conflict with Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution, limiting referenda by petition to \u201cany Act, or part of any Act of the General Assembly.\u201d From these premises, they argue that the provisions within Article 33, are limited in their application, as they relate to referenda, to those specifically provided for in Article XVI of the Constitution, to charter board questions or proposed charter amendments, both under Article XI-A of the Constitution, and to the borrowing of money or issuing of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, within the provisions of the Express Powers Act, Article 25A, \u00a7 5 (P). Conceding, <em>arguendo, </em>the validity of Section 308 (a) of Article III of the County Charter, they further assert that there are no provisions within Article 33 which contain any requirement concerning the publication and notice to be given local ordinances petitioned to referendum. Lastly, they urge that should the provisions of Article 33 be applicable, they were not complied with as to the pre-election publication of notice required for a valid referendum, nor as to the wording of \u201cQuestion D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The appellants point out that the chancellor recognized the constitutionality of Section 308 (a) of Article III of the County Charter; that although Article XI-A \u201cneither expressly requires nor prohibits the inclusion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>referendum provision in the charter of a home rule county, a charter may nevertheless include such a provision,\u201d and that upon the adoption of a charter, the right of referendum is implicitly retained in the people with respect to county local laws. From this premise, the appellants contend that the several references within Article 33 to \u201clocal questions\u201d and \u201cquestions of local concern,\u201d clearly demonstrate a legislative intent that the provisions of Article 33 are applicable to the referenda of all local questions, and that these procedural requirements concerning publication and notice were effective in connection with \u201cQuestion D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In <em>Reeder v. Board of Supervisors of Elections, </em>269 Md. 261, 305 A. 2d 132 (1973), a case involving the applicability of the residency requirements of Article 33 to an individual, who sought to register to vote in Queen Anne\u2019s County on local issues, this Court held that county elections were within the scope of Article 33, and expressly noted that \u00a7 \u00a7 16-6 (a) and 23-1 (a) were applicable to county certification of questions for the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Judge Barnes, there writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018election\u2019 is defined by Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Yol.) Art. 33, \u00a7 l-l(a)(6), as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u2018 \u201cElection\u201d means the process by which voters of the State, <em>or any county </em>or city thereof, vote for <em>any </em>party or public officer pursuant to the laws of this State or the United States, any constitution or constitutional amendment, public law, public act or proposition and unless otherwise indicated <em>shall include all elections, primary, general, special, local, congressional, presidential, or State-wide. It does not mean any municipal election </em>other than in Baltimore City unless otherwise specifically provided for in this article.\u2019 (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\u201cThis definition includes voters of \u2018any county\u2019 voting for any \u2018public office\u2019 as well as \u2018local\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>elections. The argument of the appellant that county elections are excluded from the scope of Article 33 because they are \u2018municipalities,\u2019 and the only municipality included is Baltimore City, is clearly unsound in view of oie definition and the references in other sections of Article 33 to county elections and local elections. See, <em>e.g., </em>Sections 4A-6 (a) (filing fees); 9-4 (filling local vacancies including county offices); 16-6(a) and 23-l(a) (county certification of questions for the ballot).\u201d (emphasis in original) 269 Md. at 263-64, 305 A. 2d at 134.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><em>See also County Council v. Montgomery Ass\u2019n, </em>274 Md. 52, 333 A. 2d 596 (1975) where Article 33 was characterized as \u201ca comprehensive State Election Code,\u201d containing \u201cdetailed provisions covering every aspect of the electoral processes in Maryland,\u201d and providing for the \u201cadministrative supervision of election procedures\u201d and \u201cthe administrative supervision of elections on both a state-wide and a local level.\u201d 274 Md. at 60-61, 333 A. 2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In resolving the question of the applicability of the provisions set forth in Article 33 as they affect a local referendum, it is not necessary for us here to pass upon the efficacy of \u00a7 308 (a) of Article III of the Anne Arundel County Charter, and we do not do so. We point out however that in <em>Levering v. Board of Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City, </em>129 Md. 335, 337, 99 A. 360 (1916), our predecessors implicitly recognized that a provision in the City Charter could provide for the submission of referenda to the local voters, without specific authorization therefor contained in the State Constitution, or an act by the legislature. In <em>Levering, </em>the Court, when faced with the validity of the inclusion of a referendum question involving the repeal of a Baltimore City ordinance, which had previously prohibited athletic events on Sundays, decided \u201cthat no authority existed, on the part of the Mayor and City Council [of Baltimore], or of the Supervisors of Election, to provide for the submission of the question ... at the general election of\u2019 1916, because the Mayor and City Council had not received permission from the legislature to submit such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>a question to the public, and also, in the alternative to not receiving such legislative permission, that there was \u201c[n]o specific grant of power ... to refer questions of that nature to the popular vote ... in the <em>Baltimore City Charter. </em>\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The reasoning in <em>Levering </em>was acknowledged in <em>Scull v. Montgomery Citizens League, </em>249 Md. 271, 239 A. 2d 92 (1968), where this Court recognized that by a county charter provision, the people may reserve the right of referendum on public local laws enacted by its local legislative body, created pursuant to Article XI-A of the Constitution. Chief Judge Hammond, there writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201cSection 6 of Art. II of the [Montgomery County] Charter gave a right of referendum, something Art. XI-A does not require in a charter. The people reserved the right to vote on public local laws on specified matters and on \u2018(3) Any other public local law or any part of any other public local law not included under subsections (1) and (2) above.\u2019 \u201d 249 Md. at 279, 239 A. 2d at 96.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>See also Harford County v. Board of Supervisors of Elections, </em>272 Md. 33, 321 A. 2d 151 (1974), where we noted that \u201c[i]t is not uncommon for people to write into their basic charter a restriction upon the powers of their legislative body.\u201d 272 Md. at 39, 321 A. 2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Section 16-6 (a) of Article 33 provides \u201c[t]he ballots shall contain a condensed statement in understandable language of every constitutional amendment or other question to be submitted to the vote of the people at any election. It shall be sufficient in any case to print the legislative title, [or] a brief summary of the contents or purpose of the proposed amendment or referendum unless the act proposing the constitutional amendment or other question specifically provides the title to be used.\u201d The subsection further provides, in pertinent part, that the Secretary of State \u201cshall prepare and certify the form in which a constitutional amendment or question shall appear . . .,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he county commissioners, <em>county council, </em>or treasurer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Baltimore City, as the case may be, <em>shall prepare and certify to the boards </em>[of election supervisors] <em>the form in which local questions shall appear </em>on the ballot . . .\u201d (emphasis added). The subsection additionally provides that \u201c[i]n the event [that] the title of the bill, <em>ordinance </em>or resolution, as the case may be, is one hundred words or less, the title shall be sufficient. In the event the title exceeds one hundred words, a summary of the title containing not in excess of one hundred words shall be prepared and certified [by the county commissioners, county council or treasurer of Baltimore City] to the boards.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Section 16-6 (b), as amended by Chapter 328 of the Laws of 1974, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[l]ocal questions or referenda shall be designated by successive letters of the alphabet, rather than numerically.

Even though the Article contains no express reference to such a referendum, such a conclusion emanates from a reading of \u00a7 \u00a7 16-6 (a), 23-1, 23-2 and \u00a7 \u00a7 23-3 through 23-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In \u00a7 16-6 (a), mandating that ballots \u201ccontain a condensed statement in understandable language\u201d of every question \u201cto be submitted to the vote of the people at any election,\u201d the legislature clearly recognized that local officials, as distinguished from the Secretary of State, \u201cshall prepare and certify\u201d the form in which such local questions shall appear on the ballot. The section also significantly refers to \u201cbillfs], ordinance[s] or resolution[s],\u201d terms not customarily used in describing enactments of the General Assembly. Whereas \u00a7 23-1 (b) and \u00a7 23-2 each expressly refers to \u201c[qjuestions arising under Article XIA of the Constitution of Maryland\u201d (pertaining to charters), and \u00a7\u00a7 23-3 through 23-10 expressly refer to petitions filed pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>to Article XVI of the Constitution, there is no such restriction in the language used in \u00a7 23-1 (a), where reference is freely made by the General Assembly to \u201cquestions of local concern ... to be submitted for approval to the vote of the people of a county, [etc.,]\u201d without in any way modifying the nature of those \u201cquestions of local concern.\u201d We think that by such delineation and the express language used, the General Assembly clearly undertook to separately identify those referenda, arising pursuant to Articles XI-A and XVI of the Constitution, from those arising upon \u201clocal questions,\u201d \u201cquestions of local concern\u201d and \u201cordinances,\u201d and thereby clearly showed an intent, to bring within the embrace of the procedures specified in Article 33, the submission of such local questions as may be properly subject to a referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Contrary to the views expressed by the chancellor, we conclude that the \u201crequirement of publication or other notice of the County's local laws to the electorate so that the electorate may know that there is to be a referendum and have a reasonable chance to find what it is about,\u201d is supplied by the provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 23-1 (a), and 16-6 (a) of Article 33, and the interplay of those sections with \u00a7 8-5 (a), as the latter relates to the advertisement of \u201cquestions of local concern,\u201d as in the case of nominees for county offices. Though we disagree with the chancellor\u2019s <em>ratio decidendi, </em>we shall, upon reasons to be herein set forth, concur in the conclusion reached by the lower court when it declared the results of the referendum on \u201cQuestion D\u201d to be \u201ca nullity and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The County Council purportedly acted pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 16-6 (a) and 23-1 (a), when it prepared the form and contents of the referendum question and certified it to the Supervisors; in accordance with \u00a7 16-6 (b) the Council designated the question alphabetically as \u201cQuestion D;\u201d the Supervisors accepted the question, as certified, as a ballot item on the voting machines, after deleting the words \u201cTHE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL,\u201d as submitted with the Question. The Supervisors then undertook to act pursuant to \u00a7 23-1 (a), as \u201cin the case of nominees for county offices,\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 8-5 (a) and 2-10 (a) when, during the calendar week preceding the election, they caused advertisements to be published in the four newspapers within the county. Such advertisements however did no more than publish the \u201cmake-up\u201d of the question, as certified by the Council, and as it was to appear on the voting machines as \u201cQuestion D.\u201d It was conceded that at no time, nor in any manner, was either the text of ordinance No. 59-73, or the text of its 41 amendments, ever published.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See Article 33, \u00a7 23-9, requiring the publication of the <em>text </em>of those enactments by the General Assembly brought to referendum under the provisions of Article XVI of the Constitution). The critical issues however, as we see them, concern a compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 16-6 (a) as to the wordage of \u201cQuestion D\u201d and whether the advertisements, limited to the verbiage of the question, gratified the requirement of sufficient notice by publication to the electorate as contemplated by \u00a7 23-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Presupposing, without deciding, (a) that a comprehensive zoning ordinance, or a portion thereof, may be the proper subject of a petition for referendum, (b) that such a referendum may be limited to the amendments to such an ordinance, without recitation of the provisions in the ordinance to which the amendments apply, (c) that 41 separate amendments, affecting property in different locations, may be combined to form a \u201csingle question\u201d on referendum, and (d) that a referendum may be submitted to the voters of the entire county though its subject-matter is limited to properties within one tax assessment district, we shall limit our decision to an appraisal of the wording of \u201cQuestion D\u201d as it was submitted to the voters on the ballot, and whether or not its publication, by advertisements, prior to the election, permitted, in a meaningful manner, an intelligent decision, by an average voter, when he exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>his choice, in voting either \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d \u201cQuestion D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In its appraisal of compliance with the notice requirements contained in Article 33, this Court has clearly recognized the distinction between the effects of the failure to conform with such provisions when raised in pre-election litigation, as compared with the effect to be given those same provisions, when not strictly followed, and when challenged by litigation attacking the results of an election. In <em>County Commissioners of Montgomery County v. Henderson, </em>122 Md. 533, 89 A. 858 (1914), a case involving a pre-election challenge to a special election to determine the question of a special levy and county bond issue for public improvements, this Court held that \u201c[t]he provision of the statute, as to notice ... is mandatory and not merely directory,\u201d that \u201c[a]ll of the conditions prescribed should be strictly observed, because they are equally essential to the authority attempted to be conferred,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he effect of statutory requirements in cases of this kind as to time of notice by publication .. . and the terms of such provisions must be strictly complied with . . .\u201d 122 Md. at 537, 89 A. at 859-60. Finding that the publication of the proposed ballot question was not in accordance with the requirements of the statute and a fatal defect, it was held that an injunction had properly issued enjoining the appellants from holding the special election. In <em>Dutton v. Tawes, supra, </em>Chapter 739 of the Acts of 1957 (then codified as Article 33, \u00a7 170) provided that the text of a referred law be published by \u201cat least .. . one insertion in two or more newspapers within the several counties of the state and in all the daily newspapers published in Baltimore City. ..\u201d Overlooking the requirements of that section, employees of the office of the Secretary of State undertook to follow the provisions set forth in former \u00a7 208 of Article 33, as enacted by Chapter 335 of the Acts of 1941, and published the referred law (a compact with the State of Virginia relating to the Potomac River) but once, in one newspaper, the <em>jBaltimore Sun, </em>having a general circulation throughout the state. The text of a number of proposed constitutional amendments, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>voted on in the same election in 1960, were published in 53 county newspapers and in three Baltimore City newspapers. In holding that statutes, giving direction as to the mode and manner of conducting an election, are generally construed as directory when considered after an election, unless the deviation had a vital influence upon the election, Judge Hammond, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cThe Maryland cases, like those elsewhere, have held that there is a clearly recognized difference between the effect given to modal provisions of the election laws before election and the effect of the same provisions after election. Election officials of course should do what the law tells them to do and, before election, a court will require that they do their duty. Yet if the election has been held <em>before court action is sought and it is not shown that the failure of the officials to follow the law has interfered with the full and fair expression of the will of the voters, that expressed choice will not be disturbed by the Courts. Wilkinson v. McGill, </em>192 Md. 387, 393; <em>Graham v. Wellington, </em>121 Md. 656, 661; <em>Seyboldt v. Mayor </em>&amp; <em>C. C. of Mt. Ranier, </em>130 Md. 69, 73; <em>Carr v. Town of Hyattsville, </em>115 Md. 545, 549-550. The latest statement of the rule in this Court was in <em>Lexington Park Volunteer Fire Department, Inc. v. Robidoux, </em>218 Md. 195, 200: \u2018It is generally held that an election which has been honestly and fairly conducted will not be vitiated by mere failure to follow the statute precisely unless the result is shown to have been affected or the statute expressly states that such failure renders the election void. <em>After the election is held, statutes giving direction as to the mode and manner of conducting it are generally construed as directory, unless the deviation from the prescribed forms of the law had so vital an influence as probably to have prevented a free and full expression of the popular will. </em>The courts reason that it would be unjustifiable to defeat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>expressed will of the electorate if the irregularity did not frustrate or tend to prevent a free expression of the electors\u2019 intention or otherwise mislead them.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) 225 Md. at 491-92, 171 A. 2d at 690-91.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Since in <em>Dutton </em>the litigation instituted sought to enjoin the governor from proclaiming that the compact had been adopted by the electorate in the referendum, this Court, in a post-election review, held that the provisions in then \u00a7 170 of Article 33 were \u201cdirectory,\u201d and \u201cthat the record shows there was substantial, if not full, achievement of the purpose of the statute to acquaint the electorate fully with the law involved, and nothing to show that the deviation from the prescribed mode of acquainting, misled the voters or prevented, frustrated or interfered with a free, full and intelligent expression of the popular will.\u201d 225 Md. at 493, 171 A. 2d at 691. In reaching this conclusion, the Court pointed out that wide-spread publicity had been given the compact question in both news articles and editorials, that numerous radio and television news broadcasts, including a purchased television program, had related to the proposed compact and that the official specimen ballot, which in fact contained a brief and accurate summary of the statute, had been published in 53 county newspapers and in three Baltimore City papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\"><em>See however Graf v. Hiser, </em>144 Md. 418, 125 A. 151 (1924) where, in a suit filed after an election, the results were set aside because \u201cthere was a serious defect in the notice which the act made a prerequisite to the election . . .,\u201d because there was \u201cnot a substantial compliance with that essential condition precedent ...\u201d and because the mistake \u201cin the preparation of the notice, and in the reception and exclusion of votes, had a probably decisive influence upon the election.\u201d The deviation from the terms of the statute was there held to be \u201cof such consequence as to fully justify the view that the election ought to be treated as a nullity.\u201d 144 Md. at 421, 125 A. at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The complaint here was filed by the property owners 32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>days before the scheduled referendum, and the case was at issue before the election. Since the lower court, pursuant to our holdings in <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, supra, </em>in continuing the case for trial to a post-election date, preserved the issues \u201cas if heard and decided prior to the election,\u201d and adjudicated the matter as if tried prior to the election, we shall make our appraisal of compliance with the modal provisions in \u00a7 \u00a7 16-6 (a) and 23-1 (a) of Article 33 in the same context.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Article 33, \u00a7 16-6 (a), in addition to stating that \u201c[t]he ballots shall contain a condensed statement in understandable language of every constitutional amendment or other question to be submitted to the vote of the people at any election,\u201d further provides that \u201c[i]t shall be sufficient in any case to print the legislative title, [or] a brief summary of the contents or purpose of the proposed amendment or referendum unless the act proposing the constitutional amendment or other question specifically provides the title to be used.\u201d Additionally, the section sets forth that: \u201cIn the event the title of the bill, ordinance or resolution, as the case may be, is one hundred words or less, the title shall be sufficient. In the event the title exceeds one hundred words, a summary of the title containing not in excess of one hundred words shall be prepared and certified to the boards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In discussing \u201cthe sufficiency of the legend used on the ballot\u201d in a referendum, our predecessors pointed out, in <em>Lexington Park v. Robidoux, </em>218 Md. 195, 146 A. 2d 184 (1958), in interpreting the language in Code (1957) Article 33, \u00a7 94 (i) \u2014 the forerunner of \u00a7 16-6 (a) \u2014 that \u201cit is sufficient to print on the ballot the legislative title <em>or </em>a brief summary of either the contents or purpose of the proposed amendment or referendum \u2018unless the act proposing the constitutional amendment or other question specifically provides the ballot title to be used.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) 218 Md. at 199-200, 146 A. 2d at 186. Where a legislative title is used as the ballot question, the prescriptions of Article III, \u00a7 29 of the Constitution, concerning the sufficiency of the title, come into play and the title-ballot question must embrace one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>subject, fairly apprise the voters of the purpose of the act, not be misleading and not calculated to lead the public to believe that the proposed legislation is substantially different from that which would actually become law under the statute. <em>See Morris v. Governor, </em>263 Md. 20, 281 A. 2d 216 (1971); <em>Allied American Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>219 Md. 607, 614-15, 150 A. 2d 421, 426 (1959); <em>Dinneen v. Rider, </em>152 Md. 343, 357, 136 A. 754, 759 (1927). Where however the ballot question used is not the legislative title but a brief summary of the contents or purpose of the proposed act, the standard by which the question\u2019s validity will be judged, as with a legislative title, is whether the question posed, accurately and in a non-misleading manner, apprises the voters of the true nature of the legislation upon which they are voting. <em>See Morris v. Governor, supra, </em>where the Court \u201cusing the tests of the sufficiency of legislative titles\u201d found that the ballot titles prepared by the Secretary of State and not by the General Assembly, as to eight amendments to the Constitution, were adequate and not misleading. 263 Md. at 27, 281 A. 2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In two cases involving post-election challenges to referenda, where the ballot questions did not use the legislative titles, but undertook to put forth a brief summary of the contents and purposes of the respective legislation, this Court upheld the results of the referenda, finding that, although the exact titles of the bills had not been published, the questions contained concise statements concerning their nature and purpose, and that the electorate had been adequately advised, from the wording of the question, as to their elective choice. <em>See Lexington Park v. Robidoux, supra, </em>(where \u201c[t]he supervisors of election did not print the title of the act on the ballot but substituted the words \u2018Fire Tax Referendum\u2019, but otherwise followed the directions of the Act,.. .\u201d). After pointing out that \u201cthe course followed in the preparation of the ballots was a substantial compliance with the statutory provisions . .., that failure to follow strictly the prescribed directions did not affect the validity of the election,\u201d and that the case was being reviewed after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the results of the election, Judge Hammond, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cThe heart of the title was contained in these words: \u2018 * * * relating to the levy of a special fire tax in St. Mary\u2019s County and providing for a referendum thereto\u2019. Printed on the ballot was the essence of the heart of the title, namely, \u2018Fire Tax Referendum\u2019 and the words for or against \u2018the Fire Tax\u2019. We think it is clear that the voters of the Eighth Election District of St. Mary\u2019s County knew what they were voting for or against and that the failure to follow strictly the direction of the act in the preparation of the ballot had no effect upon the fairness or the result of the election.\u201d 218 Md. at 201, 146 A. at 187.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>See also Carr v. Mayor and City Council of Hyattsville, </em>115 Md. 545, 81 A. 8 (1911) (where the act directed that the ballots \u201cshould have printed on them \u2018For the Act to Improve the Streets\u2019 and \u2018Against the Act to Improve the Streets,\u2019 \u201d but where the ballots actually read \u201c \u2018For the Road Bill\u2019 and \u2018Against the Road Bill\u2019 \u201d). Our predecessors in <em>Carr, </em>also noting that the matter was being adjudicated after the referendum, pointed out that \u201c[i]t is not alleged that the voters were deceived, misled or confused by the form of the ballot as actually prepared.\u201d 115 Md. at 548, 81 A. at 9. In concluding that \u201c[t]he voters undoubtedly knew they were voting upon the question of approval or disapproval of the act\u201d and that the \u201cobject which the legislature had in view had been gratified,\u201d Judge Burke, for the Court, reasoned: \u201cThe Legislature did not expressly declare that the use of the prescribed form of ballot was essential to the validity of the election, nor does it appear from any facts stated in the bill that the omission to use that form of ballot [suggested by the Legislature] in any way affected the actual merits of the election.\u201d 115 Md. at 551, 81 A. at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The County Council in this case patently made no attempt to certify, as the ballot question, the title of the basic zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ordinance, or the titles of any of the separate 41 amendments. Nor was any attempt made to summarize those titles by a statement \u201cnot in excess of one hundred words\u201d as \u201cQuestion D.\u201d In attempting to gratify the requirement in Article 33, \u00a7 16-6 (a) that the Question submitted be \u201ca brief summary of the contents or purpose of the proposed ... referendum,\u201d the proposition submitted to the voters asked them to vote \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d the <em>\u201crezon[ing] </em>of certain parcels ... in the median strip, the west side of the southbound lane and the east side of the northbound lane of Route 3; and to <em>rezone one parcel </em>on the west side of Brockridge Road [in Laurel] <em>all parcels </em>of which are in the Fourth Assessment District and which were <em>rezoned by virtue of amendments </em>to Bill No. 59-73.\u201d (emphasis added). Although as originally submitted, \u201cQuestion D\u201d provided for the voters to choose to vote either \u201cFOR THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL\u201d or \u201cAGAINST THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL,\u201d as the Question appeared on the voting machines, their choice was limited to a vote \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d \u201crezoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The general word \u201crezone,\u201d as used in the proposition, obviously had a psychological appeal to those who consider such term as connoting a detrimental change in the current and visible use of property. Nowhere in \u201cQuestion D\u201d is there any indication of the nature of such \u201crezoning.\u201d As conceded by counsel for the appellants in argument, from the wording of \u201cQuestion D\u201d one is unable to tell whether such \u201crezoning\u201d up-graded or down-graded the zoning uses. As earlier pointed out, the respective 41 amendments adopted at least five distinct zoning classifications \u2014 C2 (Commercial, office), C3 (General Commercial), C4 (Highway Commercial), Wl-B (Industrial Development) and CIA (Neighborhood Commercial) (for the parcel located in Laurel). In fact, none of the 41 amendments undertakes to \u201crezone\u201d those tracts of land to which they apply. While the zoning proposed by the original ordinance contemplated a \u201cdown-zoning\u201d from existing commercial uses to classifications of R1 (Residential), RA (Residential Agricultural) and Wl-B (Industrial Development), each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the amendments undertook basically to negate those proposed zoning changes and to continue in effect the zoning uses which the subject properties already enjoyed under former zoning ordinances and maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u201cQuestion D\u201d gave no indication of the location, along the 10-mile length of the median within Route 3, as to how many of the affected \u201ccertain parcels of land\u201d (42 tracts) were within the median, or how many abutted the outside boundaries of the dual lanes of Route 3. Only \u201cone parcel\u201d of land on the west side of Brockridge Road . . .\u201d (in Laurel) was pinpointed. No one reading the proposition could learn that only 41 of the 145 amendments, enacted to the ordinance, were encompassed within the Question, nor that amendments, creating industrial and commercial uses for a number of properties along both sides of Route 3, not petitioned to referendum, were not within the subject-matter the voters were called upon to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The use of the term \u201ccertain parcels,\u201d without delineating the location of the properties within the referendum, in the factual background of the case created an additional ambiguity, since, as we understand it, every amendment affecting parcels within the median \u2014 except that of the J. F. Johnson Lumber Co. \u2014 was included in the referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">No voter, when confronted with \u201cQuestion D,\u201d could know that there had been two amendments (Nos. 96 and 36) affecting the extensive, commercial, lumber-yard facilities of the J. F. Johnson Lumber Co. located within the median, each of which created for such facilities a C4 (Highway Commercial) classification, nor know that although amendment No. 96 was within the ambit of \u201cQuestion D,\u201d amendment No. 36, not petitioned to referendum, had become law and that that property had been effectively zoned as C4, prior to the referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The County Executive\u2019s solicitation, addressed to each taxpayer within the County, exhorting a vote against \u201cQuestion D,\u201d certainly obfuscated the issue. His \u201cvoter\u2019s card\u201d suggested that the ballot question was limited solely to properties <em>within the median </em>strip on Route 3; that a \u201cNo\u201d vote should be registered \u201cin order to stop <em>any further </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>commercial development in the middle of this highway,\u201d and that to vote otherwise would allow \u201cservice stations, fast food stores and other strip commercial uses <em>to locate </em>in the middle of this Highway.\u201d Without doubt, each of the voters receiving this campaign literature from the chief executive officer of the County, had his attention directed to that portion of the median where \u201cfatal accidents and serious injuries\u201d had occurred. Quite deceptively, his statement did not apprise such voters that the amendments brought to referendum did, in fact continue existing commercial uses within the full length of the median, and failed to acquaint them with the fact that the referendum question embraced properties abutting the dual lanes on Route 3, as well as one parcel, 10 miles distant.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">As we see it, \u201cQuestion D,\u201d as it appeared on the voting machines, and as it was advertised, in calling upon a voter to make a choice either \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d the \u201crezoning\u201d of \u201ccertain parcels\u201d within the Fourth Assessment District, did not present a clear, unambiguous and understandable statement of the full and complete nature of the issues undertaken to be included in the proposition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Although the wordage used to frame \u201cQuestion D\u201d can surely be said to be \u201ccondensed,\u201d the summary designed did not set forth, \u201cin understandable language,\u201d \u201cthe contents and purpose of the proposed\u201d referendum with that clarity and objectivity required to permit an average voter, in a meaningful manner, to exercise an intelligent choice. Thus, upon our analysis, we conclude that the provisions in Article 33, \u00a7 16-6 (a), concerning the \u201cmake-up\u201d of \u201cQuestion D,\u201d were not gratified; nor did the advertisements publicizing it comply with the obvious intent and purpose of \u00a7 23-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Courts in other jurisdictions which have passed upon ballot questions which did not fairly and accurately present a statement of the question to be decided, have reached similar results.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The holding in <em>Markus v. Trumbull County Board of Elections, </em>22 Ohio St. 2d 197, 259 N.E.2d 501 (1970) seems here to be particularly apposite. In that case, the appellees filed an application for a zoning change requesting a zoning classification from \u201cresidential\u201d to \u201cbusiness and commercial\u201d for property owned by them in Trumbull County. In opposition to this rezoning, certain of the appellants then obtained the required number of signatures to place the matter on referendum. Prior to the appellee\u2019s application, a portion of their property had been zoned \u201cbusiness and commercial,\u201d while the remainder was zoned \u201cresidential.\u201d Similar to the provisions in Article 33, \u00a7 16-6 (a), the Ohio Statute (R.C. 3505.06) provided that \u201c[a] condensed text that will properly describe the question, issue, or amendment shall be used as prepared and certified * * * by the board for local questions or issues.\u201d The ballot question submitted to the board read as follows: \u201cShall the following described premises be amended from residential to business and commercial,\u201d and undertook to describe the entire property.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court, in affirming the declaration by the trial court that the proposed ballot was \u201cnull and void,\u201d as \u201cinsufficient, ambiguous and misleading,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cThe ballot described the entire property owned by the appellees and in no way indicated that part of the property was presently zoned for business and commercial use, and that the zone change was merely an <em>increase </em>in the size of the business and commercial zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cIn holding the condensed text on the ballot to be insufficient, ambiguous and misleading to the average citizen who might be affected thereby, the trial judge stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u2018The ballot must be complete enough to convey an intelligent idea of the scope and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>import of the amendment. It ought not to be clouded by undue detail as not to be readily understandable. It ought to be free from any misleading tendency, whether of amplification, or omission. It must in every particular be fair to the voter to the end that intelligent and enlightened judgment may be exercised by the ordinary person in deciding how to mark the ballot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u2018The ballot should be in proper form so that the voter may have at hand some means for making up his mind whether to approve or disapprove the issue.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cA ballot statement drawn pursuant to a referendum petition is crucial to the integrity of the constitutional safeguard of referendum. It is only from the ballot statement that the ultimate deciders of the question can arrive at an efficacious and intelligent expression of opinion. The ballot must fairly and accurately present a statement of the question or issue to be decided in order to assure a free, intelligent and informative vote by the average citizen affected.\u201d (emphasis in original) 22 Ohio St. 2d at 202-03, 259 N.E.2d at 504.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">A similar view was expressed by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Sears v. Treasurer and Receiver General, </em>327 Mass. 310, 98 N.E.2d 621 (1951), where, in discussing the requirement, in its constitution, that a question submitted to the electorate by the initiative process must set forth a \u201cfair, concise summary\u201d of the law to be adopted, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u201c[T]here must be a real \u2018summary.\u2019 A summary is an abridgment, abstract, compendium, or epitome. The word carries with it the idea that, however much the subject matter may be condensed, the sum and substance of it must remain. No doubt details may be omitted or in many instances covered by broad generalizations, but mention must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>be made of at least the main features of the measure. And the summary must be \u2018fair\u2019; that is to say, it must not be partisan, colored, argumentative, or in any way one-sided, and it must be complete enough to serve its purpose of giving the voter .. . who is present in a polling booth a fair and intelligent conception of the main outlines of the measure. It must do more than merely indicate the field of human or governmental activity within which the measure falls. . ..\u201d 327 Mass. at 324, 98 N.E.2d at 631.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The view expressed in <em>Sears, supra, </em>that \u201c[t]he voters [are entitled] to rely upon the statement in the ballot prepared and given to them\u201d was followed in <em>Mayor of Gloucester v. City Clerk of Gloucester, </em>327 Mass. 460, 464, 99 N.E.2d 452, 455 (1951) in holding that a referendum vote for establishing a form of government for the City of Gloucester was a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In accord with these views are <em>Troland v. City of Malden, </em>332 Mass. 351, 125 N.E.2d 134 (1955); <em>Turner v. Barnhart, </em>83 N.M. 759, 497 P. 2d 970 (1972) and <em>State Ex rel. Fleck v. Dalles City, </em>72 Ore. 337, 143 P. 1127 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Particularly noteworthy here is the decision by the Court of Common Pleas of Ohio (for Cuyahoga County) in <em>Russell v. Linton, </em>52 Ohio Op. 228, 115 N.E.2d 429 (1953), where a village council rezoned certain lands, including that of the plaintiff, for industrial uses. A petition for referendum was rejected as defective. Those who had unsuccessfully sought the referendum then filed a petition for initiative. The proposed ordinance was to re-zone the area so classified as industrial and return it to the classification which existed prior to the council action. In holding that the question might properly be certified for an initiative election, that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cThis now brings us to the consideration of the objections that the proposed ordinance is ambiguous and misleading and contains multiple subjects in its title and text. The obvious conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>would be, that if these handicaps existed in the ordinance, the voters could not intelligently determine upon what subject they were voting. A reading of the ordinance clearly indicates a plain intention to undo the act of the village council in rezoning certain lands and to place such lands back into a classification formerly controlling them. Certainly the voters would know the issue presented: Vote \u2018Yes\u2019 to re-zone the area for single family residences: Vote \u2018No\u2019 to retain the zoning for manufacturing purposes. It seems to be as simple as that.\u201d 52 Ohio Op. at 231, 115 N.E.2d at 432.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The question submitted in <em>Russell v. Linton, supra, </em>clearly and explicitly designated the choice submitted to the voters, as contrasted to the issue here submitted to them by \u201cQuestion D.\u201d In our case, \u201cQuestion D,\u201d as framed, did not permit a voter to know whether the existing zoning on the properties, subject to the amendments, would be changed, or remain the same, nor did it, in any way, suggest the nature of any of the \u201crezoning.\u201d <em>Compare Lexington Park v. Robidoux, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Notwithstanding the deficiencies we have found in our analysis of the composition of \u201cQuestion D,\u201d and the shortcomings attending the notice thereof by its advertisement, the appellants, relying on the post-election decisions in <em>Dutton v. Tawes, supra, </em>and citing <em>Morris v. Governor, supra </em>and <em>Lexington Park v. Robidoux, supra, </em>contend that \u201cpre-election publicity was so extensive that there can be no question that the electorate was sufficiently informed with respect to the issue raised by \u2018Question D.\u2019 \u201d They cite testimony that the Office of Planning and Zoning publicized the notices of the hearings it conducted in 1973, that as many of the affected property owners as could be notified were advised of the contemplated changes in their zoning classifications and that these meetings had been \u201cactively attended;\u201d they refer to the testimony concerning the attendance at a number of meetings, conducted in June, July and August, 1973, when the County Council held public hearings on Bill No. 59-73; they additionally call attention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the publication of the \u201csample ballot\u201d in the League of Women Voters\u2019 newspaper and the sheaf of newspaper clippings, produced through the County Publication Officer, purporting to set forth the publicity given in the press to the subject-matter of the comprehensive zoning ordinance and its amendments. The trial court indicated that it was deciding the case as if it were being tried \u201c[on] November 4, 1974, the day before the General Election,\u201d pursuant to the holdings in <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>230 Md. 18, 185 A. 2d 385 (1962); it noted that although it had \u201cadmitted the County\u2019s exhibits with respect to the notoriety given to \u2018Question D\u2019, it will ignore those exhibits [in its decision].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Although we have reviewed this case in the same posture and context in which the trial court considered it, as a pre-election challenge to the validity of \u201cQuestion D,\u201d and its publication by advertisement, and thus have been required to consider the requirements of Article 33, \u00a7\u00a7 16-6 (a) and 23-1 (a) as mandatory, rather than directory, we have nonetheless reviewed the evidence offered by the County in support of its claim of the notoriety given the referendum proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">As we see it, the attendance by property owners affected by the zoning ordinance, at three meetings conducted by the Office of Planning and Zoning, prior to July, 1973 \u2014 at a time when the amendments were not even conceived \u2014 can, in no way, be considered a substitute for the publication of the \u201ccontents and purpose\u201d of the referendum. Nor do we see how attendance by interested parties at meetings of the County Council during July and August, 1973 \u2014 15 months before the election \u2014 can constitute a substitution for the notice required to be given the electorate at-large of a ballot question to be voted upon in the 1974 General Election.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Of the 53 newspaper clippings submitted, dating from September 21, 1972 to October 31, 1974, only four were published within the year 1974 \u2014 two dated July 18, 1974 and another two on October 31, 1974. It would similarly appear that news articles published during 1973 in connection with the proposed ordinance, the meetings thereon, the 145 amendments adopted by the Council, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Executive\u2019s veto of 87 of them and the Council\u2019s override of 57 of the vetoes, would not continue to have any informative viability in November, 1974, in apprising the voters of the nature of the question they were called to vote upon in \u201cQuestion D.\u201d An <em>Evening Sun </em>account of October 31, 1974, devoting five-and-one-half columnar inches to \u201cQuestion D,\u201d gave more space to a discussion of this litigation than it did in an attempt to explain the nature of the Question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One of the news articles, published in the <em>Evening Capital </em>on July 18, 1974, stated that a \u201cYes\u201d vote \u201cwould indicate the voter approves of the Council\u2019s action,\u201d whereas a \u201cNo\u201d vote \u201cindicates the voter approves of the Administration\u2019s action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The handout, <em>Issues and Candidates </em>\u2014 \u201974, distributed by the League of Women Voters, after setting forth \u201cQuestion D\u201d verbatim on page 15, undertook, in four columnar inches, a simplistic analysis of the Question. It stated basically that if the Question passed \u201c74 acres within the median strip <em>mil become </em>commercial,\u201d although it pointed out that two or three such parcels \u201cdid not receive commercial zoning from the County Council.\u201d It further reported that \u201cif the amendments are rejected, the median strip will be zoned R1 and there will not be an <em>increase </em>of Commercial or Industrial Park zoning along either side of Rt. 3.\u201d To the extent that the pamphlet was reasonably informative to those voters who \u201cpicked-up\u201d a copy, it was certainly offset and counteracted by the solicitation mailed by the County Executive to every taxpayer in the County; it cannot be construed as substituted notice to the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Patently, such sparse, incomplete and generally outdated publicity, in no manner \u2014 either in accuracy or intensity \u2014 approaches the nature of the publicity found to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>given in <em>Dutton v. Tawes, supra, </em>where a fair and accurate summary of the statute, as the ballot question, had indeed been published in 53 county newspapers and in three Baltimore City publications, immediately prior to the conduct of the election. Additionally, our evaluation of this newspaper evidence submitted by the County, convinces us that it falls far short of being in any manner sufficient, in its factual discussions of \u201cQuestion B\u201d to adequately and informatively apprise the voting public of their elective choice, or the practical effect of a vote \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d \u201cQuestion D.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Even if we were to review this case as one where the litigation was instituted after the election, and thus consider the provisions in Article 33, \u00a7 \u00a7 16-6 (a) and 23-1 (a) as being merely directory, we still could not, based upon the nature of the pre-election publicity, uphold the validity of the referendum. We are convinced that the failure of the ballot question to present a clear, unambiguous and understandable statement of the full and complete nature of the issues included in \u201cQuestion D,\u201d coupled with the advertisements, limited as they were to a verbatim statement of the Question, constituted a \u201cdeviation from the prescribed forms of the law [and] had so vital an influence as probably to have prevented a free and full expression of the popular will.\u201d <em>Dutton v. Tawes, </em>225 Md. at 491, 171 A. 2d at 691; <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>230 Md. at 22, 185 A. 2d at 387; <em>see also Graf v. Hiser, </em>144 Md. at 421, 125 A. at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Under the facts here, we endorse the view expressed in <em>Markus v. Trumbull County Board of Elections, supra, </em>that the ballot statement of \u201cQuestion B\u201d was \u201ccrucial to the integrity of the constitutional safeguard of [the] referendum,\u201d as it applied to the notice required to be given the electorate, since it was only from its make-up \u201cthat the ultimate deciders of [\u201cQuestion D\u201d could] arrive at an efficacious and intelligent expression of [their] opinion.\u201d Applying that test, and the view there stated, that the voter must have \u201cat hand some means for making up his mind whether to approve or disapprove [that] issue,\u201d we conclude that \u201cQuestion D,\u201d both as it was stated on the voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>machines, and as it was advertised prior to the election, was so inaccurate, ambiguous and obtuse, that an ordinary voter, of average intelligence, could not, in a meaningful and comprehending manner, have knowledgeably exercised his franchise when called upon to vote either \u201cFOR\u201d or \u201cAGAINST\u201d that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It is for these reasons, that we concur with the chancellor\u2019s decision, that the results of the referendum on \u201cQuestion D\u201d be declared a \u201cnullity and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed; costs to be paid by the appellant, cross-appellee, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Singley, J., concurs in the result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">.

Supp.), Art. 33, pertaining to the form of the ballot title.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While I concur with the majority in finding Article 33 applicable to local questions petitioned to referendum by county voters, I cannot agree that the ballot title in question failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 16-6 (a), and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Section 16-6 (a) provides generally that in the case of a referendum, \u201c[t]he ballots shall contain a condensed statement in understandable language of every constitutional amendment or other question to be submitted to the vote of the people at any election.\u201d It is further stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>in \u00a7 16-6 (a), in prescribing the proper form for questions referred to the voters, that \u201c[i]t shall be sufficient in any case to print the legislative title, a brief summary of the contents or purpose of the proposed amendment or referendum ....\u201d In the instant case the legislative title was not employed in formulating the ballot title, but instead what appeared on the ballot was \u201ca brief summary of the contents or purpose\u201d which the majority finds wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Because \u00a7 16-6 (a) permits the use of the legislative title, in assessing the sufficiency of a summary of the purpose or contents of the question constituting the ballot title, the test for sufficiency of legislative titles may be used. <em>Morris v. Governor, </em>263 Md. 20, 27, 281 A. 2d 216 (1971). Thus, if the summary of the contents or purpose of the question meets the test for sufficiency of a legislative title, the requirements of \u00a7 16-6 (a) are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Similar purposes are served by a ballot title and by a legislative title. The, purpose of each is to assure that the public is fairly advised of the nature of pending legislation. <em>Neuenschwander v. Wash. San. Com., </em>187 Md. 67, 79, 48 A. 2d 593 (1946); <em>State v. Norris, </em>70 Md. 91, 95-96, 16 A. 445 (1889). To fulfill that purpose it is not necessary that the title give an abstract of the act, but only that it fairly indicate the subject of the legislation. <em>Dutton v. Tawes, </em>225 Md. 484, 499, 171 A. 2d 688, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>368 U. S. 345 (1961); <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 92, 102 A. 2d 821 (1954); <em>Painter v. Mattfeldt, </em>119 Md. 466, 474, 87 A. 413 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Referendum Question No. D, as it appeared on the ballot, fairly indicated the subject matter of the question \u2014 the rezoning of certain properties along Route 3. The question was stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201cTo rezone certain parcels of land in the median strip, the west side of the southbound lane and the east side of the northbound lane of Route 3; and to rezone one parcel of land on the west side of Brockbridge Road near Ellen Street; all parcels of which are in the Fourth Assessment District and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>which were rezoned by virtue of amendments to Bill No. 59-73.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The problems the majority finds with the ballot title are basically two: the failure of the ballot title to give the precise location of the properties to be rezoned and the failure to specify the nature of the rezoning as to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">First, as to the failure of the ballot title to give the precise location of the properties in question, it seems clear that the wording of the question was both accurate and the best statement of location possible under the circumstances. As the majority itself observes at note 2, in criticizing the referendum petition which gave the complete location of each of the properties together with its present and proposed zoning, the text of the petition was necessarily such that it could be read only with \u201cthe assistance of a magnifying glass.\u201d Surely the majority cannot then contend that the ballot was deficient in failing to likewise include metes and bounds descriptions and details of zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Secondly, and perhaps most ardently, the majority urges that the ballot title was inadequate in failing to specify whether the \u201crezoning\u201d was \u201cup-zoning\u201d or \u201cdown-zoning.\u201d While it is true that in this respect the ballot title could have been more specific, this level of generality is insufficient grounds for voiding the election. It has been observed that \u201c[s]o long as the attention of the electorate is reasonably drawn to the issue involved, claims of generalities will not be honored.\u201d C. Antieau, Municipal Corporation Law \u00a7 17.14 at 558 (1974); <em>see Concrete, Inc. v. Rheaume Builders, </em>101 N. H. 59, 132 A. 2d 133, 135 (1957); <em>McDonald v. Van Winkle, </em>136 Ore. 706, 299 P. 1015, 1017 (1931); <em>Martin v. Hart, </em>296 Ill. 149, 129 N. E. 693, 695 (1920). To state that the purpose of the amendments was to rezone the parcels in question was, as the majority apparently concedes, accurate. The comprehensive zoning ordinance gave these parcels residential zoning; the amendments petitioned to referendum had the effect of rezoning the properties by placing them in various commercial and industrial categories. Furthermore, specific reference is made to the ordinance in question, Bill No. 59-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>It is too much to ask, as the majority seems to do, that a ballot title alone present enough information that a voter, confronted for the first time with the question in the voting booth, be able to render a truly informed decision. Yet the majority, citing an Ohio case, <em>Markus v. Trumbull County Board of Elections, </em>22 Ohio St. 2d 197, 259 N.E.2d 501, 504 (1970), holds that the descriptive title of a question appearing on the ballot must be in such form \u201c \u2018that the voter may have at hand some means for making up his mind whether to approve or disapprove the issue.\u2019 \u201d It is not possible, nor is it necessarily desirable, that all aspects and nuances of a question be discussed in the ballot title. While the question of sufficiency of the summary of the contents and purpose of referred legislation on the ballot is necessarily a matter of degree, it is nonetheless certain that considerable reliance must be placed on outside sources of publicity to fill in the details.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Here there was evidence on the record of extensive publicity given the issue of the Route 3 rezoning. In fact, the extent of the pre-election publicity surrounding Question No. D was a sufficient supplement to the language of the ballot title to assure that the election would be a full and fair expression of the will of the voters. <em>See Dutton v. Tawes, supra, </em>225 Md. at 493. Three fully noticed public hearings were held on the measure by the Planning and Zoning Commission and eight by the County Council after submission of the comprehensive plan. It is not necessary to detail the very extensive extra-governmental publicity given to the question, including numerous newspaper articles, some of which contained the full text of the amendments, and the sample ballots distributed by the League of Women Voters. Suffice it to say that an officer of the Planning and Zoning Commission of Anne Arundel County testified that the Route 3 rezoning received by far the greatest publicity of any activity of the County Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The majority dismisses the effect of the pre-election publicity given this question by citing the fact that this action was commenced before the election. The principle referred to is that stated in <em>Dutton v. Tawes, supra, 225 </em>Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>at 495, to the effect \u201cthat when an election has been held and it is not shown that the failure of election officials to hew strictly to the statutory line has prevented a full and fair expression of the will of the voters the Courts will not disturb the result.\u201d In a dictum relied on by the majority here, the Court in <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>230 Md. 18, 22, 185 A. 2d 385 (1962), indicated that when an action is filed prior to the election, the court may permit the election to take place, and then later try the issues in the posture of a pre-election challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">First, the majority misconstrues the use which appellants make of the pre-election publicity. The principle stated in <em>Dutton, </em>that an election will not be declared invalid where, because of the surrounding circumstances, the result was an intelligent expression of the popular will, is directly applicable only where there has first been found a deviation from statutory election standards. Here the question is not what the effect of a deviation shall be, but rather the question is whether the ballot title in fact deviated from the requirements of \u00a7 16-6 (a). The argument proffered by appellants is simply that in assessing the sufficiency of the ballot title under \u00a7 16-6 (a), the wording of the question must be viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances. As discussed above, reliance must necessarily be placed in an election on the surrounding publicity to fully apprise the voters of the nature and purpose of a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Moreover, I have serious reservations about the efficacy of the procedure indicated in <em>Tyler. </em>While it may well be that the distinction drawn in <em>Dutton </em>between the effect of election irregularities challenged before and those challenged after an election is a legitimate one, to stay a challenge until after the election is held and then treat the action as a pre-election challenge is inconsistent with that distinction. The rationale for the rule of <em>Dutton </em>is that \u201cit would be unjustifiable to defeat the expressed will of the electorate if the irregularity did not frustrate or tend to prevent a free expression of the electors\u2019 intention . . . .\u201d <em>Lexington Park v. Robidoux, </em>218 Md. 195, 200, 146 A. 2d 184 (1958); <em>Carr v. Hyattsville, </em>115 Md. 545, 549, 81 A. 8 (1911). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>is equally unjustifiable, when a challenge is presented before an election, to permit the election to take place, and then invalidate the election because of an irregularity that did not affect the result. In either case the result is the frustration of the expression of the popular will.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">There can be little doubt that here the disapproval of the amendments referred to the voters of Anne Arundel County represented the full and fair expression of the will of the electorate. The measure was defeated by a vote of 36,656 to 11,314, approximately a three-to-one margin. Furthermore, the public record of the results of the November 1974 election shows that more people voted on Question No. D in Anne Arundel County than voted for the candidates for Governor of the State. This Court should be most reluctant to assume that the voters of Anne Arundel County, especially in view of the publicity surrounding the vote on Question No. D, did not know what they were voting for or against. <em>Morris v. Governor, supra, </em>263 Md. at 27. I would hold, therefore, that the election is not void for failure of the ballot title to comply with \u00a7 16-6 (a) of Article 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Chief Judge Murphy authorizes me to state that he concurs in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-10\">. The majority, somewhat obliquely, indicates a failure to comply with \u00a7 23-1 (a), which pertains to the noticing of local questions, as well. It appears, however, to be the position of the majority that had the ballot title satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 16-6 (a), notice of the election by publication of the proper ballot title would have satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 23-1 (a). Since I find the ballot title to be in compliance with \u00a7 16-6 (a), I therefore conclude that publication of that ballot title satisfied the notice requirements of \u00a7 23-1 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
