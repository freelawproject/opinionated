J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aql\">Defendants submitted an arbitration claim to an arbitration organization asserting that plaintiff had breached the parties\u2019 contracts. Plaintiff responded by filing a complaint against defendants in superior court. Plaintiff then filed a Code of Civil Procedure section<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 425.16 motion to strike defendants\u2019 arbitration claim. The superior court partially granted plaintiff\u2019s motion. We conclude that section 425.16 does not authorize a superior court to grant a motion to strike an arbitration claim filed only in an agreed arbitral forum and not asserted by the claimant in any complaint, cross-complaint or petition filed in court. We therefore reverse the superior court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">In October 2002, plaintiff Terrance J. Sheppard entered into employment agreements with defendants Lightpost Museum Fund, Inc. (LMF), and Art for Children Charities, Inc. (ACC). Each agreement included a nondisclosure clause that remained applicable \u201cat any time after Employee leaves employment of Employer.\u201d The employment agreements provided for binding arbitration before Christian Dispute Resolution Professionals, Inc. (CDRP), of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>any dispute that \u201carises out of, or relates to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, or otherwise between the parties . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Sheppard\u2019s employment was terminated in September 2003. His wrongful termination claim and LMF and ACC\u2019s claims of breach of contract and for declaratory relief were submitted to CDRP for binding arbitration in 2004. LMF and ACC\u2019s declaratory relief claim asserted that Sheppard had violated the agreements\u2019 nondisclosure clauses. The arbitrator awarded no relief to any of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In April 2005, LMF and ACC sent a letter to CDRP requesting that the arbitrator \u201crevisit[]\u201d their claim that Sheppard had violated the nondisclosure clauses because, after the 2004 arbitration, Sheppard, as a third party witness, had turned over confidential documents and testified about confidential information in arbitration proceedings, and had expressly stated that he was not bound by the nondisclosure clauses. LMF and ACC asserted that Sheppard \u201ccontinued\u201d to possess confidential documents and disclose confidential information to others in violation of the nondisclosure clauses. \u201cAt issue now is not evidence already adduced in [unrelated arbitration] proceedings [in which Sheppard had testified regarding confidential information], but Terry Sheppard\u2019s continued [possession and disclosure] of confidential information .. ..\u201d \u201c[LMF and ACC] will suffer continuing harm from Mr. Sheppard\u2019s breaches of the confidentiality agreements, so they seek injunctive relief that will force Mr. Sheppard to return company documents and to immediately stop releasing confidential information. They also seek an award of damages in an amount to be determined by the arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">CDRP deemed LMF and ACC\u2019s April 2005 letter to be \u201ca new Demand for Arbitration and Notice of Claim.\u201d CDRP notified Sheppard of the demand and allowed him time to file a response to the demand with CDRP. Sheppard did not file a response with CDRP.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">On May 16, 2005, Sheppard filed a complaint against LMF and ACC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Santa Clara County Superior Court alleging tort causes of action and seeking declaratory relief. His declaratory relief cause of action alleged that there was a controversy between the parties regarding Sheppard\u2019s right to testify in certain legal actions. Sheppard alleged; \u201cDefendants are also attempting to obtain a prior restraint on Sheppard\u2019s constitutional right of free speech by precluding him from writing a book involving Kinkade. Defendants\u2019 conduct is in violation of Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 425.16 and is subject to a motion to strike.\u201d He sought an unspecified \u201cjudicial determination of his rights and a declaration by the court. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In June 2005, Sheppard filed in superior court a special motion to strike \u201cthe arbitration claim pending before the [CDRP] pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 425.16.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In July 2005, LMF and ACC filed a demurrer to three of the four causes of action in Sheppard\u2019s complaint and a \u201cmotion\u201d seeking \u201can order compelling this case to arbitration\u201d under section 1281.7. The demurrer did not challenge the declaratory relief cause of action. The motion to compel asserted that Sheppard\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action in his complaint was \u201cidentical to the claim pending in arbitration\u201d and should be \u201ccompelled to binding arbitration\u201d in accordance with the employment agreement. LMF and ACC did not seek to compel arbitration of their own claim that they had previously asserted in their arbitration demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In August 2005, LMF and ACC filed opposition to Sheppard\u2019s special motion to strike. They asserted: \u201c[T]he motion . . . does not even belong before this court because [LMF and ACC] have not filed any \u2018causes of action\u2019 against Sheppard in this forum. Stated differently, Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike is fatally flawed because the subject of the motion, the [LMF/ACC] arbitration demand, is not before this court and thus there is no complaint for this court to \u2018strike.\u2019 [f] Sheppard\u2019s motion must be denied on its face because this court has no jurisdiction to strike a pleading submitted to a completely different adjudicatory body. If Sheppard wants to pursue a motion to strike, he should be required to do so in the CDRP forum . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Also in August 2005, Sheppard filed opposition in the superior court to LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of Sheppard\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action. He contended that arbitration could not be compelled because \u201cdefendants\u2019 current arbitration claim ... is in direct violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(e)(1).\u201d However, Sheppard did not file a special motion to strike the motion to compel arbitration nor did he amend his pending special motion to strike to encompass the motion to compel. Sheppard\u2019s opposition to the demurrer asserted that his declaratory relief cause of action was not identical to LMF and ACC\u2019s claim in the arbitral forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">At a September 2005 hearing, the superior court asserted that it had jurisdiction to address the motion to strike. \u201cI think that it\u2019s this Court\u2019s job to reach the motion to strike issue.\u201d It directed the parties to \u201cprepare supplemental pleading on the issue of the merits.\u201d The court stated that LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of Sheppard\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action was not \u201cripe\u201d until the court ruled on the motion to strike. The hearing was continued to October 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>At the October 2005 hearing, the superior court reasoned that the motion to strike and the motion to compel \u201care sort of opposite sides on the same point.\u201d The court divided LMF and ACC\u2019s April 2005 arbitration claim into two parts. One part of the arbitration claim was that Sheppard possessed confidential documents that LMF and ACC had a right to have returned. The other part of the arbitration claim was that Sheppard had disclosed confidential information at arbitration hearings without a subpoena and was writing a book containing confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The court ruled that the first part of the arbitration claim, which was not part of LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel, was subject to arbitration, but the other part of the arbitration claim, which had never been asserted in a complaint, cross-complaint or petition filed in court, was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction under section 425.16 and subject to Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike. The superior court concluded that it was \u201cnot proper for the arbitrator to decide\u201d if Sheppard had breached the agreement by testifying and writing a book. The court granted the motion to strike as to the second part of the claim and denied it as to the first part of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The superior court thereafter issued a single order ruling on the motion to strike, the motion to compel arbitration and the demurrer. The court reiterated its earlier assertion that the motion to compel and the motion to strike \u201care the pro[v]erbial \u2018opposite sides of the same coin.\u2019 \u201d The court purported to grant LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel \u201con the issue of whether Mr. Shep[p]ard has documents in his possession that were not turned over in violation of his employment agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court asserted that LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel sought to compel arbitration of the portion of LMF and ACC\u2019s arbitration claim which asserted that Sheppard had breached the nondisclosure clause by testifying and writing a book. Because, in the court\u2019s view, this part of the claim implicated Sheppard\u2019s right to free speech, this part of the \u201carbitration claims\u201d was subject to Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike under section 425.16. The court granted Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike this part of the arbitration claim because it targeted \u201cprotected activity\u201d and LMF and ACC had not demonstrated a probability of prevailing on this part of the claim. Sheppard\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees was denied because his motion to strike had been only partially successful. The court sustained LMF and ACC\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend as to the three tort causes of action, so that only the declaratory relief cause of action remained. LMF and ACC filed a timely notice of appeal from the court\u2019s order partially granting Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">LMF and ACC contend that the superior court erred in striking a part of their <em>arbitration claim </em>filed in the arbitral forum because section 425.16 does not authorize a superior court to strike all or part of such a claim. Sheppard maintains that section 425.16 does authorize a court to strike all or part of an arbitration claim even if the claim has never been asserted by the claimant in a complaint, cross-complaint or petition filed in a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201cWe begin as always \u2018with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u2019 [Citation.] To discover that intent we first look to the words of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.] \u2018Where the words of the statute are clear, we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Trope v. Katz </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 280 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Section 425.16 is expressly intended to target \u201cabuse of the judicial process.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) \u201cA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) \u201cThe special motion may be filed within 60 days of the service of the complaint or, in the court\u2019s discretion, at any later time upon terms it deems proper.\u201d (\u00a7425.16, subd. (f).) \u201cFor purposes of this section, \u2018complaint\u2019 includes \u2018cross-complaint\u2019 and \u2018petition,\u2019 \u2018plaintiff\u2019 includes \u2018cross-complainant\u2019 and \u2018petitioner,\u2019 and \u2018defendant\u2019 includes \u2018cross-defendant\u2019 and \u2018respondent.\u2019 \u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Section 425.16 does not expressly make arbitration claims asserted only in an arbitral forum \u201csubject to\u201d a motion to strike. The statute makes a \u201ccause of action\u201d in a \u201ccomplaint,\u201d which \u201cincludes cross-complaint and petition,\u201d \u201csubject to\u201d a motion to strike. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nevertheless, the statute\u2019s failure to expressly include arbitration claims asserted only in an arbitral forum within its ambit is not necessarily conclusive. \u201cThe term \u2018includes\u2019 is ordinarily a word of enlargement and not of limitation. [Citation.] The statutory definition of a thing as \u2018including\u2019 certain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.\u201d <em>(People v. Western Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 621, 639 [268 P.2d 723].) \u201c[W]hen a statute contains a list or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>catalogue of items, a court should determine the meaning of each by reference to the others, giving preference to an interpretation that uniformly treats items similar in nature and scope.\u201d <em>(Moore v. California State Bd. of Accountancy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 999, 1011-1012 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 358, 831 P.2d 798].) Complaints, cross-complaints and petitions are <em>pleadings, </em>which are filed in <em>courts </em>to initiate <em>judicial </em>proceedings. (\u00a7\u00a7 22, 420, 422.10.) Arbitration claims filed only in an arbitral forum, while in some ways similar to pleadings, are very different because they are not filed in <em>courts </em>and they do not initiate <em>judicial </em>proceedings. These distinctions indicate that the Legislature did not intend to include such claims within the term \u201ccomplaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Section 425.16\u2019s timing provisions provide additional evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent to exclude arbitration claims filed only in an arbitral forum from the reach of the statute. Section 425.16 requires a motion to strike to be brought within a certain time period after \u201cservice of the complaint.\u201d \u201c[S]ervice of the complaint\u201d is a term of art that refers to the means by which a court obtains jurisdiction over a defendant. (\u00a7\u00a7 410.50, 413.10, 415.10.) Arbitration claims filed only in private arbitral forums are not subject to these statutory jurisdictional limitations. By restricting the timing of a motion to strike in terms that are exclusively applicable to an action <em>in court, </em>the Legislature expressed its intent to limit the pleadings that are subject to a motion to strike to those pleadings that have been filed in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Finally, the Legislature expressly stated its intent that section 425.16 target \u201cabuse of the <em>judicial </em>process.\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a), italics added.) Private arbitration proceedings are not part of the judicial process; they are \u201cnonjudicial\u201d proceedings. \u201cNonjudicial [private contractual] arbitration proceedings are generally regulated by the procedural rules established by the arbitration agency; such proceedings are not necessarily controlled by the Code of Civil Procedure <em>unless expressly provided by that code </em>(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1280 et seq.), by the arbitration rules, by the parties\u2019 contract, or other provisions of law regulating such nonjudicial arbitration.\u201d <em>(Paramount Unified School Dist. v. Teachers Assn, of Paramount </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1371, 1387 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 311], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Section 425.16 does not \u201cexpressly provided\u201d that it applies to claims asserted only in nonjudicial arbitration proceedings. This statute was expressly intended to prevent abuse of the \u201cjudicial process,\u201d and its terms are not reconcilable with a legislative intent to extend it to arbitration claims filed only in private nonjudicial forums. It follows that the Legislature did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>authorize superior courts to strike arbitration claims filed only in arbitral forums under section 425.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Sheppard asserts that section 425.16 is nevertheless applicable here because <em>he </em>\u201cplac[ed] [LMF and ACC\u2019s] arbitration demand before the court\u201d and LMF and ACC also did so by filing a motion to compel arbitration of Sheppard\u2019s complaint. His contentions do not affect our analysis of the narrow legal issue before us. This appeal is solely from the superior court\u2019s ruling on Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike. The court\u2019s rulings on the demurrer and the motion to compel are not before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The validity of Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike cannot depend on LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration since Sheppard filed his motion to strike <em>before </em>LMF and ACC filed their motion to compel, and the motion to compel did not seek to compel arbitration of LMF and ACC\u2019s own claims. Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike did not target any cause of action in a complaint, cross-complaint or petition filed by LMF and ACC in the superior court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike explicitly targeted only LMF and ACC\u2019s April 2005 <em>arbitration claim, </em>not their subsequently filed motion to compel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And obviously Sheppard did not move to strike <em>his own </em>declaratory relief cause of action that he claims \u201cplac[ed]\u201d LMF and ACC\u2019s arbitration claim \u201cbefore the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Since Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike targeted only LMF and ACC\u2019s arbitration claim, which had been asserted by the claimants only in the arbitral forum and not as part of a complaint, cross-complaint or petition filed in court, and this claim was not subject to section 425.16, the superior court erred in partially granting Sheppard\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">HI. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The superior court\u2019s order is reversed, and the superior court is directed to vacate its order and enter a new order denying Sheppard\u2019s motion to strike in its entirety. LMF and ACC shall recover their appellate costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Duffy, 1, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-12\"> Subsequent unspecified statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> Sheppard\u2019s complaint also named Thomas Kinkade and The Thomas Kinkade Company, which are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> As noted above, this claim was not the subject of the motion to compel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> We therefore have no reason to examine the scope or validity of the arbitration clauses in the agreements between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\"> Sheppard did not even move to strike LMF and ACC\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> LMF and ACC do not challenge the superior court\u2019s partial denial of their motion to compel in this appeal.

I write separately in order to commend and comment upon the trial court\u2019s attempt to resolve what was essentially an arbitration dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In spite of the inartful pleadings and the unusual procedural posture of the case, the trial court recognized the essence of the dispute between the parties as a disagreement over proceeding to arbitration: The former employer viewed the matter as a breach of the employment contract and subject to arbitration under the terms of that agreement; the former employee claimed he was being forced into arbitration for engaging in constitutionally protected activity. Each side sought the protection of the court in support of its position concerning the former employer\u2019s demand for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Courts in California have long recognized that \u201cCalifornia law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>(Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669]; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.) However, the arbitrability of a claim is a matter to be decided by the <em>court. (Freeman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479-480 [121 Cal.Rptr. 477, 535 P.2d 341]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2; see also <em>Litton Financial Printing Div. </em>v. <em>NLRB </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 190, 208 [115 L.Ed.2d 177, 111 S.Ct. 2215] [\u201cWhether or not a company is bound to arbitrate, as well as what issues it must arbitrate, is a matter to be determined by the court, and a party cannot be forced to \u2018arbitrate the arbitrability question\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Here, the trial court sensed that it was the responsibility of the court to consider and resolve whether constitutional rights might be implicated in this demand for arbitration, as opposed to declining to entertain the claim and thus delegating the determination to an arbitrator or leaving the former employee with no forum for consideration of his constitutional claim. Without ruling on the correctness of the trial court\u2019s conclusions or suggesting the outcome of any further proceedings, I commend the trial court\u2019s instincts. The problem is that the issue was presented to the trial court through a section 425.16 special motion to strike, a procedural device not available under the pleading and procedural posture of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Therefore, I would remand the matter for further consideration of the issue of arbitrability where a party to an otherwise valid arbitration agreement objects to arbitration, in a proper law and motion proceeding, based on the assertion that the claim sought to be arbitrated involves a constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 14, 2007, S150058.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
