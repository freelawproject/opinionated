We conclude that, as used in the policies at issue, \u201coccurrence\u201d means injurious exposure to asbestos* not the manufacture and distribution of those products. Accordingly, we grant the writ and direct the trial court to vacate its summary adjudication order.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Real party in interest Kaiser Cement &amp; Gypsum Corporation (Kaiser) manufactured a variety of products containing asbestos (asbestos products) for more than 30 years. In recent years, Kaiser has been named as a defendant in products liability suits brought by thousands of claimants who allege they were injured by their exposure to Kaiser\u2019s asbestos products. These claims have been defended by Kaiser\u2019s primary general liability carrier, real party in interest Truck Insurance Exchange (Truck).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">After making indemnity payments for Kaiser of more than $50 million, Truck filed an action seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that Truck\u2019s policies were exhausted and that Truck had no further duty to defend or indemnify Kaiser in asbestos-related litigation. Subsequently, Truck sought summary adjudication of the declaratory judgment cause of action. The summary adjudication motion turned on the meaning of the word \u201coccurrence\u201d as used in the CGL policies. According to Truck, all claimants\u2019 asbestos injuries resulted from a single \u201coccurrence\u201d\u2014Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products\u2014and thus were subject to the policies\u2019 per occurrence liability limits. Thus, Truck contended, because its indemnity payments exceeded policy limits, the policies were exhausted and it had no further obligation to Kaiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Petitioners London Market Insurers (LMI), Kaiser\u2019s excess insurers, opposed the summary adjudication motion, arguing that the relevant \u201coccurrence\u201d was each claimant\u2019s asbestos exposure, not Kaiser\u2019s manufacture or distribution of asbestos products. Accordingly, LMI contended, the court could not conclude as a matter of law that all of Kaiser\u2019s asbestos claims resulted from a single occurrence or that Truck\u2019s policies had been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The trial court agreed with Truck that the \u201coccurrence\u201d was Kaiser\u2019s decision to manufacture and distribute asbestos products and, thus, that all asbestos injuries arose out of a single annual occurrence. It accordingly granted summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>We find that the trial court\u2019s interpretation cannot be reconciled with the policies\u2019 plain language, which compels our conclusion that an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policies is injurious exposure to asbestos, not the manufacture and distribution of asbestos products. Thus, the trial court erred in determining that all asbestos injuries arose from a single annual occurrence as a matter of law. Moreover, on the present record we cannot determine how many occurrences are responsible for the alleged injuries and, thus, whether Truck\u2019s policies have been fully exhausted. Accordingly, we grant the writ and direct the trial court to vacate its order granting Truck\u2019s motion for summary adjudication and to enter a new order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Kaiser manufactured a variety of asbestos products, including joint compounds, finishing compounds, fiberboard, and plastic cements, from 1944 through the 1970\u2019s. Kaiser produced these products at 10 different facilities at various times.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">By 2004, more than 24,000 claimants (including, among others, carpenters, electricians, sheetrockers, painters, welders, shipyard workers, mechanics, plasterers, plumbers, tile setters, acoustical sprayers and architects) had filed products liability suits against Kaiser alleging that they had suffered bodily injury, including asbestosis and various cancers, as a result of their exposure to Kaiser\u2019s asbestos products. Kaiser tendered these claims to Truck, which had issued primary CGL policies to Kaiser between 1964 and 1983. As of July 31, 2001, Truck had paid approximately $22 million to more than 900 asbestos claimants; by October 2004, Truck\u2019s indemnity payments for asbestos bodily injury claims exceeded $50 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In April 2001, Truck filed an insurance coverage action concerning its obligations to continue to defend and indemnify Kaiser for asbestos bodily injury claims. Kaiser filed a cross-complaint against its excess insurers, including LMI, seeking a declaration of coverage under its excess policies in the event Truck were able to establish that it had no further obligation to defend or indemnify Kaiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In October 2004, Truck moved for summary adjudication that all its policies had been exhausted and it had no further duty to defend or indemnify Kaiser.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The basis for Truck\u2019s motion was the \u201cper occurrence\u201d liability limitation in its CGL policies, which capped Truck\u2019s exposure for bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>injuries resulting from \u201cany one occurrence.\u201d According to Truck, under the plain language of the policies, all asbestos-related claims in any given year arose out of a single \u201coccurrence\u201d because all had the same underlying cause; \u201cthe design, manufacture and distribution by Kaiser and its subsidiaries of asbestos-bearing products.\u201d Further, Truck urged that the parties\u2019 course of conduct\u2014specifically, Kaiser\u2019s payment of a single deductible per policy year for all asbestos bodily injury claims, rather than a deductible for each claim\u2014was consistent with the conclusion that all asbestos claims resulted from a single occurrence. Thus, notwithstanding its indemnity payments exceeding $50 million, Truck contended that its liability for asbestos bodily injury claims for all policy years was only $8.3 million and that the policies were exhausted as of January 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Kaiser responded that Truck was entitled to summary adjudication, but contended that its analysis was only \u201c \u2018half right.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kaiser agreed that under the plain language of Truck\u2019s policies, all asbestos bodily injury claims resulted from a single annual occurrence. Thus, it agreed that Truck\u2019s policies had been exhausted. However, Kaiser did not agree that this result was compelled by the course of the parties\u2019 performance; to the contrary, Kaiser contended that neither it nor Truck ever believed that they had reached an agreement on the number-of-occurrences issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">LMI opposed the summary adjudication motion, contending that the court could not conclude as a matter of law that all asbestos bodily injury claims resulted from a single annual occurrence or that Truck\u2019s policies had been exhausted. Further, LMI contended that the parties\u2019 conduct demonstrated that they believed that the asbestos claims resulted from multiple occurrences. Thus, LMI urged that Truck\u2019s motion should be denied because there were triable issues of fact as to the meaning of \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The trial court initially denied the summary adjudication motion. It explained that under California law, insurance policies are interpreted based on their plain language and the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations when the policies are issued. Further, it said that in California \u201coccurrence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>means the \u201cunderlying cause of injury\u2014the act, or acts, of the insured that gives rise to the ABIC [asbestos bodily injury claims].\u201d Thus, the dispositive question was whether Kaiser reasonably could have believed that its decision to incorporate asbestos into many different products over many decades was a single occurrence. The court held that it could not: \u201c[A]s a matter of law . . . it is not now, nor was it at the time the Truck policies were issued, objectively reasonable to assume that the incorporation of chrysotile asbestos into multiple products over a period of many years would constitute a single occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Although the court thus concluded that the asbestos bodily injury claims were not a single occurrence as a matter of law, it said that on the present record it could not decide how many occurrences were responsible for the asbestos claims. It explained: \u201cThe more difficult issue presented by Truck\u2019s motion is determining the <em>number </em>of occurrences under the policies, given that they are to be determined based on an analysis of the underlying cause of injury. The Court finds that a reading of the policies as a whole does not support a determination that the manufacture, sale, and distribution of all Kaiser\u2019s asbestos-containing products constitute a single \u2018occurrence.\u2019 By the same token, however, the policies do not support LMI\u2019s interpretation that each ABIC filed against Kaiser was an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 While a \u2018decision\u2019 to manufacture a given product in a certain manner, or warn or not warn of the dangerous propensities of that product may constitute an occurrence, such a decision must be made with reference to a product or family of products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Thus, the court said, by denying summary adjudication it was \u201cnot determining that the number of occurrences under the Truck policies will necessarily be the total number of individual asbestos bodily injury claims. Given the language of the policies, there may be evidentiary support for a finding that the \u2018design, manufacture, and distribution\u2019 of a family of products, or a particular product line, constituted an occurrence under the post-\u201974 policies.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cThe determination of the actual number of occurrences under the Truck policies will be subject to further evidentiary showings in subsequent stages of these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Several months after denying the motion for summary adjudication, on its own motion the court ordered reconsideration and supplemental briefing. The court then granted summary adjudication for Truck. In doing so, it noted that California courts had not decided the issue before it, but said that the trend nationally is that \u201cinsofar as asbestos coverage cases are concerned, the underlying cause test mandates a finding that either the manufacture and sale of asbestos-containing products was the single occurrence or that the failure to warn of asbestos-containing products was the single occurrence.\u201d Thus, the court said, its decision to apply an \u201cunderlying cause test\u201d required it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>conclude that Truck and Kaiser reasonably intended to treat all asbestos bodily injury claims as a single occurrence under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Additionally, the court said, there were significant practical problems with the approach of its prior order: \u201cPractically speaking, the roadblock in finding there were multiple occurrences based on the number of products Kaiser produced is the difficulty (if not impossibility) in proving <em>which products </em>resulted in exposure to the individual claimants. There also would be no reliable way to determine what amounts paid to claimants could be allocated to a particular Kaiser product. The complaints described in the claims matrix for the underlying ABIC illustrate this point. The underlying ABIC generally do not attempt to link any claimant\u2019s asbestos injuries with any specific Kaiser product or batch of products. Under these circumstances, coverage under the policies could likely <em>never </em>be determined and [Kaiser] would be without the insurance for which it bargained.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The court concluded: \u201cUpon reconsideration, the Court finds, as a matter of law, that the manufacture and decision to place asbestos into products by the Kaiser entities constituted a single occurrence under the applicable policies. Accordingly, the Court finds that Truck\u2019s primary policies have been exhausted, and grants Truck\u2019s motion for summary adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">LMI filed a timely petition for writ of mandate. We issued an order to show cause, ordered additional briefing and stayed all proceedings until further order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">A party is entitled to summary adjudication of a cause of action if there is no triable issue of material fact and the matter can be adjudicated as a question of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (c), (f)(1).) As with a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party. <em>(Aguilar </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]; <em>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. </em>v. <em>Helliker </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1155 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 191].) On appeal, we independently review the trial court\u2019s ruling and apply the same legal standard that governs the trial court. <em>(Colgan v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 663, 678 [38 Cal.Rptr.3d 36]; <em>Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers, Inc. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1138, 1142 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 615, 88 P.3d 517].)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Although insurance contracts have special features, they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, 868 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265]; <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P2d 545].) Thus, the mutual intention of the contracting parties at the time the contract was formed governs. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636; <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 868.) We ascertain that intention solely from the written contract if possible, but also consider the circumstances under which the contract was made and the matter to which it relates. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1639, 1647; <em>American Alternative Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1239, 1245 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 918].) We consider the contract as a whole and interpret the language in context, rather than interpret a provision in isolation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641; <em>American Alternative Ins. Corp., supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1245.) We interpret words in accordance with their ordinary and popular sense, unless the words are used in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644; <em>American Alternative Ins. Corp., supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">A policy provision is ambiguous if it is capable of two or more reasonable constructions. <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619]; <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 867 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263].) In determining if a provision is ambiguous, we consider not only the face of the contract but also any extrinsic evidence that supports a reasonable interpretation. <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. v. G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 37, 39-40 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641].) Even apparently clear language may be found to be ambiguous when read in the context of the policy and the circumstances of the case. <em>(American Alternative Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1246, citing <em>MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 635, 652 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 228, 73 P.3d 1205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">If policy language is ambiguous, an interpretation in favor of coverage is reasonable only if it is consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1265.) Thus, the court must determine whether the coverage under the policy that would result from such a construction is consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. <em>(Nissel v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1103, 1111-1112 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 174].)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The meaning of \u201coccurrence\u201d as it applies to asbestos injuries is an issue of first impression in this state. Other states have considered the question, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>they have reached varying conclusions. Some courts have held that \u201coccurrence\u201d in the asbestos-exposure context means the manufacturer\u2019s decision to incorporate asbestos into its products, and thus they have concluded that all asbestos injuries for which a defendant is responsible result from a single \u201coccurrence.\u201d (E.g., <em>Greene, Tweed &amp; Co., Inc. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(E.D.Pa., Apr. 21, 2006, Civ. No. 03-3637) 2006 WL 1050110 at pp. *3-*9; <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Treesdale, Inc. </em>(3d Cir. 2005) 418 F.3d 330, 334\u2014339; <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. American Home Assurance Co. </em>(N.J.Super.Ct., July 8, 2004, Nos. A-6706-01T5 &amp; A-6720-01T5) 2004 WL 1878764 at pp. *27-*32; <em>U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Admiral Insurance Co. </em>(1994) 268 Ill.App.3d 598 [205 Ill.Dec. 619, 643 N.E.2d 1226, 1257-1260]; <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 264 N.J. Super. 460 [625 A.2d 1, 21-23]; <em>Colt Industries Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(E.D.Pa., Dec. 6, 1989, Civ. A. No. 87-4107) 1989 WL 147615 at pp. *5-*6; <em>Air Products &amp; Chemicals v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. </em>(E.D.Pa. 1989) 707 F.Supp. 762, 772-774; <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. </em>(D.D.C. 1984) 597 F.Supp. 1515, 1524\u20141528.) Other courts have held that the \u201coccurrence\u201d is the claimant\u2019s unique asbestos exposure, and thus that each exposure is a separate occurrence. (E.g., <em>In re Prudential Lines Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1998) 158 F.3d 65, 79-83; <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Porter Hayden Co. </em>(1997) 116 Md.App. 605 [698 A.2d 1167]; <em>Stonewall Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Asbestos Claims Management </em>(2d Cir. 1995) 73 F.3d 1178, 1212-1214; <em>Cole v. Celotex Corp. </em>(La.App. 1991) 588 So.2d 376, 390-391.) Still other courts have said that the \u201coccurrence\u201d is the asbestos exposure, but have held that claimants who were exposed to asbestos at approximately the same time and place were injured by the same \u201coccurrence.\u201d (E.g., <em>Fina, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. </em>(N.D.Tex. 2002) 184 F.Supp.2d 547, 549-553; <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(2001) 255 Conn. 295 [765 A.2d 891, 896-909].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Notwithstanding their profusion, none of the preceding opinions engages in the \u201cthorough examination of the policy language\u201d California law requires. <em>(TRB Investments, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 19, 27 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 597, 145 P.3d 472].) Moreover, the insurance contracts in those cases differ from the present contracts in significant ways, and while we recognize that consistent interpretation of standardized terms in insurance contracts promotes clear understanding of future contracts, it \u201cwould be foolish ... to state as a matter of law that the word \u2018occurrence\u2019 . . . has the same meaning in all insurance contracts.\u201d <em>(Flintkote Co. v. General Acc. Assur. Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2006) 410 F.Supp.2d 875, 887.) Therefore, although we have carefully reviewed the out-of-jurisdiction cases cited by the parties, we do not rely on them to any significant degree, but instead construe the insurance contracts solely on the basis of the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">THE APPLICABLE POLICY PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Track issued CGL policies to Kaiser over 19 policy periods, from 1964 to 1983. An initial version of the CGL policy was in effect from 1964 to 1973, and a second version was in effect from 1974 to 1983. The policy provisions relevant to the present petition are described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">A. <em>The First Policy: 1964-1973</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The CGL policy in effect from 1964 to 1973 (the 1964 policy) provided coverage for \u201call sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of . . . bodily injury.\u201d It further defined the scope of the coverage as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\"><em>Liability limits. </em>The 1964 policy limited Track\u2019s liability for bodily injury to $100,000 \u201ceach person,\u201d $300,000 \u201ceach occurrence,\u201d and $300,000 \u201caggregate Products.\u201d With regard to the \u201ceach occurrence\u201d limit, it further provided that \u201cThe limit of such liability stated in the Declarations as applicable to \u2018each occurrence\u2019 is, subject to the above provision respecting each person, the total limit of the Company\u2019s liability for all damages, including damages for care and loss of services, arising out of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by two or more persons in any one occurrence.\u201d With regard to the \u201caggregate Products\u201d limit, it provided that \u201cThe limits of Bodily Injury liability and Property Damage liability stated in the Declarations as \u2018aggregate products\u2019 are respectively the total limits of the Company\u2019s liability for all damages arising out of the products hazard during the twelve-month period beginning with the effective date of the products hazard coverage ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Effective January 30, 1971, the parties eliminated the aggregate product liability limit.

The relevant provisions of the policies in effect from 1974 to 1983 (the 1974 policy) are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\"><em>Liability limits. </em>The 1974 policy contained a $500,000 \u201cper occurrence\u201d liability limit. Like its immediate predecessor, it did not contain any aggregate limit, but instead provided that \u201cThere is no limit to the number of occurrences for which claims may be made hereunder, however, the limit of the Company\u2019s liability as respects any occurrence involving one or any combination of the hazards or perils insured against shall not exceed the per occurrence limit designated in the Declarations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The parties restored aggregate limits effective April 1, 1980. The $1.5 million aggregate limit was \u201cthe total limit[] of the Company\u2019s liability for all damages arising out of the products hazard and completed operations hazard during the twelve month period beginning with the effective date of such coverage provided the personal injury or property damage occurs while the policy is in force.\u201d This change did not affect the per occurrence limit, which remained $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\"><em>Deductible. </em>The 1974 policy imposed a deductible of $5,000 for \u201ceach occurrence.\u201d A January 1, 1976 endorsement increased the deductible to $50,000 per occurrence. In April 1981, the deductible was increased again, to $100,000 per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">\u201cOccurrenceThe policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can event, or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in personal injury or property damage during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Aggregation of claims. </em>The policy provided that \u201cAll such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><em>Policy period. </em>The policy applied \u201conly to occurrences during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">THE CGL POLICIES ARE NOT REASONABLY SUSCEPTIBLE OF THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL ASBESTOS BODILY INJURY CLAIMS RESULTED FROM ONE \u201cOCCURRENCE\u201d OR THAT THE POLICIES ARE EXHAUSTED AS A MATTER OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">There is no dispute between the parties regarding the limits of Truck\u2019s liability for asbestos injuries sustained from 1964 to January 1971 or April 1980 to 1983, when the policies contained aggregate limits\u2014i.e., limits on Truck\u2019s total liability for \u201call damages arising out of the products hazard and completed operations hazard during the [policy year].\u201d The sole dispute, instead, concerns liability limits between January 1971 and April 1980, when the policies did <em>not </em>contain any aggregate limits. Because during those years the only limitation on Truck\u2019s liability was the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit, Truck\u2019s potential liability for asbestos injuries is a direct function of the number of \u201coccurrences\u201d deemed responsible for those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Kaiser and Truck contend, as the trial court concluded, that the relevant \u201coccurrence\u201d is Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products, which they contend is either an \u201cevent\u201d or \u201cexposure to conditions.\u201d They urge that all claimants\u2019 asbestos bodily injury claims result from a single \u201coccurrence,\u201d i.e., \u201cthe continuous use of asbestos in a number of Kaiser\u2019s products without warning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">LMI contends, instead, that the relevant \u201coccurrence\u201d is injurious exposure to asbestos. Further, LMI urges that each claimant\u2019s asbestos injury necessarily results from a separate occurrence because \u201c[t]he alleged asbestos injuries at issue were proximately caused by exposures to Kaiser products that took place at different times, at different places, and under different circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that, as used in these policies, \u201coccurrence\u201d means injurious exposure to asbestos. We further conclude that all asbestos exposures cannot be treated as a single \u201coccurrence\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>aggregation provisions. However, on the present record we cannot determine how many occurrences are responsible for the tens of thousands of claims asserted against Kaiser; thus, we do not conclude, as LMI urges us to do, that each injurious exposure to asbestos necessarily is a separate occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">A. <em>The \u201cOccurrence\u201d Is Each Claimant\u2019s Asbestos Exposure, Not Kaiser\u2019s Manufacture and Distribution of Asbestos Products</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">1. <em>The Policy Language Defining \u201cOccurrence\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The policies define \u201coccurrence\u201d in the disjunctive: an event <em>or </em>continuous or repeated exposure to conditions. Thus, to be an \u201coccurrence,\u201d Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products must be either an \u201cevent\u201d or \u201cexposure to conditions.\u201d As we now explain, it is neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201cAn <em>event.\u201d </em>Real parties in interest suggest that \u201cevent\u201d is a \u201cbroad[] term[]\u201d that properly includes \u201c \u2018anything that happens.\u2019 \u201d Thus, they contend, Kaiser\u2019s \u201cintentional act[]\u201d of including asbestos in its products is an \u201cevent\u201d within the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">We do not agree. As LMI correctly notes, the plain meaning of \u201cevent\u201d is a discrete happening that occurs at a specific point in time. (E.g., Random House Webster\u2019s College Dict. (1992) p. 463 [event: \u201csomething that occurs in a certain place during a particular interval of time\u201d].) Thus, for example, while an explosion or series of related explosions is an \u201cevent\u201d or \u201cseries of events,\u201d 30 years of manufacturing activities cannot properly be so characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">This plain meaning analysis is reinforced by the drafting history of the form CGL policies from which Truck\u2019s policies were derived. The history, \u201cwhile not determinative, may properly be used by courts as an aid to discern the meaning of disputed policy language.\u201d <em>(MacKinnon </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 635, 653.) Before the 1960\u2019s, the form CGL policy provided coverage for injuries \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d (16 Appleman on Insurance 2d (Holmes ed. 1996) \u00a7 117.1, p. 206; see 9A Couch on Insurance (3d ed. 2005) \u00a7 129:3, p. 129-9.) The underwriting intent of the \u201ccaused by accident\u201d policies, as explained by the legal committee of the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters (NBCU), was to \u201c \u2018require one identifiable event\u2019 \u201d to trigger coverage. (Robinson, <em>The Best of Intentions: Drafting the 1966 Occurrence, and 1973 Pollution Exclusion Policy Language, </em>Practicing Law Inst. Commercial Law and Prac. Course Handbook Series (1994) 690 PLI/Comm. 565, 578-579 (Robinson, <em>The Best of </em>Intentions).) In other words, the drafters intended the \u201ccaused by accident\u201d policies to cover traditional traumatic injury cases, but not to cover injuries from continuous or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>repeated exposure to conditions: \u201c \u2018[C]aused by accident policy language is designed to include sickness and disease from an identifiable event (such as typhoid resulting from drinking contaminated water), but not to include sickness and disease from exposure over periods of time and which is not attributable to an identifiable event (such as silicosis), and usually would be so interpreted.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 579, quoting minutes of Nov. 2, 1939 meeting of NBCU legal committee.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In the early 1940\u2019s, the joint forms committee, a joint committee of the NBCU and the Mutual Insurance Rating Bureau, issued a memorandum recommending that \u201ccaused by accident\u201d policies be endorsed to include coverage for continuous or repeated exposure bodily injury claims. (Robinson, <em>The Best of Intentions, supra, </em>690 PLI/Comm. at pp. 575-576, 580.) Consistent with that recommendation, the NBCU promulgated an exposure endorsement in 1950. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 581.) The endorsement substituted \u201coccurrence\u201d for \u201caccident,\u201d and it defined \u201coccurrence\u201d using language nearly identical to the language of the Truck/Kaiser policy: \u201c \u2018 \u201cOccurrence\u201d means an event, or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which unexpectedly causes injury during the policy period.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 582.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Based on the plain meaning of the policy language, bolstered by the drafting history, we conclude that the parties did not understand or intend \u201cevent\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018anything that happens,\u2019 \u201d including \u201cthe conscious inclusion of asbestos in products manufactured and distributed by the policyholder.\u201d If the parties had so intended, the \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure\u201d clause would have been entirely superfluous, because any \u201cexposure\u201d for which a policyholder could be held liable necessarily would result from an \u201cevent.\u201d (See <em>Boghos v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 495, 503 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 787, 115 P.3d 68] [effect of Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641, \u201cis to disfavor constructions of contractual provisions that would render other provisions surplusage\u201d]; <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Knopp </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1421 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 331] [\u201ccontracts, including insurance contracts, are to be construed to avoid rendering terms surplus-age\u201d].) Instead, we conclude that the parties intended \u201cevent\u201d to mean an identifiable, single injury-causing episode\u2014an \u201caccident\u201d under the older CGL form\u2014as distinct from \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Manufacture and distribution of asbestos products over 30 years cannot reasonably be characterized as an \u201cevent,\u201d as we understand that term to have been used in the policies, because it is not a single episode. Instead, it is an ongoing course of conduct. Accordingly, the \u201cevent\u201d prong of the occurrence definition does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"><em>\u201cExposure to </em>conditionsReal parties in interest contend, alternatively, that Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products is \u201ccontinuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>or repeated exposure to conditions\u201d and, thus, is an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policies. We do not agree. It unreasonably strains the plain language of the policies to characterize manufacture and distribution of products as \u201cconditions\u201d to which claimants were exposed. We find persuasive the reasoning expressed by two trial courts that interpreted similar policy language in asbestos-related litigation. (See <em>Coordinated Asbestos Ins. Coverage Cases </em>(Super. Ct. S.F. City and County, Jan. 25, 1990, JCCP No. 1072) [\u201cIt unreasonably strains the plain language of the policy to characterize asbestos products which were shipped from Fibreboard plants as \u2018conditions\u2019 \u201d]; see also <em>Fina, Inc. v. Travelers Indent. Co., supra, </em>184 F.Supp.2d at p. 552 [\u201c[I]t is difficult to accept the contention that a failure to protect [from the dangers of asbestos] was a \u2018condition\u2019 to which all claimants were repeatedly or continuously \u2018exposed.\u2019 Such an interpretation places considerable strain on the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms \u2018condition\u2019 and \u2018exposure\u2019 \u201d].) Contrary to real parties in interest, we conclude that the \u201cconditions\u201d to which claimants were exposed were the asbestos fibers released from Kaiser\u2019s products. This interpretation does not strain the policy language. To the contrary, it is the most natural reading of that language.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">2. <em>Other Policy Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In addition to the \u201coccurrence\u201d definition, other provisions of the CGL policies\u2014which we properly consider, because contractual language \u201c \u2018 \u201cmust be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 868)\u2014reinforce the conclusion that \u201coccurrence\u201d means claimants\u2019 asbestos exposure, not Kaiser\u2019s manufacture or distribution of asbestos products.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>The products hazard definition. </em>The 1964 policy defined \u201cproducts hazard\u201d as \u201cgoods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the Named Insured or by others trading under his name, if the occurrence or accident occurs after possession of such goods or products has been relinquished to others by the Named Insured or by others trading under his name and if such occurrence or accident occurs away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">As used in this clause, neither manufacture nor distribution can be an \u201coccurrence\u201d because both necessarily occur before\u2014not after\u2014a product is relinquished by the manufacturer or distributor. Indeed, it is difficult to understand in what sense a product is \u201ca product\u201d prior to its manufacture. No such challenges are presented if \u201coccurrence\u201d means an injury-causing event, because such an event logically can occur away from the manufacturing premises after a product has been purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>The products hazard deemer. </em>The 1964 policy provided that \u201cAs respects the Products Hazard, an occurrence shall be deemed to have taken place at the time of the injury or damage to the claimant and not at the time of the act of the Insured giving rise to liability.\u201d This clause is unintelligible if the \u201coccurrence\u201d is the manufacture of the injury-causing product, because the manufacture could take place \u201cat the time of the injury\u201d only if the injury happened during the manufacturing process. As we have just noted, however, manufacturing injuries are <em>excluded </em>from the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cproducts hazard,\u201d which embraces only injuries that occur away from the insured\u2019s premises after possession of such goods or products has been relinquished to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><em>The timing clause. </em>The 1974 policy applied \u201conly to occurrences during the policy period\u201d that \u201cresulted] in personal injury or property damage during the policy period.\u201d In other words, there was coverage only where both the <em>occurrence </em>and the <em>injury </em>occurred in the same policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Interpreting \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean the \u201cmanufacture and distribution of asbestos-containing products\u201d would create significant coverage gaps because there would be no coverage for injuries caused in <em>one </em>policy period by products manufactured in <em>a prior </em>policy period. Such gaps are fundamentally inconsistent with a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d (or \u201cultra comprehensive\u201d) liability policy, and real parties in interest have not cited any evidence that the parties intended such gaps. (See <em>MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 635, 654 [purpose of CGL policies is \u201c \u2018 \u201cto provide the insured with the broadest spectrum of protection against liability for unintentional and unexpected personal injury or property damage arising out of the conduct of the insured\u2019s business\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In contrast, interpreting \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean asbestos exposure eliminates these gaps because it provides coverage during every policy period in which injury occurs, regardless of when the product was manufactured. This interpretation thus is consistent with the kind of \u201ccomprehensive\u201d coverage we believe Kaiser thought it was purchasing and Truck thought it was providing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>The notice clause. </em>Both versions of the policy require that in the event of an occurrence, \u201cwritten notice shall be given by or on behalf of the Insured to the Company ... as soon as practicable after the manager of the insurance department of the Named Insured has knowledge of an event or occurrence which, in [his or her] opinion ... is likely to result in a claim under this policy.\u201d Such notice \u201cshall contain particulars sufficient to identify the Insured and also reasonably obtainable information respecting the time, place and circumstances of the occurrence, and name and address of the injured and of available witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>As another court has noted with reference to a similar policy, this provision uses \u201coccurrence\u201d \u201cin the sense of \u2018accident\u2019: an unforeseen event that causes injury to one or more persons, or to property.\u201d <em>(Flintkote Co. v. General Acc. Assur. Co., supra, </em>410 F.Supp.2d at p. 892.) Manufacture and distribution of asbestos products is not an unforeseen event, but rather is \u201cbetter characterized as [a] business decision[].\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It would be nonsensical to require Kaiser to provide \u201cwritten notice ... as soon as practicable\u201d of its business decision to sell asbestos, and it would be equally nonsensical to require Kaiser to provide the \u201ctime, place and circumstances\u201d of its asbestos manufacturing or the \u201cname and address\u201d of \u201cwitnesses\u201d to such manufacturing. Moreover, only a seer would be able to determine that the manufacturing of a product is \u201clikely to result in a claim\u201d under a particular insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><em>The assistance and cooperation clause. </em>The policies provide that \u201cThe Insured shall not, except at his own cost, voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense, except ... for emergency medical and surgical relief to others at the time of the occurrence.\u201d Implicit in this clause is the parties\u2019 expectation that an \u201coccurrence\u201d may cause injuries requiring medical or surgical attention. It thus reinforces our conclusion that the parties understood \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean an injury-producing event, not routine manufacture or distribution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">3. <em>California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Real parties in interest urge that notwithstanding the policy language, \u201coccurrence\u201d must mean Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products because California law defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as the underlying or remote cause of an alleged injury, not the immediate cause. Thus, they suggest, because Kaiser\u2019s manufacturing and distribution is \u201cthe single underlying cause of [asbestos bodily injury claims],\u201d it necessarily is the relevant \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We do not agree. As we have said, under California law our primary guide to determining the obligations created by insurance contracts is the language of the contracts themselves. <em>(TRB Investments, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 27 [intent of the parties to an insurance contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>is \u201c \u2018to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract\u2019 \u201d]; <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] [same].) Thus, even if other courts had held that \u201coccurrence\u201d means \u201cunderlying cause\u201d in other insurance contracts with different provisions, those holdings would be largely irrelevant to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Moreover, nearly every case real parties in interest cite was decided long after the present policies were entered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, those cases could not have informed the parties\u2019 understanding of \u201coccurrence\u201d when they entered into the policies and, thus, they are not material to our determination. (E.g., <em>TRB Investments, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 27 [\u201c \u2018Under statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties <em>at the time the contract is formed </em>governs interpretation\u2019 \u201d (italics added)]; <em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center </em>v. <em>Shewry </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 964, 979 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 48], citing Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636 [\u201c \u2018The basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties\u2019 mutual intent <em>at the time of </em>contracting\u2019 \u201d (italics added)]; <em>Roddenberry v.

[Citations.] Subsequent unforeseen events cannot be allowed to control in arriving at that intent.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Finally, contrary to real parties in interest\u2019s contentions, none of the cited cases stands for the proposition that \u201coccurrence\u201d necessarily means \u201cremote\u201d cause of injury, rather than immediate cause. It is true, as real parties in interest urge, that several California cases have held \u201coccurrence\u201d means the \u201ccause\u201d (or \u201cunderlying cause\u201d) of an injury, not the injury or claim itself. (E.g., <em>Caldo Oil Co. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1996) 44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Cal.App.4th 1821, 1828 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 609]; <em>Whittaker Corp. v. Allianz Underwriters, Inc. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1242-1243 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 659].) But these cases do not consider whether \u201coccurrence\u201d means <em>remote cause </em>(manufacture of asbestos products) or <em>immediate cause </em>(exposure to asbestos fibers), and thus they do not guide our decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Elizabeth N. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1232 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 327], for example, considered the limits of an insurer\u2019s liability for damages suffered by three children who were repeatedly molested while in the care of the insured, a daycare provider. Although there, as here, the central issue was how many \u201coccurrences\u201d caused claimant\u2019s injuries, the court had no occasion to decide whether \u201coccurrence\u201d meant \u201cremote\u201d or \u201cimmediate\u201d cause because the parties stipulated that the \u201coccurrence\u201d was the insured\u2019s asserted negligent supervision\u2014the \u201cremote\u201d cause of injury\u2014 not the \u201cimmediate\u201d acts of molestation. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><em>Whittaker Corp. </em>v. <em>Allianz Underwriters, Inc., supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th 1236, also does not support real parties in interest\u2019s contention that \u201coccurrence\u201d means remote cause. Indeed, <em>Whittaker </em>is not an \u201coccurrence\u201d case at all. The only issue there was which of several CGL policies was triggered by a series of related products liability claims. That issue, the court explained, was entirely distinct from the number of occurrences: \u201cThe <em>number </em>of relevant occurrences for the purpose of interpreting the per occurrence limitation of liability is different from the question of <em>when </em>the relevant occurrence happens for the purpose of determining if there is coverage at all, or whether coverage should be allocated to a particular policy period.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>EOTT Energy Corp. v. Storebrand Internal Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 565 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 894] <em>(EOTT) </em>arguably comes the closest to equating \u201coccurrence\u201d with \u201cremote cause,\u201d but it too is not decisive. There, the insured suffered a $1.5 million loss as the result of over 650 thefts of its petroleum products. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 568.) The insurer asserted that each theft was a separate \u201coccurrence,\u201d while the insured contended that the multiple thefts were part of an organized conspiracy and, thus, constituted a single occurrence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 568-571.) The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the insurer, holding that it could not conclude, as a matter of law, that there were multiple occurrences. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 578.) It noted that the policy did not define \u201coccurrence\u201d and that the term must be interpreted consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 575.) It concluded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u201cIn our view, EOTT\u2019s objectively reasonable expectation would embrace the conclusion that multiple claims, all due to the same cause or a related cause, would be considered a single loss to which a single deductible would apply.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although <em>EOTT </em>thus holds that \u201coccurrence\u201d can mean underlying cause, it does not suggest that it necessarily has that meaning. To the contrary, the case is clear that it \u201cmust interpret the term \u2018occurrence\u2019 \u2018in context, <em>with regard to its intended function in the policy.\u2019 \u201d (EOTT, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 575, italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Therefore, none of the cases real parties in interest cite holds, as they suggest, that \u201cwhen determining whether multiple injuries or claims arose from one or more occurrences, California courts look to the conduct of the insured which caused/gave rise to liability.\u201d Indeed, none of these cases purports to do anything more than interpret the language of the particular policies at issue, as California law requires. They do not alter our conclusion that as used in the present CGL policies, \u201coccurrence\u201d means asbestos exposure that results in bodily injury, not Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">B. <em>The Plain Language of the Policies Precludes Treating All Claimants\u2019 Asbestos Exposure as Resulting from a Single \u201cOccurrence\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">For the reasons discussed in the prior section, we cannot agree with the trial court that, as a matter of law, \u201coccurrence\u201d means Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products. That conclusion is not fully dispositive of the present petition, however, because \u201c[ajlthough the trial court may grant summary judgment on one basis, this court may affirm the judgment under another!;] ... it reviews the ruling, not the rationale.\u201d <em>(Salazar v. Southern Cal. Gas Co. </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1370, 1376 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 522]; see also <em>Modern Development Co. v. Navigators Ins. Co. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 932, 938 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 528], citing <em>Lucas v. Pollock </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 668, 673 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 918] [\u201cWe must affirm the judgment if it is correct under any theory of law applicable to the case\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Therefore, we now consider the second issue raised by the petition: Whether the policy language\u2014specifically, the policies\u2019 aggregation provisions\u2014permits the thousands of individual asbestos exposures to be deemed a single \u201coccurrence.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we conclude that they cannot be so deemed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">1. <em>The \u201cOne Lot\u201d Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The sole aggregation provision of the 1964 policy provided that multiple injuries would be treated as resulting from a single occurrence if the injuries \u201carf\u00f3se] out of one lot of goods or products prepared or acquired by the Named Insured or by another trading under his name.\u201d This provision is nearly identical to a form CGL provision promulgated by the NBCU prior to 1966, which was intended by the drafters to limit the insurer\u2019s liability for products claims. (Nachman, The New Policy Provisions for General Liability Insurance (June 1965) pp. 10-11 (New Policy Provisions).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">This provision precludes treating all asbestos claims as a single \u201coccurrence.\u201d On its face, the provision aggregates only injuries that result from <em>\u201cone lot </em>of goods or products,\u201d not injuries from multiple product lots. There is absolutely no evidence that all of the asbestos claims against Kaiser derive from a single lot of asbestos products. Indeed, Kaiser concedes that they do not: \u201cThe ABIC claims against Kaiser <em>do not </em>arise out of one lot of Kaiser-manufactured products. Rather, they arise out of multiple products, made, packaged and distributed over many years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Real parties in interest urge that the inapplicability of the \u201cone lot\u201d provision is not dispositive because it \u201c[does not] purportf] to preclude a single occurrence for multiple claims\u201d where it does not apply. We do not agree. If the policies could be read, as real parties in interest suggest, to permit aggregation of claims <em>whether or not </em>they are addressed by the policies\u2019 only aggregation provision, then that provision is meaningless: Any injuries could be deemed to result from a single occurrence, whether or not they result from \u201cone lot of goods or products.\u201d Such an interpretation violates the well-established rule disfavoring constructions of contractual provisions that render other provisions surplusage. (See <em>Boghos </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 503 [effect of Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641, \u201cis to disfavor constructions of contractual provisions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>would render other provisions surplusage\u201d]; <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Knopp, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th at p. 1421 [\u201ccontracts, including insurance contracts, are to be construed to avoid rendering terms surplusage\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Real parties in interest also suggest that the \u201cone lot\u201d provision does not apply here because it concerns only nonconforming products, not design defects. Real parties in interest do not identify anything in either the policy language or the drafting history that supports that interpretation. Instead, they contend only that it would make no sense to aggregate claims, by \u201clot\u201d where the alleged defects are not lot-specific, but instead infect multiple lots or multiple products. Perhaps not, but we cannot alter the language in a contract because we question its wisdom or efficacy. The \u201clot\u201d terminology, in hindsight, may not have been a desirable way to aggregate product defect claims\u2014especially in the case of defects of the magnitude presented by the present asbestos claims\u2014but it is the language the contracting parties chose. We cannot rewrite it. <em>(Powerine Oil Co., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 377, 392 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 562, 118 P.3d 589] [\u201c \u2018we do not rewrite any provision of any contract, including the standard policy underlying any individual policy, for any purpose\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Rodriguez v. American Technologies, Inc. </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1122 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 437] [\u201cWhile we may question the wisdom of the parties\u2019 choice, ... the parties were free to choose their [contractual provisions]. The court will not rewrite their contract.\u201d]; <em>Wyandotte Orchards, Inc. v. Oroville-Wyandotte Irrigation Dist. </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 981, 986-987 [123 Cal.Rptr. 135] [\u201cthe courts cannot rewrite a contract to avoid difficulty or hardship\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Our conclusion that the \u201cone lot\u201d clause applies equally to nonconforming products and design defects is not altered by the court\u2019s contrary conclusion in <em>Diamond Shamrock Chemicals v. Aetna </em>(1992) 258 N.J. Super. 167 [609 A.2d 440, 480]. There, the court acknowledged that similar policy language did not on its face exclude design defects, but it concluded that such an exclusion nonetheless should be read into the language. According to the court: \u201cThe intent of the parties in adding the batch clause to the policies was to minimize the number of occurrences in order to maximize coverage. If the batch clause is interpreted to require aggregation of deductibles to correspond with the number of lots distributed, it will run counter to the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">We do not agree with the court\u2019s analysis. While it is indisputable that the parties intended by the \u201cone lot\u201d clause to aggregate claims <em>in some fashion, </em>it does not follow that the parties intended that claims would be aggregated to most effectively limit the insurer\u2019s liability. Rather, the clause\u2019s language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>suggests that the parties intended to aggregate only <em>some </em>claims\u2014i.e., those arising out of \u201cone lot of goods or products.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">2. <em>The \u201cSame General Conditions\u201d Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The 1974 policy eliminated the \u201cone lot\u201d provision and replaced it with the following: \u201cAll . . . exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.\u201d This provision is not reasonably susceptible of the conclusion that all asbestos claims against Kaiser resulted from one occurrence: Since the Kaiser products at issue were manufactured at 10 different facilities at various times, we cannot reasonably conclude that they \u201cemanated from\u201d a single premises location.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">As with the \u201cone lot\u201d clause, real parties in interest contend that the \u201csame general conditions\u201d clause is not exclusive, and thus that multiple claims may be treated as resulting from a single occurrence even if they are not within that clause. According to real parties in interest, to conclude that claims cannot be deemed to result from a single occurrence unless they emanate from the same premises location \u201cnecessarily adds the phrase[] \u2018and no other situation shall constitute one occurrence.\u2019 The clause does not say that, nor can it reasonably be read to impliedly include such a limitation\u2014at least not without rewriting the clause and changing its purpose.\u201d Again, we cannot agree. If the policies can be read to permit aggregation of claims <em>whether or not </em>they result from \u201cexposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location,\u201d then the provision is reduced to surplusage, in violation of established California contract interpretation rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Real parties in interest also contend that the \u201csame general conditions\u201d clause applies only to premises coverage, not products liability coverage, and thus is inapplicable here. This interpretation is not required by the plain language of the clause and real parties in interest suggest no extrinsic support for it. In any event, even if the clause does not apply to products claims, real parties in interest fare no better because no other provision of the insurance contracts permits aggregation of claims. Thus, were we to conclude that the \u201csame general conditions\u201d clause does not apply to the products liability claims against Kaiser, it would only reinforce our conclusion that those claims are not the result of a single \u201coccurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the plain language of the policies is not susceptible of the conclusion that Kaiser\u2019s manufacture and distribution of asbestos products is an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Rather, we find that the relevant \u201coccurrence\u201d is injurious exposure to asbestos products. Further, we find that the aggregation provisions preclude treating all asbestos exposure as resulting from a single annual occurrence. Thus, the grant of summary adjudication was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We caution the parties, however, that by reversing the grant of summary adjudication we have not concluded, as LMI suggests, that the number of occurrences necessarily is equal to the number of asbestos claimants. As we have indicated, the number of \u201coccurrences\u201d turns on the meaning of the \u201cone lot\u201d clause in the 1964 policy, and the \u201csame general conditions\u201d clause of the 1974 policy\u2014an issue we have not fully resolved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the present factual record is too limited to allow us to make any judgments about how the many claims against Kaiser should be aggregated.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In short, while it is clear that the policies anticipated that claims would be aggregated in some fashion, how the aggregation provisions apply will depend on the nature of the claims. The facts of each claim will determine whether the number of occurrences is limited by either the \u201cone lot\u201d clause or the \u201csame general conditions\u201d clause. On remand, it will be up to Truck to demonstrate to the trial court that these clauses apply to aggregate particular claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent superior court to vacate the January 10, 2006 order granting Truck\u2019s motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>adjudication and to enter a new order denying that motion. The stay is dissolved. The parties are to bear their own costs incurred in this writ proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Willhite, Acting P. J., and Manella, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 26, 2007, and the petition of real parties in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 9, 2007, S150310. Chin, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> Truck\u2019s summary adjudication motion addressed only the first cause of action, which sought a declaratory judgment that Truck had exhausted all applicable policy limits for asbestos bodily injury claims. The parties stipulated that the motion did not seek summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>adjudication or any other ruling as to policy limits for asbestos <em>property damage </em>claims, except to the extent that Truck\u2019s policies provide for a combined single limit for property damage and bodily injury claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> The unusual alignment of the parties is explained by the policies\u2019 per occurrence deductible provisions. Under the 1964 policy, Kaiser was responsible for the first $5,000 of loss for each \u201coccurrence\u201d; by 1981, the per occurrence deductible was $100,000. Thus, Kaiser\u2019s share of the total asbestos liability increases as the number of occurrences increases. Additionally, although asbestos claims against Kaiser collectively exceed tens of millions of dollars, many individual claims apparently are within the applicable deductibles. Thus, if each claim is treated as a separate occurrence, Kaiser may have no coverage for a substantial number of claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\"> In the trial court and in this proceeding, real parties in interest cited extrinsic evidence that they contended supported their interpretation of the relevant policies. We have not considered that evidence here. \u201cThe test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co., supra, 69 </em>Cal.2d at p. 37.)

There, a driver negligently collided first with one car and then, immediately thereafter, with a second car. The court did <em>not </em>conclude, as real parties in interest suggest, that \u201cwhen determining whether multiple injuries or claims arose from one or more occurrences, California courts look to the conduct of the insured which caused/gave rise to liability.\u201d All it held was that the per accident policy limit applied because the injuries resulted from a \u201ccontinuous sequence of events\u201d: \u201cHere the assured\u2019s liability to the owner of each of the two automobiles damaged in the collisions accrued from one act of negligence on the part of the assured\u2019s servant, namely, the negligent operation of the Marmon car which caused it to collide first with the Overland and then with the Cadillac.
