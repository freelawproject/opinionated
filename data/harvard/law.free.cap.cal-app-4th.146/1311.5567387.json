Echeverr\u00eda. State Fund contends that the award was improperly calculated using the 1997 schedule for rating permanent disabilities (PD schedule) in effect prior to January 1, 2005, rather than the new PD schedule that went into effect on that date. As will be seen, we agree and annul the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Section 4660 governs the calculation of permanent disability awards. As amended effective April 19, 2004, the section requires regular revisions in the rating schedule and, as relevant here, provides generally that \u201c[t]he schedule and any amendment thereto or revision thereof shall apply prospectively and shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule ....\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 4660, subd. (d).) But the section also provides that for \u201ccompensable claims arising before January 1, 2005,\u201d the new schedule \u201cshall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities when there has been either no comprehensive medical-legal report <em>or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent </em>disability.\u201d (\u00a7 4660, subd. (d), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">It is undisputed that Echeverr\u00eda, employed as a logger, was injured on July 21, 2004. He sustained injury to his right ankle and low back, arising out of and in the course of his employment. State Fund is the insurer for Echeverr\u00eda\u2019s employer, Hiatt Logging. His injuries became permanent and stationary on June 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">On November 15, 2004, Echeverria\u2019s counsel faxed a letter to his treating physician, Dr. Morales. The letter read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>\u201cDear Dr. Morales:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-4\">\u201cChanges have occurred in the California Workers\u2019 Compensation system. Elements of those changes may affect your patient\u2019s rights to permanent disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-5\">\u201cPlease advise by merely signing and dating this letter if you believe permanent disability, as that term is now defined, is a reasonable medical probability as a result of your patient\u2019s industrial injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-6\">\u201cThis is very important so your immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-7\"><em>\u201cI believe permanent disability is within reasonable medical probability emanating from this injury.'\u2019'\u2019 </em>Below this last sentence, spaces for date and signature appeared and contained the date of \u201c12-15-04\u201d written in and what appears to be the signature of Dr. Morales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">The Board agreed with the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) that this last sentence, <em>read in light </em>of Dr. Morales\u2019s other reports, constituted a \u201creport by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability\u201d within the meaning of section 4660, subdivision (d). The WCJ found, as well, that nothing in section 4660, subdivision (d) requires an opinion that the worker is permanent and stationary, and noted that the statute \u201cdoes not require a medical determination of the amount of permanent disability. It only requires an indication of the existence of permanent disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">Initially, State Fund argues that the WCJ could not consider Dr. Morales\u2019s statement because it did not meet the requirements for a physician\u2019s report specified in section 9785 of title 8 of the California Code of Regulations. (\u00a7 4603.2, subd. (a).) We need not address the point, however, because State Fund made no objection to the introduction of the report at trial, thereby waiving the issue. <em>(Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 492, 499-500 [175 P.2d 823]; \u00a7 5709.)</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">Nor do we need to address State Fund\u2019s contention that \u201ca report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability\u201d is neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>sarily contradicted and defeated by the fact that a worker is temporarily totally disabled and has not been declared permanent and stationary at the time the report is issued. As Echeverr\u00eda acknowledges, in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision, we must determine whether in view of the entire record substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s findings. <em>(Braewood Convalescent Hospital v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 159, 164 [193 Cal.Rptr. 157, 666 P.2d 14].) On this record, assuming without deciding that the statute \u201conly requires an indication of the existence of permanent disability,\u201d we conclude the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">\u201c \u2018[0]ur function ... is to consider the weight or persuasiveness of all of the evidence, as contrasted with that tending to support the [B]oard\u2019s decision. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rosas v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1692, 1702 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 778].) A medical opinion is not substantial evidence if it is based on an inadequate history, speculation or guess. <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Marshalls </em>(2005) 70 Cal.Comp.Cases 604, 620.) \u201c \u2018[W]hen the Board relies upon the opinion of a particular physician in making its determination, it may not isolate a fragmentary portion of his report . . . and disregard other portions that contradict or nullify the portion relied on; it must give fair consideration to all of his findings. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rosas, supra, </em>at p. 1702.) And, to be substantial evidence, a medical report must indicate the reasoning behind the doctor\u2019s opinion. <em>(Granado v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 399, 407 [71 Cal.Rptr. 678, 445 P.2d 294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In this case, the Board read Dr. Morales\u2019s December 14, 2004 single sentence statement in conjunction with all of his other reports, from September 20, 2004, through November 11, 2005. Dr. Morales\u2019s reports of September 20, 2004, and November 11, 2004, describe spinal range of motion problems which persist throughout his examinations of Echeverr\u00eda. Nothing in the reports, however, appears to tie the range of motion and pain symptoms to Dr. Morales\u2019s December 15, 2004 prediction of permanent disability. To the contrary, the reports make no mention at all of prognosis, but instead simply declare that Echeverr\u00eda remained temporarily totally disabled. None of the reports provide any reasoning to support Dr. Morales\u2019s December 15, 2004 conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>The Board\u2019s decision to apply the 1997 PD schedule is not supported by substantial evidence. It is therefore annulled and the matter is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Stein, Acting P. J., and Margulies, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\"> Further statutory references are to this code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
