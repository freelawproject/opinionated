J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">Joseph Boudames appeals his conviction by jury verdict of two counts of failing to pay sales taxes (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 7153.5) and one count of bribery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 67.5, subd. (b)). He contends the bribery conviction must be reversed because it was the result of entrapment, there is insufficient evidence to support the failure-to-pay convictions, and the restitution order incorrectly includes statutory penalties. In the published portion of our opinion, we address whether a penalty assessment imposed under Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(2) or a penalty imposed under Revenue and Taxation Code 6591 may be included in victim restitution ordered pursuant to Penal Code section 1202.4, subdivision (f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">I. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Appellant was the president of a retail computer store in San Francisco. When an auditor from the California Board of Equalization (Board), conducting a sales and use tax audit of the business, informed appellant he had a possible sales tax arrearage of $160,000, appellant implicitly offered the auditor a bribe if he would submit an audit report showing a substantially lower arrearage. Under a clandestine investigation supervised by the Department of Justice, the auditor ultimately agreed with appellant to submit a bogus audit showing a $7,000 arrearage, in exchange for personally receiving a payment of $10,000. Following the exchange, appellant\u2019s offices were searched, numerous records were seized, and he was charged with and found guilty of bribery and two felony counts of underreported taxes of more than $25,000 for a consecutive 12-month period: April 1997 to March 1998 and April 1998 to March 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>II.-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\n<em>I.-III.*</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">IV. <em>Victim Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Appellant contends the amount he was ordered to pay as victim restitution is erroneous because the amount includes statutory penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">a. <em>Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">According to the \u201cvictim\u2019s statement\u201d in the presentence report, the Board submitted \u201crestitution\u201d consisting of, inter alia, \u201c$173,821.40\u2014(tax, interest, and penalties) to date for Criminal audit period,\" i.e., the two 12-month periods that constituted the bases of counts one and two.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The $173,821.40 figure was not further broken down into the amounts of the outstanding taxes themselves, interest, and penalties. The presentence report recommended that appellant, \u201cpursuant to Section 1202.4 of the Penal Code,\u201d pay a $600 restitution fine to the restitution fund and restitution to the victim of the entire amount of victim restitution claimed by the Board. (See fn. 9, <em>ante.) </em>The presentence report did not identify the statutory basis of the \u201cpenalties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">At sentencing the court ordered appellant to pay $600 to the restitution fund and $173,821.40 \u201cin tax, interest and penalties\u201d to the Board. It ordered a hearing regarding the Board\u2019s claimed investigative costs because appellant challenged these costs, after which it would issue a separate order with respect to reimbursement for those costs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The abstract of judgment, \u201cper PC 1202.4(f),\u201d imposes a $600 \u201crestitution fine\u201d to the restitution fund and \u201crestitution to [the Board] for $173,821.40 plus 10 percent administrative fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">b. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(1) states: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.\u201d Section 1202.4 further provides that a convicted defendant shall pay a fine in the form of a penalty assessment, in accordance with section 1464 (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(2))<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>; a restitution fine between $200 and $10,000, payable to the restitution fond in the State Treasury (\u00a7 1202.4, subds. (a)(3)(A), (b)-(e)); and restitution to the victim (\u00a7 1202.4, subds. (a)(3)(B), (f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Section 1202.4, subdivision (f) states: \u201c[I]n every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim ... in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim . . . .\u201d It further provides that, to the extent possible, \u201cthe restitution order shall be prepared by the sentencing court, shall identify each victim and each loss to which it pertains, and shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim ... for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, including, but not limited to .... [f] (A) Full or partial payment for the value of stolen or damaged property. ... [][]\u2022\u2022\u2022 H] (G) Interest, at the rate of 10 percent per annum, that accrues as of the date of sentencing or loss, as determined by the court.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Neither a restitution fine, imposed under section 1202.4, subdivisions (a)(3)(A) and (b)-(e), nor victim restitution, imposed under section 1202.4, subdivisions (a)(3)(B) and (f), can serve as the underlying fine upon which a penalty assessment can be imposed under section 1202.4, subdivision (a)(2) and section 1464. (See respectively <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 986, 988 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 253]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorsey </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 729, 731 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 498].)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>c. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Appellant does not dispute that his unpaid taxes and interest thereon constitute economic losses to the Board, for which it may be compensated in a victim restitution order pursuant to section 1202.4, subdivision (f).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He argues that victim restitution is different from and does not encompass any statutory monetary penalties to which a defendant may be subject. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Statutes are to be interpreted by ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them. <em>(People v. McHenry </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 730, 732 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 877].) The first step in making this determination is to scrutinize the statute\u2019s actual words, giving them their plain and commonsense meaning. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 732, 733.) If the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Section 1202.4 could not set forth its intent regarding victim restitution any more specifically or plainly: Crime victims who incur \u201cany economic loss\u201d as a result of the crime shall receive restitution for that loss from the defendant. (\u00a7 1202.4, subds. (a)(1), (f).) Subdivision (f)(3) \u201cinclude[s] but [is] not limited to\u201d 11 itemized economic losses for which restitution is available. \u201cPenalties\u201d are not included among the specified enumerated economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Section 1202.4, subdivision (f)\u2019s catchall phrase \u201cbut not limited to,\u201d when read in conjunction with the statute as a whole, does not manifest a legislative intent that penalties are a recognizable item of victim restitution. As we explain, penalties are addressed separately from a victim\u2019s \u201ceconomic loss.\u201d Words of a statute are to be construed in context; different provisions relating to the same subject matter are to be harmonized if possible. <em>(People v. McHenry, supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 733.) Section 1202.4 specifically provides elsewhere, in subdivision (a)(2), for the payment of penalties following conviction. The enactment of discrete subdivisions for the payment of a fine in the form of a penalty assessment to the county treasurer (\u00a7\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(2), 1464) and the payment of restitution directly to the victim (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)) readily manifests a legislative intent to segregate and distinguish a \u201cpenalty assessment\u201d from \u201cvictim restitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Additionally, to deem a \u201cpenalty\u201d an item of a crime victim\u2019s economic loss is contrary to the plain meanings of \u201cpenalty,\u201d \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d and \u201crestitution\u201d and contravenes our obligation to read statutes in a commonsense fashion. <em>(People v. Dorsey, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>pp. 736-737.) A penalty is commonly understood as \u201cthe suffering, in person, rights, or property, that is annexed by law or judicial decision to the commission of a crime or public offense.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s 11th Collegiate Dict. (2004) p. 915.) It is imposed as punishment on a wrongdoer for the wrongful act, and it is suffered by the wrongdoer. On the other hand, the economic loss to which section 1202.4, subdivision (f) refers is suffered by the victim. It is the monetary value placed on the thing or things the victim had, e.g., personal goods, or anticipated having, e.g., future wages, when the wrongful act occurred and of which he or she was deprived as a result of the wrongdoer\u2019s act. Because the victim did not possess, or expect to possess, a penalty at the time of the wrongful act, he or she could not have lost it as a result of the act. Restitution is commonly understood as \u201can act of restoring or a condition of being restored ... (a) a restoration of something to its rightful owner (b) a making good of or giving an equivalent for some injury.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s 11th Collegiate Dict., <em>supra, </em>at p. 1062.) It obligates the defendant wrongdoer to restore to the victim the value of those things he or she was deprived of by the wrongful act. Therefore, in making restitution to the victim, i.e., restoring the monetary value of the things the victim lost, the defendant is not restoring a penalty to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Citing language in <em>People v. Crow </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 952, 957 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 864 P.2d 80], and subsequent cases that describes restitution as having a deterrent and rehabilitative objective, respondent argues the court did not err in awarding restitution for statutory penalties. These cases are inapposite. At issue in <em>Crow </em>was whether a county department of social services was entitled to victim restitution for welfare fraud even though it was not a natural person. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 954, 956-957.) In holding that a government agency was so entitled, <em>Crow </em>observed that \u201c \u2018the concept of restitution embodies not only the notion that people who suffer loss as a result of criminal activity should be compensated for those losses . . . , but also a perception of the value of restitution as a \u201cdeterrent to future criminality\u201d . . . , and \u201cto rehabilitate the criminal.\u201d . . . Both aims are furthered by imposing a restitution condition in appropriate cases whether or not the victim is an individual. We therefore agree with the dictum that \u201c[t]he government may be the beneficiary of [restitution] if it has incurred actual loss due to the crime, as in the instance of tax evasion or theft of government property . . . \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 957, citations omitted.) Nothing in <em>Crow\u2019s </em>observation that victim restitution may serve to deter and rehabilitate the defendant as well as to indemnify the victim can reasonably be read to transmogrify a statutory penalty the defendant is obligated to pay as a consequence of his conviction into an economic loss of the victim. As observed in <em>People v. Bernal </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 155, 161-162, 168 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 622], while victim restitution may serve the additional objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of deterrence and rehabilitation, those objectives are served by the substantial restitution fine requirement of section 1202.4, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Draut </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 577 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 469], respondent also argues that because the Board is statutorily authorized by Revenue and Taxation Code section 6591 to collect penalties for the failure to report and pay sales taxes, the trial court here had the statutory power to award such penalties as restitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We reiterate that a penalty imposed on a wrongdoer for wrongful acts, in this case a person who has not made a timely report and payment of sales tax, is not an economic loss to the victim of those wrongful acts. Nor does <em>Draut </em>support respondent\u2019s argument that a court has statutory power to award penalties as restitution. In <em>Draut </em>the defendant was guilty of fraudulently failing to report and remit sales and unemployment insurance taxes. (73 Cal.App.4th at p. 579.) The losses of the victims, Board of Equalization and Employment Development Department, were comprised of unpaid taxes and investigative costs and totaled approximately $1,157,000. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court reduced the amount to $150,000 based on the defendant\u2019s inability to pay. <em>Draut </em>reversed, holding the reduction was an abuse of discretion, because a criminal defendant is required under section 1202.4, subdivision (f), to make full restitution to the victim absent compelling and extraordinary reasons, and, by statute (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (g)), inability to pay is not a compelling or extraordinary circumstance. <em>(Draut, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 582.) <em>Draut </em>also observed that the reduced amount came nowhere near reasonably compensating the victims for the amount of their undisputed losses. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 583.) The only payments at issue in <em>Draut </em>were for victim restitution; it makes no mention of penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">A court has broad discretion in fixing a restitution order, but it abuses that discretion if the order rests on a demonstrable error of law. <em>(People v. Draut, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 581; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thygesen </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 988, 993 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 886].)  Because statutory penalties are not, as a matter of law, an item of victim restitution, the court here erred in including them in its victim restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The victim restitution order is reversed and remanded with directions to calculate a restitution order based only on the economic losses of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of Equalization. The clerk of the superior court shall prepare and deliver to the Department of Corrections an amended abstract of judgment consistent with the newly calculated order. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Simons, J., and Bruiniers, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 18, 2007, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 11, 2007, S149689.
