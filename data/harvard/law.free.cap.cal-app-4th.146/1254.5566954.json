Defendant Sanfer Sports Cars, Inc., is a Florida corporation that maintains its principal place of business in Miami, Florida. Plaintiff sued defendant in California on causes of action arising out of the purchase of a used car that plaintiff saw advertised on defendant\u2019s Web site. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Defendant is in the business of selling new and used automobiles. Defendant\u2019s only physical place of business is in Miami, Florida and its principal clientele are residents of Southern Florida. Defendant was incorporated in Florida in 1973. The company has never owned or leased property in California, has never directly advertised in the state, and has never intentionally targeted any California resident as a potential buyer or seller of an automobile. Over the course of 32 years in business defendant has sold about 44,800 vehicles; fewer than 10 of those have been sold to persons living in California. The company maintains a Web site that is accessible to anyone in the world with access to the Internet. The Web site does not target California residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">In or about June 2004, plaintiff saw a 2002 BMW M5 advertised on defendant\u2019s Web site. The Web site stated that defendant shipped vehicles \u201cworldwide.\u201d Plaintiff wrote to and telephoned defendant to inquire about the vehicle and he ultimately decided to purchase it. The contract for sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>vehicle was prepared in Florida and mailed to plaintiff in California. Although defendant\u2019s Web site allegedly included a credit application, plaintiff did not avail himself of defendant\u2019s financing service; he arranged for his own financing. When plaintiff asked defendant about shipping arrangements defendant sent him a list of shipping companies from which he could choose. Plaintiff engaged a shipping company recommended by defendant. It is undisputed that title to the vehicle passed to plaintiff when the shipper took possession of the vehicle in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">When the car arrived in California it was not as plaintiff had expected it to be. Plaintiff communicated with defendant, seeking to remedy the problem. When those negotiations failed plaintiff filed this lawsuit. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.), violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (Fla. Stat., \u00a7 501.201 et seq.), and common law fraud and misrepresentation causes of action. Although he filed suit in California, plaintiff specifies in his complaint that the action will be governed by Florida law because \u201cthe transaction . . . occurred partially in Florida.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Defendant moved to quash service of the summons on the grounds that defendant lacked minimum contacts with the State of California. The trial court granted the motion and plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The sole issue before us is whether the trial court could lawfully exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant, a Florida corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The rule is that California courts may exercise personal jurisdiction \u201con any basis consistent with the Constitutions of California and the United States.\u201d <em>(Pavlovich v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 262, 268 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 329, 58 P.3d 2] <em>(Pavlovich).) </em>\u201cIn order to satisfy due process requirements, the defendant must have \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit \u2018does not offend the \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(F. Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 782, 795 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 407], quoting <em>Internal Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316 [90 L.Ed. 95, 66 S.Ct. 154].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific. <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 445 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 899, 926 P.2d 1085] <em>(Vons).) </em>\u201cThe nature and the quality of the defendant\u2019s contacts determine whether jurisdiction, if exercised, is general or specific. General jurisdiction exists when a defendant is domiciled in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>forum state or his activities there are substantial, continuous, and systematic.\u201d <em>(F. Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 796.) Where the contacts are sufficiently substantial, continuous, and systematic, it is not necessary that the cause of action alleged be connected with the defendant\u2019s business relationship to the forum. <em>(Vons, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 445.) However, \u201ccontacts that are random, fortuitous, or attenuated do not rise to the minimum level, and general jurisdiction cannot be exercised under these circumstances.\u201d <em>(F. Hoffinan-La Roche, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>130 Cal.App.4th at p. 795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">If a defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state are not substantial, continuous, and systematic, the defendant may be subject to specific jurisdiction. \u201cA court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if: (1) \u2018the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits\u2019 [citation]; (2) \u2018the \u201ccontroversy is related to or \u2018arises out of\u2019 [the] defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum\u201d \u2019 [citation]; and (3) \u2018 \u201cthe assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.].\u201d <em>(Pavlovich, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">When a defendant challenges personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the factual basis for the exercise of jurisdiction. <em>(Vons, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 449.) Where, as here, the jurisdictional facts are undisputed, the question of jurisdiction is a purely legal question and, therefore, is subject to de novo review. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">A. <em>General Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">General jurisdiction is proper only where the defendant\u2019s contacts in the forum are continuous and systematic. Continuous and systematic contacts include such activities as maintaining an office and employees in the forum, use of forum bank accounts, and the marketing or selling of products in the forum state. <em>(Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 408, 415 [80 L.Ed.2d 404, 104 S.Ct. 1868].) Defendant has no physical presence in California, is not registered to do business here, and has never intentionally directed its marketing efforts to California residents. Plaintiff contends that defendant \u201chas sold vehicles in California for as long as thirty-two years.\u201d But the sale of 10 vehicles to California residents out of a total of more than 40,000 vehicles over a period of 32 years in business is hardly continuous and systematic contact. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any of those 10 sales took place in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Plaintiff argues that defendant\u2019s maintenance of an \u201cinteractive\u201d Web site that pursues California residents is sufficient to support general jurisdiction. But the only evidence in the record related to the Web site is that plaintiff first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>saw the vehicle advertised on the Web site, that the site states that defendant has been in business for over 30 years and ships \u201cworldwide,\u201d and that the Web site is maintained in Florida. Plaintiff\u2019s papers in opposition to the motion to quash point out that the Web site includes a credit application page, a fact that defendant seems to concede. But although plaintiff includes a reference to the Web site address, there is no authenticated evidence in the record from which one can determine what the Web site looks like nor whether it is actually interactive as opposed to merely providing a form to use when applying for financing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, defendant contends that there is no reference to California on the Web site other than in the drop-down menu on the credit form where California appears on the list of 50 states. Plaintiff does not dispute this representation. Even if the Web site is as represented, there is no evidence that it established the continuous, systematic contact with California necessary to trigger general jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">B. <em>Specific Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Plaintiff contends that defendant\u2019s use of fax, telephone, United States mail, e-mail and its \u201cinteractive\u201d Web site to communicate with plaintiff and negotiate the sale of the vehicle is sufficient to establish the first prong of the test for specific jurisdiction, i.e., to show that defendant \u201cpurposely availed\u201d itself of contact with California. <em>Pavlovich </em>explained that the purposeful availment prong is only satisfied when the defendant \u201c \u2018purposefully and voluntarily directs his activities toward the forum so that he should expect, by virtue of the benefit he receives, to be subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction based on\u2019 his contacts with the forum.\u201d <em>(Pavlovich, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 269, quoting <em>U.S. v. Swiss American Bank, Ltd. </em>(1st Cir. 2001) 274 F.3d 610, 623-624.) <em>Pavlovich </em>rejected the holding of <em>Janmark, Inc. v. Reidy </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 132 F.3d 1200, which was that the forum state could exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant <em>solely </em>because the injury occurred in the forum state. <em>(Pavlovich, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 272.) <em>Pavlovich </em>held that in order to establish personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant the plaintiff must proffer \u201cevidence of express aiming or intentional targeting.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">In evaluating Internet activity for jurisdictional purposes <em>Pavlovich </em>adopted the sliding scale test: \u201c \u2018At one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the Internet. If the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the Internet, personal jurisdiction is proper. [Citation.] At die opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an Internet Web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions. A passive Web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise [of] personal jurisdiction. [Citation.] The middle ground is occupied by interactive Web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer. In these cases, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the Web site.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pavlovich, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 274, quoting <em>Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. </em>(W.D.Pa. 1997) 952 F.Supp. 1119, 1124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\"><em>Pavlovich </em>observed that the Web site at issue in its case merely contained information, had no interactive features, and did not target California. Thus, the defendant\u2019s posting of offending material on the Web site was not enough, by itself, to subject him to jurisdiction in California. <em>Pavlovich </em>explained that creating a Web site, like placing a product into the stream of commerce, may be felt nationwide but without more it is not an act <em>purposefully directed </em>toward the forum state. If it were, personal jurisdiction in Internet-related cases would almost always be found in any forum in the country, contrary to long-settled principles of personal jurisdiction. <em>(Pavlovich, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 274\u2014275, citing <em>Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 130 F.3d 414, 418 and <em>GTE New Media Services Inc. v. BellSouth Corp. </em>(D.C. Cir. 2000) 339 U.S. App. D.C. 332 [199 F.3d 1343, 1350].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">In this case, defendant\u2019s Web site merely advertised its vehicles and (presumably) included a credit application. There is no evidence that files were exchanged via the Web site or that any business was actually conducted via the site. As plaintiff explained in his declaration, he \u201cwrote to and phoned\u201d defendant to get more information and to negotiate the purchase. Nor is there evidence that anything about the Web site specifically targeted California residents. Thus, defendant\u2019s maintenance of the Web site alone is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Citing <em>Hall </em>v. <em>LaRonde </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1344 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 399], plaintiff claims that defendant\u2019s use of mail, e-mail, or telephone to negotiate the purchase of the vehicle creates the necessary minimum contacts. <em>Hall </em>is distinguishable. There the parties, a New York defendant and a California plaintiff, had a continuing relationship. That relationship included the ongoing payment of royalties by the defendant to the plaintiff. There is no evidence of any such relationship in this case. Although there were an unknown number of communications between the parties in this case, there is no evidence that this was anything other than a one-time transaction. Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>there is no evidence that defendant ever expressly reached out to California in search of this or any other business opportunity. After the vehicle left defendant\u2019s business in Florida, defendant\u2019s only further contact with plaintiff concerned the dissatisfaction that led to the instant lawsuit. There was no ongoing business relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">We conclude that the evidence does not establish the \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d prong of the test for specific jurisdiction. It follows that plaintiff did not carry his burden and the motion to quash was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The order of the superior court granting defendant\u2019s motion to quash service of summons is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Rushing, P. J., and Elia, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\"> The Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201cinteractive\u201d in this context as: \u201cPertaining to or being a computer or other electronic device that allows a two-way flow of information between it and a user, responding immediately to the latter\u2019s input.\u201d (8 Oxford English Dict.
