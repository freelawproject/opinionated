J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADm\">Robert Wagner individually and as trustee of his children\u2019s trusts brought this action against Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., claiming he and the trusts are contractually entitled to share in the net profits Columbia earned from two motion pictures it produced based on the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>television series. The trial court concluded the contract did not entitle Wagner and the trusts to share in the profits from the movies and granted Columbia\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Wagner filed a timely appeal from the judgment. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood (the Wagners) entered into an agreement with Spelling-Goldberg Productions (SGP) \u201crelating to Charlie\u2019s Angels (herein called the \u2018series\u2019).\u201d The contract entitled the Wagners to 50 percent of the net profits SGP received as consideration \u201cfor the right to exhibit photoplays of the series and from the exploitation of all ancillary, music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.\u201d SGP subsequently sold its rights and obligations with respect to the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>series to defendant Columbia Pictures. Thirteen years later Columbia contracted to obtain the motion picture rights to the series from the heirs of the show\u2019s writers, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts. In 2000 and 2003 Columbia produced and distributed two Charlie\u2019s Angels films based on the TV series.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Wagner contends the \u201csubsidiary rights\u201d provision in the agreement with SGP entitles him and the trusts to 50 percent of the net profits from the two Charlie\u2019s Angels films. Columbia contends even if the term \u201csubsidiary rights\u201d may sometimes include movie rights, its production of the Charlie\u2019s Angels movies did not constitute exploitation of a subsidiary right <em>\u201cin connection </em>with\u201d the \u201cright to exhibit photoplays of the series.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Wagner brought this action against Columbia for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, declaratory relief and an accounting. Columbia answered and moved for summary adjudication of the cause of action for breach of contract. After the trial court granted that motion the parties stipulated to entry of judgment in favor of Columbia on the ground the order granting the motion as to the breach of contract cause of action effectively disposed of the remaining causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">I. <em>SCOPE OF REVIEW.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In <em>Wolf v. Superior Court </em>we thoroughly examined the role of an appellate court called upon to review a trial court\u2019s decision interpreting a contract and we need not repeat this discussion here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Essentially, when a party to a contract claims its terms are ambiguous the trial court\u2019s threshold determination of ambiguity is a question of law subject to our independent review. If parol evidence is admitted to determine the meaning of a contract term and the evidence is in conflict we defer to the trial court\u2019s determination under the substantial evidence test. If the evidence is not in conflict but is subject to different interpretations then we do not defer to the trial court\u2019s findings. Instead we review the lower court\u2019s interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">II. <em>THE CHARLIE\u2019S ANGELS AGREEMENT IS UNAMBIGUOUS IN DESCRIBING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE WAGNERS ARE ENTITLED TO SHARE IN THE NET PROFITS FROM THE MOTION PICTURES.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The Wagners\u2019 contract with SGP entitled them to a share of \u201call monies actually received by the producer, as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the [Charlie\u2019s Angels] series, and from the exploitation of all ancillary, music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.\u201d The principal dispute between the parties is whether the phrase \u201cin connection therewith\u201d modifies \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels television series,\u201d so the net profits SGP, or Columbia, received from any ancillary or subsidiary right which bears a \u201cconnection\u201d to the television series are included within the agreement (Wagner) or whether the phrase \u201cin connection therewith\u201d modifies \u201cthe right to exhibit photoplays of the series\u201d so only the net profits SGP, or Columbia, received by taking advantage of SGP\u2019s rights, as producer, to exhibit photoplays of the series are included in the agreement (Columbia).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Wagner offered extrinsic evidence to show the contract was reasonably susceptible to his interpretation. As has been explained in numerous cases, when a party contends the language of a contract is ambiguous the test for the admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of the contract is not whether the contract appears to the court to need interpreting \u201cbut whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the court must provisionally receive all credible evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intentions to determine whether the contract language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by a party. If in light of the extrinsic evidence the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged, then the extrinsic evidence is admitted to aid in interpreting the contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIf it is not, the case is over.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">A. <em>Wagner\u2019s Extrinsic Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">1. <em>The antecedent </em>Love Song <em>agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Wagner introduced evidence of the history of the negotiations underlying the Charlie\u2019s Angels contract in support of his interpretation of the agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">This history begins with a contract the Wagners entered into with SGP to star in a television movie of the week, <em>Love Song. </em>As compensation for Wagner and Wood acting in <em>Love Song, </em>SGP agreed to pay them a fixed amount plus one-half the net profits derived from the \u201cexploitation of all ancillary, music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.\u201d The evidence shows the definition of net profits in the <em>Love Song </em>agreement was derived from a memorandum of understanding based on negotiations between SGP and the Wagners. SGP sent a copy of this \u201cdeal memo\u201d to its counsel requesting counsel prepare a contract under which SGP, after recouping its costs, \u201cwill share equally (50/50) with [the Wagners] in all gross revenues derived from all sources from the exploitation of \u2018Love Song.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">An early draft of the <em>Love Song </em>contract limited the Wagners\u2019 net profit to the net of \u201call monies received by the Producer as consideration for the right to exhibit the photoplay.\u201d The Wagners objected to this language as inconsistent with the \u201cdeal memo,\u201d which stated SGP\u2019s intent there be an equal split of all revenues \u201cderived from all sources.\u201d They called for the phrase \u201cand all rights therein\u201d to be added immediately following the word \u201cphotoplay\u201d and asserted these rights should be defined as \u201cincluding but not limited to . . . remake rights, sequel rights, publication rights, legitimate stage rights, television rights, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>SGP\u2019s counsel responded to the Wagner\u2019s request for a revised definition of net profits, stating the language they wanted to include could be construed as granting them ownership rights in <em>Love Song. </em>Counsel affirmed, however, the Wagners were entitled to receive a share of \u201cincome from any and all sources and it is my opinion that the agreement so states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The Wagners replied their intent was not to ask for ownership rights in <em>Love Song </em>\u201cbut merely to make certain [they] participated in all revenues from all sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">After receiving this letter SGP\u2019s counsel revised the net profit definition to include profits \u201cderived from all sources from the exploitation of the photoplay and all ancillary rights therein.\u201d In an accompanying letter counsel noted with respect to net profits: \u201cI have made the change requested\u201d and \u201ccovered your comment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In the final <em>Love Song </em>contract net profits were not limited to monies received \u201cfor the right to exhibit the Photoplay.\u201d Instead they were defined as the net of \u201call monies received by Producer as consideration for the right, to exhibit the Photoplay, <em>and </em>exploitation of all ancillary, music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">2. <em>The </em>Charlie\u2019s Angels <em>agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Another provision of the <em>Love Song </em>agreement stated the Wagners would team up with SGP \u201cto jointly submit up to five ideas to ABC for the basis of a pilot script for the 1974-1975 television season.\u201d The parties agreed if ABC accepted any of these ideas they would \u201center into a business relationship . . . where the profits therefrom are shared equally between the parties.\u201d One of the ideas the Wagners and SGP submitted to ABC was a series called <em>\u2019\u2019\u2018Harry\u2019s Angels.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">After ABC expressed interest in the series, renamed <em>\u201cCharlie\u2019s </em>Angels,\u201d the Wagners entered into negotiations with SGP under the joint submissions provision of the <em>Love Song </em>agreement discussed above. As in the <em>Love Song </em>agreement the parties agreed to a 50-50 share of the net profits. The <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>agreement defines net profits as the net of \u201call monies actually received by Producer as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the series and from the exploitation of all ancillary, music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.\u201d This language is identical to the final definition of net profits in the <em>Love Song </em>agreement. In a letter to counsel for the Wagners, counsel for SGP noted the definition of net profits in the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>agreement \u201cis not a standard definition, but has many changes more favorable to your clients than any such standard definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Wagner\u2019s argument is simple and straightforward. The net profits provision in the <em>Love Song </em>agreement was intended to give the Wagners a one-half share in the net profits received by SGP \u201cfrom all sources\u201d without limitation as to source or time. This intent was confirmed by SGP\u2019s attorney, who acknowledged the Wagners were entitled to receive \u201cincome <em>from any and all sources </em>and it is my opinion that the agreement so states this.\u201d The <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>agreement was based on the <em>Love Song </em>agreement and defines net profits in identical language. Therefore, the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>agreement should also be interpreted as providing the Wagners with a 50 percent share in SGP\u2019s income \u201cfrom all sources\u201d without limitation as to source or time. Since Columbia admits it stands in SGP\u2019s shoes with respect to SGP\u2019s obligations under the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>agreement, Columbia is obligated to pay Wagner and the trusts 50 percent of the net profits derived from the Charlie\u2019s Angels movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">B. <em>Wagner\u2019s Extrinsic Evidence Does Not Support a Meaning to Which the Contract Is Reasonably Susceptible.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The problem with Wagner\u2019s extrinsic evidence is that it does not explain the contract language, it contradicts it. \u201c \u2018Under the parol evidence rule, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to contradict express terms in a written contract or to explain what the agreement was. . . . The agreement is the writing itself. . . . Parol evidence cannot ... be admitted to show intention independent of an unambiguous written instrument.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, as Justice Holmes explained, parol evidence is not admissible to show that when the parties \u201csaid five hundred feet they agreed it should mean one hundred inches, or that Bunker Hill Monument should signify the Old South Church.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Even if the Wagners and SGP intended the Wagners would share in the net profits \u201cfrom any and all sources\u201d they did not say so in their contract. What they said in their contract was the Wagners would share in \u201call monies actually received by Producer, as consideration for the right to exhibit photoplays of the series, and from the exploitation of all ancillary, music and subsidiary rights in connection therewith.\u201d For a right to be \u201csubsidiary\u201d or \u201cancillary,\u201d meaning supplementary or subordinate,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there must be a primary right to which it relates. The only primary right mentioned in the contract is \u201cthe right to exhibit photoplays of the series.\u201d Thus the Wagners were entitled to share in the profits from the exploitation of the movie rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>Angels </em>if those rights were exploited by Columbia as ancillary or subsidiary rights of its primary \u201cright to exhibit photoplays of the series\u201d but not if those rights were acquired by Columbia independently from its right to exhibit photoplays.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Thus, for example, if SGP held the motion picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>from the beginning or if it acquired them by exercising its right of first refusal as producer to purchase the rights from Goff and Roberts<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> then it could be said to have acquired those rights by exploiting its right to exhibit photoplays of the series and the Wagners would be entitled to a share of the profits. But if SGP (or Columbia) purchased the motion picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>on the open market, independent of any right it had as producer of the TV series, then it could not be said to have acquired those rights by exploiting its right to exhibit photoplays of the series and the Wagners would not be entitled to a share of the net profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">III. <em>THE UNDISPUTED EVIDENCE SHOWS SGP DID NOT ACQUIRE THE MOTION PICTURE RIGHTS TO </em>CHARLIE\u2019S ANGELS <em>BY EXPLOITING ITS RIGHTS AS PRODUCER OF THE TV SERIES.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">To understand how the producer of a television series acquires the motion picture rights in the series it is necessary to understand the concepts of \u201cworks made for hire\u201d under the Copyright Act of 1909<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and \u201cseparated rights\u201d under the 1970 Writers Guild of America minimum basic agreement (MBA).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">A. <em>Works Made for Hire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The 1909 act provided the holder of the copyright in a work had \u201cthe exclusive right . . . [t]o . . . make any other version thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It further provided, \u201cthe word \u2018author\u2019 shall include an employer in the case of works <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>made for hire.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, unless the parties agreed otherwise a writer\u2019s employer owned all of the rights comprised in the copyright, including the right to use a work created for one medium in another medium.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It was not uncommon, however, for the parties to agree to a provision reserving to the employee writer the rights in certain media while the employer producer retained the rights in other media.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Here Goff and Roberts, who wrote the teleplay for the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>pilot, entered into a contract with the producer, SGP, which provided in relevant part: \u201cProducer hereby engages Artist to render services in the writing, composition, preparation and revision of the literary material described in paragraph 3 hereof [a complete pilot script entitled \u2018Charlie\u2019s Angels\u2019]. . . . Artist agrees that all material composed, submitted, added and/or interpolated by Artist hereunder shall automatically become Producer\u2019s property and that Producer, for this purpose, shall be deemed the author thereof, Artist acting entirely as Producer\u2019s employee.\u201d Thus, if there had been no further provision in the contract concerning media rights SGP would have had the exclusive right to exploit the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>television series in a motion picture, stage play, comic book or any other media.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">B. <em>Separated Rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The contract between Goff and Roberts and SGP did contain additional provisions concerning media rights, however. The contract stated: \u201cThe parties acknowledge that this agreement is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the applicable [MBA] and to the extent that the terms and provisions of the [MBA] are more advantageous to Artist than the terms hereof, the terms of the [MBA] shall supersede and replace the less advantageous terms of this agreement.\u201d As we shall explain, the \u201cseparated rights\u201d provision of the MBA was more advantageous to Goff and Roberts than the \u201cworks made for hire\u201d provision of their contract with SGP. Therefore in determining the rights of the parties the MBA\u2019s \u201cseparated rights\u201d provision prevailed over the contract\u2019s \u201cworks made for hire\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Article 16B of the MBA, entitled \u201cSeparation of Rights,\u201d provided in relevant part the producer \u201cagrees that separation of rights . . . shall be accorded to the writer of a format, story, or story and teleplay for any television film.\u201d The rights were separated as follows: \u201c[Producer] shall own the exclusive film television rights in the literary material to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>provisions of this Article 16B apply .... Writer shall retain all other rights . . . including but not limited to . . . theatrical motion picture . . . rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Article 50 of the MBA described the rights and duties of the producer and writer with respect to separated rights. It stated: \u201cThe writer of any literary material subject to the provisions of Article 16B hereof and the [producer] agree that they will take no action with respect to the rights reserved to the writer or granted to the [producer] which will cause or permit such literary material to become a part of the public domain in the United States. Insofar as such literary material is covered by the copyright of the television film, the rights reserved to the writer hereunder will be held in trust for such writer by the owner of the copyright. . . . Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, [producer] agrees to execute and deliver to writer an assignment under the copyright of all rights in the copyright reserved or which may revert to writer pursuant to the provisions hereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Thus, in the present case, SGP owned the copyright to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>and held \u201cthe exclusive film television rights in the literary material\u201d; in other words it had \u201cthe right to exhibit photoplays of the series.\u201d SGP also held in trust for Goff and Roberts the separated right to generate motion pictures based on the series.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Despite the provision in the MBA conferring the motion picture rights in a teleplay on the writers of the teleplay, the producer retained a \u201climited interest in such rights.\u201d As relevant here, this \u201climited interest\u201d consisted of the right of first refusal should the writer decide to offer the movie rights for sale within five years from the date the writer delivered the teleplay to the producer. After the five-year period expired the producer could still purchase the movie rights but it had to do so on the open market and in competition with any other producer who wanted to purchase those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Consequently, if Columbia had produced Charlie\u2019s Angels movies based on motion picture rights its assignor SGP had acquired from Goff and Roberts under SGP\u2019s right of first refusal, Columbia could be said to have \u201cexploited\u201d an ancillary or subsidiary right, i.e., movie making, in connection with \u201cthe right to exhibit photoplays of the series\u201d and the Wagners would be entitled to a share of the movies\u2019 profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">However, as we discuss below, there is no evidence SGP ever acquired the motion picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>by exercising its right of first refusal or in any other way connected to its right to exhibit photoplays of the series.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>C. <em>SGP Did Not Acquire the Motion Picture Rights to </em>Charlie\u2019s Angeles <em>by Exercising a Right Connected to Its Right to Exhibit Photoplays of the Series.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Columbia produced sufficient evidence to make a prima facie showing SGP never acquired the motion picture rights from Goff and Roberts. This evidence included the contract under which Columbia purportedly purchased from the heirs of Goff and Roberts \u201cthe right to create and produce motion pictures . . . based upon the television series created by Ben Roberts and Ivan Goff entitled \u2018Charlie\u2019s Angels.\u2019 \u201d In addition, Columbia submitted the deposition testimony of Marvin Katz and the declaration of Gregory Boone. Katz, a former senior executive of SGP, testified it was his understanding SGP never acquired Goff\u2019s and Roberts\u2019s reserved rights in <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels. </em>Boone, an executive with Sony Pictures Television, testified that in the early 1990\u2019s he was asked to look into the issue of who owned the motion picture rights to the <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>television series. Boone conducted a search of the business records of SGP, which Columbia obtained after it purchased SGP\u2019s assets, and \u201cdid not locate any evidence in SGP\u2019s business records to suggest that SGP owned the theatrical motion picture rights for \u2018Charlie\u2019s Angels.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The reasonable inference from this evidence is that SGP did not acquire the motion picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>before it sold its assets to Columbia in 1982, more than six years after Goff and Roberts wrote the pilot episode. This inference, of course, may be rebutted \u201cby other inferences or evidence, which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The record contains no such inferences or evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The only evidence SGP might have acquired Goff\u2019s and Roberts\u2019s movie rights is a document entitled \u201cCopyright Assignment Nunc Pro Tunc\u201d executed by SGP on May 5, 1982, a few days after it sold its assets to Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The first paragraph of the \u201cCopyright Assignment\u201d states \u201c[SGP] has <em>sold, </em>assigned, transferred and set over . . . unto [Columbia] <em>the sole and exclusive motion picture rights </em>and certain other rights in and to those certain television motion pictures set forth on Schedules \u2018A\u2019 through \u2018H\u2019 attached hereto ... all as more particularly set forth and enumerated, and upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in that certain agreement between [SGP] and [Columbia] dated as of April 30, 1982 . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Schedule A is a list of <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>television episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The second and third paragraphs of the Copyright Assignment empower Columbia to take all steps necessary to assure <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>and the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>properties listed in the schedules do not fall into the public domain and to prosecute any action necessary to protect the copyrights in those properties from infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Wagner reasons SGP would not have represented it sold rights to Columbia it did not own. Therefore, he argues, the first paragraph of the Copyright Assignment, reciting SGP \u201csold\u201d the motion picture rights in <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>to Columbia, should be viewed as raising a triable issue as to whether SGP acquired the motion picture rights from Goff and Roberts by exercising its right of first refusal under the MBA. We are not persuaded by this argument for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Although the Copyright Assignment states SGP sold the motion picture rights in <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>to Columbia it also states the sale of the motion picture rights was subject to the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the April 1982 purchase agreement with Columbia. Under this agreement Columbia\u2019s purchase of SGP\u2019s assets was expressly subject \u201cto all SGP[\u2019s] .. . industry-wide collective bargaining agreements,\u201d which would include the 1970 MBA under which Goff and Roberts, not SGP, held the motion picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These two statements are not contradictory because under article 50 of the MBA the producer did not \u201csell\u201d the separated rights to the writer. Rather, it \u201cassigned\u201d those rights to the writer. The assigned rights continued to be \u201cowned\u201d by the producer but \u201cheld in trust\u201d for the writer. The purpose of SGP\u2019s Copyright Assignment, as shown by the second and third paragraphs, was to protect the properties from copyright infringement or becoming part of the public domain\u2014a duty imposed on SGP under article 50 of the MBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Even if we viewed the Copyright Assignment as evidence SGP held the motion picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>when it sold its assets to Columbia, the Copyright Assignment is not evidence SGP acquired those rights by exercising its right of first refusal under the MBA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> SGP\u2019s right of first refusal under the MBA expired five years from the date Goff and Roberts delivered the pilot teleplay to SGP. We do not know the date Goff and Roberts delivered the teleplay but we do know it had to have been sometime before the pilot aired on March 21, 1976.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We also know SGP sold its television assets to Columbia in April 1982. Therefore, SGP could have acquired the movie rights <em>after </em>its right of first refusal expired by purchasing them on the open market just as any other studio could have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We conclude, therefore, a reasonable trier of fact could not find, based on the language of the Copyright Assignment that SGP acquired the motion</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>picture rights to <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels </em>by exercising a right connected to its right to exhibit photoplays of the series.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
