We conclude such exculpatory clauses do not preclude, as a matter of law, the buyers\u2019 showing of justifiable reliance, and thus, for purposes of the summary judgment proceeding at issue in this appeal, they do not bar the buyers\u2019 claim for intentional misrepresentation against the brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">We further conclude that any lack of due diligence by the buyers in conducting an investigation of the zoning and other laws restricting the development and use of the property also does not preclude, as a matter of law, the buyers\u2019 showing of justifiable reliance as an element of their claim for intentional misrepresentation. Therefore, we reverse the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the brokers on the buyers\u2019 claim for intentional misrepresentation. Because the brokers did not seek summary adjudication of the buyers\u2019 remaining claims for negligent misrepresentation and suppression of facts, we need not decide whether those claims are barred by the exculpatory clauses and the buyers\u2019 alleged lack of investigatory due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">This action for deceit arose out of the purchase and sale of a parcel of land located in the City of El Cajon in San Diego County. The buyers were plaintiffs Anne and William Manderville (together the Mandervilles), and coplaintiffs Roseann and Rick Rinear (together the Rinears) (collectively Buyers). The Mandervilles are the parents of Roseann Rinear. The two couples intended to subdivide the property and build adjacent homes on the subdivided property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">A. <em>The Two MLS Listings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">During their search for a suitable property they could subdivide into two lots, Buyers, through their agent Marilyn Fowler, found a multiple listing service (MLS) advertisement (the second MLS listing) for a property located in El Cajon, California (the property). In describing the property, the second MLS listing stated in part: \u201cALL USEABLE 2.62 ACRES <em>COUNTY STATES </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number><em>1 ACRE MIN. LOT SIZE COULD BE SPLIT.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) This listing was placed by the sellers of the property, Robert and Georgia Uecker (together the Ueckers or Sellers),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> through their brokers, defendants Russ Clark, David Norberg and PCG&amp;S Group, Inc. (collectively Brokers).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Clark prepared the language, \u201cCOUNTY STATES 1 ACRE MIN[IMUM] LOT SIZE COULD BE SPLIT,\u201d that was placed in the second MLS listing. He testified during his deposition that in so doing he had relied on the County of San Diego (County). Clark indicated that during his telephone conversation with \u201cthe County,\u201d he asked about the zoning for the property, and \u201cthey\u201d told him the zoning was \u201cRR1,\u201d which meant \u201c[r]ural residential one acre per dwelling,\u201d and the property could be split. When asked to identify the person at the County with whom he spoke, Clark testified he had \u201c[n]o idea\u201d who it was, and he did not know why he did not write down the person\u2019s name. When asked whether that person was a male or female, Clark stated, \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Buyers and Fowler had seen a previous MLS listing of the same property (the first MLS listing) that did not contain the statement in the second MLS listing that \u201cCOUNTY STATES 1 ACRE MIN[IMUM] LOT SIZE COULD BE SPLIT.\u201d During his deposition, Clark stated that as of May 25, 2002\u2014 before he obtained the listing\u2014an MLS listing prepared by a prior listing agent showed that the property had been listed for 347 days. Clark also stated that this prior MLS listing did not say the property \u201ccould be split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">B. <em>Fowler\u2019s Confirming Telephone Call to Clark on Behalf of Buyers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">The parties acknowledge that \u201c[subdividing [real property] in rural San Diego County is a heavily regulated process, requiring the preparation and submission of a parcel map by a professional civil engineer, compliance with a \u2018labyrinth\u2019 of federal, state, and local regulations, and discretionary approval by a public body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">On June 22, 2002, as a result of the discrepancy in the two MLS listings, Fowler telephoned Clark on behalf of Buyers to confirm that the property could be split. During that call (the June 22 call), Fowler asked Clark whether the lot could be split. The Rinears were present during the call and observed Fowler write notes on the two MLS printouts (copies of the first and second MLS listings) regarding the question of whether the property could be split. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>In those notes, Fowler wrote on the copy of the first MLS listing, <em>\u201cThe [s]plit has been approved </em>to what extent need to go to County &amp; see\u2014how far.\u201d (Italics added.) On the copy of the second MLS listing that indicated the lot could be split, Fowler wrote, \u201cSplitable.\u201d At the end of her telephone conversation with Clark, Fowler made copies of her notes and gave them to the Rinears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">What Clark told Fowler during their telephone conversation is in dispute. Rick Rinear testified during his deposition that Fowler told him that Clark said to her the lot could be split, and this led him (Rick Rinear) to believe Buyers could build one house per acre. Rick Rinear stated he understood the second MLS listing meant \u201c[t]he County states the lot could be split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">During her deposition, Fowler testified that although she did not have a specific recollection of Clark telling her the lot split had been approved, she believed Clark told her during the telephone conversation that the split had been approved because she would not have written in her notes \u201cThe [s]plit has been approved\u201d unless Clark had made that statement. Fowler indicated Clark had lied to her: \u201cI feel like he . . . lied by omission, by not telling me that . . . there was only a split potential, that . . . not that it could be split. That he didn\u2019t. . . retract his statement that it could be split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">In a declaration supporting Brokers\u2019 summary judgment motion at issue in this appeal, Clark stated he did not tell Fowler during her inquiry that a split had been approved or that the property could be split, and he told her only that \u201cthe County\u201d had told him that it could be split. He testified, \u201cAt no time did I agree with [Fowler], or any other person, to represent that the property had been split, or approved for a split, or that it could be split, except to the extent I repeated in the [second] MLS listing what the County had told me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">When asked whether the issue of \u201csplitability\u201d of the property arose during his telephone conversation with Fowler, Clark testified, \u201cNo, not that I recall.\u201d He denied mentioning the words \u201csplit\u201d or \u201csplitability\u201d during the conversation, but acknowledged that Fowler asked him, \u201cCan you build two houses on this property[?],\u201d and he answered, \u201c[Y]es.\u201d Clark also testified he told Fowler that her clients could build two houses on the property without splitting it, but then changed that testimony and stated: \u201cThere was a <em>potential </em>she could do it. Didn\u2019t tell her she could do it. \u2018You need to go down to the County before you write an offer. And, here, I\u2019ll fax you over all the information,\u2019 and I faxed her over all the information, whether it was 52 pages or whatever pages, I had. I faxed them all to her. She came back some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>two or three days later with an offer and said, \u2018My clients are satisfied based on that information.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">C. <em>The California Association of Realtors (CAR) Form Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">CAR is an association of licensed realtors and realtor-associates that \u201cdevelops and publishes standard forms and publications for specific use and reference by the real estate industry.\u201d (2 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate (3d ed. 2000) \u00a7 4:62, pp. 201-202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">On June 24, 2002, two days after Fowler\u2019s June 22 call to Clark, Clark received from Fowler on behalf of Buyers an offer in the amount of $235,000 to purchase the property. Buyers made the offer in a standard CAR purchase agreement form titled \u201cVacant Land Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (and Receipt for Deposit)\u201d (hereafter the CAR form agreement or the agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">Paragraph 7 of the CAR form agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated that Buyers had the \u201cright\u201d to conduct inspections and investigations, and strongly advised Buyers to investigate the condition and suitability of all aspects of the property, as well as all matters affecting the value or desirability of the property, including ordinances affecting the future development and zoning of the property. Paragraph 7 also indicated that Buyers and Sellers were aware that Brokers did not guarantee and in no way assumed responsibility for the \u201ccondition\u201d of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Paragraph 15 provided that Buyers had 21 days after acceptance of their offer to \u201ccomplete all inspections, investigations and review of reports and other applicable information for which [Buyers are] responsible.\u201d Paragraph 26 contained the following integration clause: \u201cAll understandings between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>the parties are incorporated in this Agreement. Its terms are intended by the parties as a final, complete and exclusive expression of their Agreement with respect to its subject matter and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement.\u201d The CAR form agreement also incorporated the following handwritten term set forth in paragraph 1(C) of Sellers\u2019 counteroffer No. 1: \u201cBuyer[s] to satisfy themselves to use of property with warranties or representation to use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">D. <em>Buyers \u2019 Investigation: \u201cProperty Project Profile, \u201d \u201cZoning Information,\u201d and \u201cNotice of Negative Declaration\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">During discovery and the summary judgment proceeding at issue here, Buyers admitted that prior to the close of escrow they received from Clark, and reviewed, what Brokers referred to as a \u201cdisclosure package,\u201d which contained a copy of (1) a property project profile sheet, which indicated the existing zoning of the property was \u201cRR-1\u201d and the minimum lot size was one acre, but also indicated that the general plan designator number of the property was \u201c24\u201d; (2) a 1999 zoning information sheet prepared by the County\u2019s Department of Planning and Land Use listing the zone use regulations applicable to the property as \u201cRR1\u201d and the lot size as one acre, but indicating the general plan designation was \u201c24\u201d; and (3) a 1987 notice of negative declaration on the County\u2019s Department of Planning and Land Use letterhead specifying an \u201cRR1 Use Regulation\u201d for the property followed by the terms \u201cRural Residential\u201d and \u201cldu/1 acre,\u201d but also stating \u201cValle de Oro Subregional/Comm. Plan\u201d followed by the terms \u201c(24) Impact Sensitive\u201d and \u201c1 du/4, 8, 20 acres.\u201d Buyers also admitted that prior to the close of escrow, they conducted an investigation of laws and ordinances affecting the potential for splitting the property. In their summary judgment motion, Brokers asserted that Buyers\u2019 admissions established that they (Buyers) had \u201cinvestigate[d] the specific representations . . . concerning] the ability to get County approval of a lot split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">E. <em>Buyers\u2019 Discovery That the Property Could Not Be Split</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">After the close of escrow, Buyers hired William A. Snipes, a civil engineer, to submit to the County on their behalf an application for permission to split the property. Snipes reported to Buyers that he had learned from his research at the County that the property could not be split because of its designation as \u201c(24) Impact Sensitive\u201d under the County\u2019s general plan, which specified a minimum lot size of four acres. Snipes explained to Buyers in a letter that \u201c[t]he research at the County revealed some unfortunate information. The zoning allows a minimum lot size of 1.0 acres, but the general plan has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>slope dependent lot size criteria and the minimum lot size is 4.0 acres. To subdivide this property both elements have to be met. The property is too small to meet all the elements. This is the first time I have seen such a discrepancy between the zoning and the general plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">In their operative first amended complaint (the complaint), Buyers alleged three counts of deceit against Brokers: (1) intentional misrepresentation of facts, (2) negligent misrepresentation of facts, and (3) suppression of facts. All three counts were based on Buyers\u2019 allegations that (1) although the property in fact could not be split, Brokers stated in the second MLS listing \u201cALL USEABLE 2.62 ACRES COUNTY STATES 1 ACRE MIN. LOT SIZE COULD BE SPLIT,\u201d thereby falsely representing that the property could be split; (2) in reasonable diligence to confirm that the property could be split, Buyers met with their agent Fowler, showed her the second MLS listing, and caused her to verify that the property could be split; (3) Fowler responded to Buyers\u2019 inquiry by contacting Clark, who represented that the property could be split and that the split had already been approved; and (4) after her communication with Clark, Fowler represented to Buyers that the property could be split and was already approved for splitting. Buyers further alleged in all three fraud counts that they were ignorant of the falsity of Brokers\u2019 representations, they purchased the property in reliance on those false representations, and they would not have purchased the property had they known the actual facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">A. <em>Brokers\u2019 Summary Judgment Motion and Buyers\u2019 Opposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Brokers filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting two principal arguments: (1) There was no triable issue of material fact as to representations they made because the declarations of Clark and Norberg established that Brokers did not make a statement that the property could be split or that a lot split had been approved, and Fowler\u2019s deposition testimony showed that she was told, and then conveyed to Buyers, that the extent to which there had been an approval of a lot split was not clear and thus there was a need to go to County to investigate the possibility of getting a lot split; and (2) there was no fraud under any theory because Buyers contractually assumed the obligation to investigate and verify land use and future development of the property, they admitted they received and reviewed a disclosure package, they failed to diligently perform an investigation that would have revealed that splitting the property was inconsistent with the County\u2019s ordinance (general plan designator 24) requiring a minimum of four acres per dwelling unit, and thus they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>did not justifiably or reasonably rely on the statements Brokers allegedly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">In their written opposition, Buyers argued that Brokers undertook the obligation to list and sell the property after it had been \u201csitting\u201d on the market for a period \u201cin excess of [300] days\u201d under the first MLS listing. Buyers also argued there was no dispute that when Brokers undertook this obligation, Brokers had information showing the property was placed in a \u201cgeneral plan designator\u201d that required a minimum of four acres per dwelling, and thus Brokers knew at that time that splitability of the property was \u201cuncertain,\u201d yet they changed the MLS listing to make the property more marketable and desirable by including the statement that it \u201ccould be split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">Buyers also asserted Brokers had a duty to investigate whether the statement that the property could be split was true when they changed the MLS listing. In addition, Buyers asserted that Brokers induced their reliance by affirming the representation in the second MLS listing by telling Fowler the property was splitable and the lot split had been approved, and thus triable issues of material fact existed as to \u201cwhat Brokers knew, what they were told and by whom, what was said to the Buyers\u2019 agent [Fowler], and whether the Buyers justifiably relied on the representations of Brokers.\u201d Buyers further asserted that based on the second MLS listing and the conversation between Fowler and Clark, they relied on Clark\u2019s statements and believed they were buying a property that could be split, and that the split would be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">B. <em>Order Granting Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">The court issued a tentative ruling granting Brokers\u2019 summary judgment motion on the grounds Buyers contractually assumed a duty to investigate zoning and land use limits on the future development of the property, and as a matter of law Buyers could not show they justifiably relied on statements Brokers made in connection with their listing of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">Specifically, the court\u2019s tentative ruling stated in part: \u201c[A] <em>fact-finder in the circumstances of this case could conclude </em>[Brokers\u2019] <em>MLS Listing was a knowing or negligent misrepresentation when it stated \u2018ALL USEABLE 2.62 ACRES COUNTY STATES 1 ACRE MIN. LOT SIZE COULD BE SPLIT. </em>\u2019 A <em>fact-finder could conclude [Clark] knowingly or negligently misrepresented the split had been approved. A fact-finder could also conclude [Buyers] reasonably relied on these misrepresentations and were not put on notice by the realty profile provided to them or their agent prior to making the first </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number><em>offer to buy. </em>However, the final contract (Paragraph 7) among the parties and brokers provides that the buyer has been advised to investigate the property condition including limits placed on the future development and use of the property and that [Brokers] do not guarantee and in no way assume responsibility for the condition of the property and have not and will not verify zoning and land use. It also includes the handwritten language adopted in the final contract \u2018Buyerfs] to satisfy themselves to use of property with warranties or representation to use.\u2019 (Counter Offer No. 1.) This same contract also states \u2018All understandings between the parties are incorporated in this Agreement. Its terms are intended by the parties as a final, complete and exclusive expression of their Agreement with respect to its subject matter and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement.\u2019 (Paragraph 26.) [][] [Brokers] have met their initial burden of showing the absence of \u2018justifiable reliance\u2019, and therefore [Buyers] must make a prima facie showing that a triable issue of material fact exists. <em>The Court finds, </em>putting the evidence in the light most favorable to [Buyers], <em>that as a matter of law no \u2018justifiable reliance\u2019 can be shown.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Following oral arguments on the tentative ruling, the court granted the parties leave to submit supplemental briefing on the issues of (1) whether a contract provision stating that all representations are contained in the contract bars an action for fraud, and (2) whether a defrauded party\u2019s negligence in investigating the accuracy of defendants\u2019 representations is a defense to a claim for intentional fraud. The court thereafter confirmed its tentative ruling and entered summary judgment in favor of Brokers. Buyers appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">On an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we independently examine the record to determine whether triable issues of material fact exist. <em>(Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 767 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143].) In performing our de novo review, we view the evidence in a light favorable to the losing parties (here, Buyers), liberally construing their evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing the prevailing parties\u2019 (here, Brokers) own showing, and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in favor of the losing parties. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 768-769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">\u201c[T]he part[ies] moving for summary judgment bear[] the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that [they are] entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493], fn. omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>\u201cA defendant [moving for summary judgment] bears the burden of persuasion that \u2018one or more elements of\u2019 the \u2018cause of action\u2019 in question \u2018cannot be established,\u2019 or that \u2018there is a complete defense\u2019 thereto.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o).) In such a case, the moving defendants \u201cbear[] an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.\u201d <em>(Aguilar, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 850.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">If the moving defendants meet their burden of production, the burden shifts to the plaintiffs \u201cto make [their own] prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 850.) \u201cThere is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the parties] opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">In support of their appeal, Buyers argue the summary judgment granted in favor of Brokers should be reversed because: (1) the integration clause in paragraph 26 of the CAR form agreement at issue in this appeal does not bar Brokers\u2019 liability; (2) paragraph 7 of the agreement provided Buyers with the right, not the duty, to investigate whether they could split the property; (3) the court erred by holding that the \u201cas is\u201d provisions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the agreement prevented Buyers from justifiably relying on Brokers\u2019 misrepresentations that the property could be split and had already received the County\u2019s approval for the split; and (4) there is a triable issue of material fact whether Buyers acted reasonably. For reasons we shall discuss, we hold that neither the exculpatory clauses contained in the CAR form agreement, nor Buyers\u2019 alleged lack of due diligence in exercising their right to investigate the zoning and other laws restricting the development and use of the property, bars Buyers\u2019 cause of action against Brokers for intentional misrepresentation as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">A. <em>Applicable Legal Principles (Element of Reliance)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">In Buyers\u2019 complaint, the gravamen of which is the allegation that Brokers deceived and harmed them by falsely representing both in the second MLS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>listing and during Fowler\u2019s June 22 call to Clark that the property could be split, Buyers assert a claim for deceit based on intentional misrepresentation of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">To establish a claim for deceit based on intentional misrepresentation, the plaintiff must prove seven<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> essential elements: (1) the defendant represented to the plaintiff that an important fact was true; (2) that representation was false; (3) the defendant knew that the representation was false when the defendant made it, or the defendant made the representation recklessly and without regard for its truth; (4) the defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation; (5) the plaintiff <em>reasonably relied on the representation', </em>(6) the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff\u2019s reliance on the defendant\u2019s representation was a substantial factor in causing that harm to the plaintiff. (CACI No. 1900; see Sources and Authority foll. CACI No. 1900, <em>supra, </em>pp. 921-922, citing Civ. Code,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 1709, 1710, <em>Engalla, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 974.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">The element of intentional misrepresentation at issue in this appeal is reasonable or justifiable reliance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The California Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[rjeliance exists when the misrepresentation or nondisclosure was an immediate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct which altered his or her legal relations, and when without such misrepresentation or nondisclosure he or she would not, in all reasonable probability, have entered into the contract or other transaction.

Section 1668, which was enacted in 1872, provides: \u201cAll contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt <em>any one </em>from responsibility for his own <em>fraud, </em>or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>It is well established in California that a party to a contract is precluded under section 1668 from contracting away his or her liability for fraud or deceit based on intentional misrepresentation.

The seller appealed, relying on contractual provisions to the effect that the buyer had viewed and investigated the property and did not rely upon any representations of the seller or its agents except those mentioned in the contract of sale, and that the contract contained all the representations, promises and statements made by the seller or its agents that had induced the buyer to enter into the contract. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 203.) Citing section 1668, among other authorities, the California Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of rescission. <em>(Simmons, supra, </em>217 Cal. at pp. 204, 209.) The high court explained, \u201cIt is settled beyond doubt, manifestly on sound grounds of justice, that a seller cannot escape liability for his own fraud or false representations by the insertion of provisions such as are embodied in the contract of sale herein.

The seller appealed, claiming the buyers had disabled themselves from claiming fraud by agreeing to a provision in the contract that stated, \u201c \u2018Buyer has personally examined said property and is familiar with its location and condition and is not relying upon any representation relating thereto.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 653-654.) Citing section 1668 and <em>Simmons, supra, </em>217 Cal. 201, the <em>Smith </em>court rejected the seller\u2019s claim and affirmed the judgment of rescission, stating, \u201cSuch provisions have often been held insufficient to protect a fraudulent vendor from being held responsible for his fraud.\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.2d at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">More recently, the Court of Appeal in <em>Blankenheim v.

Therefore, ... a party who has <em>induced the other party to enter into the contract based on </em>... <em>an intentional. </em>. . <em>misrepresentation </em>cannot be relieved of liability by any . . . <em>exculpatory clause, </em>or other clause waiving liability, contained in the contract. Because the fraud renders the entire contract voidable, the clause intended to absolve the seller from liability is also voidable.\u201d (1 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal. Real Estate, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1:153, pp. 632-633, fns. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Here, the CAR form agreement expressly provides at page 9, following paragraph 35, that \u201cReal Estate Brokers are not parties to the Agreement between Buyer and Seller.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) All of the exculpatory clauses at issue in this appeal are contained in the agreement between Buyers and Sellers, and are not part of any agreement between Buyers and Brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">However, the fact that Brokers were not parties to the agreement between Buyers and Sellers does not preclude application of section 1668 in this case in which Buyers allege Brokers induced them to enter into the agreement by means of intentional misrepresentations. The plain language of section 1668 (discussed, <em>ante) </em>shows that its provisions apply to \u201c[a]ll contracts\u201d the object of which is to directly or indirectly exempt \u201canyone\u201d from responsibility for his or her \u201cown fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">Brokers implicitly claim the exculpatory clauses in the CAR form agreement exempted them from responsibility for their alleged acts of intentional misrepresentation as a matter of law. We reject this claim. Assuming without deciding that Brokers have standing to invoke or rely upon the provisions of those exculpatory clauses as a defense to Buyers\u2019 cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, those provisions must be deemed to be against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>the policy of the law within the meaning of section 1668, and are thus unenforceable. (See \u00a7 1668; <em>Simmons, supra, </em>217 Cal. at p. 204; <em>Smith, supra, 149 </em>Cal.App.2d at pp. 649-650, 654; and <em>Blankenheim, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1471-1472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">In <em>Ron Greenspan Volkswagen, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Land Development Corp. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 985 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 783], the Court of Appeal, without citing section 1668, held that a contract clause stating the parties relied only on representations contained in the contract does not bar, as a matter of law, a claim for intentional misrepresentation. <em>(Ron Greenspan Volkswagen, Inc., supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 987, 989, 992-993, citing <em>Simmons, supra, </em>217 Cal. 201 and other case authorities.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Applying the foregoing authorities, we conclude the exculpatory clauses in the CAR form agreement cannot and do not support the trial court\u2019s erroneous decision that, as a matter of law, Buyers cannot make a prima facie showing that they justifiably relied on Brokers\u2019 alleged intentional misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">2. <em>Buyers\u2019 Alleged Failure to Diligently Investigate Brokers\u2019 Representations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">In a related claim, Brokers also assert on appeal, as they did in their memorandum of points and authorities in support of their summary judgment motion, that the element of justifiable reliance is negated as a matter of law because Buyers contractually undertook to, and did, investigate Brokers\u2019 representations concerning Buyers\u2019 ability to obtain County approval of a lot split, but failed to diligently perform that investigation, and thus Buyers must be \u201ccharged with all the knowledge [they] might have obtained had [they] pursued the inquiry to the end with diligence and completeness.\u201d Brokers assert the central core of the court\u2019s ruling granting summary judgment in their favor is that Buyers had no legal \u201cright to rely\u201d on Brokers\u2019 alleged misrepresentation because the CAR form agreement assigned to Buyers the duty to investigate the condition of the property. In essence, Brokers assert that Buyers could not justifiably rely on Brokers\u2019 alleged misrepresentations as a matter of law because Buyers would have discovered through a more diligent investigation that splitting the property was inconsistent with general plan designator 24, a County ordinance requiring a minimum of four acres per dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Brokers\u2019 claim is unavailing. It is well established in California that in an action for fraud or deceit, negligence on the part of the plaintiff in failing to discover the falsity of the defendant\u2019s statement is no defense when the misrepresentation was intentional. <em>(Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number><em>supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 1239-1240; <em>Seeger v. Odell </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 409, 414 [115 P.2d 977]; see also 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 812, p. 1173.) In <em>Seeger, </em>a unanimous decision of the California Supreme Court, Justice Traynor quoted an out-of-state case for the proposition that \u201c \u2018[n]o rogue should enjoy his ill-gotten plunder for the simple reason that his victim is by chance a fool.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Seeger, supra, </em>18 Cal.2d at p. 415.) The <em>Seeger </em>court also stated, \u201cThe fact that an investigation would have revealed the falsity of the misrepresentation will not alone bar [the plaintiff\u2019s] recovery [citations], and it is well established that he is not held to constructive notice of a public record which would reveal the true facts. [Citations].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 414-415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Also, Brokers\u2019 claim is based on the false premise that Buyers contractually undertook to investigate Brokers\u2019 representations concerning Buyers\u2019 ability to obtain County approval of a lot split. It is a well-settled principle of contract interpretation that the language of a contract governs its interpretation if the language is clear and not absurd. (\u00a7 1638 [\u201c[t]he language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, if the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve an absurdity\u201d]; 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Contracts, \u00a7 741, p. 827 [\u201c[w]here the language of a contract is clear and not absurd, it will be followed\u201d] and case authorities cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Here, the plain, unambiguous language of paragraph 7 of the CAR form agreement shows as a matter of law that the agreement did <em>not </em>impose on Buyers a contractual duty to investigate whether the property could be split. Paragraph 7 clearly states in part that (1) Buyers had the <em>\u201cright\u201d </em>to conduct investigations; and (2) Buyers were \u201cstrongly <em>advised\u201d </em>to investigate the \u201ccondition and suitability\u201d of \u201call aspects\u201d of the property and \u201call matters affecting the value or desirability of the property,\u201d including ordinances affecting the future development and zoning of the property, and they would be \u201cacting against the advice\u201d of Brokers if they \u201c[did] not exercise <em>these rights\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Thus, paragraph 7 conferred upon Buyers the contractual <em>right, </em>not the contractual obligation, to conduct such an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">Brokers rely on <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Vannini </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 120 [295 P.2d 102] (Vannini) for the proposition that \u201cwhen the duty to investigate is <em>contractually </em>assigned to the purchaser of real property, the purchaser is precluded from later suing the seller for fraud because the purchaser has, as a matter of law, no legal \u2018right to rely\u2019 on any alleged material misrepresentations by the seller that predate the contract.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">Brokers\u2019 reliance on <em>Vannini </em>is misplaced. That case involved the purchase and sale of an abandoned gold mine in which the purchasers entered into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>option agreement to buy the mine, but expressly and specifically agreed to investigate the property before exercising the option by clearing water and debris out of the mine and, at their election, digging an exploratory tunnel within a specified period of time from the date of the agreement. <em>(Vannini, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at pp. 122-123, 128, 130-131.) The purchasers did not clear the mine and complete the investigation within the period specified in the agreement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 132.) Years later, after exercising the option to buy the mine, the purchasers discovered the falsity of the sellers\u2019 representation that ore in commercial quantities existed in the mine. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">The sellers in <em>Vannini </em>brought an action against the purchasers to recover money they allegedly owed the sellers under the option agreement, and the purchasers filed an amended answer and cross-complaint, both of which were predicated on the theory that the sellers had fraudulently induced them to enter into the agreement. <em>(Vannini, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d. at pp. 124, 132.) The trial court sustained the sellers\u2019 demurrers to the purchasers\u2019 amended answer and cross-complaint without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of the sellers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The <em>Vannini </em>court addressed the issue of whether the trial court properly sustained without leave to amend the sellers\u2019 demurrer to the purchasers\u2019 amended answer, which (like the purchasers\u2019 cross-complaint) was based on an allegation that the sellers had induced them to enter into the option agreement by means of an intentional misrepresentation. <em>(Vannini, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at pp. 125-126, 130.) Noting that under the pleaded facts the purchasers had obligated themselves under the option agreement to clear the mine and investigate the property within 17 months of the date of the option agreement <em>(id. </em>at pp. 130, 132), the Court of Appeal stated that \u201cthe real question [was] <em>not </em>whether [the purchasers] <em>relied </em>on the false representations, but whether they had the <em>legal right to rely </em>upon them.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 131, italics added.) The court concluded that the purchasers\u2019 express agreement to conduct their own investigation \u201camounted to an agreement [they] were not to rely on the representations made by [the sellers], but were to rely on their own investigation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Vannini </em>court held, \u201cas a matter of law, that [the purchasers] had <em>no legal right to rely on the false representations </em>at the time that they exercised the option,\u201d and thus the trial court had properly sustained the demurrer to the purchasers\u2019 amended answer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 132, italics added.) The court reasoned that if the purchasers had performed their contractual duty to clear the mine and investigate the property, \u201cthey would have gained full knowledge of the falsity of the representations made to induce the contract.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\"><em>Vannini </em>is factually and legally distinguishable. There, as already discussed, the purchasers expressly agreed to clear the gold mine and investigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>the property within a specified period of time before they exercised the option agreement. Here, however, Buyers entered into a purchase agreement, not an option agreement, under which they acquired the contractual <em>right, </em>not the contractual obligation, to investigate the condition of the property, including whether they could obtain County approval to split the property into two parcels. <em>Vannini </em>is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">3. <em>Buyers\u2019 Prima Facie Showing of Justifiable Reliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Brokers do not challenge the court\u2019s express findings that (1) \u201c[a] fact-finder could conclude [Brokers] <em>knowingly . . . misrepresented </em>the split had been approved,\u201d and (2) \u201c[a] fact-finder could also conclude [Buyers] <em>reasonably relied </em>on these misrepresentations and were not put on notice by the realty profile provided to them or their agent prior to making the first offer to buy.\u201d (Italics added.) Rather, their principal contentions are (1) the court \u201cdid not commit error by ruling on the issue of \u2018justifiable reliance\u2019 as a matter of law\u201d because the CAR form agreement \u201cassigned the duty to investigate the condition of the property to Buyers\u201d; and (2) Buyers \u201cadmitted that they conducted an investigation of the laws and ordinances affecting the potential for splitting the . . . property prior to close of escrow,\u201d and thus they must be \u201ccharged with all the knowledge that [they] might have obtained had [they] pursued the inquiry to the end with diligence and completeness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Viewing the evidence in a light favorable to the losing parties (here, Buyers), liberally construing their evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing the prevailing parties\u2019 (here, Brokers) own showing, and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in favor of the losing parties, as we must <em>(Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 768-769), we conclude the record demonstrates that Buyers met their burden of making a prima facie showing that there are triable issues of material fact (1) whether Brokers intentionally misrepresented that, according to County, the property could be split and the split had been approved; and (2) whether Buyers justifiably relied on Brokers\u2019 alleged intentional misrepresentations. As discussed more fully in the factual background, <em>ante, </em>the parties dispute what Clark told Fowler during their June 22 telephone conversation, as shown by the deposition testimony of Rick Rinear, Fowler and Clark, and Clark\u2019s declaration in support of Brokers\u2019 summary judgment motion. The issues of whether Brokers intentionally misrepresented that the County had stated the property could be split and the split had been approved, and whether Buyers\u2019 reliance on Brokers\u2019 statements was reasonable under all of the circumstances, are questions of material fact that must be decided by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.
