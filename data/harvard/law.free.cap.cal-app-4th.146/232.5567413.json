Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 211.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court found that defendant had suffered a prior conviction for forgery (\u00a7 470, subd. (a)), and a prior conviction for second degree robbery (\u00a7 211). The trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to strike his prior serious felony conviction for second degree robbery and sentenced him to 10 years in state prison. Defendant contends that the trial court committed <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>error <em>(Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712] <em>(Batson); People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] <em>(Wheeler)), </em>and that the failure to retain the juror questionnaires of the entire venire has denied him his constitutional right to an adequate record on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">A. <em>Trial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Because of the nature of the issues raised on appeal, it is not necessary to detail the evidence upon which defendant was convicted. In short, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>approached a 55-year-old woman as she tried to enter her office located in Oakland, and began tugging and yanking on the victim\u2019s purse, which she wore on her shoulder. The victim was scared, but did not see a weapon. As the victim began to scream, defendant kicked her in the leg, and then punched her in the face, all the while trying to get her purse. The victim kept screaming to get attention, and held on to her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The victim\u2019s coworkers, both inside the office building and in the parking lot, heard her screams and came to her aid. As the victim\u2019s coworkers were chasing defendant, a faded blue Pontiac Firebird pulled up to the intersection of 21st Avenue and Telegraph Avenue. Defendant then opened the passenger door and got in.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The incident was reported to the Oakland Police Department. The officer who arrived at the scene observed that the victim was visibly shaken and had redness and swelling on the right side of her face. Approximately 15 minutes after the dispatch call, another officer stopped a car matching the description of the getaway car. Codefendant Branche was alone in the car at the time of the stop. Defendant was later apprehended riding a bicycle in Oakland.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The victim viewed a photo lineup, and identified defendant as the person who tried to take her purse. Although the victim was later concerned about the accuracy of her identification, defendant admitted that he tried to take a woman\u2019s purse earlier that day, and that the woman would not let go of it. Defendant blamed his actions on drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">B. <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The venire was comprised of 95 prospective jurors. The prospective jurors were given questionnaires prior to the commencement of voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s fourth, eighth, and 10th peremptory challenges because they were used against African-American women. The only identifying information about the women in the record is their respective juror numbers. Accordingly, we refer to the women as Jurors Nos. 7, 70, and 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">1. <em>Juror No. 70</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Each questionnaire asked, \u201cHave any members of your family or household, friends or co-workers ever been arrested, accused or charged with a crime?\u201d During initial questioning by the court, Juror No. 70 stated that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>uncle had been in prison in Texas in 1963. She was uncertain of the exact offense, but thought it was \u201cprobably theft.\u201d Juror No. 70 further stated that her uncle had also been in jail in California, possibly for drugs, but she was \u201cnot really sure.\u201d Juror No. 70 also stated that in 1974, her sister\u2019s former boyfriend, an Oakland police officer, was investigated by internal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Juror No. 70 had served on a jury in May of the previous year, and appealed to the court about having to serve again in the instant case. Since the trial in this case began in July, the trial court told Juror No. 70 that it had been over 12 months since her last service, and that she was technically eligible for jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">After questioning other jurors, the trial court came back to Juror No. 70, stating that it had forgotten to ask her about her answer in the questionnaire to a question that asked, \u201cWhat is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of: [(|Q Police Officers,\u201d to which Juror No. 70 replied \u201cracial profiling.\u201d Juror No. 70 expressed surprise that the trial court had not asked her about this response earlier. She explained that minorities, especially men, are racially profiled for traffic stops, even in the absence of any criminal activity. Juror No. 70 believed that racial profiling happens in the United States in general, and that it commonly happens in connection with Hispanic and African-American males. At one point Juror No. 70 stated that she believed racial profiling was wrong, but later stated that she thought it was okay to stop a person \u201cif they fit a certain profile,\u201d and if the police \u201cfind something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">2. <em>Juror No. 81</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Juror No. 81 had been physically and mentally abused by her former husband from approximately 1986 to 1996. In initial questioning by the trial court, Juror No. 81 stated that she had called Oakland police about five times during this 10-year period. Juror No. 81 believed that the Oakland police officers had not been very responsive to her situation, stating that the police officers would either have her former husband leave the home or have her leave instead. She further stated that Oakland police officers never indicated that they would arrest her former husband and request prosecution from the district attorney\u2019s office. Eventually, Juror No. 81\u2019s former husband was arrested after breaking into her home. She knew that he had been convicted of an offense, but was uncertain of the details.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Juror No. 81 was not sure if her past experiences with the Oakland police would affect her ability to evaluate the testimony of Oakland police officers who might testify. When further questioned by the court, Juror No. 81 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>indicated that her past experiences \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t\u201d affect her ability to be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">When questioned by the prosecutor about her interactions with the Oakland Police Department, Juror No. 81 stated that some were positive and some were negative. She explained that she felt that the police had not given her the support she needed and had not been sympathetic. However, Juror No. 81 stated she would not view a police officer\u2019s testimony with more suspicion than another witness\u2019s testimony. She further denied that she would vote not guilty, if it came to light that the police officers made mistakes in their investigation, just to send a message.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">3. <em>Juror No. </em>7</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">When questioned by the trial court, Juror No. 7 stated that she could be fair and impartial. Juror No. 7 stated that her brother had been convicted of possession of drugs in Oakland in the early 1980\u2019s. She did not attend any of his court appearances. When asked whether she felt her brother had been treated fairly by the justice system, she replied: \u201cI, actually, can\u2019t say that I feel a lot about it, because he knew that he was wrong, so ... he suffered the consequences.\u201d Juror No. 7 believed that her brother\u2019s sentence was appropriate. Juror No. 7\u2019s sister had been involved in two cases involving prostitution and possession of drugs. Juror No. 7 did not attend any of those court proceedings, and did not have any opinion regarding her sister\u2019s treatment in her various cases. Juror No. 7 stated that her sister \u201cdid what she did, and she paid for it.\u201d Juror No. 7 further stated that she did not think her sister was treated unfairly, but qualified the response by stating that she was not present during the criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Juror No. 7\u2019s son was charged and convicted of assault in Oakland in the late 1980\u2019s. Her son\u2019s case did not proceed to a jury trial and took a while to resolve. Juror No. 7 attended her son\u2019s final court appearance. She thought her son \u201cserved about a year.\u201d When asked whether she thought her son had been treated fairly, she replied, \u201cWell, from what he explained to me, it was fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Juror No. 7 also had a close friend in the 1960\u2019s who was convicted of rape. She was not sure where the crime was committed, but thought her friend told her it occurred in Kansas. She did not attend any of the court proceedings and had no opinion about whether he was treated fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In her juror questionnaire, Juror No. 7 wrote, \u201cTrouble,\u201d as the first thing that came to mind when she thought of police officers. She explained that she lived in an African-American and Hispanic neighborhood, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201cit\u2019s always something going on. So when you see the police coming, you know he\u2019s not going to tell you that you\u2019re a millionaire. So there\u2019s trouble.\u201d Juror No. 7 believed that some police officers create trouble and some do not. She also had witnessed the police acting inappropriately in her neighborhood. She gave the example of a police chase in which the suspect fell and the police officer attempted to hit the suspect, but was stopped by another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In her juror questionnaire, Juror No. 7 wrote, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d as the first thing that came to mind when she thought of prosecutors. When asked by the court to explain this response, she stated, \u201cWell, you\u2019re sitting in the court, you know, listening to things, and you hear a lot of different type things, so I said what\u2019s next.\u201d When the court further inquired about some of the negative things Juror No. 7 thought about regarding prosecutors, she replied, \u201cSimilar questions they ask.\u201d Juror No. 7 explained that she was referring to the questions asked in a civil case in Oakland, in which she was a prospective juror. Juror No. 7 thought the questions posed to jurors were strange. She denied that her \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d comment related to family and friends who had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Juror No. 7 also wrote in her questionnaire that the first thing that came to mind when she thought of defense attorneys was, \u201cMake the right decision.\u201d When asked to explain this response, she stated, \u201cWell, you know it\u2019s really complicated, that one, the way I stated that in any . . trial that you come in contact with, you would hope that they based on the evidence. You hope that, you know, the right decision arise[s] from all that.\u201d She further explained that she was referring to the jury making the right decision, while listening to the defense attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Each questionnaire asked, \u201cWhat are your feelings about the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system?\u201d Juror No. 7 wrote that she thought that it needed a little updating. When asked to explain this response, Juror No. 7 stated she was referring to the police department. She further stated, \u201cyou have some good; some bad. I\u2019ve seen some of both. That\u2019s all.\u201d She believed that improvement in police department personnel was required in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">When questioned by the prosecutor, Juror No. 7 stated that her brother had been arrested in Oakland by the Oakland Police Department at least five times. Juror No. 7 stated that she did not hear any negative reports from her family about her brother\u2019s arrests. She did not believe that her brother had been harassed by Oakland police, stating, \u201che just got caught. That\u2019s all.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Juror No. 7 also stated that her sister had been arrested by Oakland police two or three times. When asked about how she felt about her sister\u2019s arrests, Juror No. 7 stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it, but it wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it .... HD ... I didn\u2019t like it that she got herself into that kind of predicament.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Juror No. 7 stated that her son\u2019s arrest caused her a lot of pain. Juror No. 7 was also pained by seeing her son go through the system. She denied that she was angry at the district attorney\u2019s office or the police. She said, \u201cI talked to [my son] and he told me the truth. So, . . . he [had] to suffer the consequences of it, and he knew that, and he told me that.\u201d Juror No. 7 stated that she did not have any lingering feelings of resentment or bitterness towards the prosecutor in the instant case. When asked how she would view the testimony of a police officer who happened to be the only witness, Juror No. 7 stated that she would analyze what he said \u201ca little bit closer.\u201d Juror No. 7 explained that she would take a closer look at the testimony, not because it came from a police officer, but because it came from the only witness. Juror No. 7 did not think that she would view a police officer\u2019s testimony with more scrutiny, if the testimony conflicted with a civilian witness\u2019s testimony. Later, when questioned by defense counsel, Juror No. 7 stated that if multiple witnesses were involved, she could treat each one with the same level of scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">C. Batson-Wheeler <em>Motion and Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Defense counsel made a <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>motion on the grounds that the prosecutor had used three of her 10 peremptory challenges exercised at that point to excuse African-American women. Defense counsel noted that there had been a total of eight African-American jurors in the venire, six of whom had been excused, three for cause, and three peremptorily challenged by the prosecutor. Defense counsel stated that the two remaining jurors were Juror Nos. 56 and 76 (who was seated in the jury box). The trial court observed that the prosecutor had excused \u201cthree of the four of African-Americans who were in the jury box,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> constituting 75 percent, which \u201ccould raise an inference of discriminatory purpose. [][] Okay. Then I\u2019ll find that it\u2019s very borderline, but I\u2019ll find that a possible inference of discriminatory purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1. <em>Explanations by the Prosecutor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In giving reasons for excusing Juror No. 70, the prosecutor noted that in her questionnaire, Juror No. 70 wrote, \u201cI prefer not to serve since I just served last year in May.\u201d The prosecutor further noted that when Juror No. 70 was questioned by the court, she specifically appealed to get out of jury service. The prosecutor asserted that Juror No. 70\u2019s comments indicated that she did not want to be a juror in this case. The prosecutor was also concerned that Juror No. 70 said \u201cracial profiling\u201d was the first thing that came to mind when thinking about police officers, and that Juror No. 70 had this response to all police officers in general. The prosecutor further noted that when the court questioned Juror No. 70 about her racial profiling response, Juror No. 70 said she had been wondering why the issue was not discussed earlier. The prosecutor argued that this response \u201cimplies that she is either, one, trying to be\u2014say as much as she can ... to get off the jury, or, two, she was being untruthful. Either way, I don\u2019t believe she would be a good juror for this case.\u201d Finally, the prosecutor asserted that Juror No. 70 was chewing gum throughout the proceedings and while answering questions, which she believed showed a lack of respect to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">With respect to Juror No. 81, the prosecutor cited her domestic violence problems and that she was \u201cvery critical\u201d of how the Oakland Police Department had handled the investigation. The prosecutor further asserted that \u201cgiven her reluctance to even talk about her case any more frankly or openly with the Court, it appears to me that she still harbored some feelings about what had happened to her. And given that police investigation will be an issue in this trial, I don\u2019t believe she can set that aside, and that she will judge the Oakland Police Department much more harshly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The prosecutor also noted that Juror No. 81 had failed to answer some of the questions on the questionnaire, including question 19. Finally, the prosecutor cited the fact that Juror No. 81 did not talk much about her spouse, and indicated that since she was a victim of domestic violence, she \u201c[might] have some feelings, lingering feelings, about any women who was [sic], perhaps, attacked or assaulted.\u201d The prosecutor asserted that the victim in this case was a woman, and while it is possible that Juror No. 81 would be sympathetic, there was a concern that Juror No. 81 might feel that the Oakland Police Department did not do a sufficient job of investigating the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Regarding Juror No. 7, the prosecutor cited the multiple arrests in her family by the Oakland Police Department. While Juror No. 7 said that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>could try to set this aside, the prosecutor did not think that Juror No. 7 could \u201cview or judge the Oakland Police Department in a fair light.\u201d In addition, the prosecutor \u201cnoticed that there was a discrepancy, the way she answered questions ... on the arrests involving her brother and sister and involving her son. She was a little more defensive with me when I asked a question about her son. Her son, who was assaulted[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and, also, arrested by an Oakland police officer, she felt a lot of pain about that. She still has feelings about that, and her son still lives with her. [f] Based on her questionnaire, her son is 44 years old, and I think she\u2019s going to sympathize with the defendant in this case, because the defendants are the approximate age as her son.\u201d The prosecutor cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Moss </em>(1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 268, 280 [233 Cal.Rptr. 153], in which the prosecutor felt the juror would identify with the defendant in that case, given the fact that the juror\u2019s sons were about the same age.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In addition, the prosecutor was concerned about Juror No. 7\u2019s feelings regarding the police, noting that the first thing that came to her mind about police was \u201ctrouble.\u201d The prosecutor believed that \u201cin light of the fact that her family members all have had dealings with the Oakland Police Department, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not unreasonable why she would view the Oakland Police Department that way. But nonetheless, she will be judging the Oakland Police Department in a different manner in this case. She mentioned that it means there\u2019s trouble in her community whenever she sees the police[] . . . perhaps chasing somebody else or has to do with someone in her family or in her community.\u201d The prosecutor believed that Juror No. 7\u2019s thoughts about the police went \u201chand in hand with how she felt . . . about defense [attorneys].\u201d The prosecutor felt that Juror No. 7\u2019s \u201cmake the right decision\u201d response regarding defense attorneys indicated that she was \u201cclearly defense-oriented,\u201d and that she could not be fair in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The prosecutor denied questioning only African-Americans about police misconduct. She asserted that she specifically questioned Juror No. 34, a Hispanic man, about police misconduct involving his brother-in-law. As Juror No. 34 stated that the misconduct had occurred in Modesto and did not involve the Oakland Police Department, the prosecutor did not feel it was something to be concerned about.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">2. <em>Argument by Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Defense counsel acknowledged that Juror No. 70 indicated \u201cracial profiling by the police officer\u201d on her questionnaire, but claimed that Juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>No. 70 also indicated that there were some good and some bad officers. Defense counsel asserted that several other unchallenged jurors, specifically Juror Nos. 39 and 76, also stated that there are good and bad officers. Counsel further asserted that Juror No. 79 indicated that she might have a problem with some police officers, as did Juror No. 22. The court noted that Juror No. 79 did not have any personal experiences with the police. Rather, Juror No. 79 indicated that her friend had reported that the police were not sympathetic with her. The court further pointed out that Juror No. 22 did not indicate having any bad experiences with police officers. Defense counsel stated that Juror No. 23<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicated that it was possible for police to fabricate evidence. The court noted nothing in the questionnaire related to fabrication of evidence by the police. Rather, Juror No. 23 accepted the premise asserted by defense counsel that it was possible for police to fabricate evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel believed that Juror No. 70 credibly explained her views on racial profiling. Counsel denied seeing Juror No. 70 chewing gum, and did not believe that gum chewing showed a sign of disrespect. Finally, defense counsel claimed that many of the jurors had previously served on a jury and preferred not to serve. Counsel asserted that Juror No. 63<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> had given the court many reasons why she did not want to serve, but the prosecutor had not excused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Regarding Juror No. 81, defense counsel argued that she said she could set aside her feelings about the Oakland Police Department and judge them independently. Defense counsel asserted that Juror No. 81, like the other challenged jurors, said she could be fair. Counsel further claimed that Juror No. 81\u2019s domestic violence claim had been \u201chandled,\u201d and that she was willing to answer further questions in private if required to do so. Counsel did not understand the prosecutor\u2019s concern with respect to there being a female victim in this case. Finally, counsel asserted, without providing specific details, that many people skipped questions on the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As to Juror No. 7, defense counsel clarified that her son was not assaulted by the police, but instead had an assault case. Counsel stated that it was understandable that Juror No. 7 viewed her son\u2019s case differently. He argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that Juror No. 7 \u201cadequately and thoroughly explained her explanation with regards to police officers and defense attorneys.\u201d Defense counsel asserted that Juror No. 7\u2019s description of \u201ctrouble\u201d was accurate, stating that when someone sees a police officer, he or she assumes he is responding to a crime, and that there is trouble in his or her neighborhood. With respect to Juror No. 7\u2019s comment about defense attorneys, counsel claimed that \u201cmaking the right decision\u201d meant only that she hoped when a criminal defendant went to trial, the jury would make the right decision and that it would hold \u201cthe prosecution to the burden of proof.\u201d Defense counsel maintained that Juror No. 7 was articulate and neutral in her responses, and that she was honest.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Finally, defense counsel argued that all three challenged African-American jurors said they could be fair. Counsel also claimed that two prospective jurors had been sleeping, but that did not seem to bother the prosecutor. Additionally, the prosecutor had not challenged other prospective jurors who had family members that had been arrested. The prosecutor countered this argument by noting that she had excused Juror No. 26, a White female, who had negative feelings about the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Defense counsel also argued that young African-American men are typically kept off juries.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">3. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The trial court accepted the race-neutral explanations provided by the prosecutor as to all three jurors, but expressed some concerns about the explanations of Juror No. 7: \u201c[Accept][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] the explanations excusing 81 and 70, it\u2019s a little more troubling with regards to excusing Juror 7, and I see [the prosecutor\u2019s] explanations as with regards to numerous contacts or family has had the initial response about police officers, trouble, defense attorneys making the right decision. [][] Despite the fact that I have some problems with her race-neutral explanation for Juror 7, I [accept] her explanations on the other-two, and it\u2019s not that I completely disagree with the explanations. I\u2019m just not comfortable with the explanation as to Juror 7. I certainly don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a history of excluding African-Americans in Alameda County . ... [][] As far as the sleeping jurors, I asked my staff. My Bailiff didn\u2019t notice. My Court Reporter didn\u2019t notice. My Clerk didn\u2019t notice. ... I am sorry I didn\u2019t notice if it happened. ...[][] I do accept, as I indicated, the explanations, and that I don\u2019t believe that the defense has proven a purposeful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges by the prosecution. ...

Batson-Wheeler</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Race-based use of a peremptory challenge violates the federal constitutional guaranty of equal protection of the law, as held in <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. 79, and the state constitutional right to a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community, as held in <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 258 <em>(People v. Huggins </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 175, 226 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 593, 131 P.3d 995]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cornwell </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 50, 66 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 117 P.3d 622]). <em>\u201cBatson </em>states the procedure and standard to be employed by trial courts when [a challenge is] made. \u2018First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case by \u201cshowing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.\u201d [Citations.] Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the \u201cburden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion\u201d by offering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes. [Citations.] Third, \u201c[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

We are therefore concerned with the third step of the analysis <em>(People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 345, 384 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 21 P.3d 769]; accord, <em>Purkett v.

This fact came to light after we granted defendant\u2019s motion to augment the record with the juror questionnaires. Defendant contends that the failure to retain the questionnaires of all of the prospective jurors has denied him his due process right to an adequate appellate record and thus prevents effective review of his <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u201cA criminal defendant is indeed entitled to a record on appeal that is adequate to permit meaningful review. That is true under California law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1165 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315].) It is true as well under the United States Constitution . . . <em>(People v. Howard, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1166.) The record on appeal is inadequate, however, only if the complained-of deficiency is prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s ability to prosecute his appeal. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 1165-1166.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 196, fn. 8 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In <em>People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 243, 270 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 532, 6 P.3d 193], and <em>People v. Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at page 196, footnote 8, the California Supreme Court held that lost juror questionnaires did not impede meaningful appellate review of a <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>claim. (See also <em>People v. Haley </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 283, 305 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 877, 96 P.3d 170] [applying <em>People v. Ayala </em>and <em>People v. Alvarez </em>in the context of challenge for cause].) In <em>People v. Alvarez, </em>the court held that it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that a deficient record prejudiced his ability to prosecute his appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 196, fn. 8.) There, the court determined that the defendant had not met his burden of showing that the absence of the juror questionnaires prejudiced his ability to assert his <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>claim. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIndeed, material from the now lost items survives in the reporter\u2019s and clerk\u2019s transcripts through quotation and paraphrase.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>People v. Ayala, </em>the court explained that despite the absence of the juror questionnaires the record was sufficiently complete to decide defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>claims. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ayala, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Defendant maintains that the \u201cweight of the holdings\u201d in <em>People v. Ayala, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 243, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th 155, is \u201cquestionable\u201d in light of <em>Miller-El </em>v. <em>Dretke </em>(2005) 545 U.S. 231 [162 L.Ed.2d 196, 125 S.Ct. 2317] <em>(Miller-El), </em>and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>545 U.S. 162. He maintains that a \u201cmuch more detailed <em>de </em>novo-type review is required in California by the federal constitution.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In <em>Johnson v. California, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the \u201cnarrow but important\u201d issue of the scope of the first <em>Batson </em>step. <em>(Johnson v. California, supra, </em>545 U.S. 162, 168.) The question before the court was \u201cwhether <em>Batson </em>permits California to require at step one that \u2018the objector must show that it is more likely than not the other party\u2019s peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>People v. Johnson, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1318.) The court held \u201cthat California\u2019s \u2018more likely than not\u2019 standard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a prima case.\u201d <em>(Johnson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>California, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 168.) In so holding, the court reasoned that it \u201cdid not intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge\u2014on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty\u2014that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the requirements of <em>Batson's </em>first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.\u201d <em>(Johnson v. California, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 170.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In <em>Miller-El, </em>the trial court found the defendant had made a prima facie case of discrimination, thus requiring the prosecutor to state the reasons for his challenges to specific jurors. <em>(Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 236.) After hearing from the prosecutor, the trial court proclaimed his stated reasons were \u201c \u2018completely credible [and] sufficient\u2019 \u201d and denied the motion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court reversed, and held that in the context of a challenge of an African-American juror, the defendant had established purposeful discrimination under <em>Batson </em>and was entitled to relief on that ground in federal habeas corpus proceedings. <em>(Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 237.) In so holding, the high court observed: \u201cIf a prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at <em>Batson\u2019s </em>third step.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In <em>Miller-El, </em>the high court performed a comparative juror analysis. <em>(Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at pp. 239-252; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 278, 285 (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.).) As part of this analysis, the court reviewed the transcripts from voir dire and compared the juror questionnaires of the challenged and seated jurors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 241-245.) The court \u201cthought it fitting to consider, albeit as a less significant factor than the side-by-side [juror] comparisons it undertook, the statistic that \u2018the State ha[s] peremptorily challenged 12% of qualified nonblack penal members, but eliminated 91% of the black ones.\u2019 <em>([Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. 240, 266].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 233.) In another component of its analysis, the high court examined whether the prosecutor employed disparate questioning and trickery when questioning African-American jurors on their views of the death penalty and minimum acceptable sentences. <em>(Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at pp. 242-245, 248-249, 255, 260.) Finally, the court discussed the use of \u201cjury shuffling\u201d and the evidence of historical discrimination by the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 275-276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, we find nothing in <em>Johnson v. California </em>or <em>Miller-El </em>as calling into doubt California Supreme Court precedent pertaining to the effect of lost juror questionnaires. Nor do we find anything in either decision requiring a more \u201cde novo-type\u201d review of trial court\u2019s ruling at Batson's third step. Our Supreme Court recently explained that \u201c[t]he fundamental inquiry remains the same after <em>Miller-El </em>as before: Is there substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s ruling that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing prospective jurors were based on proper grounds, and not because of the prospective jurors\u2019 membership in a protected group? If so, then defendant is not entitled to relief. In undertaking this inquiry, we note that the question is not whether we as a reviewing court find the challenged prospective jurors similarly situated, or not, to those who were accepted, but whether the record shows that the party making the peremptory challenges honestly believed them not to be similarly situated in legitimate respects .... <em>Miller-El </em>teaches that if a \u2018stated reason does not hold up, its pretextual significance does not fade because ... an appeals court, can imagine a reason that might not have been shown up as false.\u2019 <em>(Miller-El, supra, </em>[545 U.S. at p. 252].)\u201d <em>(People v. Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 233.) Our Supreme Court explained that it would confine its review \u201cto whether the prosecutor . . . honestly found pertinent and legitimate dissimilarities between members of the group he challenged and the group he accepted.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Defendant maintains that the record is insufficient because <em>Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. 231, and recent California Supreme Court precedent requires an appellate court to engage in a comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal. According to defendant, the absence of the questionnaires from the unseated jurors prevents this court from determining: \u201c(1) what percentage of the total available African-American jurors [was] challenged at each point in the proceedings; (2) what the racial composition of the jury was at the time of each challenge; (3) whether unchallenged, but unsworn, jurors had similar questionnaire responses to challenged jurors; (4) whether jurors with certain questionnaire responses were questioned more or less closely than others; (5) whether the prosecution tried to rehabilitate some jurors with similar questionnaire responses to those of the challenged jurors, who were not rehabilitated; (6) whether the original answers on the challenged jurors\u2019 questionnaires had been misinterpreted by the prosecution and/or the court below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Preliminarily, although it appears that the <em>Miller-El </em>court performed a comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal (see <em>People v. Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 232), the high court did not mandate that such an analysis be performed by an appellate court. <em>(People v. Gray </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th at 168, 189 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 451, 118 P.3d 496] <em>[\u201cMiller-El[, supra, </em>545 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>231] thus did not consider whether an appellate court must conduct a comparative juror analysis in the first instance, when the objector has failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination, or whether an appellate court must conduct a comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal, when the objector failed to do so at trial\u201d].) Moreover, contrary to defendant\u2019s implied assertion, the California Supreme Court has not mandated that a comparative juror analysis be performed for the first time on appeal. Rather, our Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that it would assume without deciding that comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal is constitutionally required. (See <em>People v. Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 232; <em>People v. Avila </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 546 [43 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 133 P.3d 1076]; <em>People v.

Ward </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 186, 203 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 464, 114 P.3d 717].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">When our Supreme Court has engaged in comparative juror analysis, the relevant inquiry has been centered on the responses of the challenged jurors and the seated jurors. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 547 [conducting side-by-side comparison of challenged and seated jurors]; <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 105 [noting defendant failed to identify \u201cany seated juror who gave responses similar\u201d to the challenged juror]; <em>People v. Schmeck, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 270 [noting defendant failed to identify \u201ccomment by a seated juror that was similar\u201d to the challenged juror\u2019s comment]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ward, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 203 [engaging in side-by-side comparison of two seated jurors and two challenged jurors].) Finally, even in <em>Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at pages 239-245, the United States Supreme Court conducted side-by-side comparisons of jurors who were struck, and those who were allowed to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">While it is true that neither the United States Supreme Court nor the California Supreme Court has addressed the specific issue before us, viz., whether a record lacking the questionnaires of unseated jurors is sufficient to conduct a comparative juror analysis on appeal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the cases reflect such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>analysis is not conducted in a vacuum. In other words, when conducting a comparative juror analysis, reviewing courts have examined the record in light of the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reasons for challenging specific jurors. (See, e.g., <em>Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at pp. 241-249 [views on death penalty and possibility of rehabilitation]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 547 [negative personal experience with police causing juror to question the veracity of police officers]; <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 105 [arrest and prosecution for drugs coupled with negative feelings against prosecutors].) Here, while the prosecutor asserted various reasons for challenging the jurors in question, the overarching theme was concern about bias against the police, caused by personal experiences, which would affect the jurors\u2019 ability to judge fairly the testimony of police officers. The record reflects that during voir dire, the trial court permitted both attorneys considerable latitude in exploring a prospective juror\u2019s views about the police. The attorneys were free to read questions on a prospective juror\u2019s questionnaire and the prospective juror\u2019s written response, and then ask the prospective juror to explain his or her written response. Thus, the salient material from the lost juror questionnaires survives in the reporter\u2019s and clerk\u2019s transcripts through quotation and paraphrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">To the extent defendant contends that the absence of questionnaires from the entire venire prevents a statistical analysis, we note that the <em>Miller-El </em>court found such bare statistical evidence to be not as compelling as the actual side-by-side comparisons of challenged jurors and seated jurors. <em>(Miller-El, supra, </em>545 U.S. at p. 240.) Additionally, we find nothing in <em>Miller-El </em>or subsequent California Supreme Court precedent as requiring an analysis of the \u201csix factual questions\u201d proffered by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Accordingly, we confine our review to whether the prosecutor here honestly found pertinent and legitimate dissimilarities between the challenged jurors (Juror Nos. 70, 81, and 7) and the seated jurors. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 547; <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 105; <em>People v. Schmeck, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 270-271; <em>People v. Ward, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 203.) The trial court and all counsel read the jurors\u2019 questionnaires. There was no dispute below as to the contents of the jurors\u2019 questionnaires. Accordingly, the actual questionnaires from Jurors Nos. 70, 81, and 7 are not necessary to permit us to provide adequate and effective review of defendant\u2019s <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>In sum, we conclude that the existing record is sufficient to permit review,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and defendant is not prejudiced by the absence of the questionnaires from the unseated jurors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>(People v.

According to defendant, after the prosecutor gave her reasons for dismissing the jurors in question, the trial court \u201cshould have then asked the defense for further proof of discriminatory purpose, including comparative . . . analysis using the questionnaires of the unsworn jurors and the timing of the juror challenges.\u201d Defendant\u2019s assertions are contrary to both fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">First, the record reflects that the trial court did give defense counsel an ample opportunity to make further argument after the prosecutor gave her reasons for challenging the three African-American jurors. The record further reflects that, at least as to Juror No. 70, defense counsel presented a comparative analysis, albeit a minimal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Second, the cases cited by defendant do not support remanding the instant case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>People v. Johnson </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 1096, 1101-1102 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 136 P.3d 804], our Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court to conduct the second and third <em>Batson </em>steps. Similarly, the cases defendant relies on from the Ninth Circuit were also remanded for further proceedings due to <em>Batson </em>error occurring at the first step. (See <em>Williams v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Runnels </em>(9th Cir. 2006) 432 F.3d 1102, 1110 &amp; fn. 14; <em>Paulino v.

Here, the trial court determined that defendant had made a prima facie case, then required the prosecutor to state her reasons for exercising her peremptory challenges, and finally gave defense counsel an opportunity to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons, before ruling on the motion. On this record, remand is not required, as there are no further proceedings to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the \u201cnow-required\u201d <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>procedures do not require a trial court to review \u201call [of] the questionnaires, including those of the unchallenged jurors.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th 72, cited by defendant, does not require the trial court to undertake such an analysis. There, our Supreme Court reviewed the record of voir dire, in which the prosecutor cited to the juror questionnaires, and noted that the record supported the prosecutor\u2019s assertions. <em>(People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 105-107.) Moreover, nothing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jurado </em>indicates that the Supreme Court reviewed and compared all of the questionnaires. Rather, the court noted that even if it assumed it must conduct a comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal, the defendant had not identified any seated juror who gave responses similar to the challenged juror. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Jurado, </em>like the instant case, involved the third <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>step.

Applying this deferential standard of review, we conclude the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Assuming without deciding that we are required to conduct a comparative juror analysis, we do so. Having reviewed the entire record of voir dire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>including the questionnaires of the seated jurors, we find nothing that entitles defendant to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Regarding Juror No. 70, the prosecutor provided the following reasons for excusing her: (1) she had just served on a jury in a burglary case a little over a year before the instant case, and stated that she preferred not to serve; (2) she stated on the questionnaire that the first thought that came to mind when she thought of police was \u201cracial profiling,\u201d and (3) she was chewing gum during voir dire, which the prosecutor believed showed a lack of respect for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">At trial, defense counsel argued that other unchallenged jurors, specifically Juror Nos. 39 and 76, stated that there were good and bad officers. However, when Juror No. 39 was questioned by the trial court, she stated that she had only \u201cgood experiences\u201d with police officers. Juror No. 39 also wrote \u201csecurity\u201d in her questionnaire, as the first thing that came to mind regarding police officers. While it is true that Juror No. 76, as well Juror No. 74, acknowledged in their questionnaires that some police officers could be bad, they also included positive comments about police officers protecting the community. Additionally, both Juror Nos. 76 and 74 stated that they had not had any negative experiences with police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Defense counsel also argued below that Juror Nos. 79 and 22 may have problems with police officers. In her juror questionnaire, Juror No. 79 indicated that a friend who was mugged reported that the police officer was not sympathetic or helpful. She also indicated that a friend\u2019s home was damaged and ransacked when her son\u2019s friend was found dead. Juror No. 79 did not list any personal experiences with police officers that were negative and stated that \u201cpublic service\u201d and \u201cdangerous situations\u201d were the first things that came to mind when thinking of police officers. Additionally, the record reflects that Juror No. 22 had no negative experiences with police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Moreover, no seated juror stated that \u201cracial profiling\u201d was the first thing that came to mind when thinking of the police. In fact, the responses of the seated jurors about the police were overwhelmingly positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Additionally, while Juror No. 63 had given various reasons for why she did not want to serve, she did not state any negative bias about the police. Rather, she expressed \u201chatred\u201d for criminal defendants, because her husband had been murdered in the Philippines. On appeal, defendant argues that Juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>No. 15,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a sworn alternate, expressed some reluctance in serving in this case. Juror No. 15 had previously served on juries in 1999 and 2002, but, unlike Juror No. 70, she did not ask to be excused from jury service in the instant case. Rather, Juror No. 15 expressly stated that it was part of her civic duty to serve.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Juror No. 15 also did not express any negative feelings about the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Finally, the fact that defense counsel did not think that gum chewing was disrespectful does not call into question the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing Juror No. 70. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Power </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 881 F.2d 733, 740 [peremptory challenge of African-American juror upheld, where juror had recently completed service on another jury and was fidgeting].) A prosecutor\u2019s explanations need not rise to the level of justifying a challenge for cause. <em>(Batson, supra, </em>476 U.S. at pp. 97-98; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 274\u2014276.) \u201cRather, adequate justification . . . may be no more than a \u2018hunch\u2019 about the prospective juror [citation], so long as it shows that the peremptory challenges were exercised for reasons other than impermissible group bias and not simply as \u2018a mask for race prejudice\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 664 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 573, 941 P.2d 752].) It is important to remember the legitimate bases for peremptory challenges, which include various factors that suggest the possibility of prodefense or proprosecution bias. \u201cFor example, a prosecutor may fear bias on the part of one juror because he has a record of prior arrests or has complained of police harassment, and on the part of another simply because his clothes or hair length suggest an unconventional lifestyle. In turn, a defendant may suspect prejudice on the part of one juror because he has been the victim of crime or has relatives in law enforcement, and on the part of another merely because his answers on voir dire evince an excessive respect for authority.\u201d <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 275.) As <em>Wheeler </em>elaborated, such factors may be less focused on the background or basic impression of a potential juror, but more commonly involve a \u201cgut feeling\u201d or the seat-of-the-pants subjectivity of prosecutors and defense attorneys alike. \u201cIndeed, even less tangible evidence of potential bias may bring forth a peremptory challenge: either party may feel a mistrust of a juror\u2019s objectivity on no more than the \u2018sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another\u2019 [citation]\u2014upon entering the box the juror may have smiled at the defendant, for instance, or glared at him.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing Juror No. 70 were neither contradicted by the record nor inherently improbable. (See <em>People v. Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 547-548 [prosecutor believed challenged juror\u2019s personal experience with police caused the juror to question the veracity of police officers]; <em>People v. Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 171 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Griffin </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 536, 555, fn. 5 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 743, 93 P.3d 344] [prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges based on prospective juror\u2019s negative experience with law enforcement upheld]; see also <em>People v. Ward, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 205.) Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding on the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 233; <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">With respect to Juror No. 81, the prosecutor explained that she challenged her because: (1) she had been \u201cvery critical\u201d of how the Oakland Police Department had handled the investigation of her domestic violence issues; and (2) she failed to answer questions on the questionnaire. The prosecutor stated that based upon Juror No. 81\u2019s answers, she was concerned that the juror would judge the Oakland police more harshly. While it is true that Juror No. 76 also skipped a question on the questionnaire, neither she nor any of the seated jurors answered questions in a manner that raised concerns about their ability to assess the credibility of police officers who might testify in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The record reflects that the prosecutor peremptorily challenged Juror No. 19, who in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question about Oakland police officers, stated, \u201cOakland Police Officers have been known to be very corrupt.\u201d The record further reflects that the prosecutor did not challenge Juror No. 34, a Hispanic man, whose brother-in-law was killed while in police custody in Modesto. When asked in the questionnaire to comment about the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system, Juror No. 34 wrote, \u201cI believe we have the best system in the world today.\u201d He thought of \u201csafety\u201d when thinking about police officers. And \u201cgood lawyer\u201d came to Juror No. 34\u2019s mind when thinking about prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Finally, the fact that Juror No. 81 said that she could set aside her feelings about the Oakland Police Department does not call into question the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing her. The record reflects that Juror No. 81 was somewhat equivocal about whether she could put aside her negative feelings, first stating that she was not sure if her past experiences with the Oakland Police Department would affect her ability to be fair and impartial. Upon further questioning by the court, Juror No. 81 stated her past experiences \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t\u201d affect her ability to evaluate the testimony of Oakland police officers who might testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The record reflects that the prosecutor peremptorily challenged Juror No. 26, a White woman, who gave similarly equivocal responses. Juror No. 26 stated that she had been a victim of domestic violence for approximately seven years. Juror No. 26 said she was \u201cambivalent\u201d about the district attorney\u2019s choice to not prosecute the case. However, her feelings about law enforcement, in general, were \u201cmixed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The prosecutor was not required to believe Juror No. 81\u2019s assertion that she could set aside her feelings about the Oakland Police Department. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 554\u2014555 [record established numerous reasons other than racial bias for challenging juror, notwithstanding juror\u2019s assurances that prior experiences would not carry over to trial].) The prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing Juror No. 81 were neither contradicted by the record nor inherently improbable. <em>(People v. Ward, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 205.) Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding on the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations. <em>(People v. Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 233; <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">As to Juror No. 7, although the trial court did have some reservations about the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for challenging this juror, substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s ultimate denial of defendant\u2019s <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>motion. The prosecutor stated that she challenged Juror No. 7 because: (1) multiple members of her family had been arrested by the Oakland Police Department; (2) her son, who had been arrested by the Oakland Police Department for assault, was the same age as defendant; (3) she stated that the first thing that comes to mind when she thinks of the police is \u201ctrouble\u201d; and (4) she stated that the first thing that comes to mind when she thinks of defense attorneys is \u201cmake the right decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The record reflects that no seated jurors had immediate family members with multiple arrests by the Oakland Police Department. Although Juror No. 7 stated that she felt her brother and sister had been treated fairly, the prosecutor believed that she was more defensive about her son\u2019s arrest and conviction. From the cold record before us, we cannot determine the tone or manner in which Juror No. 7 answered questions about her son. \u201cThe trial judge is best placed to consider the factors that underlie credibility: demeanor, context, and atmosphere. And the trial judge is best placed to determine whether, in a borderline case a prosecutor\u2019s hesitation or contradiction reflect (a) deception, or (b) the difficulty of providing a rational reason for an instinctive decision.\u201d <em>(Rice v. Collins, supra, </em>546 U.S. at p. 343 [126 S.Ct. at p. 977] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Defense counsel argued below that it was only natural that Juror No. 7 would view her son\u2019s case differently, and that she nonetheless stated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>felt she could be fair. However, given the number of Juror No. 7\u2019s relatives who were arrested by the Oakland Police Department and thereafter convicted, it was not unreasonable for the prosecutor to be skeptical. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 554-555; see also <em>People v. Farnam </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 138 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988] [\u201cclose relative\u2019s adversary contact with the criminal justice system\u201d reasonable grounds for prosecutor\u2019s challenge]; <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 277, fn. 8 [prospective juror\u2019s stepson\u2019s conviction \u201cdeemed to give rise to a significant potential for bias against the prosecution\u201d]; <em>People v. Douglas </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1681, 1690 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 129] [valid grounds for challenging jurors whose relatives and/or family members had negative experiences with criminal justice system]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 306, 314\u2014316 [260 Cal.Rptr. 463] [valid grounds for challenging jurors included having relatives or close friends who have been arrested].) Additionally, citing <em>People v. Moss, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d 268, the prosecutor asserted that Juror No. 7 might be sympathetic towards the defense, because her son was 44 years old, which was about the same age as defendant. There, as here, a prosecutor proffered numerous reasons for challenging a prospective juror, including the fact that she had sons who were the approximate age of the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 280.) The appellate court determined that the prosecutor\u2019s alternate reason for challenging the prospective juror based on the ages of her sons did \u201cnot survive analysis[, as] three unchallenged jurors (two women and one man) also had sons the same age.\u201d <em>(People v. Moss, supra, </em>188 Cal.App.3d at pp. 280-281.) Here, unlike in <em>People v. Moss, </em>none of the seated jurors had children who were the approximate age of defendant. Additionally, none of the seated jurors had children who had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The prosecutor was also concerned about Juror No. 7\u2019s responses on her questionnaire regarding the first thing that came to mind regarding police officers (\u201ctrouble\u201d) and defense attorneys (\u201cmake the right decision\u201d). The prosecutor believed that Juror No. 7\u2019s responses indicated that she was \u201cclearly defense-oriented\u201d and unable to be fair in this case. The prosecutor was not required to accept Juror No. 7\u2019s neutral explanation for these equivocal responses. (See <em>People v. Avila, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at pp. 554\u2014555.) No seated juror gave similar responses when referring to the police and defense attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the record does not reflect that \u201cthe judge felt Juror 7 was excused due to her race.\u201d Rather, the record reflects that the trial court expressed uncertainty about the prosecutor\u2019s challenge of Juror No. 7, which \u201cmay reflect the more general fact that, sometimes, no one, not even the lawyer herself, can be certain whether a decision to exercise a peremptory challenge rests upon an impermissible racial, religious, gender-based, or ethnic stereotype. ... [][].. . Appellate judges cannot on the basis of a cold record easily second-guess a trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>decision about likely motivation. These circumstances mean that appellate courts will, and must, grant the trial courts considerable leeway in applying <em>Batson. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rice v. Collins, supra, </em>546 U.S. at p. 343 [126 S.Ct. at pp. 976-977] (conc. opn. of Breyer, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s reasons for excusing Juror No. 7 were neither contradicted by the record nor inherently implausible. <em>(People v. Ward, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 205.) Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding on the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations. <em>(People v. Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 233; <em>People v. Jurado, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We also note that the prosecutor accepted two jurors of African descent: one African immigrant (Juror No. 76), and one African-American (Juror No. 75), \u201cwhich we find here to be \u2018an indication of the prosecutor\u2019s good faith in exercising [her] peremptories.\u2019 <em>(People v. Snow </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 216, 225 [242 Cal.Rptr. 477, 746 P.2d 452].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Huggins, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 236.) If the prosecutor were filtering prospective jurors by race, presumably she would have challenged Juror No. 76, an African immigrant. Juror No. 76 stated in her questionnaire that her husband had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. On voir dire, it came to light that Juror No. 76\u2019s husband had been recently arrested by Oakland police officers, and that his case was pending in Alameda County Superior Court. She also acknowledged that police officers could be bad, and failed to answer a question on the questionnaire. But Juror No. 76 also stated that police officers \u201cprotect the people\u201d and that she \u201creally\u201d appreciated the criminal justice system. Juror No. 75, an African-American woman whom the prosecutor did not challenge, had no prior arrests (self, friends, or family), and provided positive responses regarding her thoughts about police and prosecutors. Plainly, the prosecutor was seeking prospective jurors having a favorable attitude toward her cause, not jurors of a particular race or ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In sum, the prosecutor gave reasons demonstrating that she distinguished between jurors she challenged and those she accepted on valid, race-neutral grounds. The trial court accepted those reasons, and substantial evidence in the record supports the ruling. On our own review of the record, we think it is clear that the prosecutor desired jurors who did not have a bias against police officers, rather than jurors of a particular race. The jurors she accepted fit that desire, while those challenged did not. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>III.

Gray, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 186.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> Quoting the concurring opinion in <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 375 U.S. 277, 288 [11 L.Ed.2d 331, 84 S.Ct. 424], defendant argues that \u201c[a]nything short of a complete transcript is incompatible with effective appellate advocacy.\u201d There, an indigent defendant had been denied a complete <em>trial </em>transcript. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, the record includes a complete transcript of the voir dire proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\"> By reason of our conclusion that the record is sufficient to permit review of defendant\u2019s <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>claim, we do not address his alternate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to preserve the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\"> Of course, the better practice is for county clerks to retain <em>all </em>of the juror questionnaires whenever a <em>Batson-Wheeler </em>motion has been made, or at least the questionnaires of prospective jurors who were called to the box and questioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\"> We note that defendant\u2019s reply brief commences with the assertion that remand is not an adequate remedy because the lost juror questionnaires \u201cprevent the trial court from re-visiting the merits of the original motion.\u201d However, elsewhere, defendant asserts that \u201c[a]t a minimum, the case must be remanded to the trial court to allow it to comply with the high court rulings in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Miller-El.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\"> To the extent defendant impliedly asserts that a trial court is now required to conduct a comparative juror analysis on its own motion, this contention is without merit. \u201cCertainly, the trial court should consider obvious matters, and it can consider any other circumstances it finds relevant in the particular case. But, midtrial, we cannot expect, and do not demand, trial courts to engage sua sponte in the sort of comparative juror analysis that appellate lawyers and courts can do after scouring the often lengthy appellate record during the appeal.\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 1323.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> The reporter\u2019s transcript references Juror No. \u201c13\u201d instead of \u201c15.\u201d However, when comparing the voir dire transcript with the juror questionnaires, it is clear that the juror being questioned by the prosecutor is Juror No. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> The prosecutor\u2019s questioning regarding Juror No. 15\u2019s prior jury service is as follows: \u201cQ. If you have to serve a third time, will that be a problem for you? [f] A. I guess not. It\u2019s my duty to do it. [IQ Q. You\u2019d rather not? [IQ A. I\u2019d rather not. Here and work. It is hard, but it\u2019s my duty as a citizen. I have no choice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> Based upon this conclusion, we do not reach defendant\u2019s argument regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
