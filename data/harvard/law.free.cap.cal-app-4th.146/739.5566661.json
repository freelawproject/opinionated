In 2003, the Legislature responded by enacting Government Code section 8315,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which attempted to graft onto article I, section 31 a definition of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d that excluded \u201cspecial measures\u201d taken to secure advancement for certain racial or ethnic groups. Ward Connerly, as a taxpayer and citizen of California, filed a lawsuit in December 2003 against the Governor and Attorney General (defendants), seeking two remedies: (1) a judicial declaration that section 8315 is invalid as in conflict with article I, section 31, and (2) a permanent injunction preventing defendants from implementing or enforcing section 8315.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">While this lawsuit was pending, this court decided <em>C&amp;C Construction, Inc. v. Sacramento Municipal Utility Dist. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 284 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 715] <em>(C&amp;C </em>Construction), in which we held that section 8315\u2019s definition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d was ineffective because it conflicted with the plain meaning of that term set forth in article I, section 31 and interpreted by the California Supreme Court. <em>(C&amp;C Construction, </em>at p. 303.) The Supreme Court denied review in <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>and the parties here agree that section 8315 is, for all purposes, invalid and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, claiming that there was no case in controversy and that Connerly has no standing to pursue this action. Connerly maintained he had taxpayer, citizen or \u201cvoter\u201d standing to seek a court order prohibiting defendants from enforcing the statute. Agreeing with the voter standing argument, the court granted Connerly\u2019s cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings, issuing a judgment declaring the statute void and prohibiting defendants from enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">We shall reverse the judgment and direct the trial court to dismiss the action. With the finality of <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>and defendants\u2019 acceptance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>its holding, there is no longer a justiciable controversy surrounding section 8315. Moreover, absent allegations demonstrating that defendants are enforcing or threatening to enforce section 8315, there is no basis upon which to issue an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">A. <em>Proposition 209 and Section 8315</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Article I, section 31 (added by the 1996 adoption of Prop. 209) states in subdivision (a): \u201cThe state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Subdivision (g) of article I, section 31 provides that \u201c[t]he remedies available for violations of this section shall be the same, regardless of the injured party\u2019s race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin, as are otherwise available for violations of then-existing California antidiscrimination law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In <em>Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 537 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 653, 12 P.3d 1068] (Hi-Voltage), the California Supreme Court construed the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d in article I, section 31 as follows: \u201c \u2018[Discriminate\u2019 means \u2018to make distinctions in treatment; show partiality <em>(in favor of) </em>or prejudice <em>(against)' </em>[citation]; \u2018preferential\u2019 means giving \u2018preference,\u2019 which is \u2018a giving of priority or advantage to one person . . . over others.\u2019 \u201d (24 Cal.4th at pp. 559-560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Three years after <em>Hi-Voltage </em>was decided, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed into law section 8315, which purports to define \u201cracial discrimination\u201d for the purpose of interpreting article I, section 31. (Stats. 2003, ch. 211, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Subdivision (a) of section 8315 provides that the term \u201cracial discrimination\u201d in article I, section 31 \u201cshall have the same meaning as the term \u2018racial discrimination\u2019 as defined and used in ... the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination . . . .\u201d Subdivision (b) of section 8315 reproduces parts of the convention\u2019s definition of \u201cracial discrimination.\u201d After initially prescribing a definition similar to the one in <em>Hi-Voltage, </em>it goes on' to provide: \u201c <em>\u2018Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination </em>....\u2019\u201d(\u00a7 8315, subd. (b), italics added.) Thus, under section 8315, the definition of \u201cracial discrimination\u201d includes exceptions not found in the <em>Hi-Voltage </em>definition, i.e., \u201cspecial measures\u201d which help certain racial and ethnic groups equally enjoy the \u201cexercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Subdivision (c)(1) of section 8315 states that article I, section 31 \u201cshall not be interpreted as granting an individual a private cause of action to challenge any special measures undertaken for the purpose of securing adequate advancement of those racial groups requiring . . . protection .... Special measures shall not be interpreted as preferential treatment.\u201d It also allows the government to proceed with \u201cspecial measures\u201d without proving prior racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">B. <em>Connerly\u2019s Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Characterizing himself as a \u201ccitizen and taxpayer\u201d of this state, Connerly filed the present lawsuit against defendants, seeking to prevent them from implementing or enforcing section 8315. The first amended complaint alleged that, by adopting the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination\u2019s definition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d to interpret Proposition 209, a definition in fatal conflict with the one enunciated by the California Supreme Court in <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 537, section 8315 was an unlawful attempt to amend a constitutional provision by enacting a statute. It was also alleged that section 8315, subdivision (c)\u2019s prohibition on private actions based on the use of \u201cspecial measures\u201d was inconsistent with article I, section 31, subdivision (g), which contains no such bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Connerly\u2019s prayer for relief sought (1) a declaration that section 8315 is \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, and unenforceable\u201d and (2) an injunction restraining defendants from enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">C. <em>Defendants Demur and Connerly Amends His Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Defendants filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint, challenging Connerly\u2019s standing to bring the suit. The trial court sustained the demurrer, rejecting Connerly\u2019s theories of taxpayer and citizen standing. However, the court granted Connerly leave to amend the complaint to allege other facts that would entitle him to standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Connerly then filed a second amended complaint (SAC), essentially repeating the allegations of the first amended complaint but also averring that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>had the right to vote on section 8315 as a \u201csubstantial amendment\u201d of article I, section 31, and that, by failing to submit the statute to the voters, the Legislature had denied him a \u201cfundamental liberty interest\u201d in violation of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">D. C&amp;C Construction <em>Is Decided</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">After Connerly filed the SAC but before defendants filed an answer, this court filed its opinion in <em>C&amp;C Construction, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th 284. In that case, a contractor sued a municipal utility district alleging that the utility engaged in preferential discrimination in its contracting. While the case was pending, section 8315 was enacted. After receiving supplemental briefing by the parties concerning the effect of section 8315, we held that its definition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d to allow for \u201cspecial measures\u201d was invalid, because it conflicted with the meaning of the term \u201cdiscrimination\u201d set forth in article I, section 31 and the construction placed on it by the California Supreme Court in <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 537. We thus characterized section 8315 as an invalid attempt by the Legislature and the Governor to amend the state Constitution without complying with proper procedures for amendment. <em>(C&amp;C Construction, supra, </em>at pp. 300-302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">E. <em>The Trial Court Rules on Cross-motions for Judgment on the Pleadings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The California Supreme Court denied review in <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>on December 15, 2004. <em>(C&amp;C Construction, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at p. 325.) Defendants answered the SAC and in April 2005, each party filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defendants continued to assert that Connerly lacked standing and added that, as a result of our decision in <em>C&amp;C Construction, </em>there was no longer an actual controversy. In addition to reasserting taxpayer and citizen standing, Connerly asserted he had standing because the enactment of section 8315 without an opportunity to vote on it as an amendment to the state Constitution deprived him of \u201cone of the most cherished of all rights,\u201d the right to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The trial court granted Connerly\u2019s motion and denied defendants\u2019 motion. While again rejecting Connerly\u2019s claims of taxpayer and citizen standing, the court determined that he had standing <em>as a voter </em>to challenge section 8315 as an unconstitutional attempt to amend article I, section 31. Relying on <em>C&amp;C Construction, </em>the court declared section 8315 unconstitutional. Noting also that <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>did not address the constitutionality of section 8315, subdivision (c)\u2019s prohibition on private actions, the court found subdivision (c) equally unconstitutional. Accordingly, the court entered judgment granting the declaratory and injunctive relief Connerly had sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u201cA motion for judgment on the pleadings is the equivalent of a demurrer made after the pleadings are in.\u201d <em>(Columbia Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457, 463 [282 Cal.Rptr. 389].) \u201cThe standard of appellate review of a judgment on the pleadings is, therefore, identical to that on a judgment following the sustaining of a demurrer.\u201d <em>(Barker v. Hull </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 224 [236 Cal.Rptr. 285].) A demurrer admits all material and issuable facts pleaded in the complaint, amplified by matters of which judicial notice may be taken such as court records <em>(ibid.), </em>and the concessions of a pleader. <em>(Columbia Casualty Co., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 463.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">II. Case in Controversy Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Courts do not decide abstract questions of law. An indispensable element to jurisdiction is that there be an actual controversy between parties who have an adversarial interest in the outcome of the litigation. As the California Supreme Court explained nearly a century and a half ago: \u201cWhen questions are presented in good faith in the regular course of honest litigation, and are necessary to the determination of the case, we shall not hesitate to decide them; but it is no part of our duty to investigate and decide questions not regularly arising in the due course of litigation, for the gratification of the curiosity of counsel, or to serve some ulterior purpose of parties who choose to procure them to be raised against themselves by others who feel no interest in the contest.\u201d <em>(People v. Pratt </em>(1866) 30 Cal. 223, 225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Through this lawsuit, Connerly seeks two judicial remedies: (1) a declaration that all of section 8315 is unconstitutional and (2) a permanent injunction restraining the Governor and Attorney General from enforcing it. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that neither remedy is available here.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">A. <em>Declaratory Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 provides: \u201cAny person . . . who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another, . . . may, <em>in cases of actual controversy </em>relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an original action ... in the superior court. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cThus, declaratory relief is appropriate only where there is an actual controversy, not simply an abstract or academic dispute.\u201d <em>(Newland v. Kizer </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 647, 657 [257 Cal.Rptr. 450]; see also <em>Fiske v. Gillespie </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1243, 1246 [246 Cal.Rptr. 552] <em>(Fiske).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>No actual controversy exists in this case. As we have noted, <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>definitively determined that section 8315\u2019s definition of discrimination is inconsistent with Proposition 209 and amounted to an ineffectual attempt to amend the state Constitution. The California Supreme Court, which is \u201cthe final authority on interpretation of the state Constitution\u201d <em>(C&amp;C Construction, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.4th at p. 302), denied review in <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>in December 2004. Defendants readily acknowledged in the trial court and on appeal that <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>constituted a binding appellate pronouncement that the statute is unconstitutional. Therefore, any dispute over the constitutionality of section 8315 that might have existed when this lawsuit was filed in September 2003 surely no longer existed by the time the trial court granted Connerly\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings in May 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>C&amp;C Construction </em>is binding on and must be followed by all trial courts of this state. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) It was an idle and superfluous act for the trial court to issue a declaratory judgment that merely restates the holding of <em>C&amp;C Construction. </em>(Civ. Code, \u00a7 3532.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">It is true, as the trial court noted, that <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>did not directly address the constitutionality of subdivision (c) of section 8315, which forbids actions by private individuals seeking to challenge the \u201cspecial measures\u201d authorized in subdivision (a) of section 8315. But subdivision (c) no longer retains any vitality in the aftermath of <em>C&amp;C Construction. </em>Since subdivision (a) has been declared unconstitutional, subdivision (c), which has no independent force but exists only to enforce subdivision (a) procedurally, is equally invalid.  \u201c \u2018[I]f the statute is not severable, then the void part taints the remainder and the whole becomes a nullity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Santa Barbara Sch. Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 315, 330 [118 Cal.Rptr. 637, 530 P.2d 605].)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Even if a cause of action for declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of section 8315, subdivision (c) were to lie, the Governor and Attorney General would not be proper parties. Subdivision (c) bars actions by <em>private individuals </em>who seek to challenge \u201cspecial measures\u201d to combat discrimination. As public officers, defendants have no control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>commencement of private actions. Courts will not entertain a declaratory relief action \u201cthe sole object of which is to settle rights of third persons who are not parties.\u201d <em>(Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. v. Felt </em>(1931) 214 Cal. 308, 316 [5 P.2d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We conclude Connerly\u2019s declaratory relief cause of action seeks adjudication of a moot, abstract question without an actual controversy between truly adversarial parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">B. <em>Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">An \u201c[injunction is an equitable remedy available to a person <em>aggrieved by certain torts or other wrongful acts </em>. . . .\u201d (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 778, p. 235, italics added &amp; omitted.) The fact that a void law is on the books is not sufficient, by itself, to justify the issuance of an injunction. <em>(Golden Gate S. T., Inc. v. San Francisco </em>(1937) 21 Cal.App.2d 582, 584 [69 P.2d 899].) To obtain an injunction, a party must show injury <em>as to himself. </em>\u201cTo have standing, a party must be beneficially interested in the controversy; that is, he or she must have \u2018some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Holmes v. California Nat. Guard </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 297, 315 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 154], quoting <em>Carsten v. Psychology Examining Com. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 793, 796 [166 Cal.Rptr. 844, 614 P.2d 276].)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Connerly does not allege any facts showing that he has suffered or will suffer particularized injury as a result of the enforcement or threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>enforcement of Government Code section 8315. Instead, he relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 526a, which allows a taxpayer the right to bring an action to restrain an illegal expenditure of public money without a showing of special injury. <em>(Blair v. Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 269 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The goal of Code of Civil Procedure section 526a taxpayer standing is the necessity of prompt action to \u201c \u2018prevent irremediable public injury\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ahlgren v. Carr </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 248, 252 [25 Cal.Rptr. 887]), i.e., the unlawful or illegal expenditure of public funds <em>(Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. v. County of Alameda </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1240 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 740]). But, as we stated in <em>Waste Management, </em>\u201c[t]he taxpayer action must involve an <em>actual </em>or <em>threatened </em>expenditure of public funds. [Citation.] [\u00b6] General allegations, innuendo, and legal conclusions are not sufficient [citation]; rather, the plaintiff must cite <em>specific facts and reasons for a belief that some illegal expenditure or injury to the public fisc is occurring or will occur.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added; accord, <em>Fiske, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1246.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\u201cFor a lawsuit properly to be allowed to continue, standing must exist at all times until judgment is entered and not just on the date the complaint is filed.\u201d <em>(Californians for Disability Rights </em>v. <em>Mervyn\u2019s, LLC </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 232-233 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 57, 138 P.3d 207].) Where, as here, section 8315 has been successfully challenged in other litigation and a final decision by an appellate court has rendered it null and void, the purpose of allowing taxpayer standing to challenge it is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The SAC is devoid of allegations establishing that defendants have wasted or are about to waste taxpayer funds by attempting to enforce section 8315. Instead, Connerly\u2019s request for an injunction rests entirely on speculation that defendants <em>might </em>try to enforce a statute that has already been declared unconstitutional. However, injunctions cannot be predicated on the proponent\u2019s fear of something that may happen in the future. <em>(Korean Philadelphia Presbyterian Church v. California Presbytery </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1084 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 275]; see also <em>Cohen v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 447, 454 [225 Cal.Rptr. 114].)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 989 [190 Cal.Rptr. 682] <em>(Lee) </em>the Court of Appeal was confronted with a fact situation quite similar to the one before us. There, employers and employees of various clubs and bars sought and obtained an injunction preventing city law enforcement officers from enforcing city ordinances that regulated nude entertainment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 991.) While the case was on appeal the California Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Morris v. Municipal Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 553 [186 Cal.Rptr. 494, 652 P.2d 51], which all parties agreed rendered the city code sections unconstitutional. In the meantime, the city had declared a moratorium on enforcement of the ordinances, even though they had not been amended or repealed. <em>(Lee, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at pp. 991-992.) When the case was transferred to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of <em>Morris, </em>the city asked that the judgment be reversed and the case dismissed, since there was no longer any danger of enforcement. (Id. at p. 992.) The plaintiffs insisted that the injunction was still necessary since \u201cthe enforcement or nonenforcement [of the ordinances] is entirely dependent on the discretion of the city.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The <em>Lee </em>court reversed the judgment, with directions to dismiss the case. <em>(Lee, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at p. 994.) Citing case authority holding that there is no equitable reason for an injunction where the conduct to be proscribed has, in good faith, been discontinued and there is no evidence that the acts will recur <em>(id. </em>at p. 993, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>National Association of Realtors </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 459, 476 [174 Cal.Rptr. 728] and <em>Palo Alto-Menlo Park Yellow Cab Co. v. Santa Clara County Transit Dist. </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 121 [135 Cal.Rptr. 192]), the Court of Appeal held that the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morris </em>had \u201cso changed circumstances that it is unnecessary to grant an injunction.\u201d <em>(Lee, supra, </em>at p. 994.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The principles of <em>Lee </em>apply with even greater force here, since a final appellate decision declaring the statute unconstitutional was issued <em>before </em>the trial court issued its injunction. At no time after <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>did defendants threaten to defy its holding by attempting to enforce section 8315. To the contrary, defendants have admitted that <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>binds them and all state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>There is a presumption that state officers will obey and follow the law. <em>(Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Maxxam Corp. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1382 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 665].) Connerly pleaded no facts showing that defendants would not conduct themselves in conformance with the holding of <em>C&amp;C Construction. </em>Without a threat of present or future injury, no injunction can lie. (See <em>Blumhorst v. Jewish Family Services of Los Angeles </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 993, 1004 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 474] <em>(Blumhorst).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">III. Voter Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Although the foregoing analysis is sufficient to compel reversal of the judgment, we briefly address Connerly\u2019s assertion and the trial court\u2019s finding that he had standing to seek an injunction against the implementation of section 8315 because it infringes on his right to vote.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Connerly claims that because the Legislature enacted section 8315 without going through the proper procedures for amending the state Constitution, \u201chis right, as a California elector, to vote on the amendment of the California Constitution,\u201d has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Despite at least three opportunities to do so\u2014in the trial court, in his respondent\u2019s brief, and in response to questions from this court at oral argument, Connerly has failed to cite a single state or federal case that either establishes or recognizes \u201cvoter standing.\u201d Nor has he explained why, if the concept is so self-evident, no court has yet recognized it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The fact that the Legislature enacted a statute that was later declared unconstitutional did not confer upon Connerly \u201cvoter standing\u201d to sue for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">A court may not grant declaratory relief in the absence of an actual controversy between adversarial parties. No controversy exists in this case, nor was it necessary or appropriate for a trial court to issue a declaratory judgment restating the holding of a court of higher jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Injunctions do not issue as a matter of right merely because a statute is declared unconstitutional. \u201c[F]or standing to seek the prospective relief of an injunction, a plaintiff must show a likelihood he will be harmed in the future if the injunction is not granted.\u201d <em>(Blumhorst, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1004.) In the absence of an actual or at least threatened expenditure of public funds in the enforcement of an invalid statute, Connerly has no standing to sue as a taxpayer. <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>sounded the death knell for section 8315 and defendants have conceded they are bound by its holding. Connerly was not entitled to an injunction compelling defendants to follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Where there is no justiciable controversy the proper remedy is not to render judgment for one side or the other, but to dismiss. (See <em>Fiske, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 1247; <em>Lee, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at pp. 992, 994.) That will be our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the action. Defendants shall recover their costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.276(a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-11\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> Connerly alleged in paragraph 33 of the SAC that he \u201cis informed and believes . . . that Defendants dispute that Government Code section 8315 violates [the California Constitution].\u201d In their answer, however, defendants denied the \u201cmaterial factual allegations\u201d of paragraph 33. On appeal from a judgment on the pleadings, the appellate court will assume the truth of all facts properly pleaded in the answer and disregard controverted allegations of the complaint. <em>(Sebago, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Alameda </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1372, 1380 [259 Cal.Rptr. 918].) We must therefore accept as true defendants\u2019 denial that there is an actual controversy as to the constitutionality of section 8315.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> Our dissenting colleague finds a justiciable controversy in this case because he fears state agencies might enforce section 8315, subdivision (c) and are powerless to declare a statute unconstitutional on their own. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 754.) There are several problems with this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">First, Connerly has not named any state agency as a defendant, nor does he allege that any agency is enforcing or threatens to enforce section 8315, subdivision (c). Instead, Connerly has sued die <em>Governor </em>and the <em>Attorney General, </em>neither of whom has tried to enforce any part of section 8315.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Second, it is impossible to imagine and the dissent does not explain, how an administrative agency could \u201cenforce\u201d section 8315, subdivision (c) in any procedural context that makes sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Third, section 8315, subdivision (c) is a statutory tail without a head or a body. It prohibits private actions that seek to challenge special measures that enforce section 8315, subdivision (a)\u2019s definition of \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d However, once our decision in <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>invalidated subdivision (a), no administrative or elected body could implement \u201cspecial measures\u201d to carry out that definition without violating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Thus, even had we not stated the obvious by announcing the untimely death of section 8315, subdivision (c), the fact remains that there is simply no \u201cdispute\u201d regarding it between any parties that are now before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\"> Although we have chosen to address the issue, we note that Connerly\u2019s reliance on allegations of \u201ctaxpayer standing\u201d to uphold the judgment is procedurally infirm. In sustaining a demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend, the trial court rejected Connerly\u2019s assertion of taxpayer standing. Yet the SAC repeats the same averments that the trial court had rejected. Connerly was certainly entitled to appellate review of the taxpayer standing issue by refusing to amend his complaint and taking an appeal from the ensuing judgment of dismissal. <em>(Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 457 [212 Cal.Rptr. 743].) He could also have elected to file a writ petition in this court, seeking reinstatement of the taxpayer allegations that the trial court ruled were invalid. (E.g., <em>Taylor v. Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894 [157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d 854].) He had no right, however, to circumvent the trial court\u2019s ruling by reinserting the overruled allegations in an amended complaint. <em>(Sheehy </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop </em>(1942) 49 Cal.App.2d 537, 541 [122 P.2d 60] [plaintiff who amends his complaint after demurrer \u201cimpliedly confesses that the original pleading was not sufficient and that it should be corrected. Having made his election, he may not then claim the benefit of the original pleading and the amended one too\u201d]; accord, <em>Alhambra Transfer etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Muse </em>(1940) 41 Cal.App.2d 92, 93 [106 P.2d 63]; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 436; <em>Ricard v. Grobstein, Goldman, Stevenson, Siegel, LeVine &amp; Mangel </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 157, 162 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 139] [averments in a pleading that do not conform to a court\u2019s prior rulings are a sham and may be stricken].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\"> Connerly\u2019s assertion of \u201ccitizen standing\u201d was properly rejected by the trial court. Under that doctrine, \u201c[c]itizen suits may be brought without the necessity of showing a legal or special interest in the result where the issue is one of public right and the object is to procure the enforcement of a public duty.\u201d <em>(Connerly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 16, 29 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 5], citing <em>Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 144 [172 Cal.Rptr. 206, 624 P.2d 256].) But Connerly\u2019s complaint posits no \u201cpublic duty\u201d that defendants are failing or refusing to discharge vis-\u00e1-vis section 8315. Although the SAC contains extraneous allegations that the Attorney General is not enforcing <em>Proposition 209 </em>with sufficient vigor, this action targets only section 8315. Because the adequacy of the Attorney General\u2019s enforcement efforts is not at issue in this appeal, we deny Connerly\u2019s request for judicial notice of several pages from the Attorney General\u2019s official Web site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b553-11\"> The dissent finds \u201cvoter standing,\u201d but merely cites one decision reciting general principles of standing and another proclaiming the importance of the right to vote. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 752-753.) But one plus one does not equal three. We are aware of no state or federal case that recognizes \u201cvoter standing\u201d as a means of securing an advisory opinion on whether the Legislature has passed an unconstitutional statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b554-10\">NICHOLSON, Acting P. J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"ABp\">I respectfully dissent. Although the majority concludes plaintiff did not have standing and there is no actual controversy, it provides what plaintiff seeks\u2014that is, a published opinion holding that no part of Government Code section 8315 (section 8315) may be enforced by the state. I would reach that result in a more straightforward manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\n<em>Voter Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">The trial court ruled that plaintiff had standing because he is a voter and he alleged violation of his right to vote on an amendment to the California Constitution. I believe the ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u201cThe propriety of a private person\u2019s judicial challenge to legislative or executive acts depends upon the fitness of the person to raise an issue (\u2018standing\u2019) .... [Citations.] [\u00b6]... [\u00b6] \u2018The fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a . . . court, and not in the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.\u2019 [Citation.] A party enjoys standing to bring his complaint into court if his stake in the resolution of that complaint assumes the proportions necessary to ensure that he will vigorously present his case. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Harman v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 150, 159 [101 Cal.Rptr. 880, 496 P.2d 1248].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s stake in the resolution of his complaint is to vindicate his right as a California voter to vote on amendments to the California Constitution. Only California voters may amend the state Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. XVIII, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.) The right to vote is a fundamental right. \u201cIt is beyond cavil that \u2018voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Burdick </em>v. <em>Takushi </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 428, 433 [119 L.Ed.2d 245, 252, 112 S.Ct. 2059].) It is therefore vital that a qualified voter be able to vindicate the right to vote through redress in the courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>Actual Controversy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The state contends that our decision in <em>C&amp;C Construction, Inc. v. Sacramento Municipal Utility Dist. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 284 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 715] <em>(C&amp;C Construction) </em>rendered this proceeding moot and prevented the trial court from granting declaratory and injunctive relief because there was no actual controversy between the parties. To the contrary, although <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>resolved a major legal issue in this proceeding, it did not, in my opinion, render the proceeding moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">\u201c[T]he court must do complete justice once jurisdiction has been assumed [citation], and the relief thus granted may encompass future and contingent legal rights.\u201d <em>(Eye Dog Foundation v. State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 536, 541 [63 Cal.Rptr. 21, 432 P.2d 717], fn. omitted.) A proceeding is moot, and should be dismissed, when the court can grant no effectual relief, regardless of the legal merits of the case. <em>(Consol, etc. Corp. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>United </em>A. <em>etc. Workers </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 859, 862-863 [167 P.2d 725].) Effectual relief, however, can be granted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint alleged that section 8315 is unconstitutional and sought (1) a declaration that section 8315 is invalid, unenforceable, and void and (2) an injunction against implementation or enforcement of the statute. After our decision in <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>became final, the state answered the second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Administrative agencies apply the state\u2019s statutes. They cannot independently declare a statute unconstitutional and <em>must </em>implement and enforce it \u201cunless an appellate court has made a determination that such statute is unconstitutional.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. III, \u00a7 3.5, subd. (a).) <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>found section 8315\u2019s definition of \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d contained in subdivision (b), inconsistent with the use of the term in section 31 of article I of the California Constitution (article I, section 31), but the decision did not deal with the other provisions of the statute. <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>did not consider all of section 8315; therefore, it cannot be said to stand for the proposition that section 8315 is unconstitutional in its entirety. \u201cIt is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.\u201d <em>(People v. Ault </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1268, fn. 10 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 302, 95 P.3d 523].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The state argues, and the majority finds, that the entire statute was rendered invalid as a result of the decision in <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>because the unconstitutionality of the definition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in the statute defeated the statute\u2019s main purpose. This, however, is a legal conclusion concerning the constitutionality of parts of the statute that <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>did not address. While a court can, and the majority does, make this determination, an administrative agency grappling with the issue does not have the power to make this determination concerning constitutionality. For example, if a private person filed a complaint in the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, that agency, until the publication of this opinion, had no authority to conclude all of section 8315 unconstitutional. The majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>rendered all of section 8315, even the parts not addressed in <em>C&amp;C Construction, </em>unenforceable supports the relief plaintiff seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">It is difficult to understand the state\u2019s position in this litigation, opposing a judgment that would relieve administrative agencies of the Hobson\u2019s choice between (1) enforcing part of section 8315, enforcement that would violate article I, section 31, or (2) declining to enforce it based on article I, section 31, a decision that would violate California Constitution, article III, section 3.5\u2019s prohibition on declaring statutes unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure authorizes declaratory relief actions: \u201cAny person . . . who desires a declaration of his or her rights or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>duties with respect to another,.. . may, in cases of <em>actual controversy </em>relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, bring an original action or cross-complaint in the superior court for a declaration of his or her rights and duties in the premises .... The declaration may be had before there has been any breach of the obligation in respect to which said declaration is sought.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Despite the state\u2019s insistence that it does not challenge plaintiff\u2019s assertion that section 8315 is unconstitutional, an actual controversy lies in the tension between the duty of state agencies to implement and enforce section 8315 and plaintiff\u2019s assertion that <em>any </em>implementation or enforcement is unconstitutional. As noted, <em>C&amp;C Construction </em>did not make a sweeping determination that <em>any </em>implementation or enforcement of section 8315 would be unconstitutional. It determined only that the definition of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d in section 8315 was an unconstitutional attempt to amend article I, section 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The majority states that relief is not available because plaintiff does not challenge a specific or threatened application of section 8315. This action, however, is a facial challenge to section 8315\u2014an argument that any application would violate the Constitution. \u201cA facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.\u201d <em>(Tobe v. City of Santa Ana </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 1069, 1084 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 402, 892 P.2d 1145].) Accordingly, it does not matter, under these circumstances, that plaintiff did not challenge a specific application of section 8315.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The state argues, concerning whether relief is available: \u201cClearly, when an appellate court declares a statute unconstitutional it is neither necessary nor appropriate for courts to issue separate declaratory relief and/or injunctive relief against each and every state agency or officer that could be impacted by the appellate decision.\u201d For this proposition, the state provides no authority. The state exaggerates the premise in its attempt to discredit the conclusion. Plaintiff does not seek declaratory and injunctive relief against \u201ceach and every state agency or officer that could be impacted by the appellate decision.\u201d Instead, he seeks such relief against the Governor, who is the head of the branch of government charged with making many of the decisions subject to the strictures of Proposition 209, and the Attorney General, who is the state\u2019s chief civil rights enforcement officer. That is a focused and finite group, which has opposed relief throughout this litigation. (See <em>Raven v. Deukmejian </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 336 [276 Cal.Rptr. 326, 801 P.2d 1077] [taxpayers and voters sued Governor seeking injunction against enforcement of Prop. 115]; <em>American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>307 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 940 P.2d 797] [plaintiffs sued Attorney General seeking injunction against enforcing statute that violated state constitutional right to privacy].)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Because I conclude plaintiff\u2019s challenge to section 8315 presents a proper case for relief, I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> The majority disparages my math skills, which may not be altogether inappropriate. There is a good reason my wife handles the checkbook. But voter rights I know something about.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Exercising the right to vote is the means by which we, as a free society, preserve all other rights. <em>(Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1886) 118 U.S. 356, 370 [30 L.Ed. 220, 6 S.Ct. 1064].) I disagree with the majority\u2019s underlying and unstated premise that the judicial branch cannot act to check the legislative branch\u2019s attempt to amend the Constitution unilaterally. The constitutionality, not the wisdom, of the statute is at issue. The right to amend the Constitution is the epitome of voter rights. Here, plaintiff approaches the court seeking redress for constitutional injury. The majority sends him packing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
