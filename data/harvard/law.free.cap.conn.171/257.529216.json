Burns, commissioner of transportation. The plaintiff has appealed from a judgment erasing the action from the docket for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The complaint alleges that on January 3, 1969, the plaintiff purchased land in Old Saybrook for construction of a building so that he could expand and promote his engineering and manufacturing business. On February 14, 1969, he engaged a building contractor, and on May 8,1969, he obtained a building permit. The building and project that had been contemplated would have cost $120,000. On May 29, 1969, he obtained a construction mortgage loan of $32,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The complaint further alleges that, beginning in June, 1969, and on numerous occasions thereafter until May 23, 1972, employees of the defendants notified the plaintiff by letters that his land in Old Saybrook was being condemned by eminent domain and that it was to be taken for construction of a state highway. He was further notified by the defendants to refrain from and discontinue the construction of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The complaint goes on to allege that on May 23, 1972, the deputy commissioner of transportation sent a letter to the plaintiff which stated in part that the property could not be acquired until a public hearing was held and that property acquisitions for the highway were scheduled to begin in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>1973 and 1974.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The property was eventually taken. Four years elapsed from the time of the initial notice, June, 1969, to the time of \u201cactual taking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The plaintiff alleges that during that four-year period, as a result of the defendants\u2019 notifications and delays in actually taking the property, he was denied and deprived of the common, reasonable and necessary use and enjoyment of his property, that his rights of ownership were interrupted, that he was restrained from continuing the use of his land in that he refrained from and ceased construction of the building and was denied the mortgage after it was committed to him, and that he was denied and deprived of his right to carry on and expand his business. He claims damages for his being prevented from constructing the building. He further claims special damages for loss of profit, interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>on the mortgage loan of $7681.31, real estate taxes of $1339.17, an inspector\u2019s fee of $47, $300 for a survey, $435 for upkeep of the land and $445 for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The defendants filed a motion to erase in which they set up the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to the jurisdiction of the court. The court granted the motion and erased the action from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">A motion to erase a case from the docket will be granted only when the face of the record indicates that the court is without jurisdiction. <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>162 Conn. 525, 526, 294 A.2d 633; <em>Perrys, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury Redevelopment Agency, </em>157 Conn. 122, 123-24, 249 A.2d 256. The state is immune from suit unless the state, by legislation, consents to be sued. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290. In the present case, there is no statutory authority alleged for the plaintiff\u2019s action. The court, however, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>have jurisdiction to determine the plaintiff\u2019s remedy if there was a taking of property in the constitutional sense and if there were no adequate statutory procedures to assure just compensation. <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>169 Conn. 195, 205, 362 A.2d 1383; <em>Karp </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>supra, 529. The issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiff has alleged a taking that is distinct from the \u201cactual taking\u201d that took place four years after the initial notice. \u201cThe word \u2018taken\u2019 as used in the fifth amendment to the constitution of the United States and article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution \u2018means generally the exclusion of the owner from his private use and possession, and the assumption of the use and possession for the public purpose by the authority exercising the right of eminent domain.\u2019 <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>82 Conn. 51, 58, 72 A. 646.\u201d <em>Carl Roessler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 131, 140, 239 A.2d 538. Although a \u201ctaking\u201d may be complete without an actual, physical appropriation of property as discussed in such eases as <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, and <em>Stock </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>125 Conn. 405, 419, 6 A.2d 346, there is no taking in a constitutional sense unless the property cannot he utilized for any reasonable and proper purpose; <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Vartelas </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>146 Conn. 650, 153 A.2d 822; as where the economic utilization of the land is, for all practical purposes, destroyed. See <em>Dooley </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 304, 197 A.2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The complaint, to survive the defense of sovereign immunity, must allege sufficient facts to support a finding of a taking of land in a constitutional sense in the light of the principles discussed. The plaintiff has alleged that the state \u201cnotified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>plaintiff ... to refrain [from] and discontinue the construction of said building and project.\u201d That phrase, taken alone, and given the interpretation most favorable to the plaintiff, might suggest the necessary compulsion by the state, the absolute prohibition, that would indicate an unequivocal act of taking under the circumstances of the case. Beading the complaint as a whole, however, an unconstitutional taking, distinct from the \u201cactual taking\u201d in about 1973, has not been alleged. Firstly, assuming the plaintiff intended to allege two takings, the plaintiff does not ask for the value of the property not compensated .for later by the \u201cactual taking.\u201d He does not say that there was some value in the property itself for which he was not compensated. Essentially, he says that his aspirations for the use of the property were frustrated. Secondly, assuming one taking is all that could be found, the plaintiff does not ask that the date of taking be changed, or advanced. See <em>Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>167 Conn. 334, 355 A.2d 307. Thirdly, the plaintiff seeks damages for financial stress and loss incidental to a statutory condemnation, but does not seek the value of the property allegedly taken. Finally, there is but one count in the complaint. It combines all the allegations into one cause of action that alleges nothing more than possibly tor-tious conduct not amounting to a distinct taking. As the complaint is insufficient to establish an unconstitutional taking, and merely seeks damages for tortious conduct by the state, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is a sufficient bar to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In this opinion House, C. J., Longo and Barber, Js., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b281-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Bogdanski, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-0\">(dissenting). A taking may occur in the constitutional sense where the state causes <em>\u201ca </em>substantial interference with private property which destroys or nullifies its value or by which the owner\u2019s right to its <em>use </em>or <em>enjoyment </em>is in a substantial degree abridged or destroyed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Textron, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wood, 167 </em>Conn. 334, 346, 355 A.2d 307. In my judgment, although the plaintiff\u2019s complaint could have been more articulately drawn, it did nonetheless allege facts sufficient to support a finding of a taking in a constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the state \u201cnotified the plaintiff ... to refrain [from] and discontinue the construction of said building and project,\u201d and thac, because of the acts of the state, he was denied and deprived of the reasonable use of the property. If those allegations were shown to be true, the trier could have concluded that there was a \u201csubstantial interference\u201d with the property by the state, that the plaintiff was thereby deprived of the reasonable use of his property, and that, therefore, a taking in the constitutional sense had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">A motion to erase a case from the docket should be granted only when it is clearly apparent on the face of the record that the court is without jurisdiction. <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>159 Conn. 416, 420, 270 A.2d 554; <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>141 Conn. 646, 648, 109 A.2d 260. The allegations of a complaint must be construed in a manner most favorable to the plaintiff and \u201cevery presumption must be indulged which favors the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>152 Conn. 228, 233, 206 A.2d 106; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>147 Conn. 418, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>419, 162 A.2d 175. I am not persuaded, therefore, that the scope of the relief prayed for negates the import of the allegations of the complaint. I would find error, set aside the judgment and remand the case with direction to deny the motion to erase.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> \u201cMay 23, 1972</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Mr. Jerry Horak</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">ABEX Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Company</p>\n<p id=\"AlL\">432 Hammock Point</p>\n<p id=\"Aak\">Clinton, Connecticut 06413</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">Be: Project 105-131-1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">Old Saybrook, Boutes 154 &amp; 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMi\">Property Inquiry</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Deal Mr. Horak:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Your May 15, 1972 letter requesting answers to specific questions regarding your property in Old Saybrook as affected by the subject project has been referred to me for reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">On May 8, 1972 we received communication from Attorney Benjamin M.
