Floman, </em>for the appellants (defendants).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-9\"><em>L. Stewart Bohan, </em>with whom was <em>E.

The defendants denied that the buildings and equipment were on the plaintiff\u2019s land. The case was referred to a state trial referee. At trial, the plaintiff\u2019s original prayers for relief were abandoned and the case was tried to the referee, exercising the powers of the Superior Court, on the question of whether the plaintiff or the defendants held title to the land where the buildings were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The properties of the plaintiff and the defendants adjoin each other. The plaintiff\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>consists of approximately sixty acres, the major portion of which lies at the base of Beseck Mountain in Meriden. The easterly portion of the land extends up the side of the mountain, the deed description of the easterly boundary being stated as \u201cthe top of the mountain.\u201d The defendants own the land on the westerly side of the mountain in the town of Middlefield. It is the precise location of the plaintiff\u2019s easterly \u201ctop of the mountain\u201d boundary that was disputed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">After hearing all the evidence, examining the relevant records and deeds and viewing the property, the court concluded that there was an ambiguity in the deed description of the easterly boundary line as to the meaning of \u201cthe top of the mountain,\u201d that it was the intention of the parties when their respective properties were purchased that the boundaries were within the respective town or city where the deeds were recorded, and that the easterly boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s land described in its deed as the \u201ctop of the mountain\u201d was the Meriden-Middlefield town line, which was clearly designated on the mountain by brownstone monuments.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">It is unnecessary to recite all the evidence considered by the court. Under the circumstances, the \u201ctop of the mountain\u201d boundary description was insufficient to fix the location of that boundary solely from the deed description. What this court said in similar circumstances in <em>Christen </em>v. <em>Ruppe, </em>131 Conn. 149, 152, 38 A.2d 439, is particularly relevant to our decision on this appeal: \u201cThere was therefore a latent ambiguity in the description of the line in question. <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Blakesley, </em>4 Day 265, 271; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Turney, </em>15 Conn. 101, 113; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Cummins, </em>9 How. (50 U.S.) 479, 486, 13 L. Ed. 223; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1 Metc. (42 Mass.) 378, 381; note, 68 A.L.R. 4, 5; and see <em>Bielby </em>v. <em>Blinn, </em>112 Conn. 1, 4, 151 Atl. 357. Accordingly, the question of what the parties intended as the easterly line was one of fact for the trial court and we cannot disturb its finding, based as it is upon evidence of the surrounding circumstances and the situation'of the property, which legally supports it. <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Niantic Menhaden Oil &amp; Guano Co., </em>86 Conn. 147, 150, 84 Atl. 521; <em>Gioia </em>v. <em>Annunziata, </em>102 Conn. 52, 56, 127 Atl. 921; <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>113 Conn. 420, 426, 155 Atl. 639.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
