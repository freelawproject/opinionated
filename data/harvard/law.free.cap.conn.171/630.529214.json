That motion alleged that, in 1968, a child was placed by her mother with the plaintiff. In 1969, the plaintiff attempted to adopt the child but the natural mother did not consent. In June, 1973, the Juvenile Court, acting upon a petition of neglect against the mother, granted temporary custody of the child to the welfare commissioner who, in turn, placed the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>in the plaintiff\u2019s home where the plaintiff assumed the role of a foster parent. In February, 1974, the Juvenile Court committed the child to the custody of the welfare commissioner who continued the child\u2019s placement in the plaintiff\u2019s home. On October 3, 1974, the welfare commissioner removed the child directly from school to the home of the natural mother. The motion also alleged that the plaintiff, although not the biological mother of the child, is the psychological and emotional parent of the child. The plaintiff alleged that the child had lived with her from September, 1968, to October 3, 1974. In the appeal from the Juvenile Court to the Superior Court, the plaintiff alleges that the child was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Juvenile Court treated the motion as one made under General Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (f), and considered it as a motion to revoke the commitment of the child to the welfare commissioner. Both parties have characterized the motion in this manner. The Juvenile Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff\u2019s motion because \u00a7 17-62 (f) fails to include a foster mother as one who may file a motion to revoke. The Superior Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the Juvenile Court on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The plaintiff has assigned as error the court\u2019s failure to find that a foster parent is a \u201cparent\u201d as the word is used in General Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (f); that a foster parent has standing to file a motion to revoke commitment in Juvenile Court; that the Juvenile Court has jurisdiction to entertain a motion by a foster parent to revoke commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We turn initially to the plaintiff\u2019s contention that she is among those listed in \u00a7 17-62 (f). General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> empowers the Juvenile Court to summon the parents or guardian of a child to appear in eourt when a petition is filed containing information that a child is uneared for and neglected. Subsection (d) of \u00a7 17-62<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that after a hearing and adjudication that a child is uncared for or neglected the court may commit the ehild to the welfare commissioner or other persons and agencies designated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The power to revoke such commitment is controlled by \u00a717-62 (f),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which restricts the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>file an application for revocation to a \u201cparent,\u201d a \u201crelative\u201d and other persons or agencies named therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We find without merit the plaintiff\u2019s contention that her status is to be found among those listed in \u00a717-62 (f). The meaning to be given a statute is determined by legislative intent and that legislative intent must be determined by language actually used in the legislation. <em>Knoll </em>v. Kelley, 142 Conn. 592, 594, 115 A.2d 678. Poster parents are not mentioned in \u00a7 17-62 (f). If the legislature had intended to include a foster parent among the persons permitted the right to file an application to revoke commitment, it could easily have done so. Our statutes contain numerous instances in which a distinction is drawn between natural or adoptive parents and foster parents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We presume that the legislature was aware of the use of foster homes when it enacted \u00a7 17-62 (f) since it specifically authorized the welfare commissioner to place children committed to him in foster homes in \u00a717-62 (d). We, therefore, conclude that the legislature intentionally excluded foster parents from \u00a717-62 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The plaintiff also contends that the Juvenile Court has jurisdiction to entertain a motion by a foster parent to revoke commitment. The Juvenile Court is a statutory court. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-53 to 17-74. \u201cIt is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., </em>150 Conn. 563, 565, 192 A.2d 44. Under \u00a717-62 (f), one of those specified persons or agencies must apply to trigger the Juvenile Court\u2019s power to revoke the commitment to the welfare commissioner. As the plaintiff did not fall within one of those categories, the Juvenile Court did not have jurisdiction to revoke the commitment under \u00a717-62 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The plaintiff asserts that the due process clause of the federal constitution\u2019s fourteenth amendment guarantees her the right to initiate a hearing to revoke the commitment to the welfare commissioner. The record of the proceedings of the Juvenile Court includes only a motion entitled \u201cmotion to reopen,\u201d the court\u2019s memorandum of decision and a transcript devoted entirely to comments of counsel. At the hearing on the motion, counsel admitted that the plaintiff was a party at the neglect hearing. The Juvenile Court\u2019s memorandum of decision also states that the plaintiff was represented by counsel at that hearing. In any event, there is no claim that the plaintiff was deprived of due process because of the hearings in June, 1973, and in February, 1974. As a result of those hearings, the welfare commissioner was made guardian of the children. The plaintiff had an opportunity to request that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the child he committed to her as a person \u201csuitable and worthy\u201d of the responsibility of earing for the child. See General Statutes \u00a717-62 (d). In her \u201cmotion to reopen,\u201d she made no claim that was different from that which she could have made at the neglect hearing. She had an opportunity to be heard at the most critical time in the proceedings before the Juvenile Court. Due process does not require a rehearing of issues that have been litigated. See cases in 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law, \u00a7 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">While the principal brief is mainly concerned with the plaintiff\u2019s right to be heard upon the deprivation of her interests in the child, and while the argument is in traditional due process terms, the plaintiff\u2019s reply brief emphasizes an equal protection argument: \u201cAppellee has incorrectly stated in his brief that Appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of the classification by the legislature of those persons perfnitted to seek revocation of commitment in Juvenile Court. . . . Appellant does argue that the word \u2018parents\u2019 in the relevant statute, C.G.S. \u00a7 17-62 (f), can be construed to include foster parents. . . . However, if this Court does not see fit to adopt this construction, then Appellant argues it has no other choice but to find C.G.S. \u00a7 17-62 (f) unconstitutional.\u201d As to her claim of lack of due process because she was not included with the other persons allowed to bring motions for revoking commitment under \u00a7 17-62 (f), the argument concerns her right under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. The issue, then, is not whether a foster parent should be included as one who may initiate a hearing to preserve interests in a child, but whether a foster parent should be included among those who may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>move to revoke a commitment to the welfare commissioner, now commissioner of children and youth services.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The requirement of equal protection of the laws does not deny a state the right to make classifications in law so long as there is no invidious discrimination. Willi<em>amson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S. Ct. 461, 99 L. Ed. 563, reh. denied, 349 U.S. 925, 75 S. Ct. 657, 99 L. Ed. 1256. \u201cUnder traditional equal protection principles, a State retains broad discretion to classify as long as its classification has a reasonable basis.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 371, 91 S. Ct. 1848, 29 L. Ed. 2d 534. In the area of social welfare, a statute is not impermissible because the classifications are imperfect. So long as a classification has some reasonable basis, the statute does not offend constitutional requirements simply because a classification found therein \u201c \u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.\u2019 <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S. Ct. 337, 55 L. Ed. 369].\u201d <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S. Ct. 1153, 25 L. Ed. 2d 491, reh. denied, 398 U.S. 914, 90 S. Ct. 1684, 26 L. Ed. 2d 80. In <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 81 S. Ct. 1101, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, the court said (p. 425): \u201cAlthough no precise formula has been developed, the Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>constitutional power despite .the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality.\u201d A proper classification must include all who naturally belong to the class. There must be some natural and substantial difference germane to the subject or purposes of the legislation between those within the class and those excluded. <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 493, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">It would seem that a legislature could reasonably make a distinction between a foster parent and those included in the statute as parties who may move to revoke commitment to the commissioner. A logical argument can be made that a foster parent, after having had a child in its care for some appreciable time, becomes a psychological parent and that its interest in the child is equal to that of a biological parent. A reasonable extension of this argument would also include any considerate neighbor or relative who has had a child for a period of time for one reason or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On the other hand, once a commitment has been made, foster parents and concerned relatives and neighbors generally act more on a temporary basis, with the legal guardianship of the child in another. Although in some instances a long-term placement may develop a close relationship between the foster parent and child, generally speaking, a foster parent acts more as a custodian awaiting either the return of the child to parents or the adoption of the child. Goldstein, Freud &amp; Solnit, \u201cBeyond the Best Interests of the Child,\u201d p. 23. Furthermore, after a commitment under \u00a7 17-62 (d) to the welfare commissioner a foster parent derives custody from the commissioner\u2019s placement. It is reasonable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>include those who are legally responsible and biologically related to a child among those that have a statutory right to move to revoke the guardianship and custody of the commissioner and to exclude those who derive custody from the commissioner..</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In this opinion House, C.

I respectfully dissent. It seems to me that the plaintiff had the constitutional right to a hearing after the child was taken from her custody in October, 1974, and that General Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (f) is an appropriate avenue for pressing this claim under the unique circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The thrust of the majority opinion in this regard is that the plaintiff received all the due process to which she was entitled by virtue of her appearance with counsel at the February, 1974, hearing when a finding of neglect by the natural mother was made and custody of the child was transferred to the welfare department. In my opinion, however, the due process accorded the plaintiff at the hearing on the issue of the natural mother\u2019s neglect cannot limit or govern the due process right to a hearing which arose in the plaintiff after the state had entrusted the child to her and then summarily removed the child from her care. That due process must be accorded in a state action, involving revocation of a state-given right or privilege has been a concept developed in the opinions of the United States Supreme Court in recent years. As examples, it is now well-established that elements of due process such as notice and the opportunity for a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ing and cross-examination must be present in proceedings to revoke welfare benefits; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287; driver\u2019s licenses; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 91 S. Ct. 1586, 29 L. Ed. 2d 90; and parole and probation; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484; <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656. It seems to me that the state\u2019s removal of foster children from foster parents should be no less subject to the same guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551, a natural father successfully challenged an Illinois statute which allowed the state to deprive him of custody of his illegitimate children without a hearing. The court held that individual hearings were constitutionally required before the state could separate unfit parents from their children, and stated (p. 651): \u201cIt is plain that the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children \u2018come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.\u2019 <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>336 U.S. 77, 95 [69 S. Ct. 448, 93 L. Ed. 513] (1949) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\"><em>Stanley </em>is distinguishable from the present case in that the plaintiff here is not the natural parent of the child in question. Recent cases, however, have blurred the distinction between rights of natural parents and the rights of foster parents in this area; see, e.g., <em>Borsdorf </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>49 Ala. App. 658, 275 So. 2d 338; <em>In re One Minor Child, </em>254 A.2d 443 (Del.); <em>In re Fleming, </em>271 Minn. 337, 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>N.W.2d 109; <em>Pace </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>496 S.W.2d 931 (Tex. Civ. App.); and much commentary has been written in recent years about biological and psychological parents and to what respect each is entitled in custody determinations. One of the most influential works in the area is Goldstein, Freud &amp; Solnit, \u201cBeyond the Best Interests of the Child,\u201d in which the authors contend (p. 19) that the role of a psychological parent may be filled by any concerned, attentive adult on the basis of \u201cday-to-day interaction, companionship, and shared experiences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">I do not suggest that all legal distinctions between biological, legal and psychological parents be abolished, but rather suggest that the one who has cared for a child over a long period of time will develop mutual bonds of love and dependence with the child. Despite the lack of a biological tie in this ease, the plaintiff has stood in loco parentis since the child was four months old and was for six years, until the child was removed from her home, the only full-time mother the child had ever known. Under these circumstances, the absence of a biological connection cannot be regarded as fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In <em>James </em>v. <em>McLinden, </em>341 P. Sup. 1233 (D. Conn.), the court held that failure to notify foster parents of the filing of a petition of alleged neglect violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the fourteenth amendment,. as well as the express terms of General Statutes \u00a7 17-61. The court observed (p. 1235): \u201cThere is no sound reason to deny a person who has voluntarily assumed the obligations of parenthood over a child the same basic rights to due process a natural or legal parent possesses when the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>intervenes to disrupt or destroy the family unit.\u201d Of course, in the present case, the plaintiff did attend the hearing on the neglect petition, although she did not participate. Nonetheless, the principle announced in <em>James </em>v. <em>McLinden </em>has equal currency when applied to the state\u2019s action removing the child from the plaintiff\u2019s care. The latter action was taken with no due process guarantees; the plaintiff has averred that she received a letter which informed her of the commissioner\u2019s decision and that the child was then removed directly from school to the home of the natural mother. Under the circumstances the plaintiff had, at a minimum, the right to a hearing with respect to the propriety of the commissioner\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In a recent decision, a three-judge district court invalidated on fourteenth amendment grounds a New York statute which allowed the state to remove foster children from foster homes without affording a prior evidentiary-hearing to either parents or children. The court held (p. 282) that, in placements lasting over one year, \u201cbefore a foster child can be peremptorily transferred from the foster home in which he has been living, be it to another foster home or to the natural parents who initially placed him in foster care, lie is entitled to a hearing at which all concerned parties may present any relevant information to the administrative decision-maker charged with determining the future placement of the Child.\u201d <em>Organization of Foster Families </em>v. <em>Dumpson, </em>418 F. Sup. 277 (S.D. N.Y.).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">It is thus apparent that the state action in removing the child from the plaintiff-foster parent\u2019s home should be subject to the due process guarantees of the fourteenth amendment. To vindicate this right, the plaintiff proceeded under G-eneral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (f) to move to \u201creopen\u201d the commitment in the Juvenile Court. The essential allegation in her motion to \u201creopen\u201d is not that she has a right to continued custody of the child, hut that \u201c [i]n handling the placement change in this emergency manner, the Welfare Department disrupted the most significant relationship [the child] has in a substitute family that she sees as her own and created exactly the kind of traumatic situation which its guidelines state must be avoided.\u201d It is therefore clear that, while the motion was not filed by the child, it was filed for the child. And, although the plaintiff as a foster mother is not given the right to file such a motion in her own behalf, the legislature has specified in \u00a7 17-62 (f) that the child is a proper party to move to \u201creopen\u201d commitment. As a practical matter, a child may often be unable to bring a court suit of his own initiative. Accordingly, there must be some instances in which another party is entitled to file under \u00a7 17-62 (f), asserting the rights of the child and giving effect to the legislative intent. The plaintiff\u2019s unique position in this case so entitles her.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">I am unpersuaded that an action under \u00a7 17-62 (f) should be foreclosed by a strict reading of that statute. The plaintiff\u2019s motion raised before the Juvenile Court the issue of whether the welfare department\u2019s action was in the best interest of the child. The legislature has explicitly vested \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over matters pertaining to the custody of neglected children in the Juvenile Court. General Statutes \u00a7 17-59. As a motion under \u00a7 17-62 (f) is the most efficacious manner in which the best interest of the child can be determined, the plaintiff\u2019s motion should have been considered in that light and decided on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>In conclusion, then, the child has rights and interests which must he effectively protected, just as the plaintiff has rights which must be vindicated. A hearing conducted under General Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (f) is a fact-finding proceeding at which the child\u2019s best interest is determined from an examination of all the relevant circumstances and events. Likewise, a determination by the department that a foster parent is not acting in the best interest of the child is based wholly on facts which should be established only after the protections of due process have been extended to the foster parent. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 269, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287. As the rights are not protected and guarantees of due process have been denied in the present case, the welfare department\u2019s action is open to challenge by the plaintiff-foster parent, and a hearing conducted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-62 (f) is an appropriate method for resolving issues pertaining to the best interest of the child, and the adequacy of the plaintiff\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In this opinion Bogdanski, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
