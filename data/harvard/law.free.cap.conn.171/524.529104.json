On appeal he has challenged certain of the trial court\u2019s rulings on evidence, as well as the denial of his motion to dismiss the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">From a review of the evidence, the jury could have found the following facts: Beginning on August 25, 1971, an undercover police officer succeeded in ingratiating himself with persons involved in policy playing operations in the New Haven and outlying areas. On September 27, 1971, the officer met with the defendant and one John Taddei<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to discuss the officer\u2019s efforts to set himself up in the policy playing operation. At that meeting, the defendant made a series of threats against the officer in the event it should be discovered that he was a policeman. The officer responded that his life was an open book and that he was only in it for the money. The defendant, apparently satisfied by this reply, then said: \u201cOkay, here\u2019s how I do it,\u201d and described how the officer would be set up in the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Later that day, at the defendant\u2019s instructions, Taddei told the officer to call in his \u201caction\u201d to a certain telephone number every day between noon and 1 p.m. The officer was told that he should identify himself as \u201cPeanuts\u201d and that the person on the other end, who would identify himself as \u201cRoger,\u201d would be expecting his calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>On September 28, 29 and 30, the officer called in a series of fictitious bets to \u201cRoger\u201d and made tapes of these conversations, which were admitted into evidence along with a tape of a September 26 conversation between the officer and John Taddei. Transcripts of these four conversations were also submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On September 30, the officer made arrangements to meet with Taddei the next day, and at that October 1 meeting Taddei gave the officer $80 to pay off a winning policy number from the preceding day\u2019s action. This $80 was admitted into evidence for the limited purpose of showing the intention of the parties on September 30, but, in the final charge to the jury, the trial court reversed itself and instructed the jury to disregard the $80 payment as well as evidence concerning the conversation between the officer and Taddei on October 1. The officer\u2019s undercover operation concluded on October 4, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The conspiracy was alleged to have taken place between August 25, 1971, and October 4, 1971.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Connecticut\u2019s conspiracy statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was repealed, effective October 1, 1971, upon adoption of a new \u201cPenal Code,\u201d \u00a7 53a-l, and a new conspiracy statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> became effective. The trial court therefore excluded all evidence of events which occurred from October 1 through October 4 and permitted the state to proceed under the original information,- charging the defendant with conspiracy under General Statutes \u00a7 54-197, instead of under the new \u00a7 53a-48 (a) of the .General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The defendant challenges the state\u2019s right to charge him under General Statutes \u00a7 54-197 after its effective repeal date, i.e., October 1, 1971, along with the admission of evidence as to events of October 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">With respect to the state\u2019s power to charge under General Statutes \u00a7 54-197, General Statutes \u00a7 54-194 is dispositive, for it provides that: \u201c[t]he repeal of any statute defining or prescribing the punishment for any crime shall not affect any pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>prosecution or any existing liability to prosecution and punishment therefor, unless expressly provided in the repealing statute that such repeal shall have that effect.\u201d \u201c[Wjhen such a saving provision exists, a crime committed prior to the effective date of the repealing act remains punishable under the terms of the prior statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pastet, </em>169 Conn. 13, 22, 363 A.2d 41; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reisinger, </em>128 U.S. 398, 401, 9 S. Ct. 99, 32 L. Ed. 480; <em>Dortch </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 18, 29, 110 A.2d 471; see also 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes, \u00a7 422; 1A Sutherland (4th Ed.), Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a723.36\u2014 23.38, and cases cited therein. There was no error in charging the defendant under General Statutes \u00a7 54-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Nor is there any error in the trial court\u2019s limited admission and subsequent exclusion of evidence of events of October 1, i.e., the conversation between the officer and Taddei and the $80 which Taddei paid the officer. Although the court had barred the state from presenting evidence of a conspiracy which took place after September 30, this October 1 evidence was initially admitted for the limited purpose of showing the intention of the parties on September 30, the day a bet winning $80 was phoned in by the officer. The trial court, in its charge to the jury, however, reversed itself and told the jury to disregard this October 1 evidence and to consider only events which occurred on or up to September 30. In light of the strong and explicit language of the charge,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as a review of the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>evidence challenged by the defendant, we cannot say that the defendant was prejudiced by the limited admission and then exclusion of the October 1 evidence ; any error in its admission was cured by the trial court\u2019s charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 198, 187 A.2d 442; <em>State </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>88 Conn. 177, 90 A. 225; see also <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>102 U.S. 451, 458-59, 26 L. Ed. 141; <em>Veney </em>v. <em>State, </em>251 Md. 182, 197-98, 246 A.2d 568, cert. denied, 394 U.S. 948, 89 S. Ct. 1284, 22 L. Ed. 2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The defendant claims error in the denial of his motion to dismiss the information on the ground that under Wharton\u2019s rule<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the crime of policy playing is of such a character that one can be charged only for a substantive violation of the statute and not for conspiracy. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In its most recent formulation, Wharton\u2019s rule reads as follows: \u201cAn agreement by two persons to commit a crime cannot be prosecuted as a conspiracy when the crime is of such a nature as to necessarily require the participation of two persons for its commission.\u201d 1 Wharton, Criminal Law &amp; Procedure (Anderson Ed.) \u00a789, p. 191, cited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>171 Conn. 105, 117, 368 A.2d 212. Differently put, the principle is that \u201cwhere a crime can only be committed by the concurrence of two parties, they must be charged with its commission and not with a conspiracy to commit it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>126 Conn. 60, 81, 9 A.2d 63; <em>State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>132 Conn. 325, 335, 44 A.2d 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In a recent opinion, the United States Supreme Court reviewed Wharton\u2019s rule at length and declined to hold that the doctrine required reversal of a conviction for conspiracy to violate a federal antigambling statute. <em>Iannelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 95 S. Ct. 1284, 43 L. Ed. 2d 616. As the court noted: \u201cThe classic Wharton\u2019s Rule offenses \u2014 adultery, incest, bigamy, dueling \u2014 are crimes that are characterized by the general congruence of the agreement and the completed substantive offense. The parties to the agreement are the only persons who participate in commission of the substantive offense, and the immediate consequences of the crime rest on the parties themselves rather than on society at large.\u201d Id., 782; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bobo, </em>477 F.2d 974, 987 (4th Cir.); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The court concluded that \u201cWharton\u2019s Rule applies only to offenses that <em>require </em>concerted criminal activity, a plurality of criminal agents. In such cases, a closer relationship exists between the conspiracy and the substantive offense because <em>both </em>require collective criminal activity.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Iannelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">It is true that gambling generally involves the participation not only of bettors but also of people who accept and process these bets. The policy playing statute in effect at the time of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>conspiracy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> former \u00a7 53-298 of the General Statutes, is specifically drawn, however, and seeks to punish only those persons in the latter category and not the bettors. From a reading of this statute, it is also apparent that one may commit a substantive violation of \u00a7 53-298 without necessarily conspiring to do so, just as one may conspire with another to violate the statute without actually committing the substantive policy playing offense. For these reasons, a substantive violation of \u00a7 53-298 and a conspiracy to violate that statute do not require collective or concerted activity in the same sense as adultery, incest, bigamy, dueling, or any other Wharton\u2019s rule offense. <em>Iannelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Our holding on this issue is consistent with <em>State </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>supra, 335, in which we upheld a conviction for conspiracy to operate a telegraph and telephone apparatus for transmitting and receiving information concerning horse races upon which bets were to be placed. It was noted in that case that the legislature intended to punish only those who were transmitting the betting information and not those who received it, and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Faillace, </em>134 Conn. 181, 185, 56 A.2d 167, we similarly observed \u201cthat persons can set up a dice game arid thus violate\u201d a gambling statute \u201ceven though no customers are obtained.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The policy reasons for permitting prosecution for conspiracy under such circumstances were best summed up by Mr. Justice Powell in <em>Iannelli, </em>where he wrote (p. 784): \u201cUnlike the consequences of the classic Wharton\u2019s Rule offenses, the harm attendant apon the commission of the substantive offense is not restricted to the parties to the agreement. Large-scale gambling activities seek to elicit the participation of additional persons \u2014 the bettors \u2014 who are parties neither to the conspiracy nor to the substantive offense that results from it. Moreover, the parties prosecuted for the conspiracy need not be the same persons who are prosecuted for commission of the substantive offense. An endeavor as complex as a large-scale gambling enterprise might involve persons who have played appreciably different roles, and whose level of culpability varies significantly. It might, therefore, be appropriate to prosecute the owners and organizers of large-scale gambling operations both for the conspiracy and for the substantive offense but to prosecute the lesser participants only for the substantive offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">This statement is logically persuasive when applied to the present case. The trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information on the ground it violated Wharton\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Before trial, the defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress (1) three tapes made by the officer of his telephone calls to \u201cRoger\u201d on September 28, 29, and 30, and (2) the tape of a September 26 conversation between the officer and John Taddei. The defendant also moved to suppress the transcripts of these conversations. The basis of his objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>was that the tapes and transcripts were obtained without regard to the wiretapping and electronic surveillance statute, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a\u2014 54-41s. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Present federal and state wiretapping and eavesdropping statutes were drafted in response to a series of United States Supreme Court decisions which broke with the past and stated that one\u2019s conversations were protected from illegal \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution: <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U.S. 41, 87 S. Ct. 1873, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1040; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576, and <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 323, 87 S. Ct. 429, 17 L. Ed. 2d 394. In order to consider the defendant\u2019s statutory claims, we must first examine the constitutional background of wiretapping in light of <em>Berger, Katz, Osborn </em>and preexisting case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In <em>Berger, </em>the court invalidated a New York statute which authorized wiretapping and eavesdropping because the statute contained a \u201cblanket grant of permission to eavesdrop . . . without adequate judicial supervision or protective procedures.\u201d Id., 60. It was noted, in particular, that the statute permitted eavesdropping without requiring the belief that a particular offense had been or was being committed and without the need that the conversations sought be particularly described; that the eavesdropping was authorized for a two-month period, with extensions permitted; that there was no termination date specified once the conversation sought was actually seized; and that there was no requirement for notice as there was with conventional warrants. Id., 55-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>Katz, </em>decided six months later, overruled <em>Olm-stead </em>v. <em>United States, </em>277 U.S. 438, 48 S. Ct. 564, 72 L. Ed. 944, and <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 129, 62 S. Ct. 993, 86 L. Ed. 1322, and held that the fourth amendment protects a person from unreasonable seizure of his conversations from a place where he has a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d; id., 351; regardless of whether there was a physical trespass, because the \u201cFourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d Id., 351-52. The court noted, however, that surveillance of communications to accommodate \u201cthe legitimate needs of law enforcement\u201d may he authorized by judicial order issued in accordance with appropriate fourth amendment standards. Id., 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Osborn, </em>a case decided prior to <em>Berger </em>and <em>Katz </em>and upon which each relied to some degree; see <em>Berger, </em>supra, 63; <em>Katz, </em>supra, 355-56; stated (p. 329-30) that under \u201cprecise and discriminate circumstances,\u201d a federal court could empower agents to use concealed electronic devices \u201cfor the narrow and particularized purpose of ascertaining the truth of the . . . allegations\u201d of a \u201cdetailed factual affidavit alleging the commission of a specific criminal offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Prior to <em>Berger, Katz </em>and <em>Osborn, </em>however, the Supreme Court had turned back contentions that the recording of a conversation by one of the participants or the overhearing of a conversation by a third party with the consent of one of the parties violated the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">In <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, 83 S. Ct. 1381, 10 L. Ed. 2d 462, an internal revenue service agent concealed an electronic device on his person and recorded his conversation with the defendant. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>this recording was an illegal seizure of his conversation, and, after noting that the agent could properly testify as to his conversation, added: \u201cThe Government did not use an electronic device to listen in on conversations it could not otherwise have heard. Instead, the device was used only to obtain the most reliable evidence possible of a conversation in which the Government\u2019s own agent was a participant and which that agent was fully entitled to disclose. And the device was not planted by means of an unlawful physical invasion of petitioner\u2019s premises under circumstances which would violate the Fourth Amendment. It was carried in and out by an agent. who was there with petitioner\u2019s assent, and it neither saw nor heard more than the agent himself.\u201d Id., 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The court in <em>Lopez </em>relied on <em>On Lee </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 U.S. 747, 72 S. Ct. 967, 96 L. Ed. 1270, in which an undercover agent secreted a microphone on his person and engaged the defendant in a conversation during the course of which incriminating statements were made and transmitted to another government agent by means \u00f3f a receiver tuned in to the microphone. In <em>On Lee, </em>as in <em>Lopes, </em>the court rejected the argument that these statements were seized in violation of the fourth amendment. Id., 750-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Although it might appear at first blush that the constitutional doctrines of <em>Lopez </em>and <em>On Lee </em>could not survive <em>Berger, Katz </em>and <em>Osborn, </em>these cases were harmonized by the Supreme Court in the 1971 case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>401 U.S. 745, 91 S. Ct. 1122, 28 L. Ed. 2d 453. In that case, the court held admissible testimony by government agents who conducted warrantless electronic monitoring of incriminating conversations between the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>and an informant who was wearing an electronic transmitter and who could not be located at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In its discussion of <em>On Lee, </em>the plurality opinion in White<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> acknowledged that to the extent <em>On Lee </em>rejected the claim that there was no fourth amendment violation \u201cbecause the informer had not trespassed when he entered the defendant\u2019s premises and conversed with him,\u201d it could not survive <em>Katz. </em>Id., 750. The court, however, cited an alternative ground for the holding in <em>On Lee </em>which could survive <em>Katz, </em>i.e., that the defendant was \u201ctalking confidentially and indiscreetly with one he trusted and he was overheard. ... It would be dubious service to the genuine liberties protected by the Fourth Amendment to make them bedfellows with spurious liberties improvised by farfetched analogies which would liken eavesdropping to a conversation, with the connivance of one of the parties, to an unreasonable search or seizure.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The court went on to explain (p. 751) the viability of <em>On Lee </em>and <em>Lopez </em>in the wake of <em>Berger, Katz </em>and <em>Osborn </em>as follows: \u201cConcededly a police agent who conceals his police connections may write down for official use his conversations with a defendant and testify concerning them, without a warrant authorizing his encounters with the defendant and without otherwise violating the latter\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 300-303, 87 S. Ct. 408, 17 L. Ed. 2d 374. For constitutional purposes, no different result is required if the agent instead of immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>reporting and transcribing his conversations with the defendant, either (1) simultaneously records them with electronic equipment which he is carrying on his person; <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; or (2) carries radio equipment which simultaneously transmits the conversations either to recording equipment located elsewhere or to other agents monitoring the transmitting frequency. <em>On Lee </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. If the conduct and revelations of an agent operating without electronic equipment do not invade the defendant\u2019s constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, neither does a simultaneous recording of the same conversations made by the agent or by others from transmissions received from the agent to whom the defendant is talking and whose trustworthiness the defendant necessarily risks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Thus, having considered the constitutional framework for wiretapping and electronic surveillance, we turn to the federal and state statutes here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The present federal wiretapping and electronic surveillance statute, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public Law 90-351, Title III, \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. 212, codified as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72510-2520 (hereinafter title III), was enacted in 1968 in an effort to establish guidelines which would pass constitutional muster in light of the fourth amendment guarantees set forth in <em>Berger, Katz </em>and <em>Osborn. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States District Court, </em>407 U.S. 297, 302, 92 S. Ct. 2125, 32 L. Ed. 2d 752; see also S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1968 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2264-68.

Ed. 2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The purposes of title III, which are set forth in detail in the Congressional findings,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are two-fold: protecting the privacy of oral and wire communications while delineating on a uniform basis the narrow and clearly-defined circumstances and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ditions under which an interception of such communications may be authorized. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cafero, </em>supra, 500 n.8; see also 1968 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin. News 2153. To this end, Title III prohibits, on the pain of criminal and civil penalties, all interceptions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of oral and wire communications except those specifically provided for in title III, most notably those permitted to law enforcement officers when authorized by a court order in connection with the investigation of serious crimes set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 514-15, 94 S.

The pertinent portion of the act reads as follows: \u201cIt shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a72511 (2) (e). The same rule applies to persons not acting under color of law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72511 (2) (d). A reading of this statute makes it clear that the recording of a conversation by a party to it is an action which is permitted under this federal law. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wunker, </em>356 F. Sup. 44, 46-47 (S.D. Ohio); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>515 F.2d 885, 890 (5th Cir.). This conclusion is buttressed by an examination of the Senate Judiciary Committee Report, which states that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (2) (c) \u201clargely reflects existing law\u201d and that \u201c[wjhere one of the parties consents, it is not unlawful,\u201d citing <em>Lopez, </em>supra, <em>On Lee, </em>supra, and <em>Rathbun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 107, 78 S. Ct. 161, 2 L. Ed. 2d 134. 1968 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin.

Whether they are authorized under Connecticut\u2019s wiretapping and electronic surveillance statute is the question to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Connecticut\u2019s wiretapping and electronic surveillance statute, 1971 Public Acts, No. 68, codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a \u2014 54-41s, became effective July 1, 1971, and is modeled after and closely resembles title III with respect to the criteria and guidelines which must be met in order for a state\u2019s attorney to obtain a court order authorizing wiretapping and electronic surveillance. These requirements, as set forth in title III, are not self-executing with respect to the states, and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (2) a state\u2019s attorney has the power to make an application for such an order only \u201cif such attorney is authorized by a statute of that State.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41b was enacted to give state\u2019s attorneys such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">While Connecticut\u2019s statute resembles title III in many respects, it contains, however, none of the broad prohibitions against wiretapping and electronic surveillance which are contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a72511 (1). Nor does it contain any of the exemptions, such as for consensual recordings, which are set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (2). The only statute which barred wiretapping during the times pertinent to the present case (August 25, 1971 through September 30, 1971) was former \u00a7 53-140 of the General Statutes, which provided that \u201c[a]ny person who makes a connection, by wire or otherwise, with any telegraph or telephone wire, not owned or leased by him, for the purpose of obtaining information or listening to the transmission of telegraphic dispatches or telephone messages to which he is not entitled . . . shall be fined not more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>than five hundred dollars.\u201d Plainly, this statute authorizes consensual recordings and is not inconsistent with title III or 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605. Since a person is entitled to listen to his own calls, it is not a violation if he connects an electronic device to record them. <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Thus, there is nothing in the state statute which prohibits the undercover officer from making tapes of his own conversations and transcribing them for introduction into evidence. It is a fundamental-axiom of statutory construction that criminal laws must be strictly construed, and the officer\u2019s actions would be illegal only if the statute made them so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cataudella, </em>159 Conn. 544, 555-56, 271 A.2d 99; <em>State </em>v. <em>Moreno, </em>156 Conn. 233, 238, 240 A.2d 871; <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>137 Conn. 267, 274, 76 A.2d 9; <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Md. App. 253, 277, 310 A.2d 817; see also 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 293, 295, 297; 82 C.J.S., Statutes, \u00a7 389 (b)(1). The Connecticut wiretapping and electronic surveillance statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>permissive in the same sense as title III only insofar as it establishes standards whereby prosecutors may obtain court authorization for an electronic intrusion; it is not, however, prohibitory in the sense of title III, which contains a broad proscription against unauthorized and unexempted electronic interceptions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a72511. The only proscriptions in existence at the time of the present conspiracy were contained in former \u00a7 53-140 of the General Statutes, which does not prohibit parties from taping their own telephone conversations. For these reasons, we conclude that the undercover officer\u2019s actions were not prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-41a through 54-41s, that this act therefore had no application, and that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the four tapes and transcriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\"> John Taddei, along with five other men whom the officer had contacted during the investigation, were named, but not charged, in the informations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> The officer also taped his telephone conversations to \u201cBoger\u201d of October 1 through October 4, but in view of the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence which occurred after September 30, these tapes and transcripts were not submitted to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> The original information in this ease, dated November 8, 1971, charged the defendant with conspiracy to commit the crime of policy playing in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-197.

The same facilities are used for interstate and intrastate communications. There has been extensive wiretapping carried on without legal sanctions and without the consent of any of the parties to the conversation. Electronic, mechanical, and other intercepting devices are being used to overhear oral conversations made in private, without the consent of any of the parties to such communications. The contents of these communications and evidence derived therefrom are being used by public and private parties as evidence in court and administrative proceedings, and by persons whose activities affect interstate commerce. The possession, manufacture, distribution, advertising, and use of these devices are facilitated by interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">(b) In order to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative proceedings, and to prevent the obstruction of interstate commerce, it is necessary for Congress to define on a uniform basis the eircum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>stances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized, to prohibit any unauthorized interception of such communications, and the use of the contents thereof in evidence in courts and administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">(c) Organized criminals make extensive use of wire and oral- communications in their criminal activities. The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">(d) To safeguard the privacy of innocent persons, the interception of wire or oral communications where none of the parties to the communication has consented to the interception should be allowed only when authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction and should remain under the control and supervision of the authorizing court. Interception of wire and oral communications should further be limited to certain major types of offenses and specific categories of crime with assurances that the interception is justified and that the information obtained thereby will not be misused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> \u201cIntercept\u201d is defined as \u201cthe aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a72510(4). \u201cAural acquisition\u201d has been defined literally as meaning \u201cto come into possession through the sense of hearing.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wunker, </em>356 F. Sup. 44, 46 (S.D. Ohio). The Connecticut wiretapping statute defines \u201cintercept\u201d slightly differently as \u201cthe intentional overhearing or recording of a wire communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-41a (2). This difference in wording, however, need not be discussed in view of our resolution of this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\"> <em>In Rathbun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 107, 78 S.

The legislative history makes dear that this change was intended to make the new section a substitute and not merely a reenactment of \u00a7 605. By this new language, the amendment was designed to insure that the regulation of the interception of wire or oral communications would be governed by chapter 119 of title 18, i.e., title III of the Crime Control Act, which governs the procedure by which a warrant for electronic surveillance may be obtained by law enforcement personnel. 1968 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin.

As the Senate Judiciary Committee stated: \u201cThe new section is designed to regulate the conduct of communications personnel. It also provides that no person not authorized by the sender shall intercept any radio communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person. \u2018Person\u2019 does not include a law enforcement officer acting in the normal course of his duties.\u201d Id., 2197.

In particular, General Statutes $ 53a-189 (a) provides that: <em>\u201cA </em>person is guilty of eavesdropping when he unlawfully engages in wiretapping or mechanical overhearing of a conversation.\u201d The words \u201cwiretapping\u201d and \u201cmechanical overhearing of a conversation\u201d are defined to make it clear that the eavesdropping occurs only when there is an \u201cintentional overhearing or recording of a conversation\u201d which is carried out \u201cby a person other than a sender or receiver thereof\u201d and \u201cwithout the consent\u201d of at least one party thereto.

As an added precaution, the legislature made it clear that General Statutes \u00a7$ 53a-187-53a-189 \u201cshall not apply to wiretapping by criminal law enforcement officials in the lawful performance of their duties and does not affect the admissibility of evidence in any proceedings other than a prosecution for eavesdropping or tampering with private communications.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-187 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
