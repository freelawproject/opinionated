These criteria have been codified in \u00a7\u00a7 46-51 and 46-52 of the General Statutes. See <em>Krieble </em>v. <em>Krieble, </em>168 Conn. 7, 357 A.2d 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The court\u2019s finding and memorandum of decision in this case clearly indicate that it fully considered these criteria in making the award which it did. We find no abuse of discretion in the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
