In his application, the plaintiff alleged that he was an inmate at the Connecticut correctional institution at Somers, that he had been denied parole on not less than four occasions, and that the procedures followed by the board of parole at parole release hearings complied with neither the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (c. 54 of the General Statutes, hereinafter referred to as UAPA) nor the due process clauses of the United States and Connecticut constitutions. In his prayer for relief, he requested the court to order that he either be granted a parole release hearing conforming to the UAPA and complying with the mandates of due process or, in the alternative, that he be immediately released from custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In denying the application, the trial court determined that the UAPA did not apply to parole release hearings, and that the usual procedures followed at such hearings did satisfy the minimum requirements of due process. On appeal, the plaintiff has challenged both of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim that the procedures followed by the board of parole at parole release hearings do not comply with the minimum requirements of the due process clauses is not properly before this court. The trial court\u2019s finding of fact, stipulated to by the parties, merely recites in general terms the usual procedures followed by the board of parole and does not disclose whether these usual procedures were actually followed by the board in considering the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for parole. Nor does it appear that the plaintiff offered any evidence that the procedures actually followed in his particular ease resulted in a denial of his rights to due process of law. Questions of constitutional law presented in abstract rather than concrete form are not susceptible of proper determination. <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 497, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 152, 25.1 A.2d 49; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sul, </em>146 Conn. 78, 81, 147 A.2d 686; see 1 Antieau, Modern Constitutional Law \u00a7 15.21. In this case, the record discloses no substantial injury to the plaintiff from any concrete ruling involving minimum due process requirements. \u201cThis court does not sit to determine questions where the record shows that at most only remote or possible injuries can be suffered from leaving undisturbed the judgment of the lower court.\u201d <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Radcliffe, </em>134 Conn. 164, 168, 56 A.2d 1. We, therefore, do not consider the due process claims raised by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>H</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In the interim between the trial court\u2019s judgment and the perfection of this appeal, the plaintiff has been granted parole. Under similar circumstances, the United States Supreme Court has dismissed challenges to parole board procedures as moot. <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 96 S. Ct. 347, 46 L. Ed. 2d 350; <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>419 U.S. 1015, 95 S. Ct. 488, 42 L. Ed. 2d 289, vacating <em>United States ex rel. Johnson </em>v. <em>Chairman, New York State Board of Parole, </em>500 F.2d 925 (2d Cir.). Despite the plaintiff\u2019s lack of an immediate interest in the outcome of this appeal, we are persuaded that we should consider the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the UAPA is applicable to parole release hearings. Recently, in <em>Liistro </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>170 Conn. 116, 365 A.2d 109, we reached the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they were entitled to bail pending the outcome of parole revocation proceedings, even though, by the time the appeal was argued, the proceedings to revoke the plaintiffs\u2019 parole had been completed. We noted (p. 121) that \u201c[t]he single issue involved is one which is \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u2019 <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S. Ct. 279, 55 L. Ed. 310 ... . It directly affects the ongoing parole program of the state\u2019s penal system, and could very well affect the petitioners .... Hence, practical relief can follow directly from our decision and \u2018the public importance of the question involved makes it desirable that we decide the point.\u2019 <em>Winnick </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>100 Conn. 291, 296, 123 A. 440.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Similar considerations are involved in the present appeal. The board of parole conducts some 1700 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>parole release hearings each year, and the issue of whether the procedures mandated by the UAPA apply to those hearings is obviously one of considerable public interest and both parties seek a determinative resolution. The trial court decision in this case has been relied upon in dismissing the relief sought in at least eleven other applications for a writ of habeas corpus. Also, in view of \u00a7 54-126 of the Greneral Statutes, which authorizes the commissioner of corrections to retake and imprison a paroled convict upon violation of parole conditions, a determination of the issue presented on appeal might well affect the plaintiff upon a later application to be reparoled. We shall, therefore, consider the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, although our discussion is limited to the single issue of whether the UAPA applies to parole release hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The UAPA \u201capplies to all agencies and agency proceedings not expressly exempted\u201d; \u00a74-185; and mandates the procedures to be followed by such agencies in the adoption of regulations; \u00a7\u00a7 4-168 through 4-176; and in conducting hearings on \u201ccontested cases\u201d; \u00a7\u00a7 4-177 through 4-184. The plaintiff claims that a parole release hearing is a contested case to which the appropriate provisions of the UAPA apply. In determining the merits of this claim, we must consider (1) whether the board of parole is a nonexempt \u201cagency\u201d; and (2), if so, whether a parole release hearing is a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">An \u201cagency\u201d is defined for purposes of the UAPA as \u201ceach state board, commission, department or officer . . . authorized by law to make regulations or to determine contested cases.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u00a74-166 (1). The board of parole, as established by \u00a7\u00a7 54-124a through 54-126 of the General Statutes, is an autonomous body \u201cwithin the department of correction for fiscal and budgetary purposes only\u201d and consists of a chairman and ten other members who are assigned by the chairman to sit on panels of three members each, which panels serve as the paroling authorities of the state correctional institutions. \u00a7 54-124a. The panel may, in its discretion, permit an inmate who has served his minimum term to go at large on parole, provided the panel is satisfied that there is a reasonable probability that the inmate will remain at liberty without violating the law, and is satisfied that parole is \u201cnot incompatible with the welfare of society.\u201d \u00a7 54-125. The board of parole is authorized to \u201cestablish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary,\u201d and a panel may establish special rules governing the release of any particular inmate. \u00a7 54-126. Section 18-78 of the General Statutes provides that the board of parole shall be a part of the department of correction and \u00a7 18-78a provides that the TTAPA shall apply to the department, except that \u201ccases involving disciplinary action, classifications and out-of-state transfers\u201d are not required to be determined in accordance with the procedures mandated for contested cases. \u00a7 18-78a (b). Without resolving the apparent inconsistency between \u00a7 54-124a and \u00a7\u00a7 18-78 and 18-78a, we assume, for the purposes of this decision, that the board of parole is an \u201cagency.\u201d Such an assumption is not dispositive of the issues presented on appeal, however, for it remains to be determined whether a parole release hearing is a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined as \u201ca proceeding . . . in which the legal rights, duties or privileges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held.\u201d \u00a74-166 (2). A parole release hearing obviously qualifies as a proceeding \u201cin which a hearing is in fact held,\u201d and parole may arguably be characterized as a \u201cprivilege\u201d of the inmate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The third criterion for classification as a \u201ccontested case,\u201d however, is not met by a parole release hearing because there is no statutory requirement that the parole board determine the eligibility for parole of any particular prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The sole statute concerning parole, \u00a7 54-125, simply provides that an inmate who has served his minimum sentence \u201cmay be allowed to go at large on parole in the discretion of the panel of the board of parole for the institution in which the person is confined.\u201d There is no statutory requirement that the panel actually consider the eligibility of any inmate for parole, the statute does not vest an inmate with the right to demand parole, and there is no statutory provision which even permits an inmate to apply for parole. The only statutory limits upon the discretion of the board of parole are the requirement that the inmate serve his mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>mum sentence, that it appear that the inmate will remain at liberty without violating the law, and that the release of the inmate not be incompatible with the welfare of society. \u00a7 54-125. The statute does not deposit a power with an agency for the benefit of specifically designated persons, and does not establish the conditions upon which these persons would be entitled to call for the exercise of the power, as in <em>State ex rel. Markley </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>130 Conn. 88, 94, 32 A.2d 58. For even if the inmate has complied with the minimum requirements of \u00a7 54-125, the statute does not require the board to determine his eligibility for parole. The parole situation thus bears little resemblance to those cases in which we have held that the UAPA provisions concerning contested cases do apply. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Berlin Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 373, 355 A.2d 265, and <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>168 Conn. 435, 363 A.2d 103, both involved hearings which were statutorily required to be held before dismissing a tenured teacher. \u00a7\u00a7 10-151 (b), 5-242.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We conclude that there is no statutory requirement that the board of parole determine the eligibility for parole of any particular inmate, and that a parole release hearing is therefore not a \u201ccontested case\u201d to which the provisions of the UAPA apply. This is not to say that a qualified inmate has no constitutional right to a parole release hearing or that an inmate has no due process rights at a parole release hearing. See <em>Childs </em>v. <em>United States Board of Parole, </em>511 F.2d 1270, 1279 (D.C. Cir.). We hold only that the procedures which the UAPA requires for \u201ccontested cases,\u201d which procedures exceed the minimal procedural safeguards mandated by the due process clause; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Haymes </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>525 F.2d 540 (2d Cir.); <em>La Bonte </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>406 F. Snp. 1227 (D. Conn.); are not statutorily required at parole release hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> The defendants filed a special defense, claiming that habeas corpus relief was not appropriate under the circumstances alleged, because the application did not challenge the validity of the judgment under which the plaintiff was confined, nor did it challenge the jurisdiction of the court which rendered that judgment. Cf. <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>155 Conn. 36, 40, 229 A.2d 362. The trial court resolved this issue in favor of the plaintiff and that ruling has not been challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\"><em> </em>Compare <em>In re Schoengarth, </em>66 Cal. 2d 295, 300, 425 P.2d 200 (characterizing parole as a \u201cprivilege\u201d) and <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Parole Board, </em>148 Colo. 547, 548, 367 P.2d 338, cert. denied, 370 U.S. 927, 82 S.
