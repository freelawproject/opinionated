The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was killed at the same time as was the intestate of the plaintiff in that case, and under the same circumstances. Our decision in this case is therefore the same as in that one. The rulings and judgment of the court as to the defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff were erroneous, and the motion to nonsuit should have been sustained and the action dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
