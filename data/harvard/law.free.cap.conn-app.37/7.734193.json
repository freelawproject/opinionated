The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) conducted a hearing in damages after he filed an answer that required the clerk \u201cautomatically\u201d to set aside an earlier default for failure to plead, (2) granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the defendant\u2019s notice of intention to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s allegations at the hearing in damages, and (3) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to file a late notice of defenses as to the hearing in damages. We disagree with all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>defendant\u2019s assertions and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendant received certain valuable coins, a firearm and other articles that were stolen in a burglary of the plaintiff\u2019s home. The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for default for failure to plead on January 17, 1992, and the clerk sent notice of the default to all parties on January 22, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">On February 6, 1992, the defendant filed a motion to set aside the default pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 376.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 25, 1992, the trial court granted the motion \u201cif defendant files affidavit setting forth the existence of a defense, and files its answer by 3-10-92.\u201d The defendant failed to file the necessary documents. On March 23, 1992, the plaintiff filed a claim for the hearing in damages list. On April 2,1992, the defendant filed an answer and on May 6,1992, he filed a motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list. In the May 6 motion to strike, the defendant asserted that \u201cthe clerk of the court was obligated to automatically set aside the default pursuant to \u00a7 363A of the Practice Book.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike, stating in its memorandum of decision that \u201c[ajccordingly, the defendant was defaulted not because he failed to plead but because he failed to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>an order of the court. (Practice Book \u00a7 351.)\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 18, the defendant filed a \u201cnotice as to hearing in damages\u201d that stated which allegations of the plaintiffs complaint he intended to deny and, if necessary, disprove. The plaintiff then filed a motion to strike that notice, asserting that the notice had not been filed within ten days of the notice of default as required by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 367<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 368.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion to strike, ruling that \u201cthe default was effective as of March 10, 1992, and notice of the court\u2019s order was communicated to counsel on February 25, 1992.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The defendant then filed a motion for permission to file a late \u201cnotice of defenses as to hearing in damages.\u201d That motion was denied by the trial court, and a hearing in damages was held on July 7,1993. The trial court awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages of $78,245, which were trebled pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-564.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Punitive damages of $26,387.96 were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>also awarded, resulting in a total judgment of $261,122.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The defendant first contends that he is entitled to use Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 376 and 363A because both sections address the setting aside of defaults and there is no express prohibition in the rules against using the sections seriatim. He reads the rules to allow a second opportunity to set aside a default. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201cThe rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules.\u201d <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Trantolo, </em>192 Conn. 15, 22, 470 A.2d 228 (1984); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Smarrelli, </em>29 Conn. App. 660, 663, 617 A.2d 905 (1992) , cert. denied, 225 Conn. 901, 621 A.2d 284 (1993) . Two principles of statutory construction militate against the interpretation urged upon us by the defendant. The first principle is: \u201c[W]hen two statutes relate to the same subject matter every effort should be made to find a reasonable field for the operation of both statutes . . . [and] where there is a reasonable field of operation for each statute which does not impinge on the domain of the other, it is the court\u2019s duty to give them concurrent effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. Windham, 208 Conn. 543, 553, 546 A.2d 226 (1988); see also <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 578, 587 A.2d 116 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">Practice Book \u00a7 363A took effect on October 1,1990, long after the adoption of Practice Book \u00a7 376.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Just as legislatures are presumed to act with the knowledge of existing laws, so too are the judges of the Superior Court presumed to act with knowledge of existing rules when promulgating new rules. This presumption exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>in order to \u201ccreate one consistent body of laws.\u201d <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 696, 542 A.2d 1145 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>32 Conn. App. 224, 240, 630 A.2d 74 (1993), aff'd, 231 Conn. 545, 651 A.2d 1264 (1995). Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 376, a court, upon a party\u2019s motion, may set aside a default entered for <em>any </em>reason where judgment has not yet been rendered \u201c/or <em>good cause </em>shown upon <em>such terms </em>as it may impose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 363A, however, is limited to defaults entered for failure to plead and authorizes the clerk to set aside such a default where an answer is filed before judgment is rendered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second paragraph of \u00a7 363A<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> works in conjunction with the first paragraph that allows the clerk to enter the default for failure to plead without placing the motion for such default on the short calendar. Prior to the adoption of \u00a7 363A, a defaulted party\u2019s only remedy was to appeal to the court pursuant to \u00a7 376 or its predecessors. Section 363A, on the other hand, mandates that the clerk set the default aside upon the filing of the answer before judgment is entered. In return for the guaranteed set aside of the default, the defendant gives up the right to file a motion to dismiss, a request to revise or a motion to strike.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The obvious purpose of \u00a7 363A is judicial economy. Such economy is achieved by eliminating the need to place motions for default for failure to plead and motions to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>such defaults on the short calendar when an answer is filed by the defaulting party, prior to judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is nothing in the rule to suggest that it was intended to provide a second opportunity to set aside the same default.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 376 and 363A can be made compatible by limiting each to its proper sphere of operation. Section 376 applies to all defaults and permits the court to set aside such defaults prior to judgment. A party who is defaulted for a reason other than failure to plead must use this section. A defendant who wants to file a pleading that precedes the answer may also resort to this section. In contrast, \u00a7 363A applies only to defaults for failure to plead and only when the defendant elects to waive the right to file preceding pleadings by filing an answer prior to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Upon being defaulted for failure to plead, the defendant must make a choice of which section to invoke. To decide otherwise would run counter to a second well settled rule of statutory construction. Neither statutes nor court rules should be interpreted in a way that leads to bizarre results. \u201cWhen two constructions are possible, courts will adopt the one which makes the [statute] effective and workable, and not one which leads to difficult and possibly bizarre results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gabrielle </em>v. <em>Hospital of St. Raphael, </em>33 Conn. App. 378, 386, 635 A.2d 1232, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 928, 640 A.2d 115 (1994). \u201c[I]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts will assume that [the legislature intended to accomplish] a reasonable and rationale result . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, 212 </em>Conn. 727, 737, 563 A.2d 1347 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Applying these principles to rule making, it becomes clear why the defaulted defendant must choose one of the rules of practice, and is precluded from using both to address the same default. If we were to adopt the interpretation advanced by the defendant, he would be able to invoke the court\u2019s discretion pursuant to \u00a7 376, knowing full well that the court could impose conditions for setting aside the default. The defendant could then choose not to comply with those conditions (as he did here) and effectively countermand the court\u2019s order that the default stand, absent compliance, by resorting to \u00a7 363A. This interpretation would vitiate that portion of \u00a7 376 that allows the court to set the terms on which it will set aside a default. An even more egregious result could occur when the court denies a defendant\u2019s motion to set aside a default that had entered for failure to plead. Before judgment entered, that defendant could file an answer and the clerk would \u201cautomatically\u201d have to set the default aside. Such action would effectively overrule the court\u2019s order. In adopting \u00a7 363A, the judges of the Superior Court could not have intended the bizarre result of authorizing a clerk to overrule a court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">A rational result may be obtained by interpreting the rules to require that the defendant elect his remedy. A defaulted defendant could take the guaranteed set aside of \u00a7 363A by filing an answer or invoke the court\u2019s discretion pursuant to \u00a7 376. This would effect the judicial economy inherent in streamlining the short calendar pursuant to \u00a7 363A without impinging on the exercise of the court\u2019s authority to deny a motion to set aside such a default or to attach conditions thereto pursuant to \u00a7 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We conclude that once the defendant invoked the court\u2019s discretion pursuant to \u00a7 376, he was bound by the court\u2019s order thereon and was not entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 363A with respect to the same default.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant next claims that the court\u2019s order striking his \u201cnotice as to hearing in damages\u201d was improper for two reasons. First, he asserts that a motion to strike is not the proper vehicle to address such a notice and, second, he contends that the ten day period pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 368<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was never triggered because no notice of the operative default was ever sent by the clerk. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The defendant correctly asserts that a motion to strike tests the legal sufficiency of a pleading. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161, 170, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988). He argues that because the attack on the notice addressed its timeliness rather than its legal sufficiency, the motion to strike was improper. In support of this argument, the defendant cites <em>Mac\u2019s Car City, Inc. </em>v. <em>DeNigris, </em>18 Conn. App. 525, 528, 559 A.2d 712, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 807, 563 A.2d 1356 (1989), for the proposition that the proper way to raise a claim that a cause of action is time barred is by way of a special defense, not a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">We do not need to address the issue of whether a motion to strike or a special defense is the proper way to raise a timeliness claim pursuant to \u00a7 368 because Practice Book \u00a7 373<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> prohibits <em>any </em>pleading to a notice of defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Even though the plaintiff\u2019s motion here is labeled \u201cmotion to strike\u201d and invokes Practice Book \u00a7 151,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>we look to the substance of the claim rather than the form. In <em>Killingly </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>18 Conn. App. 508, 514, 558 A.2d 1039 (1989), this court determined that the use of a form labeled \u201capplication for review\u201d was sufficient to appeal a statement of compensation in a condemnation case even though the operative statute provided for an \u201cAppeal by owner.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court stated that it \u201cwas abundantly clear to all parties that the defendant\u2019s application for review contested the town\u2019s statement of compensation . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. <em>In State v. Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 213, 219, 537 A.2d 460 (1988), the Supreme Court rejected a claim that the defendant had not waived <em>his Miranda </em>rights because he signed a form labeled \u201cnotice of rights\u201d rather than a \u201cwaiver of rights\u201d form. The Supreme Court stated that to accept such a claim would elevate form over substance under the circumstances of that case where there was a clear waiver of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">There is nothing in the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike that addresses the legal sufficiency of the defendant\u2019s notice of defenses. The sole claim made by the plaintiff is that the notice was untimely. This \u201cmotion\u201d is, therefore, more properly viewed as an objection to the <em>filing </em>of the notice rather than a pleading that attacks the contents of the notice. Although the trial court ruled that the \u201cmotion is appropriate to address the legal sufficiency of what is in effect an answer,\u201d we may affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on an alternative ground supported by the record. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Bonney, </em>221 Conn. 549, 592, 606 A.2d 693 (1992); <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>216 Conn. 237, 252, 579 A.2d 497 (1990); <em>In re Jennifer G., </em>29 Conn. App. 689, 693, 617 A.2d 921 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">It is necessary to treat the plaintiff\u2019s motion as an objection in order to achieve a rationale result in read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ing \u00a7 367, notice of defenses, \u00a7 368, ten day rule, and \u00a7 373, no pleading to notice, together. To hold that a late notice cannot be attacked would make the ten day provision superfluous and inoperative. Rules of practice, as must statutes, must be read to give effect to all of their provisions. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Tonken, </em>192 Conn. 581, 589, 473 A.2d 782 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 150-51, 460 A.2d 26 (1983); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>26 Conn. App. 418, 421, 601 A.2d 555 (1992). To hold the plaintiff strictly to the label on his filing would exalt form over substance. Because the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion was the objection to the defendant\u2019s notice as untimely, it was a proper filing. The court\u2019s action in granting the motion was the functional equivalent of sustaining the objection to the late notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The defendant further asserts that there was no notice of a default that triggered the ten day provisions of \u00a7 368. He also claims in the alternative that \u00a7 368 provides that a notice of defenses can be filed, in the case of a denial of a motion to strike, within ten days from the expiration of the time limited for pleading over. The defendant\u2019s notice here was filed within ten days of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the case from the hearing in damages list.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We address the defendant\u2019s alternative claim first because it is easily refuted. The part of \u00a7 368 that he cites refers only to a situation where a party has a right to plead over.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> After the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike this case from the hearing in damages list, the defendant could not have pleaded over because he had already been defaulted for failure to plead. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s reliance on this part of \u00a7 368 is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>We now address, the defendant\u2019s claim that there was no notice of default that would trigger the ten day period. His argument rests on two bases: (1) the trial court\u2019s statement that the defendant was defaulted for failure to comply with conditions set by the court and <em>not </em>for failure to plead; and (2) the trial court\u2019s statement that the notice of default that triggered the ten day period was the court\u2019s order of February 25,1992. The defendant asserts: (1) that the clerk never sent notice that he was defaulted for failure to comply with the conditions set by the court in its February 25,1992 order; and (2) if the ten day period ran from February 25,1992, he was in the position of having the ten days expire before his March 10,1992 deadline for compliance with the conditions set by the court. These assertions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The trial court\u2019s order of February 25,1992, granting the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the default for failure to plead on certain conditions constituted what is commonly referred to as a nisi order. Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary defines nisi as: \u201cUnless, if not: except.\u201d Such orders are conditional and empower the affected party either to avoid an adverse order of the court or to cause an existing adverse order to be set aside or vacated by complying with the specified conditions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The present case is an example of the latter type of nisi order. The defendant was empowered by the trial court to effect a set aside of the default for failure to plead by complying with the two conditions set by the court. If the defendant had timely complied with those conditions, the default would have been set aside effective as of the date of compliance without the need for further action by the court. By failing to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>those conditions, the defendant failed to effect the set aside and, therefore, remained in default for failure to plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The notice that triggered the ten day provisions of \u00a7 368 was, therefore, the January 22, 1992 notice of default for failure to plead. Because that default was never set aside, the trial court\u2019s statements that the defendant was defaulted for failure to comply with the conditions set on February 25,1992, and that the order of February 25 was the notice of default, were of no consequence. Although the trial court referred to Practice Book \u00a7 351,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> no disciplinary default entered on February 25,1992, because the trial court did not order the defendant to do anything. The court granted the defendant the <em>opportunity </em>and the means to effect a set aside of the default, but the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the conditions and take advantage of that opportunity was not a violation of a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the February 25,1992 order of the trial court could not be notice because the ten days would have run prior to the expiration of the time period within which the defendant could have complied with the court\u2019s conditions is also without merit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree that the February 25 order was not notice of a default for the reasons discussed previously. The ten day period after February 25, 1992, is irrelevant because the ten day period for filing a notice of defenses began to run from the January 22, 1992 notice and had expired before the defendant filed his motion to set aside the default on February 6,1992. The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>incorrect statements regarding the notice and the default, therefore, did not affect the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Normally a default conclusively determines liability. <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Willametz, </em>9 Conn. App. 565, 579, 520 A.2d 621 (1987). Pursuant to \u00a7 367, a defaulted defendant who files a timely notice of defenses can contradict the allegations of the complaint and prove matters of defense in addition to contesting the amount of damages. This approximates what the defendant would have been able to do if he had filed an answer and special defenses. In order to obtain this extraordinary relief, the defendant must act within ten days of the notice of a default \u201c[i]n all actions where there <em>may </em>be a hearing in damages . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 368. A party who allows the ten day period from the notice of a default to expire without filing a notice of defenses does so at his peril. The defendant elected to appeal to the court\u2019s discretion pursuant to \u00a7 376 without filing a timely notice of defenses as a precaution in the event the court denied his motion to set aside the default. He then chose to ignore the opportunity presented by the court to effect a set aside of the default. The trial court properly precluded the May 18,1992 notice of defenses because the ten day period for doing so had expired over three and one-half months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly denied his motion to file a late notice of defenses as to a hearing in damages. The defendant\u2019s motion to file a late notice of defenses was addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. We reverse discretionary rulings of the trial court only where such discretion has been abused and has caused prejudice or injustice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>35 Conn. App. 609, 620, 646 A.2d 909 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>34 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>App. 473, 484, 642 A.2d 36, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 907, 642 A.2d 36 (1994); <em>Coble </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>34 Conn. App. 655, 661, 643 A.2d 277 (1994). \u201cDiscretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . . It goes without saying that the term abuse of discretion does not imply a bad motive or wrong purpose but merely means that the ruling appears to have been made on untenable grounds. . . In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Avitabile, </em>32 Conn.
