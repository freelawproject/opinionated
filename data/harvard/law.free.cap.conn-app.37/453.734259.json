The defendants claim that the trial court\u2019s action was an abuse of discretion because there was no evidence of jury confusion in the verdict rendered. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">The following facts form the basis of this appeal. This negligence action was tried to a jury in April, 1993. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the close of the evidence, the trial court instructed the jury as to the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof, causation, damages, comparative negligence, and the method of completing either the plaintiff's or the defendant^\u2019 verdict form. During deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the court in a note that read: \u201cWe are confused as to which form should be used if, one, fifty percent negligence each; two, no damages, plaintiff\u2019s verdict or defendants\u2019 verdict?\u201d In response, the trial court instructed the jury: \u201cIt would be a plaintiff\u2019s verdict form.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The jury returned with a completed plaintiff\u2019s verdict form that read: \u201cWe the jury find the issues in favor of the plaintiff Arlyne Fox and against the defendants Colony T.V. and Appliance, Inc., and Laurel Creagh and therefore find the damages to be as follows: [total damages zero.]\u201d The plaintiffs verdict form further indicated that the negligence attributable to the defendants was 50 percent and the negligence attributable to the plaintiff was 50 percent. The form clearly explained that if the percentage of negligence attributable to the plaintiff was 50 percent or less, the percentage of negligence attributable to the defendant should be multiplied by the total damages found to ascertain the amount of the damage award. Because the jury found zero total damages, however, the final figure of damages awarded was also zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The plaintiff filed a timely motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>inconsistent and ambiguous. After hearing argument on this motion the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion and rendered judgment ordering a new trial. It is from that judgment that the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In Connecticut, a jury\u2019s verdict is normally accorded great deference. <em>Balboni </em>v. <em>Stonick, </em>2 Conn. App. 523, 529-30, 481 A.2d 82 (1984). Nevertheless, it is the trial court\u2019s duty to set aside a verdict when \u201c \u2018it does manifest injustice, and is . . . palpably against the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Malmberg </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>208 Conn. 675, 679-80, 546 A.2d 264 (1988). We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision to set aside the verdict unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Fusaro, </em>225 Conn. 420, 425, 623 A.2d 1014 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In determining whether a jury verdict does manifest injustice, \u201cthe only practical test is whether the total damages awarded fall somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of fair and reasonable compensation in the particular case, or whether the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury were influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption. ... A direct showing of partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption is not required. [I]f the amount awarded shocks the sense of justice as to what is reasonable, then the inferred conclusion is that the jury was misguided in reaching its decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Malmberg </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[a] plaintiff\u2019s verdict with a nominal damage award ordinarily suggests that the jury found that despite the defendant\u2019s liability, the plaintiff failed to prove damages. . . . The jury\u2019s intent in rendering a plaintiff\u2019s verdict with zero damages ... is far less clear.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 681-82. In this situation, it cannot be stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>with certainty either that the jury found that the plaintiff had failed to prove any damages or that the jury was confused as to the correct interplay between damages and liability. Id., 682. \u201c[T]he jury\u2019s intent in finding the issues for the plaintiff, but awarding zero damages, is known only to the jurors, and this court\u2019s endorsement of one plausible explanation of the verdict over another would amount merely to speculation.\u201d Id., 683. The appropriate course of action when such an ambiguous verdict is rendered is to order a new trial on all issues. Id., 682; see also <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Fusaro, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In this case, the jury found in favor of the plaintiff on the issue of liability, yet awarded zero total damages. Because the jury was instructed that the finding of liability involved finding negligence by the defendants, which was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, a plaintiff\u2019s verdict with zero total damages is inherently ambiguous. <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Fusaro, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 425. The trial court\u2019s decision to set aside the verdict and to order a new trial comports perfectly with our Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Malmberg </em>and <em>Ginsberg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> The defendants also argue that, because the plaintiff failed to take exception to this jury instruction, the plaintiff waived the right to have the court consider the propriety of this instruction in the motion to set aside the verdict. Our review of the record indicates that the instruction was proper; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (b); and that the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict challenged the verdict as confusing and ambiguous, not the court\u2019s instruction as to which verdict form to use. There is no merit to this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
