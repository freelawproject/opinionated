J.</author>\n<p id=\"AujB\">This appeal arises from the denial by the planning commission of the town of Berlin of the plaintiffs\u2019 affordable housing subdivision application. The plaintiffs appealed that denial to the trial court, which sustained the appeal and ordered the commission to approve the plaintiffs\u2019 application. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Certain facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiffs, Joseph Wisniowski and Stanley Wisniowski, filed, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g, an affordable housing development application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the Berlin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>planning commission (commission) to subdivide a 14.5 acre lot into thirty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> smaller lots. Six of the thirty lots were designated as affordable housing in the development proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The property that the plaintiffs sought to subdivide was zoned R-43 by Berlin. This zoning designation requires that the minimum size of any lot be at least 43,000 square feet.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs proposed that their property be divided into lots ranging in size from 8000 square feet to 23,000 square feet. The plaintiffs' proposal did not, however, disturb the zone\u2019s single-family dwelling requirement. Although the size of the proposed lots did not comply with the requirements of the R-43 designation, the plaintiffs did not file an application with the Berlin zoning commission to change the zone of the property or to otherwise amend the regulations and zoning map to permit the undersized lots. Instead, the plaintiffs filed their application with the planning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The commission held a public hearing on the subdivision application and then denied the plaintiffs\u2019 appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>cation to subdivide the property for nine reasons, including the following three: \u201c(1) The plan does not comply with existing regulations for the R-43 zone nor with the existing affordable housing regulations. The commission is therefore prohibited from approving this proposal by Section 8-26 of the statutes. ... (5) The applicant did not seek the remedy of an amendment to the zoning regulations or amendment to the zoning map. ... (7) The retaining walls on the site plan present safety and maintenance problems for the homeowners. Lots with slopes in excess of fifteen percent do not comply with the subdivision regulations and the proposed walls are an unacceptable solution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then appealed to the Superior Court from the commission\u2019s decision and served both the planning commission and the town on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The trial court evaluated the reasons that the commission asserted for rejecting the application and found that these reasons were insufficient to satisfy the commission\u2019s burden of proof under \u00a7 8-30g, the affordable housing land use appeals statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>proof is on the commission to prove the denial is necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety or other matters, and that those interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing and that those interests cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development. General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c). The court found that this burden was not met. The trial court noted, however, that the issue of the degree of the slope of the land of two lots might comprise a valid safety concern. Those two lots, however, were not designated as being available for affordable housing. Consequently, the trial court ordered the commission to approve the application, but it also remanded the potential problem of the degree of the slope of the two lots to the commission for further discussion to determine whether that safety concern regarding the degree of the slopes could be reasonably addressed or whether the two lots were, in fact, unbuildable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The commission then sought certification in this court, which we granted. On appeal, the commission claims that the trial court (1) improperly concluded that \u00a7 8-30g overrides both the requirement that an applicant seek a zone change prior to obtaining subdivision approval pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-26, if the development proposed does not comply with municipal zoning regulations, and the uniformity requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 8-2, and (2) illegally usurped the legislative and administrative authority of the planning and zoning commissions of Berlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The first question that we must address is whether this appeal is taken from a final judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe expeditious resolution of disputes counsels against appellate review of trial court rulings that do not finally dispose of all the issues between the litigating parties. . . . Interlocutory orders . . . are immediately appealable only \u2018(1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 409, 521 A.2d 566 (1987).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201cA judgment by a trial court ordering further administrative proceedings cannot meet the first prong . . . because, whatever its merits, the trial court\u2019s order has not terminate[d] a separate and distinct proceeding. The more difficult question is whether the trial court\u2019s order so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted). Id., 409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 122, 653 A.2d 798 (1995), a \u00a7 8-30g appeal, the Supreme Court, determined that the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., does not govern zoning cases. In those administrative appeals that are not governed by the UAPA if the trial court remands the matter to the administrative agency for further consideration, the scope of the proceedings on remand dictates whether there has been a final judgment from which the parties can appeal. <em>Byars </em>v. <em>Whyco Chromium Co., </em>33 Conn. App. 667, 668, 637 A.2d 805 (1994). If the remand is for ministerial action, then it will be treated as if there is a final judgment, but if the remand is for discretionary action, then there is no final judgment. <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 556, 573 A.2d 1 (1990); <em>Matey </em>v. <em>Estate of Dember, </em>210 Conn. 626, 630, 556 A.2d 599 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The distinction is premised on the reasoning that when a trial court concludes that an administrative ruling was in error and orders further administrative proceedings on that very issue, it is considered a final judgment \u201cin order to avoid the possibility that further administrative proceedings would simply reinstate the administrative ruling, and thus would require a wasteful second administrative appeal to the Superior Court on that very issue. . . . A trial court may alternatively conclude that an administrative ruling is in some fashion incomplete and therefore not ripe for final judicial adjudication. Without dictating the outcome of the further administrative proceedings, the court may insist on further administrative evidentiary findings as a precondition to final judicial resolution of all the issues between the parties. . . . Such an order is not a final judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 128, held that there was a final judgment where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>trial court, after concluding that the affordable housing application must be granted, remanded the matter to give the commission the opportunity to \u201cimpose reasonable conditions and changes with respect thereto.\u201d In finding that there was a final judgment, the Supreme Court reasoned, \u201c[w]e attach significance to the fact that the trial court\u2019s judgment did not order further evidentiary determinations on remand. Although the trial court\u2019s remand may have <em>allowed </em>the commission to hear additional evidence in order to determine whether to impose \u2018reasonable conditions\u2019 on or to make \u2018reasonable changes\u2019 in the application, the remand in no way <em>required </em>the commission to conduct such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u201cEven more important, the trial court\u2019s judgment required the commission to approve the plaintiffs application. With respect to this central issue, the trial court\u2019s decision so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. . . . After explicitly resolving <em>all </em>[of] the issues in favor of the plaintiff\u2019 . . . the trial court remanded the case only for the limited purpose of allowing the commission to impose reasonable conditions on or make reasonable changes to the development, if it so chose. Because the proceedings on remand cannot deprive the plaintiff of the zone change that the trial court has ordered to be approved, the trial court has rendered a final judgment and this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the commission\u2019s appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We face a similar situation. Here, the trial court rendered a final decision on the affordable housing application, and held that the application should be granted. The proceedings on remand cannot affect the trial court\u2019s decision because the two lots that are the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ject of the remand are not included in the six lots designated as affordable housing lots. The approval of the application is final, no matter what is determined on remand relative to two of the thirty lots. As in <em>Kaufman, </em>the remand does not <em>require </em>a further evidentiary hearing. We conclude that this court has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal and now turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The commission\u2019s first claim is that the trial court should have found that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to seek a zone change prior to submitting a \u00a7 8-30g subdivision proposal that does not comply with the underlying zoning of an area. The commission refers this court to General Statutes \u00a7 8-2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>which requires uniformity of zoning regulations, and General Statutes \u00a7 8-26,\u00ae which prohibits planning commissions from approving subdivision applications that do not comply with applicable zoning regulations. The commission claims that because these traditional zoning requirements compel the planning commission to deny all sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>division applications that do not comply with the underlying zoning of an area, the trial court should have affirmed the commission\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 affordable housing subdivision application on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The commission argues that the plain language of \u00a7 8-30g indicates that it is an appeals act only, and, therefore, the fact that an appeal is brought under \u00a7 8-30g should not affect the standards and law applicable at the administrative level of land use decisions regarding affordable housing. Further, the commission argues that the legislative history of \u00a7 8-30g recognizes the need for a developer to comply with existing zoning or to seek zoning amendments to obtain approval for proposed developments. Thus, the commission\u2019s basic claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 8-30g overrides the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 8-26 and 8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Our conclusion is that the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 8-30g does not contemplate a denial of an affordable housing subdivision application on the ground that it does not comply with the underlying zoning of an area.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u201c Tn construing a statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 507-508, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (c) provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon an appeal ... the burden shall be on the commission to prove, based upon the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>record compiled before such commission that (1) the decision from which such appeal is taken and the reasons cited for such decision are supported by sufficient evidence in the record; (2) the decision is necessary to protect substantial public interests in health, safety, or other matters which the commission may legally consider; (3) such public interests clearly outweigh the need for affordable housing; and (4) such public interests cannot be protected by reasonable changes to the affordable housing development.\u201d This burden of proof applies to \u201cevery type of application filed with a commission in connection with an affordable housing proposal.\u201d <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 509. This includes affordable housing subdivision applications filed with planning commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The burden of proof established in \u00a7 8-30g is a specific, narrow standard that a commission must satisfy on appeal. The plain and unambiguous language does not list noncompliance with zoning regulations as a reason to affirm the denial of an affordable housing subdivision application. The commission argues, however, that even if \u00a7 8-30g does not, itself, contemplate the denial of an affordable housing subdivision application on the ground of zoning noncompliance, \u00a7 8-30g should not affect the traditional land use policy as found in \u00a7\u00a7 8-2 and 8-26. Therefore, despite the burden of proof established in \u00a7 8-30g, according to the commission, it must nevertheless deny an affordable housing application that does not comply with the zoning regulations, and the trial court must affirm the denial on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">To the extent possible, statutes should be reconciled. <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 572, 362 A.2d 871 (1975). When two statutes conflict, however, as in the present case, the more specific legislation governs over the general legislation; <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Conn. 616, 624, 441 A.2d 600 (1981); and the latest expression of the legislature prevails over a conflicting prior enactment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>195 Conn. 326, 331, 487 A.2d 1091 (1985). The affordable housing land use appeals act was enacted to deal with the particular problem of the lack of affordable housing in Connecticut. <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 511. It was not enacted as an amendment to the general zoning law. Section 8-30g is the later expression of the legislature and it prevails in the event of any conflict with \u00a7\u00a7 8-26 or 8-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The commission contends that according to the plain language of the statute, \u00a7 8-30g applies only to appeals. This argument, however, assumes that administrative proceedings exist in a vacuum. The burden of proof in \u00a7 8-30g dictates the only effective reasons for a commission to deny an affordable housing application. That burden necessarily establishes the standards of the underlying proceeding. Section 8-30g, therefore, affects the administrative proceedings concerning affordable housing subdivision applications, as well as the appeal proceedings. The narrow rigorous standard of \u00a7 8-30g dictates that the commission cannot deny an application on broad grounds such as noncompliance with zoning. Section 8-30g anticipates that there will be many different types of applications that may be brought to many different types of agencies. <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 137; <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 510-11. For example, in <em>Kaufman, </em>the application was made to the zoning commission, in <em>West Hartford, </em>to the town council, and in the present case, to the planning commission. Whichever zoning authority is asked to deal with the application, a zone change will necessarily be embodied in the application, either as to use, or as to bulk, as is the case here. If no zone change were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>involved, there would be no need for an application for affordable housing. An application may not be rejected just because it involves a zone change. <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 510-11. No formal zone change application is needed because the act is designed to allow circumvention of the usual exhaustion of zoning remedies and to provide prompt judicial review of a denial of an application. <em>Huntington Branch NAACP </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>844 F.2d 926 (2d Cir. 1988); <em>Huntington Branch NAACP </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>689 F.2d 391 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1069, 103 S. Ct. 1523, 75 L. Ed. 2d 947 (1983). Embodied in the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an affordable housing subdivision is a zone change. <em>Huntington Branch NAACP </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>supra, 689 F.2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The requirement of uniformity of \u00a7 8-2 \u201cdoes not militate against the grant of a specific exception to a general zoning requirement so long as the exception is reasonable and for the general community benefit rather than for the benefit of a single landowner.\u201d <em>Lavitt </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>152 Conn. 66, 75, 203 A.2d 289 (1964). Clearly, affordable housing legislation is for the benefit of the entire community, as well as for that of the state. <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The conclusion that zone conformity is not a mandatory prerequisite to approval of a subdivision application is consistent with the intent of the legislature as reflected by the legislative history of the affordable housing law. During the house debate, when asked by Representative Robert Farr if the fact that a proposed plan called for a multifamily dwelling in a single-family zone would in and of itself be a basis for denial of an application, Representative William J. Cibes, Jr., responded: \u201c[T]he answer is no, not per se. The municipality might have very good grounds for not having multifamily dwellings in the particular area. The soil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>type, the capacity of the infrastructure, various reasons such as that might have been a reason for the municipality not to adopt a particular zone for that particular area, but per se, there would not \u2014 it would not [be] a reason for rejecting this application.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1989 Sess., pp. 608-609. This indicates that zoning conformity is not necessarily required in an affordable housing application.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The commission refers to this passage and two others to support the position that the legislative history infers that the legislature clearly intended that zoning conformity be required. First, the commission cites Senator Richard Blumenthal as stating that \u201cit is important to understand that these decisions involve specific projects on particular pieces of land and do not provide for any kind of general zoning override.\u201d 32 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1989 Sess., p. 4048. Next, the commission cites another passage from the floor debate in which Representative Cibes commented that \u201cno one is suggesting that we\u2019re going to build a 20-story high rise on two acres of land out in Roxbury. . . . This [statute] is a step forward. It provides some meaningful standards. It is within the constraints of the existing zoning statute. It is a narrow procedure which is available only to a few kinds of developers, developers who propose to build affordable housing and I think that it is important that we recognize this and recognize the limited nature of this action.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 30, 1989 Sess., pp. 10662-64. The commission claims that these passages evidence the intent of the legislature to require zoning conformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The \u201ckey purpose of \u00a7 8-3 Og is to encourage and facilitate the much needed development of affordable housing throughout the state.\u201d <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 511. The legislative history indicates that the legislature intended to accomplish this goal by creating spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cific legislation that affects only affordable housing applications, not the overall zoning scheme. Therefore, applications that do not fit into the definition of an affordable housing application are not affected by \u00a7 8-30g. If an application does satisfy the definition of an affordable housing application, however, then the commission must satisfy the increased burden of proof in order to deny the application effectively. Under these circumstances, nonconformity of zoning is not, per se, a reason to deny the application. The legislature did not intend zoning nonconformity to block an affordable housing subdivision application.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The commission claims that if we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision, we will render affordable housing applications unworkable by local land use commissions acting in their administrative capacity because land use commissions would be forced to guess which regulatory standards should apply to proposals that do not comply with local zoning. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Section 8-30g is not part of the traditional land use statutory scheme. Traditional land use policies did not solve Connecticut\u2019s affordable housing problem, and the legislature passed \u00a7 8-30g to effect a change. The commission makes the mistake of looking at \u00a7 8-30g applications as though they were traditional zoning applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Section 8-30g does not allow a commission to use its traditional zoning regulations to justify a denial of an affordable housing application, but rather forces the commission to satisfy the statutory burden of proof. The factors that the commission considers when reviewing affordable housing subdivision applications are the same as those considered when it passes subdivision regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead of simply questioning whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the application complies with those regulations, however, under \u00a7 8-30g, the commission considers the rationale behind the regulations to determine whether the regulations are necessary to protect <em>substantial </em>public interests in health, safety or other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The commission asserts that it will not have any guidance in making its decisions, and, therefore, that there will be no conformity in the decisions. Conformity is provided by \u00a7 8-30g because each decision must be justified in terms of the factors enumerated in the statute. Essentially, every subdivision application must be approved unless there is a justifiable reason to deny the application. The commission must look at the rationale behind its regulations to determine if there is a substantial interest, outweighing the need for affordable housing, that must be protected by the denial of an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 8-30g was correctly interpreted by the trial court to allow the plaintiffs to seek subdivision approval for affordable housing without first seeking a zone change.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The commission argues that the trial court improperly usurped the discretion of the Berlin zoning and planning commissions, first, by ordering approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 development, despite the proposal\u2019s noncompliance with the established zoning, and, second, by undertaking its own evaluation of whether the subdivision proposal was consistent with other zones within the town.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Certain facts are relevant to this claim. After the trial court determined that zoning compliance was not a mandatory prerequisite to subdivision approval under \u00a7 8-30g, the court addressed the issue of the denial based on noncompliance under traditional land use law. The court noted that the proposal presented a situation in which the variation was not a use variation, but rather a bulk and lot variation. Because this type of variation is not totally inimical to the underlying zoning scheme, the court concluded that the commission had a basis, in town wide bulk and lot requirements, for evaluating the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The commission first argues that when the trial court ordered approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 application it essentially rezoned part of Berlin without the zoning commission\u2019s approval. We have already concluded that zoning compliance is not mandatory prior to approval of an affordable housing subdivision application. Land use commissions derive all of their power from the General Statutes. <em>Capalbo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 480, 490, 547 A.2d 528 (1988). The burden of proof in \u00a7 8-30g (c) takes away some of the discretion that local commissions have under traditional land use law and allows the reviewing trial court to effect a zone change if the local commission cannot satisfy the statutory requirements for its denial of an application. Section 8-30g (c) provides that if the commission fails to satisfy its burden of proof, the trial court, <em>\u201cshall </em>wholly or partly, revise, modify, remand or reverse the decision from which the appeal was taken in a manner consistent with the evidence in the record before it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Here, the trial court found that the commission had failed to satisfy its burden of proof under the statute and accordingly reversed the decision of the commission. Although the effect of that action was to approve a subdivision application that did not comply with the existing zoning of the area, the decision did not usurp the authority of Berlin\u2019s zoning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Second, the commission claims that the trial court usurped the commission\u2019s authority when the court conducted its own policy review of the application based on standards it gleaned by reviewing regulations applicable to other properties and uses in Berlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u201c[WJhere a zoning commission has formally stated the reasons for its decision the court should not go behind that official collective statement of the commission. It should not attempt to search out and speculate upon other reasons which might have influenced some or all of the members of the commission to reach the commission\u2019s final collective decision.\u201d <em>DeMaria </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>159 Conn. 534, 541, 271 A.2d 105 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Here, the commission asserted noncompliance with existing zoning as one reason for denying the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>application. The trial court found that noncompliance was not, itself, a reason to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Because the trial court was concerned with the issue of standards by which a commission could judge an application, the trial court examined the town wide zoning plan to determine whether the bulk and lot sizes of the proposed development complied with Berlin\u2019s regulations. This review may have been superfluous, but it was not a usurpation of the commission\u2019s authority. A determination of whether a plan is in violation of public health and safety regulations is an appropriate exercise of authority under \u00a7 8-30g.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g provides in relevant part: \u2018 \u2018affordable housing land use appeals procedure, (a) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"AP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>(1) \u2018Affordable housing development\u2019 means a proposed housing development . . .
