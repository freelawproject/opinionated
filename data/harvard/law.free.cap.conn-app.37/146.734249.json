The defendant claims that the trial court improperly set aside the verdict because (1) he did not disobey the court\u2019s order in his closing argument with respect to the unreasonable speed of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle and such argument had a sufficient basis in the evidence, and (2) the defendant\u2019s comments during closing argument were, under the circumstances, not so prejudicial as to deprive the plaintiff of a fair trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The following facts and claims of the parties are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. On April 10, 1988, vehicles operated by the plaintiff and the defendant collided at the intersection of Route 164 and a one-way two lane service road in Griswold. The defendant was traveling south on the service road and had a stop sign at the intersection. The plaintiff was traveling west on Route 164 and had no traffic control sign or signal. After stopping at the stop sign, the defendant entered the intersection to cross Route 164, and the collision occurred. A witness who was traveling behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle testified that the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was moving \u201crather fast\u201d and was traveling faster than the speed limit of thirty-five miles per hour. The plaintiff alleged that the collision was due to the negligence of the defendant by, inter alia, failing to stop at the stop sign and failing to yield the right-of-way. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff was traveling at an unreasonable and excessive rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of speed under all of the circumstances and that the plaintiff in fact caused the accident and injuries through her own negligence. The plaintiffs vehicle left forty-four feet of skid marks on the roadway, but there was no expert testimony that extrapolated the speed of the plaintiffs vehicle from the length of the skid marks. The plaintiff presented medical evidence in support of her claim that she was injured as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">During closing argument, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that the plaintiff was \u201csuit happy\u201d and was \u201clooking for a hand out.\u201d He asked the jury, as people who had to \u201cearn\u201d their \u201cwages,\u201d to \u201csend a message\u201d to \u201cstop this type of conduct.\u201d He urged the jury not to reward the plaintiff \u201cso that we won\u2019t have this type of activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict, which was granted by the trial court and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Our standard of review, where the trial court\u2019s action on a motion to set aside a verdict is challenged, is whether the trial court clearly abused its discretion. <em>Labatt </em>v. <em>Grunewald, </em>182 Conn. 236, 240, 438 A.2d 85 (1980). \u201cWhere, as in this case, the trial court disagrees with the verdict of the jury and there is an appeal . . . we review the action of the judge in setting the verdict aside rather than that of the jury in rendering it. . . . The decision to set aside a verdict is a matter within the broad legal discretion of the trial court and it will not be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Lee v. Lee, 171 Conn. 1, 2-3, 368 A.2d 11 (1976); see also <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>208 Conn. 21, 25, 543 A.2d 1331 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The court\u2019s action in setting aside a verdict is entitled to great weight because the trial judge can sense the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>atmosphere of a trial and \u201ccan apprehend far better than this court, limited to a printed record, what factors, if any, could have improperly influenced the jury.\u201d <em>Fronczek </em>v. <em>Della Bitta-Bassola, Inc., </em>165 Conn. 102, 104, 328 A.2d 680 (1973). \u201cEvery reasonable presumption should be indulged in favor of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s decision to set aside the verdict because a trial court is in a better position than an appellate court to determine whether a jury\u2019s verdict was improperly influenced.\u201d <em>Caciopoli </em>v. <em>Acampora, </em>30 Conn. App. 327, 330, 620 A.2d 191 (1993); <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>147 Conn. 719, 720, 158 A.2d 745 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The defendant first claims that he did not disobey the court\u2019s order with respect to testimony concerning the speed of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle and, in any event, his argument as to the vehicle\u2019s speed had a sufficient basis in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The trial court, in its memorandum of decision, found that the defense attorney persisted in \u201cimproper questioning and remarks concerning [the speed of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle] after the court had directly ordered him to terminate this type of examination.\u201d The court found that the only evidence with respect to speed was the eyewitness\u2019 testimony that the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle \u201cwas moving rather fast\u201d and that the witness \u201cfelt\u201d that the plaintiff was going faster than thirty-five miles an hour, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that her speed was no more than thirty-five miles per hour, the posted speed limit. The trial court stated: \u201cSince there was no expert testimony regarding speed, it was improper argument for counsel to tell the jury that they could determine speed on their own from skid marks and damage to vehicles. The comments of counsel regarding speed were flagrantly prejudicial to the plaintiff.\u201d The court stated in its memorandum of decision, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>respect to the issue of the vehicle\u2019s speed: \u201cFurthermore, after a recess that followed defense counsel\u2019s final argument, in the presence of the jury, he asked the court to instruct the jury that they should consider skid marks and the condition of the vehicles after the collision as evidence of speed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We turn first to the court\u2019s statement that the defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction was made in the presence of the jury. The defendant asserts that the transcript of the proceedings has been corrected to show that in fact that request for a jury instruction allowing the jury to consider skid marks and the condition of the vehicles as evidence of speed was made outside the presence of the jury. We accept the corrected transcript because the trial court granted the motion to correct the transcript to reflect the absence of the jury. We are, nevertheless, unpersuaded that that factual misstatement by the trial court, standing alone, invalidates the court\u2019s action in setting aside the verdict, especially in light of the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cany one\u201d of the claimed instances of misconduct would \u201crequire the court to set aside the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The defendant mounts a two-pronged attack on the court\u2019s findings with respect to the issue of the vehicle\u2019s speed. First, he asserts that defense counsel did not persist in improper questioning or remarks in derogation of the court\u2019s rulings. Second, he asserts that the court\u2019s rulings regarding speed and expert testimony were legally incorrect. The excerpts from closing argument that the defendant printed in his brief rebuts his first claim. After the plaintiff\u2019s attorney objected to defense counsel\u2019s argument with respect to the speed of the plaintiffs vehicle because there was \u201cno testimony here that the impact to these cars and the damage demonstrated the speed in excess of thirty-five,\u201d the court stated, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d The defense attorney then stated: \u201cThe jury has been shown repeat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>edly there\u2019s forty-four feet of skid marks. I said the testimony of Mr. Michaud was over thirty-five miles an hour.\u201d After a brief colloquy between plaintiff\u2019s counsel and defense counsel, the court ruled: \u201cObjection sustained. There has been no evidence by an expert accident reconstructionist as to speed based on skid marks and damage to vehicles. So objection sustained. Do not make that argument.\u201d Almost immediately thereafter, the defense counsel continued: \u201cThank you, Your Honor. There is forty-four feet of skid marks. You can consider these things which are normal common sense. Forty-four feet of skid marks before the impact. That\u2019s the evidence.\u201d This excerpt, printed by the defendant in support of his first contention, clearly shows that he did persist in arguing the skid mark evidence to the jury in derogation of the court\u2019s order. Because we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside the verdict because of the improper argument of defense counsel, it is not necessary to review the defendant\u2019s claim that he did not persist in improperly questioning witnesses as to speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">With respect to his second contention, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that a party may disregard a court\u2019s ruling and instructions as to evidence because he thinks that those rulings are incorrect. It is not necessary for us to determine whether in fact those rulings were incorrect because the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision stated that the defendant\u2019s <em>disregard </em>of the court\u2019s order was part of the basis for setting aside the verdict. It is axiomatic that parties may not disregard a trial court\u2019s rulings because they disagree with those rulings. Rather, the parties must abide by the trial court\u2019s rulings and preserve those issues for appellate review. To allow a party to disregard the rulings of the trial court that it believes are legally incorrect would invite chaos, undermine the authority and ability of the trial court to conduct trials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>in an orderly fashion, and would undermine the ability of an appellate court to review the trial court\u2019s action. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in basing its decision, in part, on the defendant\u2019s argument regarding the speed of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The defendant also claims that counsel\u2019s comments during closing argument were, under the circumstances, not so prejudicial as to deprive the plaintiff of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">It is undisputed that during closing argument counsel for the defendant said that the plaintiff was \u201csuit happy\u201d and was looking for a \u201chand out,\u201d that the jury should \u201csend a message to the public by not granting or rewarding dollars to this plaintiff so that we won\u2019t have this type of activity.\u201d \u201cWe say this type of lawsuit must stop.\u201d \u201cWe say this type of conduct must stop.\u201d \u201cAll of you have wages. You have to earn them. Please do not award her any damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">These comments in closing argument must be viewed in light of the lack of any evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was fraudulent, that she was a person who had brought many lawsuits or that she was looking for a \u201chand out.\u201d These comments plus the statement that the jurors had to \u201cearn\u201d their wages must also be viewed in light of the evidence before the jury that the plaintiff was a recipient of state assistance. It is difficult to imagine how the defense argument could be construed as anything other than an appeal to the jury to decide the case based on passion or prejudice, especially in view of the continuing public discourse over the cost of public assistance and the amount and type of litigation in our courts. It is well settled that the parties to a jury trial have a constitutional right to have the jury decide the issues between them. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Data Switch Corp., </em>231 Conn. 95, 101, 646 A.2d 852 (1994); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Donahue </em>v. <em>State, </em>27 Conn. App. 135, 140, 604 A.2d 1331 (1992). It is equally well settled that appeals to passion and prejudice have no place in our jury system. See <em>American National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schuss, </em>221 Conn. 768, 774, 607 A.2d 418 (1992); <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 206-207, 579 A.2d 69 (1990); <em>Bryar </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>152 Conn. 162, 164-65, 204 A.2d 831 (1964); <em>Creem </em>v. <em>Cicero, </em>12 Conn. App. 607, 610, 533 A.2d 234 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
