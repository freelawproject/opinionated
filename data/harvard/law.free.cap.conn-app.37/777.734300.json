The plaintiff is a licensed Connecticut real estate broker. On June 15, 1992, the plaintiff was convicted, after pleading guilty, in the United States District Court for the judicial district of Connecticut, of three counts of violating 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313 (a) and 5324 (3), which make it a felony to structure financial transactions so as to avoid federal reporting requirements. The crimes took place in 1987, during which time the plaintiff was a licensed real estate sales agent. As part of her plea, the plaintiff admitted that the purpose in structuring two monetary transactions was to avoid the federal reporting requirements for cash transactions in excess of $10,000. On July 23,1992, the commission received a certified copy of the notice of the plaintiff\u2019s conviction from the clerk of the United States District Court. The commission immediately notified the plaintiff, by certified mail, of the forfeiture of her license pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-323. The plaintiff thereafter requested a hearing for purposes of reconsideration of that forfeiture. On October 1,1992, the commission held a formal hearing to allow the plaintiff the opportunity to show cause why her license should not remain revoked. At the hearing, the plaintiff personally appeared and presented her resume, four letters of reference and her version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>what had transpired leading to her conviction. On November 25,1992, the plaintiff was notified by written decision of the revocation of her broker\u2019s license and notified of her right to appeal the decision pursuant to \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">As a preliminary matter, we must address the commission\u2019s claim that this appeal should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The commission claims that \u00a7 20-323 does not require a hearing prior to a forfeiture, and the fact that one was given does not create a contested case pursuant to \u00a7 4-166 (2),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, therefore, there is no right to appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The right to appeal from a decision of an administrative agency is created by statute. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Gaming Policy Board, </em>224 Conn. 693, 699, 620 A.2d 780 (1993). Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a), a person aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court. A final decision is defined as \u201cthe agency determination in a contested case.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A); <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Conn. 792, 802, 629 A.2d 367 (1993). A contested case is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2) as \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are <em>required by statute </em>to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . (Emphasis added.) No statutory right to appeal exists \u201cunless the commissioner was statutorily required to determine the plaintiff\u2019s legal right or privilege . . . in a hearing. . . .\u201d <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 802. If a hearing is not statutorily mandated, even if one is gratuitously held, a \u201ccontested case\u201d is not created. Id., 807-809; see also <em>Fraenza </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 386, 390, 655 A.2d 1113 (1994), aff'd, 232 Conn. 401, 655 A.2d 1112 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">It is not disputed that the plaintiff\u2019s license was revoked pursuant to \u00a7 20-323, and that the provisions of that section are of a summary nature relieving the commissioner of the obligation to conduct a hearing upon notice of conviction of a crime as enumerated in subdivision (8) of \u00a7 20-320 or conviction of an offense like those enumerated. The plaintiff argues, however, that this does not eliminate the necessity for a hearing. She argues that once a revocation under \u00a7 20-323 occurs, the notice of automatic forfeiture to the licensee gives her the right to request a hearing, which is mandated, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c). We do not agree that the provisions of \u00a7 4-182 (c) create a requirement that the commission hold a hearing. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 4-182 requires notice by mail giving the licensee the facts or conduct warranting the action proposed, and gives that licensee \u201can opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for dhe retention of the license.\u201d This section of our statutes clearly deals with a situation in which a revocation, suspension, annulment or withdrawal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>any license is contemplated. The opportunity for a showing of compliance may be by conference or otherwise and does not constitute a hearing. Such cannot be found to create a \u201ccontested case.\u201d We agree with the trial court that General Statutes \u00a7 20-323 requires an automatic revocation of a real estate license under these facts and that the revocation is summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">While a \u00a7 4-182 (c) compliance conference generally satisfies the requirements of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), most agencies have statutory mandates that supersede it. General Statutes \u00a7 20-321 provides that \u201c[b]efore . . . revoking any license . . . the Real Estate Commission shall give notice and afford opportunity for hearing as provided in the regulations established by the commissioner of consumer protection.\u201d This section does not provide for a hearing when the commission invokes \u00a7 20-323. \u201c \u2018In construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u2019 \u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 332-33, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987). Section 20-321 requires a hearing <em>before </em>the revocation of any license, but does not apply to \u00a7 20-323 and the automatic nature of the forfeiture contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Because \u00a7 4-166 (2) limits \u201ccontested case status to proceedings in which an agency is <em>required by statute </em>to provide an opportunity for a hearing to determine a party\u2019s legal rights or privileges\u201d; (emphasis in original) <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 811; and because \u00a7 20-323 does not mandate a hearing, we conclude that no contested case existed. Therefore, there was no final decision from which the plaintiff had a right to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal after review of the merits is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the superior court as provided in this section. The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to the filing of such an appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 20-323, as amended by 1991 Public Acts, No. 91-229, \u00a7 13, provides: \u201cAny licensee or certification holder convicted of a violation of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision] (8) of section 20-320 [as amended by No. 91-229, \u00a7 11, of the 1991 Public Acts] shall incur a forfeiture of his license or certification and all moneys that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>have been paid therefor.

App. 417, 420, 635 A.2d 1241 (1994). This court does have jurisdiction, however, to review decisions of the Superior Court and administrative bodies to determine whether they had jurisdiction. <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 431, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995). In this case, we must first decide if the real estate commission had jurisdiction to revoke summarily the plaintiff\u2019s license under General Statutes \u00a7 20-323. The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 20-323 does not apply because (1) she was convicted in a federal, not a state, court and (2) the federal crimes that she committed were not offenses \u201clike\u201d those enumerated in \u00a7 20-320. We conclude that the commission had jurisdiction in this case because \u00a7 20-323 refers to the \u201coffenses enumerated in subdivision] (8)\u201d of \u00a7 20-320 and not to the court in which the licensee was convicted, and that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313 (a) and 5324 (3) were offenses like those enumerated in \u00a7 20-320 because fraud or dishonesty in money matters is common to the enumerated crimes and the plaintiff\u2019s crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
