The defendant asserts that the language of \u00a7 54-94a is broad enough to encompass his claim that the defendant\u2019s statement is \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He asserts that, alternatively, we do have jurisdiction to hear his appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4003 or pursuant to our supervisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We conclude that neither \u00a7 54-94a nor \u00a7 4003 implicates our subject matter jurisdiction. We will not consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal, however, because it does not fit within the framework of \u00a7 54-94a, meet the requirements of \u00a7 4003 or present an appropriate occasion for the exercise of our supervisory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The following facts were made a part of the record by the state at the time the defendant entered his conditional plea of nolo contendere. The defendant was arrested on drug charges in early 1992. After the arrest, he was recruited as a confidential informant by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the Norwalk police department. He told the police that Tim Lee was involved in marijuana trafficking, and, during the course of the investigation, he arranged to purchase marijuana from Lee. That transaction was observed by an officer of the Norwalk police department but, unbeknownst to the Norwalk police, the defendant also arranged to sell cocaine to Lee. On a later date, the defendant killed Lee during an argument over the defendant\u2019s failure to deliver cocaine or to return Lee\u2019s money. On October 21 and 22,1992, after the defendant was arrested on other charges, he confessed to the murder of Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defendant moved to suppress the October 21 statement on the grounds that (1) he had not waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and (2) the statement was taken in violation of his right to a prompt arraignment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-lc.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the same motion, the defendant moved to suppress the October 22 statement on the grounds that (1) the statement was the fruit of the illegal October 21 interrogation, and (2) the statement was taken in violation of his right to counsel pursuant to the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. The defendant then entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of murder with the agreement of the state and the approval of the court. The defendant expressly conditioned his plea on the right to vacate it if his appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>to suppress was \u201csuccessful on <em>either </em>or both\u201d of the statements. (Emphasis added.) The trial court and the parties expressed some reservations as to whether the defendant\u2019s claims fit within the language of \u00a7 54-94a that allows a conditional plea and appeal \u201cwhere there has been a denial of a motion to suppress based on the <em>involuntariness </em>of a statement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court and the parties opined that the defendant\u2019s claims appeared to be suitable for review pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory authority even if they were not within the purview of \u00a7 54-94a. After the appeal was filed, the Supreme Court transferred the case to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The threshold issue before us on appeal is whether this court has subject matter jurisdiction. The state asserts that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a because the statute permits a conditional plea of nolo contendere and appeal only when the motion to suppress a statement is based on a claim of involuntariness. The state also asserts that \u00a7 4003 improperly attempts to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the appellate courts by rule. We disagree with the state\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Despite the defendant\u2019s frustration over the state\u2019s now challenging a plea to which it agreed in the trial court, it is axiomatic that whenever the question of subject matter jurisdiction is raised, the court must address it before proceeding further. <em>Sadloski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>228 Conn. 79, 84, 634 A.2d 888 (1994); <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 429, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). It is also axiomatic that the parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court by agreement. <em>Sadloski </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Manchester, </em>supra, 84; <em>Neri </em>v. <em>Neri, </em>35 Conn. App. 812, 817, 647 A.2d 1, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 916, 648 A.2d 154 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it .... A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it ... . Jurisdiction involves the power in a court to hear and determine the cause of action presented to it and its source is the constitutional and statutory provisions by which it is created.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>222 Conn. 299, 304-305, 610 A.2d 1147 (1992); <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>202 Conn. 93, 101, 520 A.2d 155 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The power to hear appeals in criminal cases is conferred by General Statutes \u00a7 54-95.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 54-95, appellate criminal jurisdiction lies where there is an appeal from a final judgment. The thirty year sentence that was imposed on the defendant here constituted a final judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 339, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>32 Conn. App. 724, 731, 630 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 903, 634 A.2d 297 (1993). This court is competent to entertain this action because appellate courts routinely review appeals that challenge trial courts\u2019 denials of motions to suppress statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">When viewed in light of the definition of subject matter jurisdiction and the statutes that create such jurisdiction, it becomes clear that \u00a7 54-94a neither confers nor curtails appellate subject matter jurisdiction. What \u00a7 54-94a does is abrogate, in certain circumstances, the waiver of constitutional rights that is implicit in a guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>or nolo contendere plea. \u201cAs a general rule, an unconditional plea of guilty . . . intelligently and voluntarily made, operates as a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Niblack, </em>220 Conn. 270, 276, 596 A.2d 407 (1991); see also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>27 Conn. App. 675, 683-84, 610 A.2d 1305, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 909, 612 A.2d 57 (1992), citing <em>Tollett </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S. Ct. 1602, 36 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1973). Section 54-94a clearly states its purpose in its concluding sentence: \u201cA plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall <em>not </em>constitute a waiver by the defendant of non-jurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In referring to \u00a7 54-94a, our Supreme Court has said: \u201cThe legislature in 1982 <em>altered </em>the broad waiver of constitutional rights implicit in a plea of guilty or nolo contendere . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 98, 503 A.2d 136 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 374-75, 521 A.2d 547 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In enacting \u00a7 54-94a, the legislature created a new, expedited route to the appellate courts but it did not create a new jurisdictional doorway into those courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 54-94a is intended to promote judicial economy by allowing the parties to litigate a suppression or dismissal issue fully in the trial court, and thereafter allowing the defendant to obtain review of an adverse ruling without the parties\u2019 or the court\u2019s expending additional resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The state posits the issue as one of subject matter jurisdiction, but we conclude that the only question pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sented with respect to \u00a7 54-94a is whether the defendant has satisfied its predicate requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In order to utilize the benefits of \u00a7 54-94a, a defendant\u2019s claim must fall within the purview of the statute. Specifically, the motion to suppress must challenge the voluntariness of the statement. The defendant asserts that his motion to suppress, which challenged the admission of the statements because they were made without the benefit of counsel, is a claim that is within the statute. He argues that the legal concept of \u201cvoluntariness\u201d encompasses claims of both self-incrimination and right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The defendant relies on an attorney\u2019s statement to the joint committee on the judiciary<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in support of his contention that \u00a7 54-94a was intended to include statements taken in violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel. While we <em>may </em>look at testimony and legislative history to determine legislative intent \u201cwhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 430, 650 A.2d 557 (1994); <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Having examined the statute, we conclude that the language is plain and unambiguous. Section 54-94a clearly enumerates the instances wherein a defendant has a right to take an appeal after entering a conditional plea of nolo contendere. Section 54-94a provides that a defendant may \u201cappeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure, motion to suppress statements and evidence based on the <em>involuntariness of a statement </em>or motion to dismiss . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In accordance with the canons of statutory construction, we conclude that the legislature intended to grant a defendant an expedited appeal only in the three prescribed circumstances. Had the legislature intended to include uncounseled statements, such a provision would have been enumerated along with the other instances. There is nothing in the language of the statute that indicates that the word \u201cvoluntariness\u201d is meant to include claims of right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The defendant fails to cite any precedent in which our courts have held that a motion to suppress an uncounseled statement met the requirements set forth in \u00a7 54-94a. Nor has he cited any cases for the proposition that a statement that is made in the absence of counsel is involuntary per se. Our courts have held that in order for a defendant to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a the conditions therein must be satisfied, and the court will not liberally construe those requirements. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 375-76. We, therefore, decline to read \u00a7 54-94a in the expansive fashion urged by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The defendant relies in the alternative on \u00a7 4003 (b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which allows a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere with a reservation of \u201cthe right, on appeal from the judgment, to review of the adverse determination of <em>any </em>motion made prior to the close of evidence . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) The state asserts that Practice Book \u00a7 4003 purports to confer subject matter jurisdiction on this court contrary to the dictates of \u00a7 54-94a. In support of this assertion, the state cites <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 646 A.2d 126 (1994), for the proposition that appellate subject matter jurisdiction is created by statute, not rule of practice. We have no quarrel with that proposition; it simply does not apply here. Section 54-94a does not implicate the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction for the reasons discussed in part I of this opinion, and \u00a7 4003 simply makes further inroads on the court-made waiver rule that applies where there has been an <em>unconditional </em>plea of guilty or nolo contendere.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The rule increases the number of situations wherein an appeal can be taken without the necessity for a full trial. This is consistent with the notions of judicial economy that underpin \u00a7 54-94a. Section 4003 also answers the concerns expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 92. The <em>Madera </em>court noted that the conditional nolo contendere plea could be abused if not limited to dispositive matters. The court also stated that the trial courts should not \u201cemploy this procedural innovation except in situations plainly within the provisions of \u00a7 54-94a\u201d until <em>a rule </em>was furnished to prevent abuse. Id., 102. Section 4003 provides such a rule to expedite appeals within the framework of the appellate courts\u2019 existing subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ter jurisdiction and builds in these safeguards against abuse: (1) court approval of a conditional plea, (2) a determination by the court of whether an adverse determination of the motion would have a \u201csignificant impact on the disposition of the case,\u201d and (3) a determination by the trial court of whether the record is adequate for appellate review. General Statutes \u00a7 51-14 (a) recognizes that the rule-making power of the appellate courts is \u201cfor the purpose of simplifying proceedings in the courts and of promoting the speedy and efficient determination of litigation upon its merits. . . .\u201d Section 4003 fulfills those purposes without in any way purporting to enlarge subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The defendant\u2019s claims cannot be reviewed pursuant to \u00a7 4003 (b) because the rule provides that the judgment shall be set aside only if the defendant <em>prevails </em>on appeal. The defendant expressly conditioned his plea on the right to withdraw it if he should prevail as to <em>either </em>or both of the challenged statements. Partial success by the defendant is outside the contemplation and spirit of the rule. It would, in effect, modify the word \u201cprevails\u201d in the rule to \u201cprevails in part.\u201d Such an interpretation would run counter to, rather than advance the interests of, judicial economy and efficiency by allowing piecemeal appeals. If the defendant prevailed as to only one of the challenged statements, he could then withdraw his plea, go to trial and, if convicted, appeal again. An appellate court might then have to review this matter again on appeal, and the trial court would have had a full trial \u2014 exactly what the rule was designed to eliminate. This scenario is the antithesis of judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant\u2019s appeal does not properly fit within \u00a7 4003 (b) because of his reservation of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>vacate his plea even if he does not prevail.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The defendant lastly asserts that a refusal by this court to review his appeal pursuant to our supervisory authority will <em>\u201coverrule </em>the Supreme Court case of <em>State </em>v. Chung, [202 Conn. 39, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987)].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>supra, 39, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere in the trial court with the agreement of the state and the approval of the trial judge. The defendant, thereafter, appealed from the judgment of conviction and claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress certain statements elicited from him. The version of \u00a7 54-94a in effect in <em>Chung </em>did not include the denial of a motion to suppress statements among the matters subject to a conditional nolo contendere plea.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court stated that although the case was not within the ambit of \u00a7 54-94a, \u201cthis case is an appropriate situation for this court to exercise its inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice to review the issue preserved by the defendant.\u201d Id., 44. The court went on to say: \u201cThe admissibility of the defendant\u2019s confession is the sole question presented to this court and it properly can be reviewed on the record available.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Supervisory authority is a necessary adjunct of appellate jurisdiction that is used \u201cto facilitate business and advance justice.\u201d <em>O\u2019Bymackow </em>v. <em>O'Bymachow, </em>10 Conn. App. 76, 78, 521 A.2d 599 (1987). We do not read <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 39, as <em>mandating </em>that we review appeals that fail to satisfy \u00a7 54-94a or \u00a7 4003 pursuant to our supervisory authority because the parties agreed in the trial court that we should do so. The defendant\u2019s assertion of a right to review pursuant to our supervisory authority is particularly inappropriate because his plea does not conform to \u00a7 4003 (b) as discussed in part III of this opinion. The court\u2019s supervisory power \u201cdoes not allow litigants to circumvent other rules of practice designed to promote judicial efficiency and justice.\u201d <em>North Park Mortgage Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pinette, </em>27 Conn. App. 628, 633, 608 A.2d 714 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Our Supreme Court stated in <em>Chung: </em>\u201cMoreover, to force <em>this </em>defendant to go through an entire trial to preserve the right to appeal the pretrial ruling, under the facts of this case, would be a waste of judicial time and resources.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 45. The emphasis on \u201cthis\u201d defendant strongly suggests that <em>Chung </em>is limited to its facts. The case law also demonstrates the court\u2019s reluctance to extend the scope of \u00a7 54-94a beyond the three instances enumerated in the statute. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 98, the Supreme Court refused to review an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a that challenged the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress a confession because the statute did not then include such a motion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court cautioned that \u201c[t]he conditional plea is susceptible to abuse . . . unless its use is carefully limited to significant issues the determination of which on appeal is likely to be dispositive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of the case.\u201d Id., 101. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 376-80, the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 54-94a requires that a nolo contendere plea be made <em>expressly </em>conditional on the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We no.te also that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>206 Conn. 323, 537 A.2d 483 (1988), the Supreme Court refused to exercise its supervisory authority to review a juvenile transfer matter that was outside the ambit of \u00a7 54-94a. The language of <em>Chung </em>and the refusal of the Supreme Court to review the claims in <em>Kelly </em>counsel us to use our supervisory power only in appropriate circumstances. For the reasons stated in part II of this opinion, this case does not present such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The trial court improperly accepted the plea of nolo contendere because the condition could not be fulfilled under our procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-16\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides: \u201cconditional nolo contendere PLEA.
