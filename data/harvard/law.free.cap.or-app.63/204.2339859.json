He seeks a new trial on the ground that, based on the evidence, the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the fact that \u201cDarvocet 100\u201d is a \u201ccontrolled substance.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">At trial, the state proceeded on the theory that defendant had ingested a controlled substance along with alcohol. Defendant testified that he was taking \u201cDarvocet-100.\u201d The state asked the court to take judicial notice of the fact that <em>Darvocet-N-100 </em>is a controlled substance within the meaning of ORS 487.540. The court did so. Defendant contends that, because there is no evidence that he was taking <em>DarvocetN-100, </em>there was nothing before the jury linking him to the drug <em>Darvocet-N-100, </em>and, therefore, the question whether <em>Darvocet-N-100 </em>is a controlled substance was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">OEC 201(b) reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201cA judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to <em>reasonable </em>dispute in that it is * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">a* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\u201c(2) Capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">The rule permits a trial court to take judicial notice of facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute because they are capable of accurate verification. The rule takes the facts noticed out of the adversary process and treats them as given facts. Simply stated, it is a short cut to introduce undisputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Defendant agrees that <em>Darvocet-N-100 </em>is a controlled substance and that that fact is subject to judicial notice. Defendant\u2019s argument is simply that there is no evidence that <em>Darvocet-N-100 </em>was the specific drug he used and, therefore, it was not proper for it to be judicially noticed. Defendant\u2019s contention appears to rest on an assumption that there are two different Darvocet-100s: Darvocet-100, the substance he admits ingesting, and <em>Darvocet-N-100.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Here, in support of its request for judicial notice, the state offered the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (PDR) as source material. Defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the PDR. The PDR describes the medical properties of Darvocet and contains other pertinent information about the Darvocet line. \u201cDarvocet\u201d is not a generic name, such as, for example, codeine. It is a registered trademark of the Eli Lilly Company. The PDR lists only that company as a manufacturer of Darvocet. Furthermore, Lilly manufactures only <em>two </em>types of Darvocet tablets: Darvocet-N-50 and <em>Darvocet-N-100.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">We hold that the trial court\u2019s taking judicial notice that <em>Darvocet-N-100 </em>is a controlled substance fulfilled the requirements of OEC 201(b) and that the fact that the drug is a controlled substance is relevant in this case. Because defendant has not challenged the accuracy of the PDR, its accuracy must be assumed in evaluating defendant\u2019s claim on review. If defendant\u2019s doctor prescribed a Darvocet tablet, it necessarily was either Darvocet-N-50 or <em>Darvocet-N-100. </em>Those are the only drugs carrying the registered trademark name of \u201cDarvocet.\u201d Defendant testified that he was ingesting Darvocet-100. By a process of elimination, therefore, defendant\u2019s description of Darvocet-100 had to be a reference to <em>DarvocetN-100. </em>There is only one rational conclusion to be drawn from an examination of the PDR in conjunction with defendant\u2019s testimony. Defendant was referring to <em>Darvocet-N-100 </em>when he said \u201cDarvocet-100.\u201d Thus, taking judicial notice was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"><em> </em>In this consolidated trial, defendant was also convicted of driving while suspended. However, defendant does not challenge any aspect of that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
