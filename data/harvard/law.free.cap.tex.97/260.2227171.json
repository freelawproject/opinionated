Such evidence only tends to unduly prejudice the witness. Gulf C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, 83 Texas, 633; Fire Ins. Co. v. Faires, 13 Texas Civ. App., 111; Boon v.

App., 620; 1 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 461.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-13\">Even if it were competent in the trial of a civil case to impeach a witness by proving specific acts, which, however, is not admitted, still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the evidence tending to prove such acts must be the best evidence to be obtained, and not secondary evidence, and in this case the best evidence as to the conviction and sentence of the witness would be the judgments thereof, and no satisfactory reason is given for the nonproduction of the same.

Rep., 372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">If it was competent to show that this witness had been confined in the penitentiary, still a certified copy of the record kept by the penitentiary officials was the best evidence thereof, which was not produced, and in the absence of the same plaintiff should not have been permitted to show by oral evidence what was contained in the records.

Mitchell, 22 Texas, 293.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">It is incompetent in the trial of a civil case to impeach a witness upon an immaterial issue, and it was an immaterial issue in this case as to whether or not George Downs had ever been in the penitentiary.

This rule is applicable to both civil and criminal practice alike. The common law practice, in its application to the rules of evidence, is made mandatory by the statutes of Texas, in both civil and criminal cases when not in conflict with the code. Rev. Stats. (1895), art. 2299; Code of Crim. Proc. (1895), arts. 763, 764; Texas <em>&amp; </em>P. Coal Co. v. Lawson, 10 Texas Civ. App., 491; Ingersol v. McWillie, 30 S. W. Rep., 60; Linz v.

It was competent, however, for all purposes as to the matter of impeachment. Cases above cited, and Evans v. Martin, 6 Texas Civ. App., 336; Byers v. Wallace, 87 Texas, 503; Red River Cattle Co. v.

Goode v. State, 32 Texas Crim. App., 505.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-7\">BROWN, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Avu\">This is a certified question from the Court of Civil Appeals for the First Supreme Judicial District. The statement and questions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201cAppellee, who is a minor, brought this suit against the appellant by her next friend to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been inflicted upon her through appellant\u2019s negligence. The petition alleges in substance that on or about July 1, 1894, while plaintiff, who was then an infant about three months old, was lying in her cradle in her home near the railroad track of defendant in the city of Houston, said cradle and the covering thereon was set on fire by sparks emitted from a passing engine operated by defendant over its said railroad, and said fire was communicated to the clothing and person of plaintiff and she was thereby painfully and severely burned and injured. It is further alleged that said engine was equipped with defective appliances to prevent the escape of sparks and was operated in an improper and careless manner, and that the injury to plaintiff was due to the negligence of defendant in failing to properly equip said engine and in operating same in a careless manner. -</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201cThe defendant answered by a general demurrer and general denial. The cause was tried by a jury in the court below and resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201cOne of the material issues raised by the evidence was whether the fire by which plaintiff was burned originated from sparks emitted by defendant\u2019s engine or from a burning cigar which plaintiff\u2019s father, W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>T. Johnson, was smoking in the room in which plaintiff was lying when her clothing became ignited. TJpon this issue the evidence was sharply conflicting, W. T. Johnson and other witnesses \u2022 for plaintiff testifying that he was not smoking in plaintiff\u2019s room at or near the time the fire was discovered. Several witnesses for the defendant contradicted this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201cGeorge Downs was one of defendant\u2019s witnesses who testified to the effect that just before the fire was discovered in plaintiff\u2019s clothing he saw W. T. Johnson sitting in the window near plaintiff\u2019s cradle smoking a cigar. On cross-examination this witness was asked where he was on certain days in the months of January, March and April, 1894, and in reply stated he was in or near the city of Houston on the several dates named. He was then asked if he had ever been in the penitentiary, and replied that he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of impeaching this witness plaintiff introduced, over the objection of the defendant, the testimony of J. S. Rice, who stated that he was the superintendent of the State penitentiary at Huntsville and had charge of the records of that institution, and attached to his deposition a certificate purporting to contain a copy of said prison records as the same related to a convict named George Downs. This certificate shows that an inmate of the penitentiary named George Downs was convicted in the District Court of Hardin County, at the March term, 1893, of theft of property over the value of $20, and was sentenced by said court on 3d day of March, 1893, to two years confinement in the penitentiary; and that he was received in the penitentiary on the 12th of April, 1893, and served there for one year and fourteen days, having been pardoned in April, 1894. Plaintiff then proved by Julia Downs, mother of the witness, George Downs, that said witness was the George Downs mentioned in the certificate attached to the testimony of the witness Bice.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u201cTo the introduction of this testimony the defendant, as shown by the bill of exceptions appearing in the record, made the following objections: \"To all of which questions the defendant objected, it appearing that the purpose of said testimony was simply to impeach said witness George Downs, who had testified in this case on behalf of the defendant, and who had said, in response to a question propounded to him by plaintiff herein, that he had not been in the penitentiary.. The defendant therefore objected to the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff by J. S. Bice, for the reason that such was not the proper way to prove that a man had been convicted for a crime. The same was secondary evidence, and was not the best evidence of such conviction, and further that the law required penitentiary officials to keep a record of the men confined in said penitentiary, and therefore that a certified copy of such record should be produced and not a statement from a witness as to what such record contained. That same was secondary evidence, and further, because it was not shown that the witness was the keeper of the prison records, and for the further reason that this was an attempt to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the witness George Downs upon an immaterial issue, and that he could not be impeached in the trial of a civil case by showing that he had been confined in prison.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u201cIt was not shown by any other evidence in the case that George Downs had ever been in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201cHpon the foregoing statement we respectfully certify for your de-. cisi\u00f3n the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u201cDid the trial court err in refusing to sustain defendant\u2019s objection to the testimony of the witness Rice?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u201cIn event the court should hold that the testimony was inadmissible upon the ground that it was not the best evidence of the fact sought to be proven, we ask, in view of another trial, that the question of whether the- fact that the witness had been in the penitentiary was admissible for the purpose of impeaching his character, be also answered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">We answer that the trial court erred in not sustaining the defendant\u2019s objections to the evidence of the witness Rice. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel had no right to ask the witness Downs if he had been in the penitentiary, and after receiving a negative answer, to contradict the witness by proving that he had been confined in the penitentiary. If such question be asked, the answer must be accepted as final. People v. McKeller, <em>53 </em>Cal., 65; Lawrence v. Barker, 5 Wend., 305; Hart v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 233; Hill v. State, 18 Texas Crim App., 673; 1 Greenl. Ev., sec. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">\u201cWhether the fact that the witness had been in the penitentiary was admissible for the purpose of impeaching his character\u201d has not arisen in this case. It is an abstract question which may never arise and we have no authority to answer it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
