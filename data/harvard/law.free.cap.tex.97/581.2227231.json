In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>parting with title to the fee in a strip extending entirely across an inclosure, that which was formerly a single tract of land became three tracts. The railroad company\u2019s title, at least as between the parties to this suit, is as absolute as the title of an individual who had by purchase acquired the same land of the owner. This title of the railroad company necessarily carries with it all the rights of ownership. It can give it away, sell it, separate it from the two tracts of which it was formerly a part by any barriers it might choose to erect. Plaintiff retained no interest whatever in the land. He voluntarily parted with every right he had in:it when he made the conveyance, for a consideration which he deemed adequate. The right to drive his stock across this strip existed only in so far and in such manner as the railroad company might see fit to grant it. The fact that the company built its right of way along this strip could add nothing to the rights of plaintiff and could take nothing from the rights of defendant, which were determined by the conveyance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b600-5\"><em>M.

It has during all the time complained of had its right of way fenced entirely across this strip on each side, but in this right-of-way fence has erected and maintains gates, affording appellee ingress and egress to his land upon each side of the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">\u201cBy proper assignments of error and propositions, the appellant presents the question whether the provisions of articles 4523, 4524, 4525, 4526 and 4527 apply in cases where the railroad company has not condemned its right of way, but owns the land under a proper conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">\u201cIn view of the fact that the jurisdiction of this court is final in this .case, and of the importance of the question involved under the foregoing facts, the Court of Civil Appeals of said district certifies to the Supreme Court the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">\u201cDo the articles of the statute above referred to apply to a case where a railroad is constructed through an inclosure where the railroad com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>pany obtained title by conveyance to the land on which the railroad is constructed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\u201cAs possibly bearing upon the question certified, we respectfully refer to the opinion in the case of Calcasieu Lumber Co. v. Harris, 77 Texas, 18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The question is answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In Houston E. &amp; W. T. Ry. Co. v. Adams, 63 Texas, 200, the railroad company had acquired for its road the fee to a strip of land through plaintiff\u2019s inclosure and had, in construction, entered such inclosure, opening the fences, and not making cattle-guards at such openings nor fencing in its right of way. The plaintiff sought, among other things, to recover damages for the depredations of stock entering through the openings. It was held that the statute in question applied and made it the duty of the railroad company to construct cattle-guards, notwithstanding its ownership of the fee of the land on which it built and operated its road. The only difference between that case and this is, that in one there were and in the other there were not fences built along the margins of the right of way. Obviously that makes no difference as to the application of the statute. If the statute applied, it imposed the duty of providing cattle-guards and the company could not substitute something else. There is no good reason why the duty should not exist where the company owns the land which it uses as well as where it has only acquired a right of way. An entrance into an inclosure exposes it to stock as much in one case as in the other, and fences, which the company would be at liberty to erect in either case (Eev. Stats., arts. 4527, 4528), would afford equal protection in both. The language of the statute, without exception, imposes the duty whenever a railroad \u201cpasses through a field or inclosure,\u201d and no reason exists for taking such cases as this out of its operation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
