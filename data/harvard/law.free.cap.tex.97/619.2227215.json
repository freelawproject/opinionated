The testimony shows, - that, if appellant was guilty of negligence in leaving its cars an unreasonable length of time across the street, appellees were guilty of contributory negligence causing and contributing to the injuries received by Mary Kelly by attempting, at the time and in the manner and under the circumstances, to 'drive across appellant\u2019s tracks outside of the street, around .the end of the cars.

The appellees applied for a writ of error, and in order to give us jurisdiction alleged in their petition for the writ of error that the decision of the appellate court \u201cpractically settled the case.\u201d We concurred in that view and as a matter of course granted the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">We are of the opinion that the Court of Civil Appeals correctly decided that there could be no recovery under the facts proved upon the trial, and deem it unnecessary to add anything to the opinion of Mr. Justice Fly, which was delivered upon the disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Such being our conclusion, the statute makes it our duty to affirm the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals in so far as it reverses the judgment of the District Court, and render here a judgment in favor of defendant in error. It is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">\n<em>Affirmed and judgment rendered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
