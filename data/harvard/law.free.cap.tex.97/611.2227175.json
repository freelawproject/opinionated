It having been shown by the evidence that each of the companies owning the several lines constituting the through route from'Winnsb oro, Texas, to Geneva, Ga., was acting for itself, and that the tickets of the plaintiff and his wife with the coupons attached constituted with each of such companies a separate contract, the charge of the court was erroneous in making the appellant liable for such injuries as resulted from the negligence of the carriers other than the appellant.

At most, such negligence but concurred with the previous negligence of the appellant in prolonging their suffering. Gonzales v. City of Galveston, 84 Texas, 7; 1 Shearm. &amp; Redf. on Neg., sec. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-6\">It is not necessary in order to make out a case of concurring negligence that the wrongdoers should act in concert. The negligent acts of the wrongdoers may be several, distinct and independent, but if they concur in producing an injury, each wrongdoer is liable for the whole injury. Pugh v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co., 101 Ky., 77, 72 Am. St. Rep.) 392; Stone v. Dickinson, 5 Allen, 29, 81 Am. Dec., 727; Flaherty v. Minneapolis &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., 39 Minn., 328, 12 Am. St. Rep., 654.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-7\">There was causal connection between the suffering of appellee and his wife on the appellant\u2019s line and on the lines of the connecting carriers, viz., the use of the coach which was not supplied with adequate heating appliances and which was out of order, and which was used in carrying appellee and his wife by provision of appellant alone, or by previous agreement and concert between appellant and the connecting carriers; wherefore appellant is liable for the whole injury. Gonzales v. City of Galveston, 84 Texas, 7; Railway Co. v. McWhirter, 77 Texas, 360; Seale v. Railway Co., 65 Texas, 274; Carterville v. Cook, 129 Ill., 155, 16 Am. St. Rep., 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-8\">The appellant can not escape from the consequences of its negligence by saying that if the connecting carrier had done its duty appellee and his wife would have ceased to suffer from the effects of appellant\u2019s negligence. Having negligently created the conditions which exposed them to injury, it was a duty personal to appellant to do what was necessary to relieve them from the effect of such negligence. Gonzales v. Galveston, 84 Texas, 7; Railway Co. v. Sweeney, 6 Texas Civ. App., 178; Railway Co. v. Musette, 7 Texas Civ. App., 179.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b631-9\">The appellant having put appellee and his wife in a coach which could not be heated, expecting them to travel therein to the end of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>journey, can not claim that it could not have foreseen that they would continue to suffer after the coach was turned over to the connecting carrier. Besides, that they would so suffer was the natural, reasonable and probable result of the negligence of appellant in starting them on their journey in such a coach, and the appellant is liable without regard to whether or not it, in fact, anticipated the actual result which followed. The damages claimed are not, therefore, too remote to be recovered. Gonzales v. Galveston, 84 Texas, 7; Eames v. Railway Co., 63 Texas, 664; Jones v. George, 61 Texas, 351; Suth. on.Dam., 3 ed., sec. 37, p. 113; sec. 38, p. 116.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-5\">The evidence raised the issue that the suffering endured by appellee and his wife after appellant delivered the coach they were in to the connecting carrier was due in part to the negligence of appellant in starting and continuing them on their journey in a coach which could not be heated, and in part to the negligence of connecting carriers in not discovering the condition of the coach, and in failing to provide a comfortable car. This issue was correctly submitted, -in general terms, in the main charge; and since the appellant did not request more specific instructions, the main charge must be held sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-6\">If the charge of the court assumed that prior negligence of appellant brought about or in any measure induced the subsequent negligence of the connecting carrier, such assumption was not error, because the uncontradicted evidence shows that the steam pipes for heating the car were burst when the appellee entered the car, and when appellant started it on its journey, and when appellant delivered it to the connecting carrier, and when this car reached Meridian, Miss. McFadden v. Sehill, 84 Texas, 79; Wright v. Hardie, 30 S. W. Rep., 676.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-7\">That part of the court\u2019s charge complained of in appellant\u2019s fourth proposition under its first assignment, viz., \u201cThat if appellant furnished appellee and his wife a reasonably comfortable car to ride in from Winnsboro to Shreveport, then it performed all the duty it owed appellee, and if you so believe you will find for defendant,\u201d is in direct response to the pleading and the evidence, submits a defense made by appellant\u2019s pleading and supported by some evidence, and it is in fact and in law a correct statement of the law applicable to the facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-8\">The entire charge of the court must be considered- and construed together, and that part of the charge complained of in appellant\u2019s fourth proposition under its first assignment of error, when considered in connection with the preceding paragraphs of the charge, is an absolutely correct statement of the law applicable to the case. Kauffman v. Babcock, 67 Texas, 244; Brackett v. Hinsdale, 2 U. C., 468; Moore v. Moore, 73 Texas, 382; Railway Co. v. Matula, 79 Texas, 581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b632-9\">In this case the slightest degree of care would have disclosed to appellant\u2019s servants that the car was out of order,'that the steam pipes were burst, and that the car was not warmed. If there was, abstractly considered, error in that part of the court\u2019s charge complained of, in that it did not state that appellant was exempt if it used a high degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of care to provide a comfortable coach, that error was harmless. The charge 'complained of does not state that appellant is liable if it did not furnish a coach reasonably warm and comfortable. Loper v. Robinson, 54 Texas, 510; Houston E. &amp; W. T. Ry. Co. v. Hardy, 61 Texas, 230; Blum v. Light, 81 Texas, 421; Gas Co. v. Robertson, 55 S. W. Rep., 347.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b633-5\">GAINES, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq_q\">This suit was brought by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error to recover damages for the discomfort and sickness of himself and of his wife alleged to have been caused by the failure to make comfortably warm the car in which they were being carried as passengers under a contract with the defendant company. The plaintiff recovered a judgment which upon appeal was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The plaintiff, in the month of December, 1901, bought of the defendant\u2019s agent, at the town of Winnsboro, Texas, round-trip tickets for himself and wife over the defendant\u2019s road and its connecting lines to the town of Geneva, in Georgia. On the afternoon of the 24th day of the month they accordingly took passage at Winnsboro on the train of the defendant company for their destination under the contract. About nightfall of that same day they reached Shreveport, the end of the defendant\u2019s line. The car on which they took passage and were being carried was there transferred to the next connecting carrier, and they proceeded in the same car in a continuous journey to Meridian, Miss., where it was dropped out and they were transferred to another. So far the evidence is not disputed. But as to the condition of the car with respect to its warmth from the time it left Winnsboro until its arrival at Shreveport, the testimony is sharply conflicting. Neither is the testimony in accord as to its condition after leaving Shreveport, though there was much testimony tending to show that during the night after leaving that place it became quite cold and that there was no attempt except on the part of the passengers to heat it. The plaintiff and his wife each testified in effect that they suffered from the cold from the time they left Winnsboro until they reached Meridian, and that by reason of the exposure they were made seriously sick.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">There was evidence tending to show that the car contained a stove and also pipes, presumably originally provided for the purpose of heating it, but that the pipes were broken and that no fuel was provided by the servants of either of the companies to make a fire in the stove save some shavings and fragments of broken boxes. There was testimony, however, to the effect that after leaving Shreveport some of the passengers procured some coal from a coal car on the track and made a fire in the stove, and that this kept the car in a reasonably comfortable condition while the fire lasted. In reference to this matter we think the evidence was such as would have justified the jury in finding that the car could have been kept heated by providing and using the proper fuel for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The tickets which the plaintiff bought and upon which he and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>wife were being carried were contract tickets and were signed by him and his wife respectively, and each contained the stipulation that the defendant company should not be responsible beyond its own line.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Testimony was admitted showing that the defendant, in advertising for the trip, stated that the passengers would be carried through without a change of car, and it was also testified that an agent of defendant made the same statement to a passenger while negotiating for the purchase of a ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Such being the testimony, the trial judge in his charge to the jury, after defining the duty of a carrier of passengers, instructed them as follows: \u201cNow if you believe from the evidence that on December 21, 1901, the weather was cold and disagreeable, and you believe the servants of the defendant failed to provide the plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably warm and comfortable car to ride in from Winnsboro to Shreveport, and that on said trip to Shreveport 'the plaintiff and his wife were compelled to ride in a car that was cold and uncomfortable, and if you believe in consequence thereof the plaintiff and his wife, or either of them, became cold and thereby suffered from being cold, and you believe the servants of the defendant were guilty of negligence (as that term is above defined) in failing to furnish plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably warm and comfortable car (if you find they so failed), and if you believe the negligence (if any) of the defendant was the direct and proximate cause of the suffering (if any) of the plaintiff and his wife or either of them, then you will find for the plaintiff such sum as will now in cash compensate the plaintiff for the pain and suffering (if any) of himself and wife, or either of them, in consequence of getting cold in said car; but unless you so believe you will find for the defendant. If you find for the plaintiff on the issue last above submitted, and you further believe, that, in consequence of getting cold in said car from Winnsboro to Shreveport, the plaintiff and his wife or either of them contracted cold, and you believe such cold resulted in sickness to the plaintiff and his wife, or either of them, as alleged by the plaintiff, and you believe the cold and sickness of plaintiff and his wife, or either of them (if any), was directly and solely caused by the negligence (if any) of the servants of the defendant on its own line; or if you believe the employes of the connecting carriers or either of them failed to furnish the plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably warm and comfortable car to ride in after they left Shreveport, and you believe the plaintiff and his wife were compelled to ride in a cold and uncomfortable car after leaving Shreveport, and you believe the servants of the connecting carriers, or either of them, were guilty of negligence (as that term is hereinbefore defined) in failing to furnish the plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably warm and comfortable car (if you find they so failed), and if you believe the negligence (if any) of the defendant on its own line, as above explained, concurring with the negligence (if any) of the connecting carriers or either of them, was the cause of the sickness of the plaintiff and his wife or either of them, then you will also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>find for the plaintiff such sum as will now in cash compensate the plaintiff for the physical pain and mental anguish (if any) that he and his wife, or either of them, suffered and will suffer in consequence of such sickness (if any) and the effect (if any) of plaintiff\u2019s sickness upon his ability to labor and earn money, and all necessary and reasonable sums he has paid or incurred for medicine and doctor\u2019s bills, for himself and wife in consequence of such sickness. But if you believe from the evidence that the defendant furnished the plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably comfortable car to ride in from Winnsboro to Shreveport, then the defendant performed all the duty it owed plaintiff, and if you so believe your verdict will be for the defendant. Or if you believe the defendant did fail to furnish the plaintiff and his wife a reasonably comfortable car from Winnsboro to Shreveport, and was negligent, and that the plaintiff and his wife suffered with cold on the trip to Shreveport, yet you will find for the defendant on the issue of siclmess, unless you further believe the negligence (if any) of the defendant on its own line contributed to cause arid concurred in causing the sickness. Or if you believe the negligence (if any) of the. connecting carriers alone was the cause of the sickness, you will find for the defendant on the issue of sickness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The contract in this case being in writing, we are inclined to the opinion, that, for its terms, the writing alone should be looked to, and that it was not competent to import into the agreement by parol testimony a stipulation that the plaintiff and his wife were to be carried to their destination in the same car. But we also think that if there was an agreement between the defendant company and the connecting lines for the use of the one car for the through trip, the initial carrier would be Rabie for the consequences of having furnished a car for the purpose which was not capable of being made comfortably warm. But it was the duty of its connecting carriers to use the highest degree of care to preserve the comfort of their passengers, and therefore, we are of the opinion, that, if the car furnished by the defendant company was capable of being made comfortable by such degree of care, it could not be held liable for their negligence in that \"particular. It follows, as we think, that the responsibility of the defendant for any injury the plaintiff and his wife may have received after leaving its line depended upon the character of the car in which they were carried. If it could have been heated by the exercise of that high degree of diligence demanded of the servants of its connecting carriers, the defendant would not be liable for the negligence of the latter. On the other hand, we are of the opinion that if the car was not capable of being heated by the exercise of such diligence, the initial carrier would be responsible for the discomfort and any consequent injuries to the health of plaintiff and his wife accruing on that line.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The latter part of the charge quoted seems to indicate that the learned trial judge had this distinction in view while instructing the jury. But if so in a previous portion of the charge he seems to have lost sight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>of the distinction. The instruction referred to is that which reads as follows: \"Or if you believe the employes of the connecting carriers or either of them failed to furnish the plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably warm and comfortable ear to ride in after they left Shreveport, and you believe the plaintiff and his wife were compelled to ride in a cold and uncomfortable car, after leaving Shre report, and you believe the servants of the connecting carriers, or either of them, were guilty of negligence (as that term is hereinbefore defined) in failing to furnish the plaintiff and his wife with a reasonably warm and comfortable car (if you find they so failed), and if you believe the negligence (if any) of the defendant on its own line \"as above explained, concurring with the negligence (if any) of the connecting carriers or either of them, was the cause of the sickness of the plaintiff and his wife, or either of them, then you will also find for the plaintiff such sum as will now in cash compensate the plaintiff for the physical pain and mental anguish (if any) that he and his wife, or either of them, suffered and will suffer in consequence of such sickness (if any) and the effect (if any) of plaintiff\u2019s sickness upon his ability to labor and earn money, and all necessary and reasonable sums he has paid or incurred for medicine and doctor\u2019s bills for himself and wife in consequence of such sickness.\u201d This was capable of the construction (if indeed it admits of any other) that if the defendant company failed to furnish a comfortable car to Shreveport, and if after leaving that point the connecting carrier also so failed, and the two causes combined and contributed to produce the sickness of which complaint was made in the petition, the defendant was liable for all the consequences of the combined neglect. We think that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Therefore the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
