The question can be framed by describing the relevant provisions of the will relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ing to one beneficiary, the testatrix\u2019s grandnephew John Henry White. Nevertheless, the relevant provisions relating to all beneficiaries are copied in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The will directs that the testatrix\u2019s residuary estate be held as a trust estate, the trust to terminate upon the expiration of twenty-five years from the date of the testatrix\u2019s death. See Appendix, Articles III and VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Pending termination, the will authorizes the Trustee to use income and, in its discretion, principal for John Henry White\u2019s \u201cschool and college education\u201d. \u201cThe Trustee shall have wide discretionary powers in providing income for the foregoing purposes . . . [I]nsofar as the education of my said grand-nephews and grand-niece [John Henry White and the other grandnephews and the grandniece provided for in the will] are concerned, supplemental educational funds from the trust shall be provided to or for them respectively only so long as such person is making normal progress in completing the educational program approved by the parent and the Trustee for such person, or by the Trustee alone if the parent may not be living when educational decisions must be made.\u201d See Appendix, Article V.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Upon termination of the trust, that is, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the testatrix\u2019s death, the will directs the Trustee to distribute a share of the trust estate, principal and accumulated income, to \u201cJohn Henry White, should he then b\u2019e living, otherwise to his heirs and distributees, per stirpes.\u201d See Appendix, Article VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">After the will was probated, the Executor and Trustee sought by this suit the advice and guidance of the court whether the will violated the rule against perpetuities. The trial court held that the alternative gift to heirs and distributees, should John Henry White be not living upon termination of the trust, violated the rule against perpetuities and was therefore void. But the court upheld the benefits provided under the will for John Henry White during his lifetime and his remainder interest should he be living upon termination of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The appellants appeal from the court\u2019s final decree insofar as it fails to hold the entire trust estate void. The appellees assign cross-error to the final decre\u2019e insofar as it holds the contingent gifts to heirs and distributees void.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Before oral argument, we raised with counsel the question whether the Court should follow the precedent of <em>Gasque, Ex\u2019r </em>v. <em>Sitterding, </em>208 Va. 206, 213, 156 S.E.2d 576, 581 (1967), and withhold decision on the validity of the remainder interests under the Bailey will until the remainders fall in. At oral argument, counsel urged that we decide the entire case at this time. They distinguished <em>Gasque </em>principally on the ground that if, as contended by the appellants in this case, all remainder interests are void under the rule against perpetuities, the remainder interests vested in the testatrix\u2019s heirs and distributees at the time of her death. So, counsel assert, we are now called upon to decide not only the identity of beneficiaries who will be entitled to receive distribution of an estate at a future time, as in <em>Gasque, </em>but also whether interests in an estate vested in the testatrix\u2019s heirs and distributees at her death.</p>\n<p id=\"pAc0\">In this connection, another question presents itself, whether we can now make an adjudication that will bind the persons, perhaps now unborn, who may qualify as remaindermen under the terms of the will when the remainders fall in. Since the doctrine of virtual representation by parties has been adhered to in this State, we conclude that this question can be answered, yes. <em>See Faulkner </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 694, 728-39 (1868); <em>Baylor\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Dejarnette, </em>54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 152, 166-71 (1856); J. <em>A. Lile and E. B. Meade, Lile\u2019s Equity Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7\u00a7 78, 81, 83 and 84 (3d Ed. 1952). So, agreeing that counsel\u2019s distinction of <em>Gasque </em>has validity, we will now decide the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The will does not provide benefits for John Henry White as a memb\u2019er of a class. Rather, it provides for him as a named individual. And since John Henry White was living at the testatrix\u2019s death, any gift to him is a gift to a \u201clife in being\u201d within the contemplation of the rule against perpetuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Any interest in the trust estate that vests in John Henry White before termination of the trust must necessarily vest in him, if at all, during the life of a \u201clife in being\u201d. This is so because sums are distributable to John Henry White before termination of the trust only so long as he may be living.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>And any remainder interest in the trust estate must vest in John Henry White, if at all, during the life of a \u201clife in being\u201d. This is so because a remainder interest vests in John Henry White under the terms of the will only if he is living when the trust terminates.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Under settled Virginia law for at least 170 years, an interest under a will is valid under the rule against perpetuities provided the interest must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years and ten months after the death of a life in being at the testator\u2019s death. <em>See Burruss </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>199 Va. 833, 887, 103 S.E.2d 249, 252, (1958); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>191 Va. 171, 179-80, 60 S.E.2d 45, 48 (1950); <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pleasants, 6 </em>Va. (2 Call) 270, 283-84 (1800).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All interests of John Henry White under the Bailey will are valid because they necessarily vest, if at all, within that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The alternative gift to the heirs and distributees of John Henry White, should he die before termination of the trust, is likewise valid provided that gift must vest, if at all, within the period described in the preceding paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">By definition, any decedent\u2019s heirs and distributees are the class of persons who are described in the Virginia statute of descents and distributions and who are <em>living at the decedent\u2019s death. </em>In interpreting the alternative gift to John H'enry White\u2019s heirs and distributees, however, we are asked by the appellants to supply the further condition that each member of the class must also be living on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the testatrix\u2019s death. But we can interpret the will as imposing that further condition only if such an intent is clearly expressed or implied by the language of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The language to be interpreted is \u201c [to] John Henry White, should he then be living [upon the twenty-fifth anniversary of the testatrix\u2019s death, when the trust terminates], otherwise to his heirs and distributees\u201d. Whereas the gift to John Henry White is expressly conditioned upon his being alive at the twenty-fifth anniversary of the testatrix\u2019s death, the gift to John Henry White\u2019s heirs and distributees is not conditioned on their being alive at the twenty-fifth anniversary. So rather than implying that the class comprising John Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>White\u2019s heirs and distributees should be determined as of the twenty-fifth anniversary, the language of the will implies just the opposite. <em>See Remolds </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>182 Va. 678, 29 S.E.2d 847 (1944) (gift after the death of X to the testator\u2019s \u201cown child or children then living, and the issue of such as may have died leaving issue\u201d vests at the death of a child before X\u2019s death in that child\u2019s issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The alternative gift under the Bailey will should be contrasted with the alternative gift under th'e will of James T. Jarrett, which was involved in a case relied on by the appellees, <em>Jarrett </em>v. <em>McReynolds, </em>212 Va. 241, 183 S.E.2d 343 (1971). The gift under the Bailey will to \u201chis [John Henry White\u2019s] h\u2019eirs and distributees\u201d is not ambiguous. Conversely, the alternative gift under the Jarrett will was couched in ambiguous language. The Jarrett will did not expressly provide whether upon the death of the testator\u2019s son before the death of the life tenant, the son\u2019s share should pass to his estate or should be added to the other shares under the will. Unlike this case, we were called upon in <em>Jarrett </em>to infer an intent where express language evidencing intent was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Giving effect to the express language of the Bailey will, we can only conclude that John Henry White\u2019s heirs and distributees must be determined at John Henry White\u2019s death and that the interest of each heir and distributee vests, if at all, at John Henry White\u2019s death. Accordingly, the alternative gift to John Henry White\u2019s heirs and distributees is valid under the rule against perpetuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In holding the alternative gift to John Henry White\u2019s heirs and distributees void, the trial court relied primarily upon the following dictum in <em>Driskill </em>v. <em>Carwile, </em>145 Va. 116, 121, 133 S.E. 773, 774 (1926):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cTh'e general rule is, that the time for fixing the membership in a class taking under a will is the death of the testator; but where the distribution is to be made among a class at a time subsequent to the testator\u2019s decease, then only those who belong to the class when such time arrives are entitled to share in the distribution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">That dictum, however, does not represent the law of this State as reflected by our holdings in cases decided after <em>Driskill. </em>See the cases collected, and the comments, in <em>Lamb, Virginia Probate Practice </em>\u00a7 133 at 243-46 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">What we have said necessarily upholds all interests under the Bailey will against attack based on the rule against perpetuities, with one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>exception. Under Article V, the Trustee is authorized after the death of Alfred H. Nuttycomb, Jr. to maintain \u201chis widow and children ... in comfortable circumstances\u201d. See Appendix, Article V. Since Alfred H. Nuttycomb, Jr.\u2019s widow and children may include persons who were not lives in being at the testatrix\u2019s death, different considerations apply to their interests under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The question of the validity of the interests of Alfred H. Nutty-comb, Jr.\u2019s widow and children may never arise. If the question does arise, the Trustee can seek the advice and guidance of a court at that time. We therefore decline to pass on the question at this time and intimate nothing about a proper resolution of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The decree appealed from is vacated insofar as it passes upon the interests of the widow and children of Alfred H. Nuttycomb, Jr. and reversed insofar as it holds invalid the alternative gifts to the heirs and distributees of John Henry White, David H. Nuttycomb, William D. Nuttycomb, Patricia L. Nuttycomb, Arthur Douglas Dell\u2019Aria and Stephen Hall DeH\u2019Aria. In all other respects, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">\u201cI, Anne White Bailey, of Charlottesville, Virginia, being of sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding, do hereby make, publish and declare this Instrument of Writing to be my Last Will and Testament, hereby revoking all other wills heretofore by me made.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">\u00ab # # #</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">\u201cArticle III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">\u201cAll the rest, residue, and remainder of my property and estate, real and personal, of whatever kind and wheresoever any of the same may be, I give, devise and bequeath to the Trustee hereinafter named, with the powers and duties hereinafter set forth, and for the purposes hereinafter specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">\u201cArticle IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">\u201cThe Trustee of the trust hereinabove established shall take charge of my said residuary estate, including, but not by way of limitation, my various teal properties, money, securities, proceeds of insurance, accounts receivable, rights and claims, with full powers to lease said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>real properties, and from time to time for purposes of the trust to sell and convey any and all property under the trust, in whole or in part, with the \u2019exception of my lot and building on Court Square, in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, which latter property (generally known as No. 222 Court Square) shall be leased in whole or in part, but shall not have exterior alteration, aside from repairs and restoration, and shall not b'e sold, except as hereinafter stated, during the twenty-five year period of the said trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\u201cArticle V.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\u201cThe said Trustee shall preserve and manage the trust fund and property of the trust hereinabove 'established, investing and reinvesting the capital of the fund and unused accumulated income, except that said Trustee shall not reinvest in real property, and shall use such portions of income, and in its discretion capital funds, for the following specific purposes, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201c(a) For the welfare of my sister, Alma White Nuttycomb, should she survive me, for her lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\u201c(b) For the welfare of my nephew, Alfred H.
