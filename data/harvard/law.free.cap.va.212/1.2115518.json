The City appeals from the order dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We need not decide the usual and customary meaning of \u201cmetes and bounds\u201d because we agree with Judge Whitley, who said in his dissenting opinion in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">\u201cIn my opinion the statute [Code \u00a7 15.1-1033] does not require a description in strict and literal engineers\u2019 language but only sufficient definiteness to enable a non engineer to know where the location of the line is. The description in the ordinance refers to readily understandable monuments such as railroad rights of way, public roads, rivers and streams. After a careful reading thereof I am of the opinion that any surveyor, engineer or layman can walk the line and follow it on the ground with reasonable certainty.* * *\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
