Wolfe, was entitled to recover from defendant, Virginia Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company, hereinafter referred to as the company, the maximum limits of $1,000 for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>expenses on each vehicle insured, or a total of $3,000. Defendant having paid plaintiff $1,000 and denied liability as to the remainder, judgment was entered for plaintiff in the amount of $2,000, and defendant is here on a writ of error to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">On January 2, 1969, the company issued its automobile liability insurance policy to plaintiff covering a 1963 Ford, a 1958 Chevrolet, and a 1957 Volkswagen, effective to July 15, 1969. The policy provided medical payments coverage for each of Wolfe\u2019s vehicles, for which coverage he paid a separate premium for each automobile. On February 8, 1969, plaintiff was injured in an accident while driving the Volkswagen. He incurred medical expenses in excess of $3,000. The policy contained the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On the \u201cdeclarations\u201d page the limit of liability and the premium paid are separately stated for the various coverages on each of the three automobiles, which included medical payments in the amount of $1,000.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cPart II\u2014Expenses for Medical Services\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201cCoverage C\u2014Medical Payments: To pay all reasonable expenses incurred * * * from the date of accident for necessary medical <em>* * * </em>services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cDivision 1.

Two or more Automobiles\u2014Parts I, II, and III: When two or more automobiles are insured hereunder, the terms of this policy shall apply separately to each <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>In <em>Elder </em>the wife of the policyholder was injured while a passenger in a vehicle owned and operated by another. The policy covered two vehicles and provided for medical payments of $1,000 for each person injured while occupying or through being struck by an automobile, with separate premiums allotted to each car. (The limitation of liability clause, and the two or more automobiles clause, commonly referred to as the separability clause, are identical in language to the policy in the present case.) After noting that the courts were not in accord as to the construction to be given such provisions, we said, speaking through Mr. Justice Snead, now Chief Justice, that the policy was ambiguous in its terms and susceptible of two conflicting constructions, and, under the familiar rule, an insurance policy must be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. In affirming the trial court, we held that since the policy provided medical payments coverage \u201cwhile occupying * * * an automobile,\u201d the sum of $1,000 was available under the policy for each car and that the wife was entitled to recover up to $2,000 for medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The company, by counsel, argues that the insuring clause of the policy in the present case has been amended since <em>Elder </em>and that case is not controlling here. It is true that the terminology of the insuring clause in the present case differs slightly from that in the <em>Elder </em>case, but this difference does not significantly affect the broad coverage afforded. The limitation of liability and the separability clauses in the policy in the present case are identical with those in <em>Elder, </em>where We held that because the two clauses were susceptible of conflicting constructions Elder was entitled to recover up to the maximum limits on the two automobiles. Thus, when the medical payments section, Part II of the present policy, is considered and analyzed in conjunction with the separability clause, Wolfe was entitled to recover up to the policy limits on each of his three cars. See dictum in <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Associated Indemnity Corp., </em>371 F.2d 29, 34 (5th Cir. 1967). If the company had intended to limit the medical payment coverage to one automobile, and thereby remove the conflict between the limitation of liability and the separability clauses, it could have done so by the use of clear and unambiguous language. See <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, </em>116 Ga.App. 528, 157 S.E. 2d 768 (1967), where the policy stated in plain and unambiguous language that the $1,000 limit for each person is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all medical expenses. incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>by each p'erson, regardless of the number of automobiles to which the policy applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">We are of opinion that the trial court correctly held that the present case is controlled by <em>Elder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
