Paragraph (b) of Code \u00a7 6.1-39 permits the merger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of banks wherever located in the State, provided the State Corporation Commission finds that public convenience and necessity will be served. Paragraph (c) of Code \u00a7 6.1-39 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">\u201cNotwithstanding the limitations of the foregoing paragraphs, the State Corporation Commission may, when satisfied that public convenience and necessity will thereby be served, authorize the establishment of branch banks in cities <em>contiguous </em>to the county or city in which the parent bank is located, and the establishment of branch banks in counties <em>contiguous </em>to the city in which the parent bank is located. Establishment of such branches may be by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or creation of a new branch; but if the parent bank is located in a city such branches in the <em>contiguous </em>county may not be established more than <em>five miles </em>outside the city limits.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">After a hearing pursuant to notice to all state and national banks in Virginia, the State Corporation Commission held that \u201ccontiguous\u201d, as used in paragraph (c), means <em>economically </em>contiguous or compact, not <em>geographically </em>contiguous. The Commission then declared that Norfolk is \u201ccontiguous\u201d to Portsmouth because those cities \u201cconstitute a compact economic community\u201d; that Norfolk is not \u201ccontiguous\u201d to either Hampton or Newport News because neither Norfolk and Hampton nor Norfolk and Newport News constitute an \u201ceconomic community\u201d. First Virginia Bank of Tidewater and Virginia National Bank appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\u201cContiguous\u201d usually means either physically touching or in close physical proximity. <em>Holston S. &amp; P. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>89 Va. 396, 16 S.E. 274 (1892) (touching); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>492 (1967) (touching); <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>391 (4th Ed. 1951) (in close proximity). Nothing in paragraph (c) indicates an unusual meaning of \u201ccontiguous\u201d; in fact, the language of paragraph (c) proclaims the usual sense of \u201ccontiguous\u201d. We can find no warrant for the unique meaning ascribed by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">We therefore declare that \u201ccontiguous\u201d, as used in paragraph (c) of Code \u00a7 6.1-39, connotes geographic contiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final order.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\"> For a history of related litigation, see <em>Virginia Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commonwealth of Virginia, ex rel.
