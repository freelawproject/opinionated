The defendant now objects to that testimony on the ground that the accuracy of a speedometer, which was used to check the accuracy of the radar device, was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-22\">Defense counsel made no objection, however, to the officer\u2019s testimony when it was introduced. And counsel\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict failed to specify any ground for- setting it aside. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the objection now pressed was not properly raised in the trial court, we will not consider it. Rule 1:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The defendant also contends that his constitutional rights were violated by the sentence imposed on appeal to the circuit court, which was more severe than that imposed by the county court. We reject that contention for the reasons given in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 579, 186 S.E.2d 53 (1972), which is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
