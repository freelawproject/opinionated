Code \u00a7 18.1-268.3. Our decision turns on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">On the night of March 31, 1969, two men appeared at the front door of the Berkshire Apartments in Richmond. A woman who was in the lobby identified Carter as one of the men. She saw Carter remove from the right side of his overcoat a \u201cpipe-like object\u201d, \u201cpewter color, sort of gray, dull silver\u201d. As the woman ran away in fright, she heard a shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">About eight days later, police officers found a sawed-off shotgun wrapped in plastic and buried under a stairway in the open yard to the rear of the residence of Carter\u2019s stepgrandfather at 811-West Leigh Street in Richmond. Hearsay evidence indicated that Carter resided there, but all direct evidence was to the contrary. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>not present when the gun was found, and the evidence does not show when he had last been there.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The shotgun was produced in court at Carter\u2019s trial. The woman who observed Carter in the lobby of the Berkshire was not asked to identify the shotgun as the \u201cpipe-like object\u201d she had seen in Carter\u2019s possession. She was not even asked whether the shotgun resembled the \u201cpipe-like object\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The evidence does not support Carter\u2019s conviction of possession or use of the shotgun. Even if we can conclude that Carter resided at 811 <em>-Yz </em>West Leigh Street, the evidence does not connect him with the shotgun buried in the rear of the residence. And the evidence does not show that Carter \u201cpossessed a shotgun when he was seen at the Berkshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
