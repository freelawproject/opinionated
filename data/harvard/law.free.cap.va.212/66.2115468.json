That agreement, dated October 23, 1968 (hereinafter called the \u201cContract\u201d), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"AEg\">\"* * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u201cWHEREAS, each of the Districts over a period of years has constructed and now operates as a separate entity a water supply and sewerage system within the metes and bounds of such District and in its immediate environs, and in the course of these years the boundaries of the Districts have grown to the extent that they are contiguous one with another in many areas of the County; and</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">\u00ab# <em>* *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">\u201cWHEREAS, it is now the opinion of Districts\u2019 Consulting Engineering Firms, as technical representatives for the various Districts, and the Board of County Supervisors, as the governing body of Districts, that substantial economy would result from the operation of the water supply and sewerage systems in each of the Districts if all such systems were connected and operated in the manner of and as a single system, which hereinafter will be referred to as \u2018System\u2019, in that such mode of operation would allow for the most efficient utilization of the facilities of all the various Districts resulting in ultimate savings to the users; and</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">tc# # #</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cWHEREAS, County, through its Department of Public Utilities, has operated the water supply and sewerage systems of the various Districts as separate entities over several years, and is willing to continue to so operate and maintain said systems as the \u2018System\u2019, under the following terms and conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u201cNOW, THEREFORE, THIS AGREEMENT WITNESS-ETH: ...</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00ed\u00ed# # #</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u201cARTICLE II</p>\n<p id=\"AHb\">\u201cUndertakings of Districts</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\u201cSec. 1\u2014Districts hereby authorize and empower County from and after the date of execution hereof to connect, operate, maintain, alter, improve, add to and extend within and without the territory of Districts their several water supply and sewerage systems in the manner of and as a unified single water supply and sewerage system (herein defined and referred to as the \u2018System\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">\u201cSec. 2\u2014Districts agree that, in consideration of the agreement herein with County whereby County assumes all Districts\u2019 responsibilities with respect to providing water and sewerage facilities, and pledges to pay annually from resources enumerated herein the principal of and interest on all bonds issued and as set forth in Article III, Section 5 to be issued for water and sewer purposes by Districts as same shall mature for payment, all cash and other- assets held on the date of execution of this agreement by Districts attributable to the Districts\u2019 water supply and/or sewerage systems shall be transferred and paid to County.

County further agrees that it will apply all revenues derived from such rates, rentals, fees and charges to the payment of the cost of such operation and maintenance, the principal of and interest on said bonds, such renewals and replacements and any other lawful purposes connected with the operation and maintenance of \u2018System\u2019, including, without limitation, to the making of additions and expansions to \u2018System\u2019.

On this appeal, the appellants raise the issues described in the section headings that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Whether the County Assumed Debt Under the Contract in Violation of Section 115a of the Constitution of Virginia</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Under Article III, Sec. 2, of the Contract, the County assumed the \u201cexisting contracts pertaining to the water supply and sewerage system of each District . . . exclusive, however, of any bonded indebtedness of such District now or hereafter existing\u201d. Appellants contend that by assuming those contracts, the County assumed debt prohibited by \u00a7 115a of the Constitution of Virginia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Operators of water and sewerage systems customarily make contracts for the procurement of materials and services necessary to operate the systems. Such contracts, even though they commit the system operators to pay for the materials and services after they are delivered or rendered, do not create debt within the meaning of \u00a7 115a of the Constitution. <em>See Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>210 Va. 680, 173 S.E.2d 869 (1970), and the authorities cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Appellants did not introduce the existing contracts into evidence. We will not assume that they created debt prohibited by \u00a7 115a, rather than commitments to pay for materials and services delivered or rendered, which are not within the scope of \u00a7 115a. <em>Cf. Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia, ante </em>at 57, 62. Appellants therefore have not borne their burden of showing that Article III, Sec. 2, of the Contract violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Article III, Sec. 5, of the Contract makes the County responsible for \u201call costs of financing\u201d the System and recognizes that \u201cCounty may issue its bonds to pay any such costs\u201d. Appellants contend that the County thereby created debt prohibited by \u00a7 115a of the Constitution. But the record does not show that any debt has been created. And we will not assume that when the County arranges for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>financing or issues bonds, it will act in contravention of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Whether the County and the Sanitary Districts Had Statutory Authority to Make a Contract Providing For County Control of the Systems</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> Appellants adopt the premise that the Sanitary Districts have transferred their water and sewerage systems to the County. But the Contract does not so provide. Rather, the Contract provides that at a future time each Sanitary District will transfer its water and sewerage systems to the County \u201cin accordance with the procedures of then applicable law\u201d. Contract, Article II, Sec. 5. In the meantime, each Sanitary District will continue to exist and to own the systems within its boundaries, including improvements made by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Until the Sanitary Districts\u2019 systems are duly transferred to the County, the Contract commits the County to operate them. The question is whether the Board of Supervisors, as the governing body of the County and its Sanitary Districts, had statutory authority to cause the County and its Sanitary Districts to make that commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Appellants apparently recognize that title 15.1 of the Code, \u201cCounties, Cities and Towns\u201d, authorizes the Board to cause the County to operate water and sewerage systems. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-292, -522 (Supp. 1970); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 15.1-875, -876 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Chapter 2 of title 21 of the Code, \u201cSanitary Districts\u201d, permits a board of supervisors to authorize a contract between a county and a sanitary district providing for the county\u2019s operation of water and sewerage systems within the district. Code \u00a7 21-118.4, being part of chapter 2, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">\u201c\u00a7 21-118.4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when an order has been entered creating a Sanitary District in such County,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the board of supervisors or other governing body . . . shall have the following powers ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">\" * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">\u201c(c) To contract with any . . . county ... to acquire, construct, reconstruct, maintain, alter, improve, add to and operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>any . . . water supply [and] sewerage . . . systems in such district ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u00ab# # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c(g) To negotiate and contract with any . . . county . . . with regard to the connection of any system or systems with any other system or systems now in operation or hereafter to be established, and with regard to any other matter necessary and proper for the construction or operation and maintenance of any such system within the sanitary district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u00c9\u00cd# # <em># </em>\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-118.4 (Supp. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Appellants contend, however, that the Contract lacks statutory authority because Code \u00a7 21-118.4 authorizes a contract relating only to a system within a sanitary district. Appellants argue that the section does not authorize a county-wide <em>system </em>like that contemplated by the Contract. But clause (g) of Code \u00a7 21-118.4 authorizes connection of a district system with another system, whether the other system be inside or outside that district, and title 15.1 of the Code authorizes counties to operate county-wide systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Whether the Contract Provision Calling For the Issuance of Authorized but Unissued Bonds is Valid</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">Article 3, Sec. 5, of the Contract provides that the authorized but unissued bonds of the Sanitary Districts \u201cshall ... be issued for the purposes for which such bonds were voted and the facilities constructed or acquired with the proceeds of such bonds shall be included in [the] \u2018System\u2019 \u201d. Appellants contend that the bonds may not be legally sold for the construction of facilities to be included in the \u201ccounty-wide system\u201d contemplated by the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">Operation of a system under the Contract as a county-wide system does not preclude issuance of the bonds for the purposes for which they were voted. Facilities constructed within a District will be owned by the District and enure to the benefit of residents of the District. The Contract specifies that the unissued bonds \u201cshall . . . be issued for the purposes for which such bonds were voted\u201d. The evidence does not show that they will be issued for any other purpose. So we reject the appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Whether the Sanitary Districts Can Legally Transfer to the County the Net Revenues Derived From the Operation of the Systems</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In Article II, Sec. 2, of the Contract, the Sanitary Districts agree to pay to the County \u201call cash and other assets held on the date of execution of this agreement by Districts attributable to the Districts\u2019 water supply and/or sewerage systems\u201d. The Sanitary Districts also agree in that section to credit to the countywide system \u201call future cash to be received as a result of service charges, connection fees and other services rendered within any District\u201d. Appellants contend that those provisions conflict with Code \u00a7 21-137, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201c\u00a7 21-137. <em>Interest and sinking fund. </em>The net revenue derived from the operation of the public utilities so established by the sanitary district shall be set apart by the governing body to pay the interest on the bonds issued hereunder and to create a sinking fund to redeem the principal thereof at maturity. The governing body is hereby authorized and empowered to apply any part or all of the sinking fund in redemption of such bonds, if redeemable by their terms, or to the purchase of any such bonds at any time, and all bonds so redeemed or purchased by such governing body shall be immediately cancelled and shall not be reissued, and the governing body is authorized and empowered to invest all accumulations of money to the credit of the sinking fund in bonds of the United States, of the State of Virginia or of any county, city or town of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-137 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The trial court held, and the appellees now contend, that Code \u00a7 21-137 is not applicable because the bonds of the Sanitary Districts \u201care not sinking fund bonds\u201d. But Code \u00a7 21-137 requires a sinking fund to which the net revenues of a system shall be allocated. And that statutory mandate must be obeyed whether or not the resolutions of the Board of Supervisors authorizing the Sanitary District bond issues provided for sinking funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Sinking fund provisions in sanitary district bond issues may benefit landowners in the district, as well as bondholders. To the extent that moneys are not available to pay interest on and principal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>sanitary district bonds, a tax is levied on all property in the district subject to local taxation. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-137 (1960); Contract, Article II, Sec. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Absent a statutory requirement, bond issues include sinking fund provisions only if agreed to by the governing body of the sanitary district and the underwriters as a result of their negotiations. Landowners do not have the opportunity to negotiate the terms of proposed bond issues before they are submitted for a vote. Because landowners suffer taxation if system revenues are diverted to other purposes than payment of bonds, we interpret the sinking fund provisions of Code \u00a7 21-137 as intended to protect the landowners\u2019 interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">When the voters approved any Sanitary District bond issue, they were entitled to rely upon the District\u2019s compliance with the sinking fund requirements of \u00a7 21-137. <em>See Miller </em>v. <em>Ayres, </em>211 Va. 69, 175 S.E.2d 253 (1970). And taxpayers have standing to attack an alleged illegal diversion of public funds. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, </em>207 Va. 827, 153 S.E.2d 270 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">When the Contract was made, the Sanitary Districts had on hand accumulated funds derived from the operation of the systems, but had no unspent proceeds of bond issues. To the extent that those funds and funds subsequently accumulated represent net system revenues of any Sanitary District, they should be set apart as a sinking fund for the payment of interest on and principal of the bonds of that District.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Whether the Sanitary Districts Can Legally Agree That the County Shall Fix Rates and Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The Contract provides that the County will impose rates and connection charges for the county-wide water and sewerage systems. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Contract, Article III, Sec. 3. The appellants contend that the Sanitary-Districts have illegally- delegated this authority to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The first question is whether the appellants have standing to make this contention in view of our holding in <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Amherst </em>County, 200 Va. 820, 108 S.E.2d 243 (1959). In <em>Abbott, </em>we held that a user of a sewage system had no standing to attack rates made by the duly constituted rate making body. Here the appellants attack an allegedly illegal delegation of rate making authority. So <em>Abbott </em>does not control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Code \u00a7 21-118.4(e) charges the governing body of each sanitary district with the power and duty \u201cto fix and prescribe the rates of charge for the use of any such system or systems\u201d, that is, charges for water, sewerage and other services provided by the district. The Contract charges the County with the power and duty to carry out that legislative function. Legislative functions cannot legally be so delegated. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>117 Va. 692, 706, 86 S.E. 139, 143 (1915), <em>overruled on other grounds, Irvine </em>v. <em>Clifton Forge, </em>124 Va. 781, 97 S.E. 310 (1918); <em>McCrowell </em>v. <em>City of Bristol, </em>89 Va. 652, 16 S.E. 867 (1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">It is no answer to point to the fact that the same persons constitute the governing bodies of the County and of each Sanitary District.
