Haddock (Joseph).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Ralph Earl Haddock (Ralph), Joseph\u2019s son, while a permissive user of this vehicle on April 28, 1967, was stopped and arrested for reckless driving by James J. Sciortino, a Virginia Beach police officer. After his arrest Ralph, with the officer\u2019s permission, reentered the car for the purpose of locking the doors. Instead of doing so he started the motor and attempted to drive from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Sciortino, while attempting to prevent Ralph\u2019s departure, \u201cwas dragged by the car at high speed some considerable distance before being able to pull himself into the rear seat.\u201d A struggle ensued inside the car when Ralph, after threatening to kill the officer, attempted to take Sciortino\u2019s revolver from him. During this struggle Ralph \u201clost control of the car which crashed\u201d injuring both Ralph and Sciortino.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Sciortino then instituted an action for damages against Ralph to recover for his personal injuries. Ralph, upon being served with process, notified American of the action and American\u2019s attorneys appeared and filed defensive pleadings on behalf of Ralph. American then notified Ralph that it would provide no coverage or defense to him nor would it pay any judgment arising from Sciortino\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A copy of the motion for judgment had also been served on Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate) who insured Sciortino\u2019s personal automobile. Allstate\u2019s policy contained a standard uninsured motorist endorsement as required by Code \u00a7 38.1-381.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Allstate, as Sciortino\u2019s uninsured motorist carrier, then instituted this action for a declaratory judgment against American and Ralph asking for a judgment that American was obligated to defend Sciortino\u2019s personal injury action and to pay such damages up to the limits of American\u2019s coverage, as might be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">At a pretrial conference in the trial court the facts set forth earlier were stipulated and American\u2019s policy was admitted as an exhibit. The court, without objection, took judicial notice that Ralph had been found guilty of \u201cassault with an automobile\u201d in an earlier proceeding before the court. American\u2019s position at that hearing was that Ralph was not entitled to coverage because of the assault and battery clause in Joseph\u2019s policy which provides \u201cAssault and battery shall be deemed an accident unless committed by or at the direction of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The trial court held that even if Sciortino\u2019s injuries were the result of an assault and battery, the words \u201cthe insured\u201d in the assault and battery clause should be construed as referring only to the named insured and not to an omnibus insured such as Ralph. The final order found that \u201cthe casualty in question was \u2018caused by accident\u2019 within the terms of the policy\u201d and that American was required to afford \u201cfull coverage\u201d to Ralph.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The contract itself makes an assault and battery an accident and coverage is extended \u201cunless committed by or at the direction of the insured,\u201d The crucial question then is the meaning of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>American points to the omnibus clause in Part III of the policy which defines \u201cthe insured\u201d as including \u201cthe named insured . . . and also any person . . . legally responsible for the use (of the insured vehicle) provided the actual use is with the permission of\u201d the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">It argues that we must apply this definition of \u201cthe insured\u201d to the assault and battery clause and hold that \u201cthe insured\u201d in the exception includes Ralph, an omnibus insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">For coverage under the policy to extend to a casualty, the policy requires that the accident be caused by an insured, either the named insured or an omnibus insured. Unless the assault was inflicted by a vehicle operated by either the named insured or an omnibus insured there could be no coverage. Under American\u2019s interpretation of the assault and battery clause, <em>i.e., </em>that there is no coverage if either the named insured or an omnibus insured committed the assault or directed it to be committed, the assault could never be an accident in spite of the language in the assault and battery clause which defines an assault and battery as an accident. Thus, it would appear that the assault and battery clause is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In the case of such an ambiguity the rule is that where the language of an insurance contract is susceptible of two constructions, it is to be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>National Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dervishian, </em>206 Va. 563, 145 S.E. 2d 184 (1965). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>North America Assurance Society, </em>212 Va. 177, 183 S.E.2d 160 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court correctly interpreted the exclusion of the assault and battery clause as referring to the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
