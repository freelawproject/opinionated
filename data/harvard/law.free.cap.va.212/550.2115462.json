Guthrie argues that this was an election by the Commonwealth which limited his punishment to the maximum of five years provided by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">This claim is without merit as the record establishes that Guthrie, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>prior to his plea, was advised by both his counsel and the trial court that the prosecution was being conducted under Code \u00a7 53-291. Guthrie was also advised that he, as an inmate of a penal institution, was subject to a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment if he had inflicted bodily injury on the guard from whose custody he escaped, a fact that was later established by uncontraverted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The form of the indictment was not challenged prior to verdict and it may not be challenged now since it is sufficient to charge an offense. <em>McDougal </em>v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 547, 186 S.E.2d 18 (1972), this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The record shows that Guthrie\u2019s plea of guilty was voluntarily and intelligently tendered by him and was accepted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Such a plea is, in reality, a self supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law. It is a waiver of all defenses other than those jurisdictional, effective as such not only in the lower court but as well in this court. When a conviction is rendered upon such a plea and the punishment fixed by law is in fact imposed in a proceeding free of jurisdictional defect, there is nothing to appeal. <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>King, </em>210 Va. 194, 169 S.E.2d 569 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
