Mrs. Jean Key Shepard, a widow, has been mentally incompetent since 1939. She was approximately 80 years of age at the time this proceeding was instituted. Her son, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Francis Key Shepard, then age 43, has been mentally incompetent since he was 18. He has been a patient in Western State Hospital since his commitment on August 1, 1965. It is improbable that he will ever be able to live outside an institution. He has no assets and no estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Mrs. Shepard, whose Committee is E. A. Prichard, is maintained in a private nursing home in Fairfax County at a cost of about $500 per month. Her assets, at the time of the hearing in the court below, consisted of approximately $18,000 in cash and interest bearing notes yielding approximately 6% per annum, sixty-five acres of land with an estimated value of $150,000 producing rental income of $112.50 per month, and a Civil Service widow\u2019s pension of $84 per month. It appears that Mrs- Shepard has not executed a will. If she dies intestate before her son Francis, he will be one of two heirs at law and distributees.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Proceeding under the provisions of Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 37.1-105 to 119 (1970),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Department of Mental Hygiene and Hospitals filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>its bill of complaint against Francis Key Shepard and the Committee for Jean Key Shepard, seeking judgment for accrued charges for maintaining Francis in Western State Hospital and an order directing the Committee to pay such charges thereafter incurred by the patient. The Committee denied that he or his ward\u2019s estate was hable for the patient\u2019s maintenance. He also alleged that Mrs. Shepard did not have sufficient income to pay for the upkeep of her son and that a forced sale of her real estate would result in a wastage of assets which would be prejudicial to her interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Judgment was entered January 26, 1971, against the incompetent patient in the sum of $10,981.80, with interest and costs, and he was further ordered to pay thereafter the sum of $8.15 per day for care and maintenance. By final order entered February 18, 1971, from which this appeal was taken, the estate of Mrs. Shepard and her Committee were held not legally liable for the support of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The Department contends that by statutory enactment (Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-61 (Cum. Supp. 1971)) and under the common law, Mrs. Shepard\u2019s estate is liable for her son\u2019s maintenance within the meaning of \u00a7 37.1-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Section 20-61 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-8\">\u201c. . . any parent who deserts or wilfully neglects or refuses or fails to provide for the support and maintenance of his or her child under the age of eighteen years, or child of whatever age who is crippled or otherwise incapacitated for earning a living, the . . . child or children being then and there in necessitous circumstances, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">This statute, imposing criminal sanctions, is inapplicable as it affords no basis for civil relief. <em>Heflin </em>v. <em>Heflin, </em>177 Va. 385, 14 S.E.2d 317 (1941). Nevertheless, it indicates a legislative intent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>the mother, as well as the father, of a child under 18 years of age or of an incapacitated child of any age, shall be accountable for the support of such child.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In another context, we recognized the rule that a father has a common law duty to support an adult child who is mentally incapacitated. <em>Indemnity Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Nalls, </em>160 Va. 246, 248, 168 S.E. 346 (1933). <em>See </em>Annot., 1 A.L.R.2d 910 (1948). The Committee, conceding that this obligation is imposed upon the father, insists that the surviving mother has no duty to support her children, whether they are minors or incapacitated adults. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">By statute the parents, and the survivor of them, are declared to be the natural guardians of the persons of their legitimate, unmarried minor children. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 31-1 (1964). This indicates that the surviving parent has custody of such children. <em>See </em>Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 31-2 (1964). As a parent\u2019s duty to support children is based largely upon the right to their custody and control, <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 609, 614, 110 S.E. 868, 869 (1922), it follows that a mother, after death of the father, has a duty to support her children. See also <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 102 (1852), where it was held that a mother was entitled to custody of her child as of right after the father\u2019s death, that this right was not impaired by her remarriage, and that the child had a \u201cnatural right to the care and nurture of her mother.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">By the great weight of authority, this duty of supporting minor children devolves upon the mother after the father\u2019s death, even in the absence of a controlling statute. <em>See, e.g., Chapin </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>191 Ga. 408, 12 S.E.2d 312 (1940); <em>In Re Soltis\u2019 Estate, </em>177 Minn. 571, 225 N.W. 896 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\"><em>Moses </em>v. <em>Akers, </em>203 Va. 130, 122 S.E.2d 864 (1961), has been cited in support of the majority rule. 59 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Parent and Child </em>\u00a7 64, at 155 n. 9 (1971). In <em>Akers, </em>we held that an unemancipated plaintiff in a personal injury action could not recover her medical expenses because, her father being dead, her mother was primarily responsible for such expenses and therefore entitled to recover them. The prevailing view is that the obligation of support extends only to necessaries. <em>Mihalcoe </em>v. <em>Holub, </em>130 Va. 425, 430, 107 S.E. 704, 706 (1921); 59 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Parent and Child </em>\u00a7 55 (1971). So the holding in <em>Akers </em>is equivalent to a holding that the surviving mother is liable for support of her minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>We perceive no reason to apply a different rule to the mother of an incapacitated child, and the statute under review contains no language which suggests that the term \u201cparent\u201d as used therein should be restrictively applied only to fathers. Accordingly, we hold that Mrs. Shepard, after her husband\u2019s death, had the duty to support Francis and is the person legally liable for his care and maintenance under \u00a7 37.1-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Mrs. Shepard\u2019s Committee further maintains that, as her income is not sufficient to maintain her in the nursing home, and is, therefore, not available for other purposes, she cannot be held liable for her son\u2019s support. It is true that her expenses substantially exceed her income so that annual invasion of the corpus of her estate is required for her own upkeep. But there is no provision in the statute which limits the collection of maintenance charges for a state mental patient to income of the person liable therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Section 37.1-110 directs that collection be made \u201cfrom the several sources as appears proper under the circumstances . . .\u201d if it appears from investigation that the patient, his parent or other person legally liable has \u201csufficient estate\u201d. Hence, collection may be made from Mrs. Shepard\u2019s estate, subject to the qualifying terms of the statute, because she is legally liable, as a parent, for the maintenance of Francis. Under Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 37.1-139 (1970), the claim against Mrs. Shepard may properly be asserted against her Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">The ruling of the lower court that the estate of Mrs. Shepard and her Committee are not legally liable for her son\u2019s care and maintenance in Western State Hospital is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed. -</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-7\"> \u201c\u00a7 37.1-105. <em>Who liable for expenses; </em>amount.\u2014Any person who has been or who may be admitted to any State hospital, or the estate of any such person or the person legally liable for the support of any such person, shall be liable for the expenses of his care, treatment and maintenance in such hospital.
