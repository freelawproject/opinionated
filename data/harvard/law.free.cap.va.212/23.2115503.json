This finding was based upon a conviction of driving under the influence in 1964 and convictions of driving under the influence and driving on a suspended license in 1968. The question involved here is whether the two 1968 convictions, having resulted from offenses occurring at the same time, arose \u201cout of separate acts\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2 and count as second and third convictions of the defendant, thereby constituting him an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">Under Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2, an habitual offender is defined, so far as is pertinent here, as one who, within a ten-year period, accumulates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201c(a) Three or more convictions . . . singularly or in combination, of the following separate and distinct offenses arising out of separate acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">* # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201c(2) Driving or operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\"># <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201c(4) Driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The defendant contends that his two 1968 convictions arose out of but one act of driving and did not, therefore, result from \u201cseparate acts\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.1-387.2. Thus, he says, the two 1968 convictions should count as only one in determining whether he is an habitual offender. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">We think the question before us is resolved by the interpretation we have given to a similar provision in a related statute, Code \u00a7 19.1-259 (formerly Code \u00a7 19-232). That provision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">\u201c. . . If the same act be a violation of two or more statutes . . . conviction under one of such statutes . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">We have held that under this provision one occasion of driving an automobile may give rise to several acts and offenses and that the test of whether there are separate acts sustaining several offenses \u201cis whether the same evidence is required to sustain them.\u201d <em>Hundley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 449, 451, 69 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Relating this test to the present case, it is clear that the defendant\u2019s 1968 conviction of driving under the influence was not barred, under Code \u00a7 19.1-259, by his contemporaneous conviction of driving on a suspended license, or vice versa. This is so because the defendant could have been convicted of driving under the influence without evidence of the suspension of his driver\u2019s license, and he could have been convicted of driving on a suspended license without evidence of his intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">The force of our interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.1-259 carries over and controls the application of the Act to the defendant\u2019s situation. Since it was not the \u201csame act\u201d that gave rise to violation of the two statutes under which the defendant was convicted in 1968, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>follows that the two convictions arose \u201cout of separate acts\u201d\u2014one out of the act of driving under the influence and the other out of the act of driving on a suspended license. Therefore, the convictions must be counted individually as second and third convictions, thereby constituting the defendant an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
