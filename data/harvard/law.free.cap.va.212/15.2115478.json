(\u201cMink\u201d) for repairs and rented a car from Mink to use while his car was being repaired. The accident happened while Porter was driving the rented car. Aetna had issued to Mink a garage policy excluding coverage if other valid and collectible insurance was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">State Farm had issued to Porter an automobile liability policy pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>viding only excess coverage for a temporary substitute automobile or non-owned automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The trial court held that Aetna\u2019s policy provided primary coverage to Porter and State Farm\u2019s policy provided only excess coverage. Aetna appeals, contending that paragraph (a3) of Code \u00a7 38.1-381, which was enacted in 1968 after our decision in <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>209 Va. 53, 161 S.E.2d 675 (1968), validates the provision of its policy that excluded coverage to Porter.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Paragraph (a3) of Code \u00a7 38.1-381 relates, however, to \u201cinsurance . . . against liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use of any motor vehicle in the business of <em>selling, repairing, servicing, storing </em>or <em>parking </em>motor vehicles\u201d (emphasis supplied). Since Mink rented the car involved in the accident to Porter, paragraph (a3) does not apply. Under our holding in <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>the exclusion in the Aetna policy is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
