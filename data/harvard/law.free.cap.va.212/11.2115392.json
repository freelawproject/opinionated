H. Hayter, Virginia G. Hayter, and Lucille Hayter, the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-23\">The first contention of the condemnor is that the trial court erred in overruling its objections to the qualifications of an expert witness presented by the landowners. While the qualifications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the witness could have been more fully detailed, it was shown that he lived in Abingdon, a short distance from the land involved; that he was in the business of building homes; that he had recently bought and sold land in the area; and that he was the owner of a subdivision and familiar with land development costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We cannot say, given the circumstances of this case, that the trial court erred in allowing the witness to give his opinion as an expert, for as we said in <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Highway Commissioner, </em>209 Va. 95, 99-100, 161 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201c. . . A witness is usually permitted to give opinion evidence in condemnation cases, even if he is not an expert in the strict sense, provided he has resided or done business in the general area for a sufficient length of time to enable him to become familiar with the facts upon which the value of the property in controversy depends____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The condemnor\u2019s next ground for reversal is that the trial court erred in permitting the landowners\u2019 witnesses to testify that the fair market value of the land taken was the aggregate of the individual values of \u201clots\u201d into which the land, then undeveloped, might be divided. However, the condemnor did not object on that ground in the trial court. The only specific objection to the testimony was that it was improper to state \u201chow many lots\u201d might be derived from a division of the land, a point the condemnor now concedes was proper. So we will not consider the objection which the condemnor untimely seeks to raise on appeal. Rule 1:8, Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Finally, the condemnor contends that the award of the commissioners was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d While the award was much more than the valuations given by witnesses for the condemnor, it was considerably less than the estimates of. value stated by witnesses for the landowners. There is nothing to show that the commissioners, in making their award, proceeded upon erroneous principles, and the amount awarded is not so excessive as to indicate that it resulted from prejudice or corruption on their part. Therefore, we cannot disturb the award. <em>Highway Commissioner </em>v. <em>Skillman, </em>206 Va. 39, 41-42, 141 S.E.2d 700, 702 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
