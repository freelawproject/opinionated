Acts of Assembly 1971, ch. 118, Va. Code \u00a7 24.1-4.1 (Supp. 1971), does not consist of compact and contiguous territory as required by the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Virginia. Consequently, he alleges, the Redistricting Act is unconstitutional and Representatives cannot be legally elected from the ten districts fixed by the Act. Simpson prays that we issue a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring the State Board of Elections to certify Congressional candidates only for election at large from the State of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">An Act of Congress enacted in 1967 requires that each state establish a number of districts equal to the number of Congressional Representatives to which such state is entitled, and that \u201cRepresentatives shall be elected only from districts so established. . .\u201d. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 2c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>So we cannot legally issue the writ Simpson prays for.
