Lipscomb, Jr. (appellant) was conveyed a tract of land in King William County known as \u201cOak Spring.\u201d The deed also conveyed the following right-of-way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-17\">\u201cTogether with a right of way for a road over the tract of land containing 150 acres, more or less, called \u2018Youngs\u2019 which road is located along a fence and extending from \u2018Oak Spring Farm\u2019 Northwestwardly to the road leading from Chericoks Farm to the public road all of which is more definitely set forth in a certain deed dated November 27, 1908, from J. W. Montague and wife to Thomas C. Commins recorded in the Clerk\u2019s Office of the Circuit Court of King William County, Virginia, in Deed Book 23, page 446.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Thomas E. Commins, Jr. (appellee) is the own\u2019er of the tract of land known as \u201cYoungs.\u201d On April 22, 1968, Commins filed a bill of complaint alleging that the right-of-way enjoyed by Lipscomb had been abandoned by Lipscomb\u2019s predecessors in title. The bill prayed that Lipscomb be permanently enjoined from using such right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">An issue out of chancery was had, and after all the evidence was heard, the jury returned the following verdict: \u201cWe the jury upon the issue joined find for the complainant, Thomas E. Commins, Jr. and find that the road should be abandoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Chancellor, after considering motions made by Lipscomb, entered a decree affirming the jury\u2019s verdict and enjoining Lipscomb from using the right-of-way across the land of Commins. We awarded Lipscomb an appeal from that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The only question we find necessary to decide is whether the evidence was sufficient in law to support a finding that the right-of-way had been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The party asserting the abandonment of an easement or right-of-way must prove that fact by clear and unequivocal evidence. Abandonment is a question of intention and may be proved by a cessation of use coupled with circumstances clearly showing an intention to abandon the right. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>193 Va. 522, 525, 69 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">We have carefully considered the entire record in this case. Although there is evidence of non use of the right-of-way, there is no clear and unequivocal proof that the right-of-way in question was intentionally abandoned by Lipscomb\u2019s predecessors in title. Accordingly, the decree appealed from is reversed and final decree entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">\n<em>Reversed and final decree.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
