The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney subsequently called a rebuttal witness, who testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">\u201cQ Do you know his reputation in the community for peaceableness?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">\u201cA Well, all the time I have known Mr. Tanner, he\u2019s been guilty of having little ones around him.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">[Defense counsel then objected and moved for a mistrial. The court overruled the motion.]</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">\u201cQ I would like to ask if you know the reputation of the defendant in the community for truth and veracity and peaceableness?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cA Only with th'e children. That\u2019s all I know.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u201cQ You know of his reputation?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cA Just being with the children. That\u2019s all I know.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">[Defense counsel again objected and moved for a mistrial. The court overruled the motion.]</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u201cQ There are some questions\u2014things you can\u2019t go into.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Th'e only thing I want her to do is say yes or no, if he has a reputation?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u201cA As far as I know, I know he doesn\u2019t have a good reputation simply because of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">This witness\u2019s answers, which were not responsive to the questions asked, were not properly admissible as evidence. Because the answers may have prejudiced the defendant, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
