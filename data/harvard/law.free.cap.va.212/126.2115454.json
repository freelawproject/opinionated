Mrs. Cunningham appeals, contending that Mrs. King\u2019s contributory negligence barred a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Automobiles operated by Mrs. Cunningham and by Mrs. King collided at an intersection in the Town of Abingdon. The evidence and physical facts show that Mrs. Cunningham\u2019s automobile, which was approaching the intersection from Mrs. King\u2019s right, was in plain view and dangerously near when Mrs. King\u2019s automobile entered the intersection after stopping in obedience to a stop sign. Yet Mrs. King admitted that she did not see Airs. Cunningham\u2019s automobile until the two cars collided. Mrs. King was therefore guilty of contributory negligence, barring her right to recover. See <em>Sayre </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>209 Va. 409, 164 S.E.2d 665 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
