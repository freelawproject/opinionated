We granted him a writ of error, and we are concerned here with two issues\u2014the admissibility of an oral statement made by Taylor following his arrest, and whether the venue of the crime was established to be in Hanover County.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">On the evening of September 11, 1969 Paul Snell was driving alone in Richmond when four men in another vehicle invited him to join them. Snell testified that he was lonely and therefore decided to park his vehicle and accept the invitation extended by the strangers. They drove around Richmond for approximately 30 minutes, during which time they purchased and drank some beer and wine. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>then decided, with Snell\u2019s approval, that they would visit \u201cAlice\u201d who lived in the vicinity of Byrd Airport. However, before reaching the airport the driver turned left off Interstate 64 onto a country road that was unfamiliar to Snell. During the journey down this road Snell, who was sitting in the back seat between two men, states that he was hit repeatedly by one of the occupants of the front seat. Finally th'e car was stopped near a country church, which the trial judge concluded was Rock Hill Church. There Snell was removed from the car, taken behind the church, beaten, robbed of his watch and money and abandoned. All four of the men in th'e car participated. Snell, although of opinion that Taylor was one of the men involved, was unwilling to make a positive identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">After his assailants left Snell noted a house, which he could see from the front of the church where the robbery occurred, located about \u201ca quarter of a mile down on the right\u201d. This house was located on State Highway 619 in Hanover County and is the home of Fred Hayes. From the Hayes home a call was made to the Hanover County Police who responded and took Sn'ell to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">On the night the robbery occurred two of the individuals who participated were arrested near Sn'ell\u2019s parked automobile. The defendant, Emmett Lee Taylor, was arrested on December 12, 1969. Following his arrest Taylor was brought to the Sheriff\u2019s Office of Hanover County. Deputy Sheriff B. H. Evans testified that he read the warrant to defendant and explained it to him. He also advised him of his rights, using the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201cYou are advised that you have the absolute right to remain silent and make no statement whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">\u201cYou are further advised that if you do not choose to remain silent, any statement made by you can and will be used against you in Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">\u201cYou are further advised that you have the right to consult with a lawyer; that you have the right to have a lawyer with you during any interrogation and that if you are unable to employ a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">\u201cYou are further advised that if you want a lawyer, either by employment or appointment if you are unable to employ one, you will be given the opportunity to consult with him and have him present during any interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u201cYou are further advised that if at any time prior to or during an interview you indicate that you wish to remain silent or want an attorney the interview will cease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">After Evans advised Taylor of his rights he asked him \u201cif he wanted to make any statement\u201d. Evans said that the Hanover police require a defendant to sign a form if he is willing to make a written statement. After explaining the procedure to defendant, Evans testified Taylor said \u201cthat he did not mind telling me about what he did this particular night on the 11th of September\u201d, but \u201che would not sign anything until he talked to a lawyer\u201d. Evans said he asked Taylor if he understood the forms that he had read to him, and Taylor replied he did. The trial judge construed the answer of Taylor to have been: \u201cI want to talk to a lawyer before I sign anything but I understand what you have told me and I am willing to talk.\u201d Taylor then gave the officer an oral statement which was consistent with and corroborated the statement made by Snell as to what occurred the evening of the robbery, except that Taylor told Evans \u201che did not recall beating up anybody or robbing anybody at all and did not remember of anybody in th'e car doing it\u201d. He did admit being in the car with Snell.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Our decision here is controlled by <em>Land </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 176 S. E. 2d 586 (1970) and by <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 213, 169 S. E. 2d 409 (1969). In <em>Land, </em>as here, the accused was fully advised of his rights and understood them. There the accused refused to make a statement but volunteered to give the police \u201cinformation\u201d. We held that his statements made to the police under such circumstances were admissible in evidence because the statements were voluntary and given willingly by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">In <em>Penn </em>the accused made no statement immediately following his arrest because he was under the impression that his father was going to get a lawyer for him. Thereafter he replied in the negative when asked if his father had gotten a lawyer and if. he wanted the police officers to have an attorney appointed to represent him. Subsequently Penn decided to make a statement or confession. We found no error in the action of the trial court in admitting in evidence the confession since it appeared that it was made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently and was in no way coerced or made as the result of any threats or promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">In the instant case there is no intimation that Taylor was threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ened, coerced or promised anything in return for his statement. Credible evidence supports the conclusion of the trial court that the defendant\u2019s statement, which implicated him in the robbery, was made voluntarily and knowingly, and after Taylor had intelligently waived his right to the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Defendant further claims that the court erred in refusing to strike the evidence of the Commonwealth on the basis that venue of the crime was not established in Hanover County. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">On the night of the robbery Paul Snell identified two of his assailants who were then in the custody of the police. When Snell was examined as a witness he was asked: \u201cNow, were the men that were there were any of those men the same men that were in the automobile that you were in\u2014that <em>left you down in Hanover County?\u201d </em>He answered: \u201cYeah. Definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Deputy Sheriff Evans was asked: \u201cAs such, did your duties require you to be involved in the investigation of a robbery <em>that took place in Hanover </em>on September 11th?\u201d The witness answered: \u201cYes.\u201d Counsel for the defendant objected to the question as leading. The court observed that it was harmless but agreed that it was leading and required the question to be rephrased.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Deputy Sheriff Eugene Helmick testified that bn the night of the robbery Snell identified two of the four men who participated in it. Helmick was asked: \u201cHow did he identify them?\u201d And he responded: \u201cHe said they were the two subjects <em>that brought him to Hanover </em>County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">It further appears from the testimony of Helmick that Highway 619 is located in Hanover County. When he was asked the location of Fred Hayes\u2019 house, he answered: \u201cIt\u2019s on 619, which is located in Hanover County, approximately a half a mile below Ellerson\u2019s Garage, on Cold Harbor Road.\u201d He was then asked if \u201cthat is still in Hanover County\u201d, and he answered: \u201cThat\u2019s still in Hanover County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The robbery occurred behind a church. When Snell escaped from his assailants he ran into the woods where he remained for about 15 minutes and until he was satisfied that the four participants in the robbery had left. H'e stated: \u201cAt that point I was behind the church in the woods. I walked back into the church yard and toward the road. I saw a light across the street\u2014the road\u2014from the church\u2014 a house\u2014and then about a quarter of a mile down on the right I saw another house. At that point I chose to walk down to the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>a quarter of a mile away, mainly because it was well lighted. It was on the main road. ... [ijt didn\u2019t take me long to get there, not over five minutes. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence in this case is that the place of the crime was in the yard of a church located on Highway 619 and within the boundaries of the County of Hanover, and therefore venue has been sufficiently proven. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 726, 109 S.
