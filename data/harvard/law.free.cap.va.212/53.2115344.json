The Virginia income tax law permits such a corporation to apportion its income according to a formula that takes into account the percentages of total property, payroll, and sales within this. State. Code \u00a7 58-131.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>In its State income tax returns for 1963 and 1964, Olin computed its net taxable income as follows: Olin (1) subtracted from gross income all deductions except accelerated amortization of a water pollution control facility in this State, (2) multiplied the difference by the applicable apportionment factor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) then deducted accelerated amortization of the water pollution control facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Contending that the accelerated amortization should have been deducted from gross income, and not from net income after application of the apportionment factor, the Department of Taxation assessed Olin with additional income taxes for 1963 and 1964. Olin brought this proceeding for correction of the alleged erroneous assessments. The trial court held for Olin, and the Commonwealth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Code \u00a7 58-79, which is part of chapter 4 of title 58, defines net income as \u201cthe gross income of a taxpayer less the deductions allowed by this chapter\u201d. Code \u00a7 58-81, also part of chapter 4, provides for the usual deductions, including a deduction for depreciation. Code \u00a7 58-81.1, also part of chapter 4, permits a deduction for accelerated amortization of pollution control facilities in lieu of the allowance for depreciation authorized by Code \u00a7 58-81. So under the plain language of the statute, accelerated amortization of pollution control facilities, like other deductions, should be subtracted from gross income to determine net income. And Code \u00a7 58-131.1 requires multistate taxpayers like Olin to apportion their <em>net income </em>to determine taxable income in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In its written opinion, the trial court gave only one reason for its conclusion that accelerated amortization under Code \u00a7 58-81.1 is properly deductible from apportioned net income. The court reasoned that its conclusion was necessary \u201cto give the meaning and intent of Section 58-81.1\u201d, that \u201cto hold otherwise would defeat the purposes of the statute designed to control pollution of streams of Virginia\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Counsel for Olin argues that rejection of the trial court\u2019s conclusion would defeat the purpose of the General Assembly in enacting Code \u00a7 58-81.1. According to Olin\u2019s brief, \u201cmultistate taxpayers are the ones most likely to be operating the large industrial plants which are potential polluters. If such taxpayers cannot get the full benefit intended by the General Assembly for pollution control facilities built <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>in Virginia, for Virginia\u2019s benefit, then the statute [\u00a7 58-81.1] is a dead letter.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">But the Virginia income tax law, as written, requires that all taxpayers deduct accelerated amortization from gross income to determine net income and that multistate taxpayers apportion their net income to determine taxable income. Nothing in the law indicates that the General Assembly intended otherwise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since we cannot rewrite the law, <em>see Owens </em>v. <em>Comonwealth, </em>211 Va. 633, 638, 179 S.E.2d 477, 481 (1971), we must sustain the additional assessments made by the Department of Taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Nevertheless, counsel for Olin contends that Virginia cannot constitutionally permit Olin to deduct only a fraction of its accelerated amortization, while permitting a corporation having income that is taxable only within this State to deduct all of its accelerated amortization. Olin argues that this would discriminate against Olin in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Olin ignores, however, the fact that its Virginia facilities are an integral part of a corporate enterprise that produces income both within and without Virginia. This State taxes only a portion of Olin\u2019s net income, and it can reasonably require Olin to apportion deductions such as its deduction for accelerated amortization. \u201cSuch deductions are required to be apportioned because they are a charge against the entire income and not merely that portion assignable to this State.\u201d <em>Duluth-Superior Dredging Co. </em>v <em>Commissioner of Taxa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>tion, </em>217 Minn. 346, 350, 14 N.W.2d 439, 442 (1944); <em>see In Re Morton Salt Co., </em>150 Kan. 650, 95 P.2d 335 (1939); <em>Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins.

And in 1968, the General Assembly made clear its intent that accelerated amortization be deducted from gross income. In that year, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 58-81.1 by adding the following provision: \u201cNothing in this section, as amended, shall be construed as in any way affecting \u00a7\u00a7 58-131.1 through 58-131.18, relating to the allocation and apportionment of income in the case of corporations engaged in multistate operations.\u201d Va.
