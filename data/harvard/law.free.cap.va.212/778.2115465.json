Rice\u2019s sole contention on this appeal is that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for a continuance because his counsel, Thomas W. Moss, Jr., was a member of the General Assembly of Virginia, which was in session at the time his case was tried, and he was entitled to a continuance under Code \u00a7 30-5, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">The pertinent portion of Code \u00a7 30-5 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>\u201cAny party to an action or proceeding in any court # # # who has * * * employed or retained to represent him in such action or proceeding an attorney who is an officer, employee or member of the General Assembly <em>* * * shall </em>be entitled to a continuance as a matter of right during the period beginning thirty days prior to the commencement of the session and ending thirty days after the adjournment thereof # * *. The failure of any court * <em>* </em>* to allow such continuance when requested so to do <em>* </em>* * during the period hereinabove specified <em>shall </em>constitute reversible error * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The record shows that Rice\u2019s counsel was a member of the General Assembly, which was in session when the motion for a continuance was made seven days before the trial date. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that it had not been timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">As a general rule, a motion for a continuance should be timely made, but there is no such limitation in the statute here involved. Under the plain language of the statute Rice was entitled to a continuance \u201cas a matter of right,\u201d and the failure of the trial court to grant his motion constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The question of the constitutionality of the statute was first raised by the Commonwealth in this case on appeal and we will not notice it at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
