By cross-bill the wife sought separate maintenance from the husband, alleging that he deserted her. After the court had decided that neither party was entitled to a divorce, the husband filed an amended bill seeking a no-fault divorce on the ground of separation for two years. Code \u00a7 20-91(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-19\">By a final decree, the court granted a no-fault divorce, but awarded no alimony to the wife. The wife appeals, contending that the court should have awarded alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-20\">The court not having adjudicated that the separation was caused by the wife\u2019s fault or misconduct, the husband was not relieved of his obligation to support her after the divorce. <em>Guy </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>210 Va. 536, 172 S.E.2d 735 (1970). The court awarded the wife no alimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>however, without any finding respecting the husband\u2019s ability to provide for her support or her need for support. We therefore reverse the decree appealed from and remand the case for a finding and adjudication respecting alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
