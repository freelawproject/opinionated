He was tried by the court on a warrant. No indictment or presentment had been returned by the grand jury against Triplett and he had not waived indictment in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The primary question here is whether a defendant, who has not waived such requirements and duly objects, can be put on trial for this violation where he has not received a preliminary hearing after his arrest and has not been presented or indicted by a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The Attorney General argues that neither a preliminary hearing nor an indictment was required to place th'e defendant on trial because of Code \u00a7 46.1-3 87.8 which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">\n<em>* * *</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">\u201cFor the purpose of enforcing this section, in any case in which the accused is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked or is charged with driving without a license, the court before hearing such charge shall determine whether such person has been held an habitual offender and by reason of such holding is barred from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this State. If the court determines the accused has been so held, it shall certify the case to the court of record of its jurisdiction for trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">This argument overlooks, however, the clear mandate of both Code \u00a7 19.1-163.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, which sets forth when a preliminary hearing is required, and Code \u00a7 19.1-162<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, which requires an indictment or presentment or a written waiver thereof before a person shall be put on trial for a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">It is true that the requirement for a preliminary hearing under Code \u00a7 19.1-163.1 is not jurisdictional and constitutionally imposed but is only statutory and procedural. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Commowwealth, </em>204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Va. 24, 129 S.E.2d 22 (1963). Likewise, the requirement for indictment is not jurisdictional and constitutionally imposed but is only statutory and procedural. <em>Henson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 120, 155 S.E.2d 346 (1967), <em>Forester </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 764, 173 S.E.2d 851 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">But where, as here, the defendant insists upon his statutory rights to a preliminary hearing and indictment, we hold the failure of the trial court to adhere to those procedural requirements is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Two other questions raised by the defendant require a brief recitation of some of the facts established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Triplett was arrested by a police officer who observed him drive his motor vehicle for a short distance along a secondary road and enter the driveway of his residence. The vehicle which the defendant was operating was a regular model half-ton pickup truck equipped with \u201coversize tires with heavy treads\u201d on the rear wheels. A trailer hitch of the type used to pull farm machinery and equipment was affixed to the rear of th'e truck. No license plates were displayed on the vehicle and the words \u201cFarm Use\u201d were painted on each side of it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The defendant, whose testimony in this respect was uncontraverted, testified that the truck was used exclusively for \u201cfarm purposes\u201d which included \u201cfeeding cattle,\u201d \u201cdrawing and pulling logs for firewood and pulling a farm trailer and machinery.\u201d Prior to his arrest the defendant had driven the truck from his residence to another location on his farm approximately <em>%. </em>mile away where he fed his cattle. He was returning to his residence at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Defendant first argues that it was not unlawful for him to operate a \u201cfarm use\u201d vehicle since the operator of such a vehicle is not required to have an operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument must fail, however, because the defendant, in July, 1969, had been adjudged an \u201chabitual offender\u201d under the Virginia Habitual Offenders Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The order declaring him an habitual offender prohibited him from operating any motor vehicle on the highways of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>state<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and no license to operate a motor vehicle could be issued to him for a least ten years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The single exemption from this prohibition is found in Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8 which provides \u201c. . . the order shall not operate to prevent or prohibit such person from operating a farm tractor upon the highways when it is necessary to move such tractor from one tract of land us'ed for agricultural purposes to another tract of land used for the same purposes, provided that the distance between the said tracts of land shall not exceed five miles. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court erred in not holding the vehicle he was driving to be a \u201cfarm tractor\u201d within the meaning of the exemption set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The General Assembly, in Code \u00a7 46.1-1 (7), has defined a farm tractor as \u201cEvery motor vehicle <em>designed </em>and <em>used primarily </em>as a farm, agricultural or horticultural implement for drawing plows, mowing machines and other farm, agricultural or horticultural machinery and implements.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 10, 55 S.E.2d 427 (1949), a case not cited by either of the parties, we held that \u201cdesigned\u201d meant \u201c \u2018intended\u2019\u2014to be used by the accused for that purpose.\u201d However, the use of that definition was required there by the context in which it appeared in th'e statute, namely \u201cadapted and designed.\u201d As we pointed out in <em>Smith, </em>when an instrumentality is spoken of as \u201cdesigned,\u201d this can refer to the purpose for which it was planned or constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">In defining \u201cfarm tractor\u201d the General Assembly has seen fit to require two criteria, namely that the vehicle be both \u201cdesigned\u201d and \u201cused primarily\u201d for the enumerated purposes. In this context we hold that the word \u201cdesigned\u201d takes on the more limited meaning set forth in <em>Smith, </em>that is, \u201cplanned or constructed\u201d for the purpose of drawing plows, mowing machines or other farm, agricultural or horticultural machinery and implements.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">The vehicle driven by Triplett was an ordinary pickup truck, it was not planned or constructed for the 'enumerated purposes. It was, therefore, not a farm tractor within the meaning of the exemption established under Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">The conviction is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-12\"> Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.1-387.1 to 46.1-38.12 inclusive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-13\"> Code \u00a7 19.1-163.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-14\">\u201cNo person who is arrested on a charge of felony shall be denied a preliminary hearing upon the question of whether there is reasonable ground to believe that he committed the offense, and no indictment shall be returned in a court of record against such prior to such hearing unless such hearing is waived in writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AaN\"> Code \u00a7 19.1-162 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-15\">\u201c. . . no person shall be put upon trial for any felony, unless an indictment or presentment shall have first been found or made by a grand jury . . . unless suGh person, by writing . . . , shall have waived such indictment or presentment . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\"> Certain vehicles generally referred to as \u201cfarm use\u201d vehicles are exempt from annual registration and licensing by law.
