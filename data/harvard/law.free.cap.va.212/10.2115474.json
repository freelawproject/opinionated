Harris sought judgment for one-half of the amount paid by him to the third party. The court set aside a jury verdict for Harris on the ground that Harris\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the accident resulting in the third party\u2019s injuries. The trial court then entered judgment for Purity, and Harris appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">Counsel agree that this appeal presents no issue of law but only an issue of fact. In our opinion the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict for Harris. We therefore reverse the judgment and enter judgment for Harris on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
