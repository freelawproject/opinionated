Seely (Claimant) not disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation (UC) benefits pursuant to section 402(h) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (Law),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   after determining that Claimant is not self-employed under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claimant was employed by Geisinger as an IT Analyst from April 2007, until June 2, 2017. (Finding of Fact (F.F.) Nos. 1-2.) Claimant filed an application for UC benefits based on her separation of employment from Geisinger. In 2016, her gross earnings from Geisinger were $ 68,000.00. (F.F. No. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2016, while still working with Geisinger, Claimant entered into an Independent Contractor Agreement with Villager Realty to perform services as a real estate salesperson. (F.F. Nos. 4-5.) Claimant considered herself an independent contractor. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 67.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Claimant's employment with Geisinger ended, Claimant continued to work for Villager Realty. (R.R. at 69.) Claimant's compensation from Villager Realty was 100% commission, based on her sales, no taxes were withheld from her compensation, and she received a 1099 tax form at the end of the year. (F.F. No. 6; R.R. at 66.) The commission rate could be altered by Villager Realty's management. (F.F. No. 7; R.R. at 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The agreement between Claimant and Villager Realty provided that Villager Realty owned Claimant's real estate listings. (F.F. No. 10; R.R. at 85.) The agreement also required Claimant to maintain membership in the local Board of Realtors, the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors, and\n   the National Association of Realtors, at her own expense. (F.F. No. 8; R.R. at 82.) Claimant was permitted to work as many or as few hours as she wanted, and she was not closely supervised. (F.F. No. 11; R.R. at 65-67, 69.) When working as a real estate salesperson, Claimant used her own vehicle, computer, and cell phone, but could use Villager Realty's offices to conduct or perform her job duties. (F.F. No. 12; R.R. at 66, 69-70.) She also had the freedom to \"call on people to get listings,\" \"meet new clients to take them out and show them properties,\" \"make her own appointments,\" and did not have to work in Villager Realty's office. (R.R. at 66-67.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to the agreement, Claimant was only permitted to perform real estate services through Villager Realty. (F.F. No. 9.) Under Pennsylvania law, Claimant was required to maintain her real estate license with only one real estate broker and be under that real estate broker's supervision. (R.R. at 65-66.) Thus, Claimant was only allowed to list properties with Villager Realty and could not list properties with other real estate brokers. (R.R. at 66-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following her separation of employment from Geisinger, Claimant applied for UC benefits. The local service center determined Claimant was not disqualified from receiving UC benefits under section 402(h) of the Law, concluding she was not self-employed because she was not free from Villager Realty's direction and control in the performance of her job. (R.R. at 36.) Villager Realty appealed and a referee conducted a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 29, 2017, the referee affirmed the local service center's determination. In his decision, the referee concluded that the main issue before him was whether Claimant was self-employed and, therefore, ineligible for benefits under section 402(h) of the Law. (Referee's decision at 2.) The referee explained that, although the Law does not define \"self-employment,\" courts have relied on the \"independent contractor\" test for determining whether a claimant is self-employed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The referee noted that for purposes of UC eligibility, the existence of an independent contractor relationship is not established by the way the parties view themselves, but instead, how they are viewed as a matter of the law. The referee also observed that the existence of a signed contract establishing an independent contractor relationship is not dispositive as a matter of law, and that the putative employer bears the burden of proving that the claimant was an independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The referee employed section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law in order to determine whether Claimant was self-employed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Referee's\n   decision at 2.) Specifically, the referee concluded that under the Law, services performed by an individual for wages are deemed employment unless it is established that (1) such individual was free from control or direction over the performance of such services under his contract of service; and (2) with regard to such services, the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With regard to the second prong, the referee identified several relevant factors, including whether the individual performs work that is customarily done by those in an independent business or trade; whether the individual holds himself out as capable of performing the work for anyone who desired the type of service at issue; and whether the nature of the business compelled the individual to look to only a single employer for the continuation of such services. (Referee's decision at 2-3.) The referee concluded that \"[i]n this case the Claimant cannot perform these identical services for any other broker.\" (Referee's decision at 3.) Thus, the referee \"deem[ed] [ ] Claimant [to be] an employee rather than self-employed, and [determined that] benefits may not be denied under section 402(h) of the Law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, Villager Realty appealed to the Board arguing that Claimant was ineligible for benefits under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because she was not an employee. The Board determined that section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) is a \"definition and does not, alone, grant or deny benefits. Benefits were granted here under [s]ection 402(h) of the Law, which provides that a claimant is ineligible for benefits for a week when self-employed.\" (Board order at 1.) The Board concluded that, \"[b]ecause [s]ection 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law does not define self-employment, it is irrelevant here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Board decided that the referee's decision was proper under the Law, incorporated the referee's findings and conclusions, and affirmed the referee's order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the only issue raised by Villager Realty is that the Board erred as a matter of law in determining that Claimant was an employee of Villager Realty, given that she rendered services as a licensed real estate salesperson. Villager Realty maintains that Claimant was not its employee pursuant to sections 402(h) and 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Villager Realty first argues that Claimant was an independent contractor and, therefore, not its employee. Villager Realty contends that Claimant was an independent contractor because she was free from its direction and control and was customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, business, or profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In particular, Villager Realty notes that Claimant had the right to meet new clients and to show them properties; her hours were not regulated; she could make her own appointments; she drove her own vehicle; she supplied her own laptop and cell phone; she was paid a commission for her sales, from which taxes were not withheld; and she was not required to attend meetings. Villager Realty contends that the Board and referee erred by focusing their analysis on the fact that Claimant could not conduct real estate services for other real estate brokers. Villager Realty claims that brokers do not dictate that real estate agents cannot work for other brokers, but rather, it is mandated under Pennsylvania law. Villager Realty points to section 603 of the Real Estate Licensing and Registration Act (Real Estate Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states that \"[n]o associate broker or salesperson ... shall be employed by any other broker than is designated upon the current license issued to said associate broker or said salesperson.\" 63 P.S. \u00a7 455.603. Villager Realty maintains that the fact that Claimant was prohibited by law from associating with other brokers did not, in and of itself, make her an employee of Villager Realty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In contrast, the Board argues that, although the referee and Board determined Claimant was not self-employed, they did not find that Claimant was Villager Realty's employee. The Board maintains that there are various exceptions to \"employment\" under the Law and that a finding that one is not self-employed does not necessarily make one an \"employee.\" The Board contends that its conclusion was limited to Claimant not qualifying as \"self-employed\" under section 402(h) of the Law. The Board asserts that, \"[a]bsent a finding that a claimant was an employee of a purported employer or a challenge to the claimant's eligibility for benefits based on her separation from a previous employer, a purported employer's challenge of only the characterization of the employment relationship is meritless.\" (Board's Br. at 6.) The Board contends that whether or not Claimant is self-employed under section 402(h) is governed by the independent contractor test,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether Claimant (1) performed her job free from Villager Realty's direction and control; and (2) was customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. The Board maintains that Claimant was not self-employed because she could only perform real estate services through Villager Realty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Board also claims that it is immaterial that Claimant was prohibited by law from working for other real estate brokers and relies on\n   <em>\n    Glen Mills School v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867281\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/665/561/\">\n    665 A.2d 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995), where we concluded a dental hygienist could not be self-employed as a matter of law based on a statute that prohibited dental hygienists from performing dental services unless they were directly supervised by a dentist. Similarly, the Board argues that, due to the requirements of the Real Estate Act, a real estate salesperson can never be an independent contractor. Because the statutory requirements of the Real Estate Act bound Claimant to one broker's control, the Board argues that Villager Realty did not meet its burden of demonstrating that Claimant was self-employed. Finally, the Board notes that its holding that Claimant is not self-employed only affects her eligibility for benefits and not whether Villager Realty is liable for contributions for benefits,\n   and that Villager Realty may still challenge the employment relationship under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law if it ever receives a financial determination holding it liable for contributions to Claimant's benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We first note that Claimant's separating employer was Geisinger and that Claimant was deemed eligible to receive UC benefits upon separation from that employment. The question, here, is whether Claimant's relationship with Villager Realty, as a real estate salesperson, acts as a disqualifying event to now make Claimant ineligible for UC benefits. In other words, did Claimant's work as a real estate broker make her self-employed or otherwise ineligible to continue receiving UC benefits. Specifically, this case involves the intersection of section 402(h) of the Law with section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law. We first analyze section 402(h) of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

First Prong of the Independent Contractor Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With regard to the first prong of the independent contractor/self-employment test, the entity seeking to establish that a claimant is self-employed \"must show a lack of control not only with regard to the work to be done, but also with regard to the manner of performing it.\"\n   <em>\n    Osborne Associates, Inc. v.

Factors typically considered by reviewing courts with respect to the first prong of the analysis,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the claimant was free from direction and control, include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   whether there was a fixed rate of remuneration; whether taxes were deducted from the claimant's pay; whether the presumed employer supplied equipment and/or training; whether the presumed employer set the time and location for the work; whether the presumed employer had the right to monitor the claimant's work and review his performance; and the requirements and demands of the presumed employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Resource Staffing, Inc. v.

(F.F. No. 6; R.R. at 66.) Claimant also supplied her own vehicle, computer, and cell phone, could \"work as many or as little hours as she wishe[d],\" and was \"not closely supervised.\" (F.F.

While Claimant had to maintain membership in several professional organizations, she was free to \"call on people to get listings,\" \"meet new clients to take them out and show them properties,\" \"make her own appointments,\" and did not have to work in Villager Realty's office.

This is because, under the second prong of the independent contractor test, Claimant was not capable of performing her services for anyone else. Therefore, Claimant is not ineligible for UC benefits pursuant to section 402(h) and section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2)(B) of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Whether Claimant was Villager Realty's Employee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although we conclude that Claimant is not self-employed and not ineligible for benefits pursuant to section 402(h) of the Law, this does not answer the separate question of whether Claimant is Villager Realty's employee, which is the main issue raised on appeal. Villager Realty argues that because the Board and referee concluded that Claimant was not self-employed and unartfully stated, \"Claimant [was] an employee rather than self-employed,\" (Referee's decision at 3), it could be construed that Claimant was Villager Realty's employee. The Board argues that the mere fact that an individual is self-employed does not necessarily make that individual an employee. Although the referee did state that Claimant was an employee,\n   <strong>\n    he did not expressly hold that Claimant was Villager Realty's employee\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In light of the questions raised by the Board's language, we must address whether Claimant was an employee of Villager Realty.

Cmwlth. 2015) (stating that \"there are various exceptions to 'employment' \" under the Law). Finally, we noted that, because there was no finding by the Board that the claimant was an employee of TTA and TTA did not challenge the claimant's eligibility to continue to receive UC benefits based on her previous separation from Accolade, we did not need to address whether the Board erred by finding that the claimant was not an independent contractor.\n   <em>\n    Training Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6921569\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/101/1225/6921569/#p1233\">\n    101 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1235 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, while both the referee and the Board found that Claimant was not self-employed, they did not expressly find that Claimant was an employee of Villager Realty. However, the referee did note that Claimant was an \"employee.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Training Associates\n   </em>\n   , the analysis in these types of cases cannot be framed as an either/or situation. Because the sole issue before the referee and Board was whether Claimant was a self-employed realtor and, thus, ineligible to continue receiving UC benefits based on her separation from Geisinger, it was improper for the Board and referee to examine whether Claimant was Villager Realty's employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Training Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6921569\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/101/1225/6921569/#p1233\">\n    101 A.3d at 1233, 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the referee and Board erred to the extent they framed their analysis as an either/or situation to conclude that, because Claimant was not self-employed, she was an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In response to Villager Realty's concern that the language in the referee's decision stating, \"Claimant [was] an employee,\" (Referee's decision at 3), would make Villager Realty liable for benefits, the Board argues that its conclusion that Claimant was not self-employed only impacts her eligibility for benefits and not whether Villager Realty is liable for contributions to benefits. Further, the Board states that the question of whether Claimant was Villager Realty's employee was immaterial to the question of whether Claimant was self-employed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6921569\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/101/1225/6921569/#p1233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Board argues that whether Claimant was an employee of Villager Realty is a question for another day. Therefore, to clarify, we hold that while Claimant was not self-employed pursuant to section 402(h) of the Law, the Board did not hold that Claimant was Villager Realty's employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Section 4(\n    <em>\n     l\n    </em>\n    )(4)(17) of the Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Lastly, we address whether Claimant is ineligible for benefits pursuant to section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law. Villager Realty argues that section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law mandates that \"employment\" does not include services performed by real estate salespersons who are paid solely by way of commission. Conversely, the Board claims that, because section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law does not define \"self-employment\" as used in section 402(h) of the Law, section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) is irrelevant to whether Claimant is eligible for benefits in this matter. The Board contends that even though Claimant worked as a real estate salesperson on a commission basis, she is not precluded from receiving benefits by section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17). The Board also notes that its holding that Claimant is not self-employed only affects her eligibility for benefits and not whether Villager Realty is liable for contributions for benefits, and that Villager Realty may still challenge the employment relationship under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law if it ever receives a financial determination holding it liable for contributions to Claimant's benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The word \"\n   <strong>\n    employment\n   </strong>\n   \" shall not include ...\n   <strong>\n    [s]ervice performed by an individual for an employer\n   </strong>\n   as an insurance agent or\n   <strong>\n    real estate salesman\n   </strong>\n   or as an insurance solicitor or as a\n   <strong>\n    real estate broker\n   </strong>\n   or as a solicitor of applications for, or salesman of, shares of or certificates issued by an investment company, or as an agent of an investment company\n   <strong>\n    , if all such service performed by such individual for such employer is performed for remuneration solely by way of commission\n   </strong>\n   , or services performed by an individual as an unsalaried correspondent for a newspaper, who receives no compensation, or compensation only for copy accepted for publication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 753(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) (first emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There is only limited case law interpreting section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law.

Pursuant to our case law, we conclude that Claimant's work for a real estate company following her separation of employment from her previous employer does not prevent her from receiving benefits under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although this Court in\n   <em>\n    Sydnor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jack Gaughen\n   </em>\n   suggested that a claimant is not\n   <strong>\n    financially eligible\n   </strong>\n   for benefits whenever his or her work is considered an exception to employment under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4) of the Law, those cases did not address the separate issue of whether a claimant, who is initially deemed eligible for benefits following his or her separation of employment, remains eligible for benefits when he or she finds new work that is considered an exception to employment under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4) of the Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, because Claimant's separating employer was not Villager Realty, but rather Geisinger, Claimant's ongoing real estate work for Villager Realty following her separation from Geisinger does not disqualify her from continuing to receive UC benefits under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because Claimant is not considered self-employed pursuant to section 402(h) of the\n   Law and Claimant's work for a real estate company following her separation of employment from her previous employer does not disqualify her from continuing to receive UC benefits under section 4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)(17) of the Law, we affirm the Board's order finding Claimant eligible for benefits. However, we diverge from the Board's and the referee's analyses, to the extent they suggested that Claimant was an employee of Villager Realty, because that issue was not properly before them. Therefore, to clarify, we note that the Board and referee did not hold that Claimant was an employee of Villager Realty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Senior Judge Leadbetter dissents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      ORDER\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   AND NOW, this 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of June, 2019, the May 2, 2018 order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Section 402(h) of the Law, Act of December 5, 1936, Second Ex.
