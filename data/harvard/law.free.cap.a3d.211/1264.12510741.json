For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We summarize the underlying history of this case as follows. The Risoldi family experienced multiple fires in their residences, resulting in the filing of numerous claims to insurance companies. Specifically, there were three fires, one in June of 2009, another in August of 2010, and the third in October of 2013. Insurance claims were made for damages suffered in each of the fires, including damage to window treatments provided by Summerdale Mills. Following the third fire, the insurer, AIG, refused to pay the claim for damage to the window treatments unless the Risoldis produced documentation that the window treatments had been replaced after the second fire and submitted the cost of that replacement. The Risoldi family alleged\n   that receipts were lost in the fire and that Summerdale Mills did not have copies of the receipts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ultimately, a grand jury was convened to investigate whether the Risoldi family and their associates were involved in submitting fraudulent insurance claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellee was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury and to produce records of all business between Summerdale Mills and members of the Risoldi family including checks, invoices, and estimates for replacement of fabrics due to fires at the Risoldis' residences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 16, 2014, Appellee testified before the grand jury. On October 8, 2014, a search warrant was executed at Summerdale Mills. At that time, numerous documents were recovered pertaining to work performed by Summerdale Mills for the Risoldi family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also in October of 2014, after the execution of the search warrant, Mark Goldman, a private investigator for the Risoldi family, delivered a binder of documents to AIG purporting to contain records from Summerdale Mills related to the window treatments. Some of the records misspelled the name of the company and reflected amounts paid to Summerdale Mills without description of the work or service provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 19, 2014, the Thirty-Fifth Statewide Investigating Grand Jury\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued a presentment recommending that charges be filed against Appellee, Claire Risoldi, Carl Risoldi, Carla Risoldi, Sheila Risoldi, Tom French, and Mark Goldman in connection with an alleged multi-million-dollar insurance-fraud scheme. Appellee was charged with one count each of corrupt organizations, insurance fraud, criminal conspiracy, obstruction of the administration of law, and perjury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 4, 2015, the Commonwealth filed a petition seeking to file bills of information without a preliminary hearing, and on March 3, 2015, Judge Gavin denied the Commonwealth's petition. A preliminary hearing ultimately was held before Magisterial District Judge C. Robert Roth on August 19, 2015. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the charges of insurance fraud, criminal conspiracy, obstruction of the administration of law, and perjury were held for court. The charge of corrupt organizations was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 2, 2015, Appellee filed a petition for writ of\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   . On October 15, 2015, a hearing on the petition was held before Judge Gavin, and on December 21, 2015, Judge Gavin granted\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   relief and dismissed all charges against Appellee. The Commonwealth filed this timely appeal. Both the Commonwealth and the trial court have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. On November 20,\n   2017, a panel of this Court affirmed the order of the trial court. The Commonwealth then filed an application for reargument\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   , which we granted. This matter is now ripe for our disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before we address the merits of the Commonwealth's appeal, we must consider whether we have jurisdiction. We note that this matter involves an appeal from a pretrial order. Generally, when criminal charges are dismissed prior to trial, the Commonwealth can simply refile the charges and, therefore, an appeal from such an order is interlocutory.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

However, under Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 311(d), in criminal cases the Commonwealth has a right to appeal an interlocutory order if the Commonwealth certifies that the order will terminate or substantially handicap the prosecution.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Super. 2012). Specifically, Rule 311(d) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In a criminal case, under the circumstances provided by law, the Commonwealth may take an appeal as of right from an order that does not end the entire case where the Commonwealth certifies in the notice of appeal that the order will terminate or substantially handicap the prosecution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pa.R.A.P. 311(d). The rule does not explicitly limit the Commonwealth's right of interlocutory appeal to any particular class of pretrial orders. Rather, it indicates that the Commonwealth may take an appeal as of right \"under the circumstances provided by law.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the record reflects that the Commonwealth has included in its notice of appeal a statement that the order on appeal dismissed all charges and terminated the prosecution. Notice of Appeal, 1/7/16. Therefore, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(d), this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal from the trial court's interlocutory order.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

We thus turn to the claims raised in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Commonwealth presents the following issue for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I.

Indeed, the trial court is afforded no discretion in ascertaining whether, as a matter of law and in light of the facts presented to it, the Commonwealth has carried its pretrial,\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   burden to establish the elements of a charged crime.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Huggins\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , our Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   At the pre-trial stage of a criminal prosecution, it is not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather, its burden is merely to put forth a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of the defendant's guilt. A\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case exists when the Commonwealth produces evidence of each of the material elements of the crime charged and establishes sufficient probable cause to warrant the belief that the accused committed the offense. The evidence need only be such that, if presented at trial and accepted as true, the judge would be warranted in permitting the case to go to the jury. Moreover, \"[i]nferences reasonably drawn from the evidence of record which would support a verdict of guilty are to be given effect, and the evidence must be read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth's case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 866 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, we have also noted that \"suspicion and conjecture are not evidence and are unacceptable as such.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Commonwealth's Brief at 18-33. Specifically, the Commonwealth asserts that it \"charged [Appellee] with perjury under subsection (a) because he made false statements under oath during his grand jury testimony which were material to the [Risoldi family's] insurance claim related to window treatments and the grand jury's investigation of that claim.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 19-20. The Commonwealth further contends:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The basis of the perjury charge was [Appellee's] testimony that he could not provide documentation related to the Risoldi window treatments because Summerdale Mills had gone \"paperless\" in 2006 and his computer hard drive containing the electronic documents as well as the back-up system had failed. Specifically, [Appellee] testified before the grand jury on September 16, 2014, that he \"looked through any of the boxes that had files that I could find to try to comply with the subpoena.[\"] In this purportedly exhaustive search, [Appellee] produced only 68 pages of documents which consisted solely of diagrams related to\n   window treatment fabrication. He further acknowledged that he did not produce any canceled checks, invoices, estimates, or similar documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 9, 2014, members of the [Office of the Attorney General] executed a search warrant at Summerdale Mills. During the search, over 450 pages of documents related to transactions with the Risoldi's [sic] were recovered from Summerdale Mills including 189 pages of Risoldi documents recovered from an office with [Appellee's] own name on the door. These documents included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , invoices, work orders, estimates, shipping logs, payment logs, and installation logs for the Risoldi's [sic]. Significantly, among the documents provided to the [Office of the Attorney General] pursuant to the subpoena were copies of documents subsequently located\n   <em>\n    among the same files\n   </em>\n   as documents not produced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as required, it is reasonable to infer that [Appellee] selected a small portion of documents to produce while holding the majority of them, notably the most relevant documents, [sic] back. It unequivocally establishes that [Appellee] knowingly provided false testimony concerning the number of documents he was able to recover.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 20-21 (citations to reproduced record omitted) (emphasis in original).

I did so as I was shocked by the manner in which [Appellee] was questioned. What was intended to be an inquiry into what [Appellee] did or did not know or did or did not do took on the aspect of an inquisition. Present before the Grand Jury were three Deputy AGs. A fair read of the testimony reveals AGs who were alternately frustrated by or disbelieving of [Appellee's] responses. In fact, it is fair to conclude that they thought they were being \"jerked around.\" The reaction to this perceived \"jerking around\" was unfortunate. Instead of stepping back, taking a deep breath and directing narrow questions to defendant, one of the AGs let his displeasure get the better of him. As a professional courtesy to the offending AG, not Mr. Augenbraun, I do not name him or set out in detail his comments. I do so as I realize his comments were out of character and motivated by his frustration. Instead, I note them in a footnote.\n   <sup>\n    5\n   </sup>\n   No witness should be subjected to such comments, comments that would not be uttered in a judge-supervised proceeding. Further, I note my disapproval of multiple attorneys questioning a witness whenever they feel the need to jump in and do so. This practice made an already confusing examination even more so and gave the appearance of a \"tag team\" wrestling match. The fact that many of the questions posed were compound questions did not help and made it difficult to determine exactly what the witness was responding to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   <sup>\n    5\n   </sup>\n   Examples of what I consider to be unprofessional questions or comments to [Appellee's] responses can be found at N.T., pg. 14, 11. 3-9; pg. 37, 11. 2-20; pg. 38, 1. 7; pg. 39, 1. 20 and pg. 58, 11. 1-3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The AG failed to establish any variance between [Appellee's] comments on September 2 and his Grand Jury testimony as there was no evidence presented as to what he said on September 2. As such, this supposed variance cannot form the basis of the perjury charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The focus of the AG inquiry before the Grand Jury was [Appellee's] failure to properly and timely respond to its subpoena. See letter of August 15, 2014, attached hereto as Exhibit \"A.\" This issue requires an analysis of what responsibility a successor owner has to retain and/or search through records of the prior owner. The AG implicitly asserts that a successor owner has a duty to maintain and produce records created at a time prior to his ownership. Alternatively, the AG suggests that if the records are on the premises and can be accessed, there is a duty to produce\n   them. The AG cites no authority for this position, nor do I believe they can. The fact that the AG believes the failure of computers on which records might exist is too convenient to be true or that [Appellee] cannot give a street address for his brother-in-law or computer consultant is not credible, is irrelevant to the duty to produce analysis. The issue is what was he in legal possession of and required to produce. To ask the question is to answer it. [Appellee] was not in legal possession of Summerdale's pre-2014 records and had no duty to produce them. A simple example will make my point. When I came on the bench, I left my old client files stored in the basement of a building I owned. I then rented the building to a third party who had access to my basement. I doubt the third party or anyone else for that matter believed he could exercise control over the files and certainly could not be compelled to produce them as they were not his. In fact, were he to take possession of them, he would arguably be committing a theft. [Appellee] was in this very position. However, before even needing to consider this scenario, his answers clearly reveal that he provided what he thought he was obligated to produce and/or that which he thought was in his control. When informed that his interpretation was erroneous, he indicated that he would comply to the extent possible. As such he made no false representations. In reaching my conclusion that [Appellee] had no ownership of or control over the Summerdale records pre-2014, I have considered the civil case law as to \"successor liability\" as it is somewhat analogous. \"Successor liability\" focuses on whether the transferee can be responsible for the debts or liabilities of the transferor (here, the records) SIMPLY BECAUSE IT ACQUIRED THE SELLER'S PROPERTY. See\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. American Standard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199090\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/607/492/\">\n    607 Pa. 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198031,4199090,7284596,7284479\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/318/\">\n    8 A.3d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. 2010). The general rule is non-liability unless credible evidence is produced to overcome it. If a transferee cannot be responsible for debt, etc., it most certainly can't be responsible to maintain or produce records of the transferor. The exceptions to the general rule can be found at\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198031,4199090,7284596,7284479\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/318/\">\n    8 A.3d at 322, fn 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A closer analogy is the criminal law relating to possessory offenses. To be liable as a possessor, one must have actual or constructive possession of the item and the intent to control the item. The fact that the item is in an area that defendant has access to does not establish his control over it, let alone his intent to possess it. There was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, of [Appellee's] intent to possess or control the pre-2014 documents of Summerdale. As the pre-2014 Summerdale records were not [Appellee's], he had no duty to produce them and was improperly held on the perjury count.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/29/15, at 9-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   After thorough review of the record, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined the Commonwealth failed to present a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Appellee committed perjury while testifying before the grand jury. Thus, there is no support for the Commonwealth's assertion that \"it is reasonable to infer that [Appellee] selected a small portion of documents to produce while holding the majority of them, notably the most relevant documents, back.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 21. The Commonwealth would have us conclude that, because documents that were not turned over by Appellee pursuant to the subpoena were discovered during the\n   subsequent execution of a search warrant, Appellee knowingly lied about the existence of the documents. However, it is our determination that the Commonwealth failed to set forth sufficient evidence beyond mere suspicion that Appellee had any knowledge of the existence of the documents that were discovered during the execution of the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Furthermore, there is no evidence beyond mere conjecture that Appellee made false statements regarding his inability to present the subpoenaed documentation to the grand jury or that he made purportedly false statements knowingly.

Indeed, review of the transcript of Appellee's testimony before the grand jury reflects that Appellee provided thorough explanations pertaining to the basic operation of the business he received from his brother-in-law approximately nine months earlier, his lack of knowledge and access regarding the business's bank accounts prior to Appellee's ownership, his reasons for producing a limited number of documents, and the difficulty in locating additional documents. N.T., 9/16/14, at 3-82. There is no indication in the record that Appellee knew that his statements regarding his inability to present additional documentation pursuant to the subpoena were false. Consequently, the Commonwealth relies solely upon a tenuous inference to establish this element of perjury. Therefore, the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden showing that a crime was committed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wodjak\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1784537,1784554\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/466/991/\">\n    466 A.2d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Summerdale Mills was the company that provided certain window treatments for the Risoldi residence, and the Risoldi\n   family filed an insurance claim seeking proceeds to replace the window treatments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Second, we observe that there is no evidence to establish that Appellee had knowledge of the commission of a crime. Specifically, with regard to the Commonwealth's claim that Appellee's \"lies to the grand jury dovetail perfectly with Claire Risoldi's lies to AIG,\" and that \"[t]he identical lies establish the agreement to defraud AIG,\" Commonwealth's Brief at 38, our review of the certified record reflects no evidence that Appellee was aware of any alleged lies made by Claire Risoldi to the insurance company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Third, we consider Appellee's presence at the scene. Again, we note that Appellee, as the current owner of Summerdale Mills, was called to testify before a grand jury in that capacity. However, there was not a specific scene of the crime as contemplated in the factors set forth in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lambert\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that this factor is not relevant to our inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Fourth, we review Appellee's participation in the object of the conspiracy. As mentioned above, Appellee is the owner of Summerdale Mills, which provided window treatments to the Risoldi family, and the family sought insurance proceeds to replace the window treatments. In addition, Appellee testified before the grand jury investigating the alleged insurance-fraud scheme perpetrated by the Risoldi family. As the Commonwealth observes, \"[F]ollowing the execution of the search warrant at Summerdale Mills, co-defendant Mark Goldman delivered a binder of documents to AIG as well as to the [office of the Attorney General] purporting to contain records from Summerdale Mills which included records previously claimed by both the Risoldi's [sic] and [Appellee] to not exist.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 35-36. The Commonwealth further acknowledges that it \"never alleged that [Appellee] fabricated the Summerdale Mills invoices presented to AIG.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 37. Rather, the Commonwealth contends the fact that the same invoices that were delivered to AIG were also delivered to Appellee's attorney is indicative of a conspiracy between Appellee and the Risoldis. However, the mere receipt of the allegedly fraudulent documents by Appellee's attorney\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   Appellee testified before the grand jury and\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   the execution of the search warrant at his business, amounts to speculation and conjecture, which fails to establish that Appellee was an active participant in the criminal enterprise or that he had knowledge of a conspiratorial agreement. Accordingly, we are left to conclude that the Commonwealth failed to furnish a web of evidence linking Appellee to an alleged conspiracy. Consequently, had we not determined that this issue is waived, within the confines of the record before us, we would conclude that the trial court properly determined that the Commonwealth failed to set forth a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case with regard to the charge of criminal conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    INSURANCE FRAUD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Commonwealth next argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the Commonwealth failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Appellee committed the crime of insurance fraud. Commonwealth's Brief at 40-45. The Commonwealth asserts that, by providing testimony and only certain documents to the grand jury and failing to provide other documents to the grand jury, Appellee essentially corroborated and furthered the efforts of the Risoldi family to defraud AIG in relation to\n   the insurance claim for replacement of the window treatments.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   The Crimes Code defines insurance fraud, in relevant part, as follows:\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 4117. Insurance fraud.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Offense defined. -\n   </strong>\n   A person commits an offense if the person does any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   (2)\n   <strong>\n    Knowingly and with the intent to defraud\n   </strong>\n   any insurer or self-insured,\n   <strong>\n    presents or causes to be presented to any insurer\n   </strong>\n   or self-insured any statement forming a part of, or in support of, a claim that contains any false, incomplete or misleading information concerning any fact or thing material to the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4117(a)(2) (emphases added). In addition, the statute defines the term \"statement,\" in part, as \"[a]ny oral or written presentation or other evidence of loss, injury or expense, including, but not limited to, any notice, statement, proof of loss, bill of lading, receipt for payment, invoice, account, estimate of property damages, bill for services, ... or computer-generated documents.\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4117(l)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It is undisputed that, absent documentation that the window treatments had been replaced following the second fire at the Risoldi residence, AIG refused to pay the insurance claim related to the window treatments after the third fire. Moreover, it is undisputed that subsequent to Appellee testifying before the grand jury and a search warrant being executed at Summerdale Mills, Mark Goldman, a private investigator employed by the Risoldi family, delivered a binder to AIG that contained documents purportedly relating to the window treatments in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   However, the Commonwealth presented no evidence that Appellee knew that the documents contained in the binder comprised any false, incomplete, or misleading information as required under the statute. Indeed, evidence of the requisite knowledge cannot be inferred from our thorough reading of the certified record. Rather, as the trial court stated, \"The [Attorney General] did not present any evidence of a Summerdale quote that was provided to the insurer in the 2013 fire [claim]. Nor was any evidence presented that [Appellee] aided or abetted the submission of false information to the insurer in the 2013 fire [claim].\" Trial Court Opinion, 12/29/15, at 8. Thus, while Appellee may have given statements to the grand jury relevant to the existence of various documents and Appellee's ability to provide documents to the grand jury, there is no showing that these statements were made with any intent by Appellee to defraud the insurer. Therefore, even if the alleged misstatements contained in the binder were found to be material to the insurance claim, there is no evidence that Appellee had any knowledge of what was contained within the binder. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Appellee was attempting to collect any money from the insurer. Hence, we are left to conclude, as did the trial court, that Appellee did not have the necessary\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   to acquire anything from the insurer. Thus, the Commonwealth's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Commonwealth last argues that the trial court erred in concluding that the Commonwealth failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Appellee committed the crime of obstruction of justice. Commonwealth's Brief at 45-46. The Commonwealth states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   It is the Commonwealth's position that under the same reasoning that a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case was established for perjury, this count of obstruction of justice was supported by sufficient evidence to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. [Appellee's] failure to produce the subpoenaed records and his lies under oath demonstrated a clear intent to obstruct the grand jury's investigation. As argued above, the lower court's conclusion that [Appellee] had no duty to produce the subpoenaed records was contrary to all standards relevant to determining whether or not a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case had been met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As set forth in our review of the charge of criminal conspiracy, the Commonwealth has failed to ensure that the certified record before this Court is complete in order that we may review the merits of this claim as well. With regard to the charge of obstruction of justice, our review of the record reflects that the documents Appellee actually produced pursuant to the grand jury's subpoena were presented in proceedings before the district magistrate as Commonwealth Exhibit 149. N.T., 8/19/15, at 61. In addition, the documents that were subsequently recovered during the execution of the search warrant at Summerdale Mills were presented in proceedings before the district magistrate as Commonwealth Exhibit 146.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . at 12-13. However, the Commonwealth has failed to include, in either the certified record or the reproduced record, copies of the documents that comprised Exhibit 149,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the documents actually secured pursuant to the subpoena. Moreover, the Commonwealth did not seek to supplement the record to correct this specific deficiency pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1926. As such, we cannot compare those items that were voluntarily turned over pursuant to the subpoena to those items that were subsequently recovered during the search. Accordingly, our review of this claim is hampered, and we are constrained to conclude that this issue is waived. Again, even if not waived, we would conclude that the Commonwealth's claim lacks merit under generally applicable legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Crimes Code defines the crime of obstruction of justice as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he intentionally obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function by force, violence, physical interference or obstacle, breach of official duty, or any other unlawful act, except that this section does not apply to flight by a person charged with crime, refusal to submit to arrest, failure to perform a legal duty other than an official duty, or any other means of avoiding compliance with law without affirmative interference with governmental functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5101.

Consequently, the Commonwealth relies solely upon a tenuous inference to establish this element of obstruction of justice.

Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The charges at issue in this case stem from a criminal investigation that started following an October 2013 fire at a mansion owned by the Risoldi family. This was the third fire at the mansion since June 2009. The investigation concerned an alleged insurance fraud scheme involving homeowners' insurance claims following the multiple fires. The claims submitted by the Risoldi family following each fire included claims for damaged window treatments, which the Risoldi family allegedly purchased from Summerdale Mills. The Risoldi family's insurer, AIG, declined to reimburse for the window treatments following the 2013 fire without proof of the replacement cost following the second fire. The Risoldi family initially claimed proof of the replacement cost had been lost in the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Holston is the owner of Philadelphia Draperies, LLC, doing business as Summerdale Mills. According to Holston, his brother-in-law, Abraham Reichbach, gave\n   him the Summerdale Mills business in January 2014. Prior to January 2014, Holston had a fabrication shop that rented space from Summerdale Mills and did fabric work for Summerdale Mills, including fabricating window treatments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In August 2014, the Commonwealth issued a subpoena to \"Summerdale Mills and Design Center[,] Rick Holston[,]\" requiring the production of all records of business conducted between members of the Risoldi family and Summerdale Mills, including canceled checks, invoices, and estimates for the replacement of fabrics due to fires at the Risoldi mansion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Holston testified before a grand jury in September 2014 and produced 68 documents in response to the subpoena.

Prior to his grand jury testimony, Holston appeared for an interview with the Commonwealth on September 2, 2014. In finding the Commonwealth failed to present a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, the trial court reasoned that \"the [Commonwealth] failed to establish any variance between Holston's comments on September 2 and his Grand Jury\n   testimony as there was no evidence presented as to what he said on September 2.\" Trial Court Op., filed Dec. 21, 2015, at 10-11.

The court stated \"[t]here was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, of Holston's intent to possess or control the pre-2014 documents of Summerdale Mills. As the pre-2014 Summerdale Mills' records were not Holston's, he had no duty to produce them and was improperly held on the perjury count.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Majority quotes the trial court's analysis and states it \"correctly determined the Commonwealth failed to present a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that [Holston] committed perjury while testifying before the grand jury.\" Majority at 1274. It concludes that the \"Commonwealth failed to set forth sufficient evidence beyond mere suspicion that [Holston] had any knowledge of the existence of the documents that were discovered during the execution of the search warrant.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   It further concluded that \"[t]here is no indication in the record that [Holston] knew that his statements regarding his inability to present additional documentation pursuant to subpoena were false.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1275.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Respectfully, I believe that in reaching this conclusion the Majority is making credibility determinations and weighing the evidence, which should not be done when addressing a motion for\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

I would conclude that the trial court erred in granting the motion for\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   and finding the Commonwealth failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case to support the perjury charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   First, the Commonwealth does not argue that the September 2 interview forms the basis for the perjury charge. Therefore, the trial court's conclusion that the Commonwealth failed to establish a variance between statements from the September 2 interview and the Grand Jury testimony is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Second, I do not agree that Holston had no legal obligation to produce documents in the possession of Summerdale Mills, a company that he owned at the time of the issuance of the subpoena. The subpoena was sent to \"Summerdale Mills and Design Center[,] Rick Holston[,]\" and required the production of all records of business conducted relating to certain individuals. A company cannot avoid its obligations under a subpoena by transferring ownership to a new individual, who could then claim he had no legal right to the records of the company he now allegedly owns. A subpoena's command is personal, and if Holston had the documents, he had a duty to produce them. It is irrelevant that the requested documents allegedly came into being before Holston owned the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Further, contrary to the trial court's finding, Holston's legal obligation as to the documents does not impact whether he, in fact, committed perjury. Rather, when testifying before the Grand Jury, he was asked about his compliance with the subpoena, and he responded, \"I looked through any of the boxes that had files that I could find to try to comply with the subpoena.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 12. In those boxes he claimed he found only 68 documents, and found no canceled checks, invoices, or work orders. Holston did not say that he lacked access to any part of the building\n   when searching for and through boxes. A month later, when the Commonwealth executed a search warrant, it also looked through boxes, and found more than 450 documents related to the Risoldi family, including invoices, work orders, and estimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Holston further stated that he did not produce any canceled checks, invoices, or estimates because Summerdale Mills'\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   computer hard drive, which ... had everything financial, which had all the orders, invoices, everything, that hard drive died at the end of April, beginning of May of this past year. And then we called in several companies to try to restore it. And they were unable to do that. And then we sent it out to a company to see if they could restore it. They recently responded that it was not able to be recovered. And that was all the data that had been passed on to me from 2006 on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 12-13. When asked whether the company had kept hard copies of the sales order, Holston stated, \"No. Not that I've seen,\" claiming the company had been \"paperless.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 31. Again, when the agents executed the search warrant, they found hard copies of invoices and work orders that predated the claimed loss of the computer hard drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Holston further stated that the records from the fabrication business he owned before January 2014, which did work for Summerdale Mills, would not reference the Risoldi name, as the customer of the fabrication business was Summerdale Mills, and Summerdale Mills did not reference specific customers when it requested work from fabrication companies. In contrast, however, when executing the search warrant, the agents located invoices from Philadelphia Draperies to Summerdale Mills which referenced \"Risoldi.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Holston never claimed he did not produce documents because he had no legal right to the documents or that he had limited access to areas of the office. Rather, he claimed he searched the boxes, the computer was not working, Summerdale Mills did not keep hardcopies of invoices, and Summerdale Mills did not inform its subcontractors of the clients for whom the subcontractor was doing work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agents' discovery of documents in areas to which Holston had access raises a strong inference that Holston's testimony before the grand jury was not truthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The statements would be material, as the Grand Jury was investigating insurance fraud on the part of the Risoldi family, who alleged they had no documentation to support the claimed replacement cost of the drapes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Further, contrary to the Majority, I believe the Commonwealth's evidence was more than mere suspicion or conjecture. Rather, the evidence would support a finding that Holston committed perjury, that is, that he made a false statement under oath, the statement was material, and he knew the statement was false.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4902(a). Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, I would find that the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to establish\n   <em>\n    a prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Obstruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The Majority finds the Commonwealth waived its claim that it presented a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    face\n   </em>\n   case of obstruction of justice because it failed to ensure the certified record included the documents that Holston produced in response to the subpoena and failed to include such documents in the reproduced record. I disagree. Holston described the documents in his Grand Jury testimony and agreed at that time that they do not contain invoices or estimates. I would therefore find that we can adequately review this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Obstruction of justice is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he intentionally obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function by force, violence, physical interference or obstacle, breach of official duty, or any other unlawful act, except that this section does not apply to flight by a person charged with crime, refusal to submit to arrest, failure to perform a legal duty other than an official duty, or any other means of avoiding compliance with law without affirmative interference with governmental functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5101. To establish a person obstructed justice, the Commonwealth must establish that \"(1) the defendant had the intent to obstruct the administration of law; and (2) the defendant used force or violence, breached an official duty or committed an unlawful act.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence supports a finding that Holston intended to prevent the government from gaining access to documents relevant to the criminal investigation, and, in doing so committed an unlawful act, that is, perjury.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Conspiracy and Insurance Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Majority claims that the Commonwealth waived the claims that it presented sufficient evidence to support\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   cases of conspiracy and insurance fraud because the certified record does not contain the documents from the binder, which form the basis of the conspiracy and insurance fraud claims. I also note that although the reproduced record contains some testimony from a preliminary hearing describing the documents, the transcript from the relevant preliminary hearing is not part of the certified record, and the reproduced record includes only a portion of the transcript. I therefore agree with the Majority that the Commonwealth has waived its claim that it presented\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   cases of conspiracy and insurance fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   In conclusion, I agree with the Majority that the Commonwealth waived its claim that it presented sufficient evidence of\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   cases of conspiracy and insurance fraud. However, I disagree with the Majority as to the perjury and obstruction of justice charges. I would find the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to support a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Holston committed perjury and obstruction of justice\n   and that the trial court erred in granting Holston's motion for\n   <em>\n    habeas corpus\n   </em>\n   as to those charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY STABILE, J.:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   The Majority concludes the Commonwealth failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case against Appellee for perjury or insurance fraud and waived its claims of criminal conspiracy and obstruction of justice for failure to include records necessary for this Court's review. Because I believe the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case on the four enumerated charges and has not waived any claims, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   As this Court explained in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Viewing the evidence in the light\n   most favorable to the Commonwealth, including reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence, I find the evidence was sufficient to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of perjury relating to Appellee's testimony to the grand jury about the existence of Risoldi documents and the fact Summerdale Mills' computers were inoperable, matters material to the Risoldi insurance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   With regard to the criminal conspiracy charge, the Majority concludes the claim is waived for failure to include documents in the certified record. Majority Op. at 1276-77. Regardless, the Majority indicates the claim would \"fail[ ] under generally applicable legal principles\" even if the record were complete.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1277. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   As the Commonwealth recognizes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   The essence of a criminal conspiracy is a common understanding, no matter how it came into being, that a particular criminal objective be accomplished. Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy requires proof of the existence of a shared criminal intent. An explicit or formal agreement to commit crimes can seldom, if ever, be proved and it need not be, for proof of a criminal partnership is almost invariably extracted from the circumstances that attend its activities. Thus, a conspiracy may be inferred where it is demonstrated that the relation, conduct, or circumstances of the parties, and the overt acts of the co-conspirators sufficiently prove the formation of a criminal confederation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   The conduct of the parties and the circumstances surrounding their conduct may create a web of evidence linking the accused to the alleged conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Ruiz\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9345100\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/819/92/#p97\">\n    819 A.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (Pa. Super. 2003) (citation omitted). The Commonwealth argues that the Risoldis' investigator, Mark Goldman,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   delivered a binder of documents to the Risoldis' insurance carrier, American International Group, Inc. (\"AIG\"), and to the Office of the Attorney General after the Attorney General's search warrant was executed at Summerdale Mills. According to testimony from AIG's adjuster, the binder included documents relating to the Risoldis' window treatments. While the binder was not included in the certified record, there was testimony relating to documents included in the binder, including various \"invoices\" ostensibly from Summerdale Mills that listed dollar amounts of charges without any description of services supporting the charges. Importantly, several reflected Summerdale Mills' name without an \"e\" at the end of Summerdale. These documents were different from the ones the adjuster previously received. N.T., March 30, 2015 Preliminary Hearing Proceedings, at 1785.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   To put this matter in context, it is important to note that Claire Risoldi claimed AIG was harassing Summerdale Mills. In order that her own reputation would not be impugned, Claire instructed the adjuster not to contact Summerdale Mills directly, indicating she would obtain whatever AIG might need from Summerdale Mills.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 1766. The adjuster acceded to Claire's demand. The testimony reflects that the documents in the binder were provided by the Risoldis' investigator not only to the adjuster but also to Appellee's counsel. N.T., 10/15/15, at 22. As the Commonwealth appropriately suggests, and considering the evidence and reasonable inferences in a light favorable to the Commonwealth,\n   \"it is reasonable to infer that the Risoldis would not deliver altered documents purporting to be Summerdale Mills receipts to the very individual who could have sounded the alarm because he would have known they were altered and because he claimed they did not exist.\" Commonwealth Brief at 37. Moreover,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   [t]he fact that the altered documents appeared after a year of the Risoldis claiming they didn't exist and after [Appellee] testified they didn't exist but very shortly after the search warrant was executed at Summerdale Mills raises the reasonable inference that [Appellee] had told the Risoldis about the search and the items seized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 38. Further, Appellee's \"lies to the grand jury dovetail perfectly with Claire Risoldi's lies to AIG. Both claimed that Summerdale Mills did not have documentation to prove the window treatments had been replaced following any of the fires and/or the cost of replacement. The identical lies establish the agreement to defraud AIG.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Based on the testimony, even in absence of the binder containing purportedly-doctored documents, I would not consider the Commonwealth's claim waived. Further, considering the evidence in the light favorable to the Commonwealth, including reasonable inferences, I would find the Commonwealth established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of conspiracy to defraud AIG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   With regard to the charge of insurance fraud, the Majority concludes there is no showing that Appellee possessed any intent to defraud AIG, even considering Appellee's statements regarding the existence of various documents or his ability to provide those documents to the grand jury. Majority Op. at 1280-81. The Majority suggests there was no evidence that Appellee had any knowledge of the contents of the binder produced by the Risoldis' investigator (despite the fact the binder was also provided to Appellee's counsel).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   As the Commonwealth argues, the evidence suggested that Appellee purposely failed to produce subpoenaed documents and testified falsely before the grand jury about his efforts to locate documents and the existence of those records, about the failure of his computers, about information included on work orders that included customer names, and about Summerdale Mills' practice of not keeping hard copies of sales orders. Commonwealth Brief at 43-44. Appellee's \"failure to produce the documents pursuant to a legitimate subpoena and his subsequent lies under oath which corroborate and further the Risoldis' efforts to defraud AIG related to the window treatments claim establish [Appellee's] culpability as an accomplice to the insurance fraud.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 44. Once again, I believe the Majority has failed to view the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light favorable to the Commonwealth when considering whether the Commonwealth has established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case. When properly viewed, I believe the Commonwealth has carried its burden of establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of insurance fraud under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4117(a)(2) and Appellee's culpability as an accomplice under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 306 in committing that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Finally, with respect to the obstruction of justice charge, the Majority again finds waiver for failure to include \"documents actually secured pursuant to the subpoena.\" Majority Op. at 1281. While I do not dispute the lack of a complete record, I do not believe the failure to include the documents is fatal to the claim. Once again, there was testimony concerning the transactional\n   documents recovered during execution of the search warrant and there was testimony relating to the window treatment fabrication diagrams voluntarily turned over by Appellee. The testimony revealed the nature of both categories of documents, thus enabling a reviewing court to understand to dissimilarity between what was recovered versus what was produced by Appellee. While the Majority suggests a review of the record fails to establish the Appellee had knowledge of the existence of documents beyond the fabrication diagrams he produced, that conclusion clearly fails to view the evidence in a light favorable to the Commonwealth and certainly fails to consider reasonable inferences drawn from the testimony. I believe the evidence supports a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of obstruction of justice under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5101 based on Appellee's failure to produce subpoenaed documents and his statements under oath regarding the records at Summerdale Mills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Finding none of the Commonwealth's claims waived and finding the Commonwealth established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of perjury, conspiracy, insurance fraud and obstruction of justice, I conclude the trial court committed reversible error of law by dismissing the charges against Appellee. Therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    We note that after the Bucks County District Attorney determined he had a conflict of interest, the matter was referred to the Office of the Attorney General.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Appellee became the owner of Summerdale Mills, which has been in business for over thirty-five years, in January of 2014.
