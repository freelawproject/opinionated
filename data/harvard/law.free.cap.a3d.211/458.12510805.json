The State urges us to apply the opening the door doctrine to the facts of the present case, and hold that defense counsel, through her opening statement, opened the door to admitting, as evidence, Mr. Heath's stated intention. To resolve this issue we explore whether defense counsel's remarks triggered the opening the door doctrine, and if so, whether the responsive evidence offered by the State was a proportional response. For reasons we shall explain, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant evidence and abused its\n   discretion in weighing the proportionality of the contested portion of Mr. Heath's statement. The error in doing so was not harmless; thus, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Heath was charged with the murder of Tom Malenski (\"Mr. Malenski\") and the attempted murder of Martin Clay (\"Mr. Clay\"). The charges stemmed from an altercation that happened on September 25, 2014 at Ottobar, where Mr. Malenski and Mr. Clay were employed, in Baltimore City. The undisputed facts are that on the evening of September 25, 2014, Dustin Cunningham (\"Mr. Cunningham\") directed inappropriate comments toward Erica Davis (\"Ms. Davis\") and Ms. Davis's unidentified friend. Mr. Heath, in an attempt to quell any hostility between Mr. Cunningham and Ms. Davis, offered an apology to Ms. Davis and her friend on Mr. Cunningham's behalf. Ms. Davis did not accept the apology. She, instead, directed Mr. Heath to inform Mr. Cunningham that he needed to apologize himself for the comments that he had made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Eventually, after continued antagonism between the individuals, the bouncers removed Mr. Cunningham from the bar. Both Mr. Clay and Mr. Malenski aided the bouncers in removing Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Malenski was not working at Ottobar that night and Mr. Clay had gotten off of work at 11:00 p.m., but each were \"hanging out\" at Ottobar at the time of the altercation. Mr. Cunningham claimed that, once outside, the bouncers attempted to beat him up, so he ran away. Mr. Clay and Mr. Malenski ran down the street after\n   Mr. Cunningham, but he successfully escaped. Thereafter, Mr. Clay and Mr. Heath offered conflicting stories as to what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Mr. Clay, while he and Mr. Malenski were walking back to Ottobar, Mr. Heath came towards them with a knife. At first, Mr. Clay thought that Mr. Heath had punched him in the face, but he ultimately realized that he had been cut. Mr. Clay testified that, while Mr. Malenski was trying to \"get in between\" Mr. Clay and Mr. Heath, Mr. Heath slashed Mr. Malenski's throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Offering a different version of the events, Mr. Heath, in his recorded statement to the police, indicated that upon leaving Ottobar, he headed in the direction of where Mr. Cunningham had fled. According to Mr. Heath, the men who had chased Mr. Cunningham, including Mr. Clay and Mr. Malenski, were walking back toward Ottobar. The group of men approached Mr. Heath while he was trying to pass them. Mr. Heath's path was blocked, and the men began arguing with him. Mr. Heath claimed that he saw Mr. Malenski pull out a knife. Mr. Heath, in trying to defend himself from an attack, told the men to back off. He explained that Mr. Clay probably got cut in the face while Mr. Heath was defending himself against the attack. Mr. Heath said that he intended to cut Mr. Malenski's deltoid muscle and that would have prevented Mr. Malenski from raising his arms. Mr. Heath stated that he was \"merely trying to 'disable' \" Mr. Malenski. Unfortunately, according to Mr. Heath, Mr. Malenski lunged forward causing Mr. Heath to accidentally cut Mr. Malenski's neck instead of his shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although Mr. Clay's and Mr. Heath's stories diverged, it is undisputed that Mr. Heath cut Mr. Clay's face and Mr. Malenski's throat. Furthermore, it is uncontested that during the confrontation, Mr. Heath cut one of Mr. Malenski's arteries, which resulted in his death. Mr. Heath was tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for the first-degree murder of Mr. Malenski, the attempted first-degree murder of Mr. Clay, and other related charges. The substantive issue at trial was whether Mr. Heath acted with criminal intent or in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Heath did not testify at trial, so his version of the events was established by way of a recorded statement that he gave to the police during an interview on September 27, 2014. Prior to trial, and without the trial court's involvement, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreed to various redactions of Mr. Heath's statement to police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The redacted portions\n   of the statement related to Mr. Heath's selling of drugs as his primary source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During her opening statement at trial, Mr. Heath's counsel made the following comment about Mr. Heath's purpose for going to Ottobar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, the young man that sits here [next to counsel] is Nicholas Heath. And just as the State described to you in regards to [Mr. Malenski and Mr. Clay], he too loved music, liked to hang out, had friends,\n   <strong>\n    was busy doing tattoos, that's one of his primary\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    sources of income\n   </strong>\n   in order to pay a lawyer to get his wife from England to the United States.\n   <strong>\n    That was his goal and that was his purpose to stop by the Ottobar that night.\n   </strong>\n   His friend, Dustin Cunningham says lots of people there have tattoos or had tattoos, this is a good source.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State did not object during defense counsel's opening statement. The State waited until its case-in-chief to respond to defense counsel's remark in opening that Mr. Heath was at Ottobar to find clients for his tattoo business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing that remark, the State moved to unredact a portion of Mr. Heath's statement to the police, in which he said that he went to Ottobar intending to sell \"white.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the State\n   sought to unredact and admit into evidence the following portion of Mr. Heath's statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I mean look at nobody's being violent man. Nobody's went in there starting trouble.\n   <strong>\n    I went in there to sit down to sell a got damn bit of white\n   </strong>\n   that they, I'm just trying to make a fucking living. And everybody around me is gotta act like an asshole.\n   <strong>\n    That's all I wanted to do.\n   </strong>\n   You know am I wrong? Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis added). The State argued that defense counsel's remark, that Mr. Heath went to Ottobar for purposes related to his tattoo business, contradicted Mr. Heath's statement to the police and opened the door to Mr. Heath's \"true\" purpose for being at Ottobar, his intent to sell \"white.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel argued that opening statements are not evidence. Furthermore, according to defense counsel, regardless of the opening the door doctrine, the portion of the statement offered by the State was inadmissible bad acts evidence. Defense counsel asserted that Mr. Heath's statement was \"highly prejudicial [with] no probative [value]\" and therefore should not be admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court weighed the probative value and prejudicial effect of the contested portion of Mr. Heath's statement and reasoned that Mr. Heath's explanation for \"being present [at Ottobar] ...\" was probative of \"the manner in which he is alleged to have conducted himself that evening.\" The trial judge expressed that he \"would not have stricken that testimony, although some of the things which have been read, not\n   everything would appear to be fully admissible even under the probative greater than prejudicial [sic] value of standard.\" Ultimately, the trial court \"permit[ted] the State to unredact the testimony with regard to [Mr. Heath's] statement\n   as to why he was there that night with regard to certain business operations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the trial court's ruling, defense counsel requested, and was granted, a continuing objection to references to Mr. Heath's involvement in the \"possession and distribution of controlled dangerous substances[.]\" Additionally, the prosecutor clarified that the trial judge's ruling was limited to the portion of Mr. Heath's statement in which he says that he went to Ottobar intending to sell \"white,\" and \"that the rest of the references to [Mr. Heath] selling drugs is not probative[.]\" The trial judge said, \"Right.\" He explained that other references to selling drugs in Mr. Heath's statement to the police are \"beyond the pale ... it's relevant only to that night and [Mr. Heath's] presence at Ottobar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later in the trial, Mr. Heath's statement to the police, including the portion in which he said that he went to Ottobar intending to sell \"white,\" was admitted into evidence over defense counsel's objection. A recording of Mr. Heath's statement was played in open court for the jury. Mr. Heath did not offer any evidence tending to establish that he visited Ottobar for reasons related to his tattoo business, or for any other reason. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict against Mr. Heath of guilty to involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Heath appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, our intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's ruling that the door had been opened.\n   <em>\n    Heath v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2736, Sept. Term 2015,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203085156\">\n    2018 WL 3085156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. June 21, 2018). First, the intermediate appellate court held that Mr. Heath's statement that he went to Ottobar to sell \"white\" constituted inadmissible bad acts evidence pursuant to Md. Rule 5-404.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-11. Additionally, the court determined that Mr. Heath's counsel\n   did not open the door during her opening statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. Alternatively, the court reasoned that, \"[a]ssuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that [Mr. Heath's] counsel had 'opened the door,' the remedy - permitting the prior acts statement to come in - was not proportionate to the malady - impugning [Mr. Heath's] character in the eyes of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court's error in allowing the statement into evidence was not harmless and therefore reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State petitioned this Court for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   and we granted the petition.\n   <em>\n    State v. Heath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12500977,12500978\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/461/458/\">\n    461 Md. 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12500977,12500978,12500979,12500980\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/193/208/\">\n    193 A.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). We now review whether the trial court erred when it determined that defense counsel opened the door to admitting the defendant's previously redacted statement based upon a comment made in her opening statement and, if so, whether admitting the defendant's statement in response was legal error and an abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the parties ask us to define the standard for reviewing whether a party has opened the door to the admissibility of responsive evidence. The State requests that we review this case as an application of the opening the door doctrine. Mr. Heath, on the other hand, argues that the opening the door doctrine is not applicable here. In addition, the State asserts that we should reverse the Court of Special Appeals on the basis that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted into evidence Mr. Heath's statement regarding his intent to sell \"white\" at Ottobar. The State contends that the admission of Mr. Heath's statement was a proportional response to defense counsel's opening statement regarding Mr. Heath's intent to find tattoo clients at Ottobar. Mr. Heath argues, however, that even if the door was opened, Md. Rule 5-404 prohibits the admission of the rebuttal evidence that the State offered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We hold that the general principles of the opening the door doctrine that allow a party \"to meet fire with fire\" permitted the trial judge to consider whether to admit into evidence Mr. Heath's statement that he intended to sell \"white\" at Ottobar. The trial judge, however, failed to recognize that Mr. Heath's intention to sell drugs at Ottobar injected into the case evidence on a collateral issue. The introduction of a collateral issue and the evidence offered on that issue had nothing to do with the underlying criminal charges and exceeded one of the limitations to the introduction of responsive evidence under the \"opening the door\" doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Another limitation under the \"opening the door\" doctrine is proportionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Terry v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2021761\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/332/329/#p338\">\n    332 Md. 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2021761\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/332/329/#p338\">\n    631 A.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (1993) (.\"[T]he remedy must be proportionate to the malady.\"). The responsive evidence permitted by the trial judge was disproportionate because the jury would likely give more weight to a statement admitted into evidence than to a comment made in opening. This disproportionality stems from the instructions given to the jury. Specifically, the trial judge instructed the jury to make its decision based solely on the evidence admitted and not on what was said in opening statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regardless of whether the statement was a proportionate response, allowing the State to admit Mr. Heath's statement into evidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative under Md. Rule 5-403 and should not have been received. Clearly, the statement was unfairly prejudicial\n   in that it associated Mr. Heath with drugs and likely undermined his credibility with the jury. The jury had to evaluate Mr. Heath's version of what occurred at Ottobar on the evening of September 25, 2014, and his theory of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Given the unfair prejudicial impact that Mr. Heath's statement had on his credibility, and how that likely affected the jury's perception of him, we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury's verdict was in no way influenced by the responsive evidence. In admitting the evidence, the trial judge risked the jury finding Mr. Heath guilty based on the inference that Mr. Heath was \"up to no good.\" Therefore, the statement's admission at trial was not harmless error and Mr. Heath is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The standard for reviewing whether the opening the door doctrine yields to the admissibility of evidence offered at trial was thoroughly reviewed in this Court's recent decision,\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, the doctrine provides a remedy where one party introduces evidence that was previously irrelevant, over objection, and in doing so, makes relevant an issue in the case.

Even if defense counsel's comments were designed to gain the jury's sympathy, the State's responsive evidence failed to rebut that suggestion in a proportionate way.

The State conceivably offered evidence of Mr. Heath's intent to sell drugs because an issue arose, due to defense counsel's opening statement, as to Mr. Heath's true purpose for going to Ottobar. In response to a slight bolstering by defense counsel, the trial court permitted the State to attack the credibility of Mr. Heath by associating him with drugs. An association with drugs is extremely prejudicial given the fact that Mr. Heath was not charged with a drug related offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hannah v.

The evidence offered by the State had the \"adverse effect\" of attacking Mr. Heath's credibility and likely misled the jury to believe that Mr. Heath's intent to engage in drug dealing\n   played a role in the altercation. As such, the probative value of Mr. Heath's statement to the police was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and should not have been admitted. Md. Rule 5-403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Heath's credibility was at issue because of his claim of self-defense. The success of that claim depended upon the jury's willingness to believe Mr. Heath's version of the events. Evidence that Mr. Heath went to Ottobar to sell drugs undermined not only his character but also his credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State did not object to defense counsel's opening remarks when they were made and, instead, waited until its case-in-chief was well underway to seek recourse. The State's decision to forego a timely remedy - while, perhaps, a strategic decision - was not the proper way to remedy defense counsel's malady. A proper response by the State in reaction to defense counsel's opening remarks would have been to object and request that the trial judge strike the comments relating to Mr. Heath's purpose for being at Ottobar and to admonish the jury to disregard the inappropriate portion of defense counsel's opening remarks. To strike the objectionable portions of the opening statement would, indeed, have been a proportional response since counsel had a stipulation about facts that would be redacted from Mr. Heath's pretrial statement to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Harmless Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the present case, the court erred when it allowed the unredacted statement into\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   to combat an inappropriate comment made in\n   <em>\n    opening\n   </em>\n   .

Therefore, according to the State, the comment that was admitted into evidence was harmless because Mr. Heath would have been convicted whether or not the statement was admitted into evidence. Next, the State contends that the statement about planning to sell cocaine in Ottobar was harmless. This is so, according to the State, because the prosecutor did not mention or refer to Mr. Heath's selling of cocaine for the rest of the trial and did not use the statement to characterize Mr. Heath as a drug dealer. Finally, the State asserts that the jury\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   have understood what \"white\" meant and, therefore, did not associate Mr. Heath with drugs in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The State's contentions regarding harmless error fail on several accounts. In our view, the association with the distribution of illicit drugs unfairly impeded Mr. Heath's credibility with the jury. Evidence that Mr. Heath intended to sell drugs unfairly gave the jury reason to disbelieve Mr. Heath's claim of self-defense. As a result, the jury may have convicted Mr. Heath solely because of his association with drugs and illicit activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Next, to influence the verdict, only\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   juror would have needed to understand what the term \"white\" meant. Given the context in which Mr. Heath used the word, we are not persuaded that no one on the jury understood that the term,\n   as used here, referred to cocaine. Pursuant to our holding in\n   <em>\n    Dorsey,\n   </em>\n   we cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury was not influenced by the inflammatory evidence of Mr. Heath's stated intention to sell \"white\" at Ottobar. The error is therefore not harmless and a new trial for Mr. Heath is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defense counsel's comment in her opening statement about what Mr. Heath intended to do at Ottobar was not evidence, but the comment triggered an analysis under the opening the door doctrine. In applying the principles of the opening the door doctrine, the State's responsive evidence was inadmissible because it injected into the case evidence on a collateral issue and was a disproportionate response to defense counsel's opening remark. Furthermore, even if the State's responsive evidence was determined to be non-collateral/relevant, the probative value of Mr. Heath's statement was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 5-403. The trial judge's errors were not harmless, given the unduly prejudicial impact on Mr. Heath's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Therefore, Mr. Heath is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Rather, the issue at trial was how he had come to do so and with what intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mr. Heath elected not to testify at the trial. His version of the incident was presented through a recording of his interview with police detectives that was introduced into evidence by the State. One problem with that recorded interview, from Mr. Heath's perspective, was that he had also made extensive admissions to the detectives that he was involved in selling illegal drugs. With reference to the evening in question, Mr. Heath told the detectives that he had gone to Ottobar not to \"start trouble\" but rather to sell \"a bit of white ... to make a ... living.\" Prior to the trial, the prosecution and the defense agreed that Mr. Heath's admissions of drug dealing, including his purpose in being at Ottobar on the night of the incident, would be redacted from the recording that was to be played for the jury, as well as from the transcript of that recording.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In opening statement, however, defense counsel chose to take the whitewash of the recorded interview a bit further. She told the jury that Mr. Heath had gone to Ottobar that night for the relatively benign purpose of promoting his tattoo business in order to raise money to bring his wife to the United States from Great Britain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argued that the defense had thereby opened the door to restoring Mr. Heath's references to his drug dealing in the recorded statement that\n   was to be played for the jury. In response, the trial court adopted a measured approach. The State was not permitted to restore all of Mr. Heath's admissions of drug dealing to the recording and transcript, but only his statement as to why he had gone to Ottobar. That statement comprises approximately nine seconds of an interview that lasted well over an hour and occupies less than two lines of the 39-page single-spaced transcript of the otherwise redacted recording.\n   Having obtained that relief, the State did not exploit it. The prosecutor did not direct the jury's attention to Mr. Heath's statement about selling a \"bit of white\" - or even present any evidence explaining that \"white\" was a reference to cocaine. Nor did she mention the statement in closing argument. The defense similarly made no mention of it during the remainder of the trial, although the defense dropped the pretense that Mr. Heath was present simply to promote his tattoo business in order to reunite with his wife. No one explained to the jury what \"white\" meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The jury ultimately convicted Mr. Heath of involuntary manslaughter of Mr. Malenski and second-degree assault of Mr. Clay. It acquitted Mr. Heath of the more serious charges, including first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Majority Opinion holds that the manslaughter and assault convictions must be reversed on the ground that the trial court abused its discretion when it restored Mr. Heath's brief statement about why he was at Ottobar that night under the \"open door\" doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   I disagree with that conclusion for two reasons. First, the trial court appropriately exercised its discretion when it allowed a targeted response after defense counsel \"opened the door\" as to Mr. Heath's purpose in going to Ottobar. Second, even if that lone and ambiguous reference to his drug dealing\n   activity should also have been excised from the redacted recording, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    The \"Open Door\" Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Under the \"open door\" doctrine, once a party has opened the door, the opposing party is allowed, as a matter of fairness, to make a tailored response with evidence that, although otherwise inadmissible, has thereby become relevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503541\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/197/1090/#p33\">\n    462 Md. 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43-44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503541\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/197/1090/#p33\">\n    197 A.3d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   There is no likelihood of such an effect in this case. First, the two lines of the recorded statement admitted under the \"open door\" doctrine comprised approximately nine seconds of a recorded interview played for the jury that lasted well over an hour. Neither party directed the jury's attention to that brief moment, nor did either party elaborate on the meaning of \"white\" in that statement. Given that expert testimony is generally required to explain the significance of such a term in a\n   drug prosecution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is quite likely that the term had no impact at all on the jury. Nor were any witnesses called to testify about Mr. Heath's drug dealing on that night or any other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   An instructive comparison is\n   <em>\n    Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12508451\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/205/995/#p352\">\n    463 Md. at 363-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12508451\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/205/995/#p352\">\n    205 A.3d 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the Court held that the State's response to defense testimony that opened the door was disproportionate because the State elicited evidence of the details of a prior incident unrelated to the crime charged. Here, the prosecutor never once mentioned that Mr. Heath was a drug dealer when questioning witnesses or making her closing argument. A stray mention by the defendant himself in an hour-plus recording was the only time \"white\" was ever mentioned before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, as noted above, Mr. Heath was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault. Involuntary manslaughter has no intent element, and second-degree assault requires only an intent to injure. He was acquitted of other charges with stronger intent elements. In his recorded interview with the detectives, Mr. Heath admitted to participating in the altercation (while admittedly being intoxicated), said that he had attempted to stab someone in the deltoid with a knife, and contended that he had accidentally slashed his victim in the throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mr. Heath's only defense to the two charges of which he was convicted was that he had acted in self-defense. Far from undermining that defense, his own statement that he had gone to Ottobar\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to \"start trouble,\" but just to sell \"white\" in order \"to make a ... living\" was perfectly consistent with that defense. If it was error to admit the statement, it was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Chief Judge Barbera has advised that she joins this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The parties did not involve the court in their agreement, but their agreement was brought to the court's attention.
