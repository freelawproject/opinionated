The petitioner\n   claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and improperly (1) denied his motions to appoint habeas counsel, and (2) rejected his claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. We disagree and, accordingly, dismiss the petitioner's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On December 17, 2014, the petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) and one count of criminal violation of a protective order in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-223. The petitioner also admitted to violating his probation in two instances and violating a conditional discharge in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. According to the factual basis provided by the state at the petitioner's plea hearing, the petitioner\n   forced his way into a house occupied by a woman with whom he had a previous relationship, where he proceeded to strike her \"several times in the head, and then grabbed a knife from the kitchen and attempted to stab her ....\" The prosecutor indicated that the woman's daughter called the police, and, at that time, the petitioner fled from the residence. After canvassing the petitioner, the court determined that the pleas had been \"knowingly and voluntarily made\" and were supported by a factual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the petitioner's sentencing hearing on February 25, 2015, the court imposed a total effective sentence of eight years incarceration followed by seven years of special parole. The court terminated the other probations that the petitioner was serving at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 29, 2015, the petitioner, who was self-represented at the time, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner alleged, inter alia, that he was living at the victim's house on the day on which the crime was committed. He contended that, because he lived there, he \"could not be guilty of burglary in the first degree ....\" Based on this contention, he alleged that his attorney at the time of the plea hearing, public defender David Egan, provided ineffective assistance by recommending that he plead guilty to that crime and \"take [nine] years and [seven] years special parole.\" Id. He also contended that Egan never \"did his due diligence to remotely look into fighting\" his case, nor did he investigate \"the facts in the case or the witnesses ....\" Additionally, the petitioner asserted that Egan and the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , had violated his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights because Egan was ineffective and the trial court had refused to grant his motion to dismiss Egan as his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his return, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, indicated that he was without sufficient\n   information to admit or deny any of the factual allegations contained in the petitioner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. As such, the respondent indicated he would leave the petitioner to his proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 9, 2015, after the court received the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, it referred the petitioner to the Office of the Chief Public Defender for appointment of counsel. On August 17, 2015, Attorney James Ruane and his law firm, Ruane Attorneys at Law, entered an appearance on the petitioner's behalf. On December 6, 2016, however, the petitioner moved to dismiss counsel because, in his view, since the time he was appointed counsel, the petitioner had been \"represented by [three] different attorneys\" from the firm. He argued that each of the attorneys had \"done nothing at all in the petitioner's case\" and that his most recent attorney, Daniel F. Lage, had refused to investigate\n   his case. The petitioner requested that the habeas court dismiss Lage and permit him to represent himself, and that a trial be scheduled for March 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 30, 2017, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Bright, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard arguments on the petitioner's motion to dismiss counsel. After canvassing the petitioner and cautioning him about the challenges of self-representation, the court stated: \"[The petitioner] has thought through this. He understands the challenges of representing himself, but he's been working diligently in preparing his case. He has a right to represent himself. He says he's prepared to go to trial. I'm going to grant his motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 9, 2017, fifteen days before the habeas trial was scheduled to begin, the petitioner filed a written motion with the habeas court for \"[appointment] of special counsel.\" The petitioner indicated in the motion that he wanted \"special counsel to assist the petitioner with his habeas case.\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.\n   </em>\n   , who\n   presided over the habeas trial, denied the motion, indicating that the \"petitioner specifically asked to dismiss appointed counsel and proceed [self-represented].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner's habeas trial was held on May 24, 2017. At the outset of the proceeding, the petitioner renewed his request for counsel to assist him in his representation. He stated: \"Now, being that I got the private investigator and the expert psychologist to do the work ... I need ... an attorney to be able to help me represent this because I'm having problems to understand why am I still being charged with burglary one when I live at that address and I have all the proof ....\" The court responded: \"[Y]ou don't get to pick and choose who your attorney is when you're having an appointed attorney. And the fact that you're disappointed with the attorney or you hold the attorney in low regard or the attorney is not presenting the case the way you would want is not grounds for disqualifying the attorney and getting a new attorney. And you opted to represent yourself, and that's what you're doing. If I were to appoint a new attorney now, that would be like allowing indigents to pick and choose their own attorney, which is not allowed. So you'll have to proceed and do the best you can in representing yourself.\" The petitioner did not revisit his request for counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, the self-represented petitioner presented testimony from three witnesses, including himself, and offered twelve exhibits, nine of which were admitted into evidence. The respondent presented no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a memorandum of decision dated May 26, 2017, the habeas court denied the petitioner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court aptly observed that the petitioner claimed that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by (1) failing to conduct adequate pretrial investigation and preparation, (2) failing to\n   request that the petitioner undergo a competency examination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d, and (3) failing to advise the petitioner that one cannot burglarize one's own residence. The court concluded that the petitioner was unable to prevail on any of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Soon thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (g) ; and an application for waiver of fees, costs, and expenses and appointment of counsel on appeal (fee waiver application). See General Statutes \u00a7 52-259b. He asserted the following grounds for his proposed appeal: \"(1) I don't have money I'm flat broke,\" and \"(2) my [sixth] and [fourteenth] amendment right[s] are violated. I have evidence to show that my ... then Attorney Egan was ineffective and also the Milford court [\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J\n   </em>\n   .] was bias[ed]. My\n   due process was violated by the court [and] Attorney Egan.\" The habeas court denied the petition for certification to appeal but granted the fee waiver application and appointed counsel for purposes of the appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and improperly (1) denied his motions to appoint habeas counsel, and (2) rejected his claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 52-470 (g) provides: \"No appeal from the judgment rendered in a habeas corpus proceeding brought by or on behalf of a person who has been convicted of a crime in order to obtain such person's release may be taken unless the appellant, within ten days after the case is decided, petitions the judge before whom the case was tried or, if such judge is unavailable, a judge of the Superior Court designated by the Chief Court Administrator, to certify that a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the court having jurisdiction and the judge so certifies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As our Supreme Court has explained, one of the goals our legislature intended by enacting this statute was \"to limit the number of appeals filed in criminal cases and hasten the final conclusion of the criminal justice process ....\"\n   <em>\n    Iovieno\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69246\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/689/#p699\">\n    242 Conn. 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 699,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%201003\">\n    699 A.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). \"[T]he legislature intended to discourage frivolous habeas appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/608/#p616\">\n    230 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%20126\">\n    646 A.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). \"[ Section] 52-470 (b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   acts as a limitation on the scope of review, and not the jurisdiction, of the appellate tribunal.\" (Footnote added.)\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235622\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/125/744/#p750\">\n    125 Conn.

The respondent argues, however, that the petitioner failed to raise this issue as a ground for appeal either by stating it in his petition for certification to appeal or in his fee waiver application on which he expressly relied in his petition for certification to appeal. Thus, the respondent argues that the petitioner is unable to claim on appeal that the court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal on this ground. The petitioner acknowledges that he did not include this ground in his petition for certification to appeal but alternatively \"seeks to prevail on his claim pursuant to the plain error doctrine.\" We address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is well established that a petitioner cannot demonstrate that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying a petition for certification to appeal if the issue raised on appeal was never raised before the court at\n   the time that it considered the petition for certification to appeal as a ground on which certification should be granted.

The respondent argues, inter alia, that considering the petitioner's claim of plain error invites petitioners who have been denied certification to appeal to circumvent the bounds of limited review pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (g) simply by couching wholly unpreserved grounds as plain error. The respondent correctly acknowledges, however, that in appeals from the denial of a petition for certification to appeal, this\n   court previously has considered claims of plain error that were not included as potential grounds for appeal in a petition for certification to appeal.

This is because we conclude that the petitioner's reliance on the plain error doctrine is flawed for a more fundamental reason, namely, the claim was adequately preserved during the habeas trial. The plain error doctrine is set forth at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, which provides in relevant part: \"The court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court....\" The plain error doctrine \"is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either\n   <em>\n    not properly preserved or never raised\n   </em>\n   at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment, for reasons of policy. ... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and\n   integrity of and public confidence in\n   the judicial proceedings. ... Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly.... Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion ... that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review.... [Thus, an appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] ... unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147982\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/781/#p823\">\n    293 Conn. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=981%20A.2d%201030\">\n    981 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454912,12454913,12454914,12454915,12454916,12454917,12454918,12454919,12454920,12454921,12454922,12454908,12454909,12454910,12454911\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/954/\">\n    560 U.S. 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454918,12454919,12454920,12454890,12454989\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/3386/\">\n    130 S.

Because this claim was raised and ruled on by the habeas court and, thus, was properly preserved prior to and during the habeas trial, the petitioner's reliance on the plain error doctrine is misplaced.
