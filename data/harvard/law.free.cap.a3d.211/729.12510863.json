Consistent with the language of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(c), we hold that there is no per se or presumptive rule that materials prepared or collected before litigation are not prepared in anticipation of litigation. Instead, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(c), there is a multi-part, fact-specific test. The first inquiry is whether the materials were prepared or collected in anticipation of litigation or trial by another party or that party's representative. If so, to obtain the materials, a party must satisfy a two-part\n   standard. The party seeking the materials must (1) show a substantial need for the discovery, and (2) demonstrate that he or she is unable, without undue hardship, to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On leave granted, defendant appeals from an April 13, 2018 order that compelled it to produce photographs and recorded witness statements taken and obtained by an investigator for defendant's insurance carrier before a complaint had been filed and before defense counsel was retained. The trial court ordered the production of those materials, essentially reasoning that because there was no pending litigation, the insurance carrier was not acting in anticipation of litigation. We reject that analysis as inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(c). Accordingly, we reverse the order compelling discovery and remand for an analysis under the standard set forth in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We discern the facts and procedural history from the record developed on the motion to compel discovery. On October 9, 2015, plaintiff Caroline Paladino was a guest at a wedding reception at defendant's catering facility. As she was walking down a staircase, she fell and injured her left knee, lower back, and right ankle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff immediately reported her accident to defendant, and that same day, defendant prepared an accident incident report. Defendant had general liability insurance, and shortly after the accident, gave notice to its insurer. The insurer then retained an investigator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two weeks after the accident, on October 22, 2015, a senior claims examiner for defendant's insurer spoke with plaintiff about\n   the accident. That same day, the claims examiner sent plaintiff a letter advising her that an investigator was looking into the accident. The claims examiner then requested the investigator to photograph the accident scene and obtain statements from plaintiff and representatives of defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The claims examiner later certified that her purpose in retaining the investigator was to \"prepare a defense for [defendant] in the event that [plaintiff] filed a lawsuit.\" The claims examiner also certified that the insurer was not disputing coverage and did not hire the investigator to look into whether the insurer owed coverage to defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The investigator arranged to meet with and take a recorded statement from plaintiff on October 26, 2015. On the day of the appointment, the investigator was contacted by an attorney who informed him that he had been retained by plaintiff and the appointment with plaintiff was cancelled. The next day, plaintiff's counsel sent a letter informing the insurance carrier that he was representing plaintiff in connection with the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 26, 2015, the investigator inspected defendant's catering facility, took photographs of the staircase, and prepared a diagram of the accident scene. The investigator also obtained recorded oral statements from two of defendant's employees. Approximately one week later, on November 1, 2015, the investigator obtained a recorded oral statement from a third employee of defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 3, 2015, plaintiff's counsel and a photographer visited defendant's facility. They measured, inspected, and photographed the staircase where plaintiff had fallen. The following month, in January 2016, defendant's insurance carrier provided plaintiff's counsel with a copy of video surveillance that had captured plaintiff falling on the staircase. Plaintiff's counsel was also provided with a copy of the incident\n   report prepared on the day of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 26, 2017, plaintiff and her husband filed suit against defendant. Plaintiff alleged that defendant was liable for the\n   injuries she suffered because defendant had been negligent. Plaintiff also alleged that defendant had breached its express and implied warranties and had not properly maintained its property. Her husband alleged loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In August 2017, defendant filed an answer. Thereafter, in response to interrogatories, defendant disclosed that the investigator had taken photographs of the staircase where plaintiff fell, had prepared a diagram, and had obtained recorded statements from three of defendant's employees. Defendant represented that none of those employees witnessed plaintiff's fall. Defendant did not produce the photographs, diagram, or statements, asserting that they were protected by the work-product privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March 2018, plaintiff filed a motion to compel the production of the photographs and the recorded statements by defendant's three employees. Plaintiff had initially also sought the diagram prepared by the investigator, but later withdrew that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Without hearing oral argument, the trial court granted plaintiff's motion in an order entered on April 13, 2018. That same day, the court placed its reasons for that order on the record. In its oral decision, the trial court relied on\n   <em>\n    Pfender v. Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"494872\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/336/379/\">\n    336 N.J. Super. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"494872\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/336/379/\">\n    765 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 2001), and reasoned that because the photographs and statements were obtained before litigation, the insurer \"may have\" had interests apart from protecting its insured's rights. Thus, the trial court ordered the photographs and statements produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant sought leave to appeal the order compelling the production. We denied leave, but the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and remanded the appeal to us \"to consider [it] on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Paladino v. Auletto Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499737,12499738\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/234/576/\">\n    234 N.J. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499736,12499737,12499738\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/191/1278/\">\n    191 A.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On this appeal, defendant makes two arguments. First, it contends that we should reject the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Pfender\n   </em>\n   and, instead,\n   adopt the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Medford v. Duggan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613459\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/323/127/\">\n    323 N.J. Super. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613459\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/323/127/\">\n    732 A.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. Div. 1999). Second, defendant argues that, applying the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Medford\n   </em>\n   , we should reverse the trial court because plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin with an overview of the work-product doctrine and\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(c). Initially, the doctrine and rule should be understood as exceptions to New Jersey's general policy of encouraging full and open discovery of all relevant information. In most situations, parties to litigation have the right to discovery of all relevant information concerning the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(a);\n   <em>\n    Capital Health Sys., Inc. v. Horizon Healthcare Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12300996\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/230/73/#p80\">\n    230 N.J. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12300996\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/230/73/#p80\">\n    165 A.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There are, however, exceptions to that general rule. Under one exception, a party may withhold \"privileged\" information. In that regard,\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(a) states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of\n   any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition and location of any books, documents, electronically stored information, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   One of the recognized privileges is the work-product doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Boyle v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dinter\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"where a fact witness testifies for an adverse party, the factual statement of that witness must be produced on demand for use in cross-examination as a potential tool for impeachment of credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"333208\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/252/84/#p100\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, we hold that the trial court failed to apply the appropriate fact-specific analysis required by the work-product doctrine and\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:10-2(c). The trial court here simply reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Pfender\n   </em>\n   stood for the proposition that statements given to investigators hired by an insurer before the commencement of\n   litigation were not protected. The issue called for a more detailed analysis. In that regard, the court needed an appropriate record to allow it to determine whether the photographs and statements were prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial. The court did not need to accept the certification submitted by the insurance claims examiner, but the court did need to evaluate that certification. Furthermore, to reject the certification, the court needed an evidentiary record that would allow it to make such a factual or credibility finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the current record does not allow an analysis of the second part of the test. The information in the current record is insufficient for us to determine whether plaintiff showed a substantial need for the discovery and whether she was unable, without undue hardship, to obtain the substantial equivalent of the photographs or statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With regard to the photographs, the insurance investigator took photographs of the stairs on October 26, 2015. Plaintiff's counsel and a photographer took photographs of the stairs on December 3, 2015. There is also a video recording, which shows plaintiff's fall. On remand, the court will need to consider that evidence and make a determination whether there is any showing that there was a change to the staircase that plaintiff was not able to capture in the photographs that her counsel took in December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trial court will also need to analyze the witness statements. We have previously held that statements of a party or witness always satisfy the first part of the standard; that is, there is a substantial need for the discovery of such statements.\n   <em>\n    Medford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613459\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/323/127/\">\n    323 N.J.

Here, plaintiff acknowledges in her brief that the three witnesses who gave statements to the insured's investigator have not been deposed. Plaintiff therefore should be given the opportunity to conduct those depositions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613459\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/323/127/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining a deposition \"may often constitute the substantial equivalent of [a] prior statement\");\n   <em>\n    Carbis Sales, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3334441\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/397/64/#p81\">\n    397 N.J.
