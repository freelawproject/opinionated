Mr. Junek poses the following question for our review: \"Is intent or scienter an element of child neglect under Md. Code. Ann., Family Law (\"Fam. Law\") \u00a7 5-701(s) ?\" For the reasons outlined below, we answer Mr. Junek's question in the negative, and affirm the Administrative Law Judge's finding of indicated child neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The underlying facts of this case are not in dispute. On September 3, 2014, Mr. Junek was responsible for taking his older son to preschool and younger son to daycare before going to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Junek first dropped his older son off at preschool. However, instead of dropping off his younger son at daycare, Mr. Junek drove directly to his workplace at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River. Mr. Junek arrived at work just before 9:00 a.m., parked his car, overlooked his 17-month-old son in the backseat of the car, and went into work. At about 3:20 p.m. that afternoon, Mr. Junek received a phone call from his wife who had arrived at the daycare center to pick up their younger son. Ms. Junek was unable to find her younger son's car seat that Mr. Junek was supposed to leave at the daycare that morning, and called Mr. Junek to inquire as to its whereabouts. It was then, for the first time that day, that Mr. Junek realized he had forgotten to drop his younger son off at daycare, and left the toddler in the backseat of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Junek went immediately to his car, where he found his younger son strapped into his car seat, \"unconscious, unresponsive,\n   and not breathing.\" Mr. Junek, with the help of a nurse who was passing by the car at the time, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the child and called emergency services. Attempts to revive the child failed, and he\n   was pronounced dead at the scene. The outside temperature that day had reached a high of 85 degrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    The Investigation and Administrative Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Respondent, the St. Mary's County Department of Social Services (\"the Department\") initiated an investigation into the above events. At the conclusion of its investigation, the Department notified Mr. Junek that it had rendered a finding of \"indicated child neglect[ ]\" against him. Mr. Junek challenged the Department's finding and requested a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings. An Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") held a hearing on June 23, 2016 regarding Mr. Junek's appeal of the neglect finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the hearing, the ALJ concluded that the Department \"ha[d] established by a preponderance of the evidence that the finding of indicated child neglect [was] supported by credible evidence and [was] consistent with the law.\" In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ commented that \"there is no intent requirement under section 5-701(s) [,]\" and that no such requirement appears in the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 07.02.07.12 (Child Neglect Disposition). Mr. Junek filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for St. Mary's County. A hearing was conducted by Judge David Densford, who subsequently affirmed the ALJ's decision and accompanying legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Court of Special Appeals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Junek filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, presenting the single issue of whether \" 'neglect'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   under \u00a7 5-701(s) of the Family Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland require[s] proof of an element of\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   ?\"\n   <em>\n    J.J. v.

However, Mr. Junek urges this Court to consider other portions of the COMAR, the Family Law Article, the Criminal Law Article, and prior Maryland case law to support his position that an implicit intent requirement should be read into the definition of \"neglect\" in \u00a7 5-701(s).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Maryland Code, Family Law Article \u00a7 5-701(b)(1) defines \"[a]buse\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (i) the physical or mental injury of a child under circumstances that indicate that the child's health or welfare is harmed or at substantial risk of being harmed by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   1. a parent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   2. a household member or family member;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   3. a person who has permanent or temporary care or custody of the child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   4. a person who has responsibility for supervision of the child; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   5. a person who, because of the person's position or occupation, exercises authority over the child; or\n   (ii) sexual abuse of a child, whether physical injuries are sustained or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Importantly, sub-section (b)(2) continues on to exclude \"physical injury of a child by accidental means[ ]\" from the definition. Additionally, COMAR 07.02.07.11A permits a finding of indicated child physical abuse based on credible evidence of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (a) A physical injury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (b) A child victim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (c) A parent, caregiver, or household or family member of the alleged victim responsible for the alleged abuse; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (d) Circumstances including the nature, extent, and location of the injury indicating that the alleged victim's health or welfare was harmed or was at substantial risk of harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Similar to sub-section (b)(2) of Family Law Article \u00a7 5-701, COMAR 07.02.07.11C(2)(c)(i) rules out a finding of child abuse where \"[t]he injury resulted from accidental or unintended contact with the child and was not caused by a reckless disregard for the child's health or welfare[.]\" Family Law Article \u00a7 5-701(s) and COMAR 07.02.07.12,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which define and provide guidance on child neglect dispositions, do not have a similar or equivalent exclusion for accidental or unintentional conduct such as the one present in child abuse dispositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

In applying this precedent, Mr. Junek posited in his brief that \"[c]hild neglect has been described as a form of child abuse[,]\" and that \"it is illogical to impose a\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   requirement for child abuse but not for child neglect.\" In support of this contention, Mr. Junek further points to\n   <em>\n    Owens v. Prince George's County Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court of Special Appeals upheld a finding of indicated child neglect based on a guardian's intentional act of ordering the child from the home and refusing to allow the child to return.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837755\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/31/#p54\">\n    182 Md.

However, Mr. Junek's application of\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   to the present case is unpersuasive. While\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   deals with intentional conduct, it does not stand for the general rule that conduct must be intentional for a finding of indicated child neglect. Nowhere in the\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   opinion did the Court of Special Appeals rely on the guardian's actions being intentional. Rather, the Court merely concluded that there was substantial evidence for the ALJ to conclude that the guardian kicked the child out of her home, constituting neglect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837755\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/31/#p54\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A similar conclusion could have been reached had the conduct been unintentional, as are the facts in the present case.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McClanahan\n   </em>\n   are similarly inapplicable to the present case. It is undisputed that\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McClanahan\n   </em>\n   address an intent requirement for child abuse, not child neglect. Mr. Junek attempts to extend the application of these two cases to child neglect situations. The Court of Special Appeals has recently addressed this precise issue, observing the distinctions between the child neglect and abuse statutes and regulations, under strikingly similar facts to those in the present case, in\n   <em>\n    I.B. v.

In reviewing COMAR 07.02.07.11 and .12,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that the Department of Social Services need not prove intent to establish neglect, but that a successful prosecution of child abuse on the other hand must establish proof of intent.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   COMAR 07.02.07.11C,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   COMAR 07.02.07.12 C. Mr. Junek cites to the principle that \"a statute is to be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense[,]\" for the proposition that it would be at odds with the intent of the General Assembly to require intent for a finding of child abuse, while not requiring the same element of intent for a finding of child neglect under the same statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Western Correctional Institution v. Geiger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/#p142\">\n    371 Md. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1126302\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/371/125/#p142\">\n    807 A.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42 (2002). We disagree. The General Assembly amended the definition of abuse in 2017 to exclude injury of a child by accidental means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Maryland Laws, Chapter 652. No such amendment was offered or adopted for the definition of\n   neglect.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Fam. Law. \u00a7 5-701(b),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Fam. Law \u00a7 5-701(s). \"As such, an intent requirement cannot be imputed to the definition of neglect within the same subtitle, especially because abuse and neglect are two distinct concepts.\"\n   <em>\n    J.J. v.

Law\") defines neglect as \"the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     intentional failure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs and mental health of a minor[,]\" the definition\n   of neglect in the Family Law Article requires a similar element of intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1(5)(i) (emphasis added). However, we find such an action by the General Assembly contrary to Mr. Junek's position. By including the phrase \"intentional failure\" in the definition of criminal child neglect, but not amending \u00a7 5-701(s) of the Family Law Article to include this same language, the General Assembly has made clear that the elements of criminal and civil child neglect differ with regard to scienter. \"[T]he [General Assembly] is [presumed] to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\"\n   <em>\n    Donlon v.
