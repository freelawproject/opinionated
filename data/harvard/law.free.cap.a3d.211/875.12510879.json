Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   Near the close of the 2013 fall semester, student members of Pi Delta Psi, Inc. traveled from their college campus in Manhattan to the Pocono Mountains. They rented a house to perform the final rites and rituals of their new-member program, as they had quietly done in previous semesters. This time, something went horribly wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   A ritual known as \"The Crossing,\" a gauntlet where members tackle and body-slam associate members,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   killed a freshman. The Commonwealth filed charges against the student members; certain national officers; and Pi Delta Psi, Inc., itself. A jury convicted the corporation of hazing, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, hindering apprehension, and conspiracy to hinder apprehension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The corporation now appeals from its judgment of sentence, imposing an aggregate of ten years of probation and fining it $ 112,500.00. It raises many appellate issues, including new, constitutional theories regarding its Due Process rights. As we will explain, none of its claims have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   However, the trial court imposed a probationary condition barring the corporation from conducting any business in Pennsylvania for a decade. This Court can find nothing in our statutes or at common law that affords a trial court authority to outlaw a corporation from an entire state. We therefore must vacate,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , that illegal sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In all other respects, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pi Delta Psi, Inc. came into being on April 14, 1995, when its founders incorporated it as non-profit corporation\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   under\n   New York law. They established it as a national, Asian-interest-based fraternal organization. Like most fraternities, the corporation has constituted subsidiaries of itself (a process known as \"colonization\") on various college and university campus throughout the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The corporation developed, published, and directed a nation-wide, new-member-education program for would-be brothers in its \"Pledge Manual.\" The new-member curriculum included physical rites and rituals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, the Baruch College Colony of Pi Delta Psi took its associate members to Pennsylvania for the final stages of the program. The members performed the Crossing Ritual quite brutally and caused the death of an associate member. Two other New York-based chapters of the corporation were also present at the hazing event. The Pennsylvania State University Chapter of Pi Delta Psi (the only functioning subsidiary in the Commonwealth) had no involvement with or knowledge of this incident.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    A.K.A. \"pledges.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    24 P.S. \u00a7 5353, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504(a), 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2702(a)(1), 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 903, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5105(a)(3), and 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 (a)(5).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    As the corporation is a non-profit, we pause to consider our jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    In civil matters involving non-profit corporations, this Court, applying 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 762(a)(5), has held \"jurisdiction over this appeal properly lies with the Commonwealth Court, because [one of the parties] is a non-profit corporation.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Zikria v.

The national president (who is an alumnus member of Pi Delta Psi) also helped the student members and officers conceal the cause of death and the corporation's connection to it from investigators. He instructed the student members and officers to lie to police and to hide the fraternity's letters, heraldry, and regalia before officers searched the rented house.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Facing criminal homicide charges, members decided to cooperate with prosecutors and began to implicate the corporation. The Commonwealth eventually charged the corporation with a host of crimes, the most severe of which was murder of the third degree.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The jury acquitted the corporation of murder and voluntary manslaughter but convicted it on charges of involuntary manslaughter and many lesser offenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The trial court fined and sentenced the corporation to probation. The conditions of probation required the corporation to \"pay all fines, restitution, and costs within five years;\" to cease all \"business within the Commonwealth during its period of probation, which shall include maintaining, creating, endorsing, or hosting any chapter, associate chapter, or colony at any college, university, or other institution of higher education, and hosting, convening, or attending any event or activity within the Commonwealth;\" and to notify all colleges and university with a Pi Delta Psi chapter or colony of its conviction and sentence.

After explaining why they are all waived or meritless, we will consider the legality of the corporation's probationary sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     A. The Exclusion of Expert Testimony\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    First, the corporation claims the trial court deprived it of a fair trial by excluding certain expert testimony. The trial court prohibited David L. Westol, an expert on collegiate fraternities, from testifying that the corporation met the national standard of care by promulgating and enforcing an anti-hazing policy. The corporation argues that decision was incorrect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Such an argument disregards our deferential standard of review for a trial court's evidentiary rulings. When reviewing a decision to admit or to exclude expert opinion testimony, we use an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Commonwealth v. Powell\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323477\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/171/294/#p307\">\n     171 A.3d 294\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 307 (Pa. Super. 2017),\n    <em>\n     appeal denied\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495923,12495924,12495925,12495926\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/183/975/\">\n     183 A.3d 975\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Pa. 2018). Abuse of discretion only \"occurs if the trial court renders a judgment that is manifestly unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; that fails to apply the law; or that is motivated by partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Hutchinson v. Penske Truck Leasing Co.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968493,8968454,687751\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/876/978/\">\n     876 A.2d 978\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 984 (Pa. Super. 2005). In other words, a reasonable judgment by the trial court is not an abuse of discretion, even if this Court disagrees with that judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Here, the corporation makes no argument that the trial court's decision to prohibit Mr. Westol from testifying about the standard of care was manifestly unreasonable. Nor does it identify which Rule of Evidence the trial court supposedly violated. The corporation merely contends the trial court's decision was incorrect and negatively impacted its defensive strategy. The corporation's assertion of an incorrect\n    judgment does not persuade us that the trial court abused its discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The trial court, in preventing Mr. Westol from opining for the jury that the corporation's anti-hazing policy and training met Greek Life's national standard of care, explained its ruling as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    An opinion is not excludable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue. PA R.E. 704. An expert opinion that embraces an ultimate issue may be objectionable on other grounds, however, as the Pennsylvania Superior Court observed:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    Pennsylvania law allows expert opinion testimony on the ultimate issue. As with lay opinions, the trial judge has discretion to admit or exclude expert opinions on the ultimate issue depending on the helpfulness of the testimony versus its potential to cause confusion or prejudice.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      McManamon v. Washko\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8470475\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/906/1259/#p1278\">\n     906 A.2d 1259\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1278-1279 (Pa. Super. 2006).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    * * * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    As to Mr. Westol's opinion that \"[the corporation] acted within the standard of care, custom, and practice within the community of Greek-lettered organizations\" and that it \"was not negligent nor did it violate any duty of care towards [the victim],\" Mr. Westol did not testify using legal terms of art, i.e., \"standard of care,\" \"negligence,\" etc., as he did in his Report. From reading the Report, it is not clear that he makes these assertions independent of an opinion that [the corporation's] conduct was consistent with the standards within Greek-lettered organizations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    Whether [the corporation] acted in conformity with the standards of conduct or care found in other [Greek-lettered organizations] is of no relevance in a criminal case. It will not help jurors understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. For each of these reasons, Mr. Westol's opinion that \"[the corporation] acted within the standard of care, custom, and practice within the community of Greek-lettered organizations\" and that it \"was not negligent nor did it violate any duty of care towards [the victim],\" is irrelevant and inadmissible.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Trial Court Opinion, 11/8/17, at 29, 35-36 (some citations and punctuation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The trial court's opinion rejecting Mr. Westol's opinion testimony on the national standard of care is firmly rooted in the Rules of Evidence, the criminal law, and our appellate precedents. The court's analysis is quite reasonable and does not misapply or override the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Because the prosecution's theory as to this corporation's guilt rested entirely upon its vicarious liability for its agents' misconduct, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the expert's opinion on the standard of care. \"Corporations are criminally accountable for the actions of a 'high managerial agent' who commits a wrongdoing in the scope of his office. This corporate accountability is based upon a simple principal/agency relationship and not upon a corporation affirming the officer's act.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Commonwealth v. Penn Valley Resorts, Inc.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"635303\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/343/387/\">\n     343 Pa.Super. 387\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"635303\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/343/387/\">\n     494 A.2d 1139\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1142 (1985) (interpreting and applying 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 307 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Thus, the instant corporation would be vicariously liable for everything that the colony's officers and the national president did in furtherance of the new-member-education program and its initiations rituals, regardless of whether the corporation met the national standard of care by disavowing hazing. To the extent that the local and national officers committed any crimes in causing the death of this associate member, so did the corporation, i.e., the principle whose interests all of the agents/officers\n    were pursuing when they physically assaulted the freshman and tried to hide their crimes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Even if the corporation's anti-hazing policy and training met the national standard of care for all Greek-lettered organizations, meeting industry standards will not excuse involuntary manslaughter, hazing, and the other crimes for which the jury convicted this corporation, when 'high managerial agents' committed those crimes specifically as part of the rites and rituals for imitation into the corporation's membership. Moreover, if the officers of the Baruch Colony and the national president met the national standard of care and this associate member died anyway, then Greek Life certainly needs to raise its national standards. If, on the other hand, their conduct did not meet the national standard of care by their conduct, then the corporation, vicariously speaking, did not meet it, as well. Either way, the opinion testimony that the corporation met the national standard of care was of no relevance to the ultimate issue of the corporation's criminal culpability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Thus, the trial court was well within its sphere of discretion in deeming Mr. Westol's opinion on the corporation's conformity to the national standard of care irrelevant in a criminal trial. Accordingly, we dismiss the first appellate issue as meritless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     B. The Exclusion of Certain Exhibits\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    As its second appellate issue, the corporation argues that the trial court erroneously excluded two exhibits from evidence. The first piece of excluded evidence was a letter to the prosecutors, which the corporation claims would show that the student members performed the Crossing in a manner \"beyond the normal Rituals.\" Pi Delta Psi's Brief at 14 (some punctuation omitted). The other piece of evidence was \"an excerpt from Daniel Lee's proper statement transcript showing the instructions by the prosecutors to the witness ....\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    at 15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The corporation cites no case law or authority to support its contention that the exhibits were admissible.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    14 - 15. It simply offers bald assertions of error without any basis in law or citations to the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure do not permit conclusory arguments. Each distinct issue in the argument section of a brief must, at a minimum, contain \"citations of authorities as are deemed pertinent.\" Pa.R.A.P. 2119(a). When a party \"cites no pertinent authority to substantiate [its] claim ... appellant's issue is waived.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Commonwealth v.

It does not, however, claim that this was an error of law or an abuse of discretion, much less explain why reversal is in order. The corporation's brief only summarizes and editorializes on Wong's testimony.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Pi Delta Psi's Brief at 14.

Specifically, it requests judicially imposed \"use immunity\" for its 34 co-defendants - the student members who performed the physical hazing. The corporation only called Jimmie Mei. It claims that its attempt to examine Mei illustrates what would have transpired, if it had also called the other 33 co-defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Mei asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Commonwealth and the trial court both declined to immunize Mei from prosecution. Next, the corporation asked the trial court to immunize Mei from his testimony being used against him - hence, \"use immunity.\" The trial court refused. According to the corporation, this refusal deprived it of its rights under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Pi Delta Psi's Brief at 18.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In its appellate brief, the corporation quotes\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Government of the Virgin Islands v.

The Verdict Slip\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    For its seventh appellate issue, the corporation asserts a novel theory - namely, that the trial court's listing of \"Guilty\" before \"Not Guilty\" on the verdict slip violated both constitutions. It claims (without reference to any source) that, historically, verdict slips were blank, and jurors handwrote the words \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" after each offense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    In the corporation's view, the multiple-choice-style verdict slip violates the constitutional presumption of innocence. It fears that this tricked the jurors into subconsciously thinking the corporation had to prove its own innocence. To make this connection, the corporation cites and quotes articles from\n    <em>\n     The Legal Intelligencer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     The Philadelphia Inquirer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     The Tribune Democrat\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     The Star-Ledger\n    </em>\n    , websites seeking to abolish judicial elections, and sociological studies correlating ballot position\n    to election results.

Finally, the Commonwealth notes that the trial court gave the standard jury instruction on the presumption of innocence, thereby negating the corporation's theory of a Due Process violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    We disagree with the Commonwealth as to waiver. Its argument places the corporation in a catch-22. The corporation advances a new, constitutional theory to expand Due Process protections under both constitutions. Thus, it cannot possibly cite precedents that support its reading of the Due Process Clauses, because no court has yet concluded that such protections exist. That fact may favor the Commonwealth on the merits, but it is hardly grounds for waiver. Otherwise, no party could ever frame a new theory of constitutional jurisprudence for judicial review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The Commonwealth also erroneously contends that this Court disposed of the corporation's claim in\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Selenski\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    . There, we found waiver of this constitutional question due to an underdeveloped appellate argument. While the panel proceeded to offer\n    <em>\n     dictum\n    </em>\n    that, \"even if Appellant had not waived the issue, his argument is without merit,\" that observation was not precedential.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    at 1235. Thus,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Selinski\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    does not control the merits of this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    We therefore address those merits now.

For instance, the corporation claims that (1) the \"Guilty\"-before-\"Not-Guilty\" verdict slip violated its fundamental right to be presumed innocent; (2) scholarly research ties primacy of place on a ballot to an increased chance of winning, which the corporation relates to the jury system; and (3) amending the verdict slip would cost the Commonwealth nothing.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Pi Delta Psi's Brief at 25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Commonwealth attacks the corporation's theory on the second prong of the test. In the Commonwealth's view, because the trial court instructed the jury on burden of proof and presumption of innocence, there was no procedural deprivation of the corporation's right to be presumed innocent. The Commonwealth also emphasizes that we legally must presume that the jury followed those instructions without any evidence to contrary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    That the corporation had a right to be presumed innocent at trial \"is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Coffin v.

The corporation claims the \"Guilty\"-before-\"Not-Guilty\" verdict slip jeopardized its most fundamental right of criminal procedure. It therefore satisfies the first prong of the\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Mathews\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      /\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Bundy\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    We also agree with the corporation that it would cost trial courts nothing to list \"Not Guilty\" before \"Guilty\" on verdict slips. The Commonwealth has not disputed this, nor has it identified any state interest for listing \"Guilty\" first. We find that the third prong favors the corporation's theory as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    However, the corporation's Due Process claim falters at the second step of the\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Mathews\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      /\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Bundy\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    test. We are unpersuaded that the verdict slip deprived the corporation of its right to be presumed innocent. Uninformed electors, who mindlessly vote for the first name on a ballot, correlate poorly to well-informed jurors, who collectively deliberate before reaching a verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    While the sociological studies and legal articles that the corporation cites are worrisome commentaries on our democracy, they, fortunately, are not indicative of how juries function. Unlike voters who may simply touch the first name on a screen in a voting booth, the twelve jurors who tried the corporation were oath-bound to follow the law and instructions of a learned trial judge, who well and fully instructed them on their duties and the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    As the Commonwealth rightly notes and the\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Selinski\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Court said, \"the trial court instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence and the Commonwealth's burden of proof, following the language of Pennsylvania Standard Jury Instruction (Criminal) 7.01.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    at 1235. We find this\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    persuasive and adopt it into our analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    And, regarding the case at bar, the jurors were fully informed about the corporation's role in the hazing death. They sat through a week-long trial, heard testimony of witnesses, and reviewed copious physical evidence. Thus, these jurors knew far more about their decision and its implications than electors who arbitrarily vote for the first name they see. Additionally, the margins of error in close elections, to which the corporation's studies referred, do not occur in a criminal-jury trial. Criminal juries must reach a unanimous decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The corporation's jurors clearly understood their role and legal obligations. They\n    did not, as the corporation suggests, simply check-off the first box of \"Guilty\" and return to the courtroom. Had they done so, the jurors would have convicted the corporation of the first charge on the verdict slip - namely, murder of the third degree. But, as the verdict slip indicates, they did not.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Verdict at 1. Instead, the jurors left the first two charges blank, followed their instructions, proceeded to the subsequent offenses, and convicted the corporation of the third charge - involuntary manslaughter.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    This jury demonstrated that a \"Guilty\"-before-\"Not-Guilty\" verdict slip did not undermine the presumption of innocence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Finally, there is no Rule of Criminal Procedure regarding the format of a verdict slip. Any such mandate, if appropriate, must come from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. \"The Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure, and the conduct of all courts ....\" Pa. Const. Article V, \u00a7 10 (c). If we created the rule the corporation requests, we would usurp the power of the Supreme Court. The criminal-defense bar may suggest this new rule to the Supreme Court's Criminal Procedural Rules Committee, should it so desire. We, however, may not create it as a constitutionally enshrined right.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Because we conclude that the verdict slip did not infringe upon the corporation's right of presumed innocence, no Due Process violation occurred, and no appellate relief is due.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <em>\n     H. The Trial Court's Use of the Word \"Defendant\"\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The corporation raises another, novel, constitutional theory.

The Commonwealth neither argues this is impractical nor that there is a state interest in referring to defendants as \"defendants.\" The corporation thus satisfied the third part of the test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    But, again, the corporation's theory cannot meet the second prong of\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Mathews\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      /\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Bundy\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    . Requiring all trial judges to call defendants \"the accused\" is a cure in search of an illness. While it is logically true that all accused are not defendants and all defendants are accused, the corporation fails to connect that tautology with\n    an undermining of the presumption of innocence. Thus, the corporation has failed to demonstrate how the trial court's verbiage deprived it of any right, beyond its mere speculative belief that some harm may have occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    And, as with the verdict slip above, we again note that the trial court fully instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence, the jury acquitted the then-accused (now-convicted) corporation of the Commonwealth's most serious accusations, and no Rule of Criminal Procedure or any Standard Jury Instruction compels the result the corporation seeks. Accordingly, for all of the reasons above, we again perceive no Due Process violation. Any request to amend the Rules of Criminal Procedure or the Standard Jury Instruction should be directed to the appropriate committees of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Because the corporation has not shown how the trial court's use of the word \"defendant\" infringed its constitutional rights, we dismiss this appellate issue as meritless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <em>\n     I.

First, it violates this Court's precedents. \"If no statutory authorization exists for a particular sentence, that sentence is illegal and subject to correction.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Stevenson\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234508\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/850/1268/#p1271\">\n     850 A.2d at 1271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Second, the trial court's assumption of authority based upon legislative silence disregards the General Assembly's mandate that its penal code \"shall be strictly construed.\" 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928(b)(1). Contrary to the claim of the Commonwealth in its Sentencing Memorandum, a trial court may not logically deduce that it possesses penal authority greater than what the legislature has expressly granted to the court. The statute authorizing conditions of probation contains no term expressly empowering a trial court to discontinue a business entity's commerce within this Commonwealth.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9754(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Most of the authorized conditions in Section 9754(c) are irrelevant to corporations. Some examples include ordering a probationer to meet family obligations, undergo drug and alcohol screening, attended treatment classes, and maintain employment and a permanent residence. The Section 9754(c) conditions that could apply to corporations are (2.1) community service; (8) pay restitution; (10) report, through its agents, to a probation officer; (11) pay its fines and (13) \"satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the defendant and not unduly restrictive of his liberty or incompatible with his freedom of conscience.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234508\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/850/1268/#p1271\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Only 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9754(c)(13) potentially provides the authority that the trial court exerted when it outlawed the corporation. But outlawry from the whole Commonwealth bears no relation to the corporation's rehabilitative process. Instead, it is punitive in nature, and such a condition of probation cannot be sustained under the language of subsection (c)(13). Also, this condition of probation unjustly punishes the Penn State Chapter of Pi Delta Psi, students who had absolutely nothing to do with the hazing death in this case. It also totally restricts the corporation's future expansion within this Commonwealth at any other colleges or universities. The corporation may not own property, attend Greek Life events, or enter contracts in Pennsylvania, during this term of probation. It thus unduly restricts the corporation's liberty by completely cutting it off from the Pennsylvania marketplace.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Third, the probationary condition flies in the face of the common law of corporations. It has long been the common law\n    that corporations \"may not commit treason, nor be outlawed, nor excommunicated, for they have no souls ....\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      The Case of Sutton's Hospital\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    , 77 Eng.

While the Pennsylvania Sentencing Code has expanded the punishments for convicted corporations beyond fines to include Section 9754(c)'s conditions of probation, we find nothing therein that supplants the common law prohibition on outlawing a corporate entity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Without such legislative authorization, we conclude the common law still holds validity. The corporation cannot be criminally \"outlawed, nor excommunicated, for [it has] no [soul].\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Sutton's Hospital\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    . An amoral corporation is no more amenable to such penalties, than it is to incarceration in a penitentiary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    In reality, corporations have no moral compass, or, as the Lord Chief Justice Coke put it, \"no soul.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    A corporation cannot feel the guilt of the harm it caused, even when that harm resulted in the tragic loss of human life, because it feels nothing at all. This corporation, though vicariously liable to make redress for the illegalities of its agent, did not kill anyone. While its negligent management may have fostered a corporate culture that permitted or even encouraged wanton behavior by student members, the corporation did not tackle or physically attack anyone. It has no body with which to do so. And so outlawry of a corporation makes no more sense now than it did in the 17th century, because, like any tool, the corporation is no more morally accountable than a hammer or a sword or a firearm. It is the wielder who sins; not his or her weapon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Yet the trial court is not without authority to oversee the rehabilitation of the corporation's culture and transfer the tool into the hands of agents who will wield it for good. We believe a Pennsylvania trial court could impose many of the conditions of probation used in\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      BP\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    ,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    , against a corporation, within the bounds of its discretion and 42 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 9754(c)(13). Professor Garrett also offers many additional ideas to transform a corporate ethos that a trial court might, if properly fitted to the circumstances at bar, order as well.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    Garrett,\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    But, finding no authority in statute or at common law to support the trial court's decision to enjoin the corporation from conducting any business within this state for ten years, we conclude that portion of its sentence is illegal. We therefore vacate that sentence. Because this \"upsets the original sentencing scheme of the trial court,\" we remand for resentencing.\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Commonwealth v.
