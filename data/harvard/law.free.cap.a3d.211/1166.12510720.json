At risk here is a $14,568,628.33 jury verdict, reduced to $7,284,264.17, returned in favor of Respondents William Edward Busch, Jr. (\"Mr. Busch\") and his wife, Kathleen (\"Mrs. Busch\") (collectively \"the Buschs\"), after a 14-day trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The jury found that Mr. Busch contracted mesothelioma as a result of his exposure to asbestos-containing materials installed by insulation contractor Wallace &amp; Gale, Co. (\"W &amp; G\")\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  during the construction\n  of Loch Raven High School (\"LRHS\") in Baltimore County. Mr. Busch worked for Honeywell Corporation during the relevant time period, performing non-insulation work in the boiler room of LRHS, the area where the asbestos exposure occurred. Although Mr. Busch did not himself install asbestos-containing products, nor was any direct evidence produced linking W &amp; G to any asbestos-containing products in the construction at LRHS (let alone in the boiler room), the jury was convinced, apparently by circumstantial evidence (and inferences drawn therefrom), that W &amp; G was responsible more likely than not for installing the asbestos-containing insulation in the boiler room.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment in a reported opinion.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  WGAST petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.

He began his career as an apprentice steamfitter\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 1967 at a Baltimore construction company, Lloyd E. Mitchell (\"Mitchell\"). During his four years at Mitchell, he worked on at least four building projects in Baltimore and its surrounding area,\n   alleging in the present litigation asbestos exposure at all four sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Busch left Mitchell in 1971 for Honeywell Corporation (\"Honeywell\"). He worked at Honeywell for 30 years, installing primarily thermostats, sensors, relay\n   stations, fan control systems, and automatic temperature-control devices. Mr. Busch's work in this regard was typically one of the final phases of the construction process - when he performed work for Honeywell on construction sites, \"most of the job sites were pretty much completed and finished ... [he was] the last one in there for the thermostats and controls.\" He testified at trial in the present case that he was exposed to asbestos at various job sites, including LRHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Busch left Honeywell in 2001 for a local construction firm, where he assumed the role of project manager and department head. He retired in 2016 when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Loch Raven High School\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The general worksite at issue in this case was LRHS. The specific worksite for Mr. Busch was its boiler room. Mr. Busch worked in the boiler room at LRHS for approximately three or four months during the winter of 1971 and into the early spring of 1972. The boiler room contained two fifteen-foot by twenty-foot boilers. The room measured forty-feet by forty-feet. Mr. Busch performed his usual work for Honeywell in close proximity to the boilers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Building specifications for LRHS called for magnesia blocks to be used to insulate the boilers. By weight, magnesia block contained up to 15% asbestos. According to testimony, workers would cut the magnesia block into smaller, but still large, blocks before placing them around the boilers. This cutting\n   created a \"snow storm\" of asbestos dust, which was inhaled inevitably by those nearby, including Mr. Busch, even though he wore a respirator. The cement mixture used to cover the magnesia block insulation contained asbestos as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Pre-Trial Discovery Responses and Depositions Received in Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Busch, in response to pre-trial defense interrogatory requests, identified McCormick Asbestos Company (McCormick) and Georgia-Pacific, LLC, as the responsible sources of products leading to his asbestos exposure at LRHS. He claimed that the asbestos-containing insulation products were \"sold, supplied, and installed by McCormick[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, he stated that he came in contact there with an \"asbestos-containing joint compound manufactured, sold and supplied by Georgia-Pacific, LLC.\" Mr. Busch provided the names of two other Honeywell workers who had supposed personal knowledge of the asbestos exposure at LRHS - Richard Huettel (\"Huettel\") and Howard Sheppard (\"Sheppard\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response to Mr. Busch's interrogatories, WGAST produced a trove of documents 48 days before trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The documents supported the existence of a contractual relationship between W &amp; G and Poole &amp; Kent Co. (\"Poole\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Poole, as testified to later by Huettel in his deposition (which was received in evidence), was the mechanical contractor at LRHS. Poole's contractual obligations\n   included employing plumbers and steamfitters to install the piping systems for the LRHS boilers. The inferred contract between Poole and W &amp; G provided $145,250.00 as the total consideration due to W &amp; G\n   for its work at LRHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The job, referred to as Job #5679, called for W &amp; G to insulate the \"plumbing, heating and ventilating surfaces\" at LRHS. It is not crystal clear what constituted the \"surfaces\" or where most were located, but other documents indicated specifically that W &amp; G, among other responsibilities, insulated \"fire lines\" in the boiler room at LRHS during the time Busch worked also in the boiler room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Partial billing statements relating to Job #5679 were produced by WGAST. The first was from W &amp; G to Poole, dated 16 February 1972. The statement indicated that W &amp; G had \"insulated various plumbing, heating and ventilating surfaces\" at LRHS. The second, again relating to Job #5679, was sent on 15 May 1972. These billing statements totaled less than $20,000.00, but stated that the total value of Job #5679 was $145,250.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Timesheets for W &amp; G insulators were produced regarding Job #5679. The timesheets revealed that their work at LRHS lasted from February to June 1972, and that the workers spent over 4,500 person-hours at LHRS during that period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Additional invoices, order forms, and shipment records produced by WGAST connected further W &amp; G to Job #5679 in LRHS, but did not refer specifically to W &amp; G with regard to asbestos-containing products used or installed at LRHS. A \"partial billing\" for Job #5679 sent by W &amp; G to A.C. MacDonald Inc. was the only document connecting directly W &amp; G to work in the boiler room, as opposed to elsewhere at LRHS. This \"partial billing\" was for insulation work performed on fire lines in the boiler room. Construction specifications\n   for the fire lines in LRHS provided that fiberglass or \"foamglass\" shall be used as insulation for those lines. Neither fiberglass nor foamglass contained asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial &amp; Direct Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Busch brought suit initially against seven defendants, alleging occupational exposure to asbestos-containing products resulting in his mesothelioma.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three were dismissed prior to trial. Thus, by the time trial began, only four defendants remained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, Mr. Busch testified that he did not remember who installed, supplied, or manufactured the block insulation and cement used to insulate the boilers and pipes in the boiler room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   He produced competent evidence, however, if believed by the factfinder, demonstrating that the dust\n   created by the sawing of the insulation blocks contributed to his contracting mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   WGAST acknowledged that W &amp; G insulators performed work at LRHS, but claimed that no evidence had been produced by Mr. Busch linking W &amp; G to the asbestos-containing insulation used in the boiler room at LRHS. According to WGAST, the evidence placed W &amp; G workers and products in the boiler room only for the limited purpose of insulating the fire lines, which insulation contained no asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Huettel's deposition, read into evidence by WGAST, revealed that he was a friend and co-worker of Mr. Busch. Huettel and Mr. Busch worked together closely at various jobsites, including LRHS, over an eight-year span. Consistent\n   with Mr. Busch's interrogatory answers (if not his trial testimony), Huettel's deposition testimony indicated that McCormick installed the asbestos-containing block insulation and cement on the boilers at LRHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   WGAST moved successfully into evidence also the deposition testimony of Sheppard. Sheppard was an electrician who performed work at LRHS in 1970-71, before Busch worked at LRHS. Sheppard did not know Busch personally and testified only as a \"general product identification witness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a vein similar to Huettel's testimony, Sheppard claimed that he saw McCormick workers apply asbestos-containing materials to insulate the pipes and boilers in the boiler room. Neither Huettel nor Sheppard identified W &amp; G as responsible for this work or connected in any way W &amp; G to the asbestos-containing insulation in the boiler room at LRHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted earlier, at the close of all evidence, only WGAST and Georgia-Pacific remained as defendants. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Buschs against both defendants. The jury awarded Mr. Busch $318,528.33 for past medical expenses, $1,250,000.00 for past and future economic loss, and $10,000,000.00 for non-economic losses. Mrs. Busch was awarded $3,000,000.00 for loss of consortium. The total verdict was $14,568,528.33. The circuit court reduced the verdict to $7,284,264.17 because of the effect of cross-claims against absent defendants. WGAST moved subsequently for JNOV, a new trial, and, in the alternative, remittitur. The circuit court denied all motions. WGAST appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. The intermediate appellate court held first that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to infer that it was likely or probable that W &amp; G performed the insulation work (with asbestos-containing products)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   in the boiler room at LRHS during the time Mr. Busch worked in the boiler room. The intermediate appellate court held also, of relevance here, that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing the Buschs to inform the jury that McCormick had been dismissed as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   WGAST contends that Mr. Busch did not present evidence sufficient to prove directly or by reasonable inference that he was exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold, or installed by W &amp; G. Because of this deficiency, the issue of its potential liability was not proper to submit to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We review a \"trial court's decision to [ ] deny judgment or JNOV to determine whether it was legally correct[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v.

The finding involves the interrelationship between the use of a defendant's product at the workplace and the activities of the plaintiff at the workplace. This requires an understanding of the physical characteristics of the workplace and of the relationship between the activities of the direct users of the product and the bystander plaintiff. Within that context, the factors to be evaluated include the nature of the product, the frequency of its use, the proximity, in distance and in time, of a plaintiff to the use of a product, and the regularity of the exposure of that plaintiff to the use of that product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2051201\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/326/179/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a bystander plaintiff must prove that a defendant's asbestos-containing products were a substantial causative factor in the illness.

Further, it avers that, because Mr. Busch presented no direct evidence at trial connecting W &amp; G to the asbestos-products in the boiler room or, for that matter, anywhere at LRHS, the jury verdict as to its liability amounted to mere speculation. It concludes its trifecta of arguments with a policy plea - allowing a defendant to be held liable based on its mere substantial presence in or at a larger workplace is akin to a market-share theory of liability, an approach rejected in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We conclude, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that the evidence presented at trial regarding W &amp; G's work at LRHS was sufficient to allow the case to go to the jury and for the jury to conclude that W &amp; G was liable. The trial judge assessed whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the preponderance standard was met. Under that standard, she was tasked to determine whether Mr. Busch presented sufficient evidence to allow the jury to determine if it was\n   <em>\n    more likely than not\n   </em>\n   that W &amp; G performed the insulation work in the boiler room with asbestos-containing products. Circumstantial evidence was presented such that a reasonable factfinder could have found by a preponderance of the evidence that W &amp; G performed the asbestos insulation work in the LRHS boiler room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Buschs moved successfully into evidence numerous documents relating to W &amp; G's work at LRHS, including, but not limited to: time sheets showing that W &amp; G spent over 4,500 person-hours in the construction at LRHS; partial billing statements for Job #5679 indicating that W &amp; G had insulated plumbing and heating surfaces at LRHS; invoices reflecting partial\n   payment for work performed at LRHS; and, partial invoices for the fire lines work W &amp; G performed in the boiler room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The nature of the documents produced during discovery\n   suggested that document production regarding W &amp; G's work at LRHS was fragmentary. For instance, although timesheets produced indicated that W &amp; G spent over 4,500 person-hours at LRHS and the total value of the job was $145,250.00, invoices reflected only a partial payment for $20,000.00. This is either indicative of an enormous write-down, or, more plausibly, gaps in the production of documents in pretrial discovery regarding the LRHS job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Busch, a reasonable factfinder could have inferred that W &amp; G was more likely than not responsible for all of the insulation work at LRHS during the time Mr. Busch worked in the boiler room. First, it is not a hyper-extended stretch for the trial jury to draw an inference that W &amp; G was the primary, if not only, insulation contractor working in LRHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   A reasonable jury could have reached that conclusion from facts such as W &amp; G's apparently broad contractual undertaking for \"insulat[ing] various plumbing, heating and ventilating surfaces\" and the thousands of hours W &amp; G spent working at LRHS. Additionally, other documentation put W &amp; G in the boiler room performing insulation work on the fire lines, albeit with insulation free of asbestos. As this reasoning goes (especially in the absence of any reason suggested for why another insulation contractor may have been hired or was necessary to perform the limited task of insulating the boilers with asbestos-containing insulation), an inference could be drawn reasonably\n   that it was unlikely that another insulation contractor would be hired for the limited objective of insulating the boilers with asbestos-containing product where W &amp; G had a building-wide insulation contract and was performing some insulation work in the boiler room, albeit not involving asbestos-containing insulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   WGAST argues that not one piece of direct evidence placed Mr. Busch in the same location at the same time that W &amp; G used an asbestos-containing product in that space, so the jury's verdict amounted to impermissible speculation. In asbestos cases, however, circumstantial evidence (and reasonable inferences available therefrom) can be sufficient to establish exposure, and liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723115\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/418/496/#p503\">\n    418 Md. at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723115\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/418/496/#p503\">\n    16 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   167 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balbos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2051201\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/326/179/#p210\">\n    326 Md. at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2051201\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/326/179/#p210\">\n    604 A.2d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the evidence highlighted above, the jury was entitled to infer that W &amp; G was likely the insulator responsible for the asbestos-containing products in the LRHS boiler room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   WGAST likens the use of circumstantial evidence and inferences here to a market-share liability approach. A market-share liability approach apportions liability among manufacturers based on their respective share of the market for the injury-causing product. WGAST points out correctly that Maryland rejects such an approach in asbestos cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reiter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696994\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/417/57/#p71\">\n    417 Md. at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696994,3697026\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/8/725/\">\n    8 A.3d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that market-share liability is not recognized under Maryland law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   WGAST's argument that the courts considering this litigation before us applied an improper market-share liability theory conflates inappropriately consideration of W &amp; G's substantial presence in LRHS with W &amp; G's share of the asbestos-containing products market. Indeed, W &amp; G performed a substantial amount of work at LRHS. Market-share liability, however, is premised on a manufacturer's share of the marketplace for a product, not its presence on, or \"share\" of, a single construction job site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mr. Busch (in his interrogatory answers), Huettel, and Sheppard (in their depositions read into evidence) testified, to\n   varying degrees of certitude, that McCormick was the contractor responsible for the asbestos-containing insulation installed in the LRHS boiler room. WGAST sees this testimony as exonerating W &amp; G. Because of this, the Court of Special Appeals erred in ruling that the jury was free to disregard this evidence and rely instead on other and more attenuated evidence that was arguably more generous to Mr. Busch's claim. WGAST points to cases, many from foreign jurisdictions, to support this notion. In essence, WGAST argues that because the testimony that McCormick installed the asbestos-containing insulation was uncontroverted, the trial court should have granted JNOV. We are not persuaded by this argument. Although there was evidence which identified McCormick as the manufacturer and installer of the asbestos-containing insulation in the boiler room, other evidence was presented that permitted a reasonable judge or factfinder to infer otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For the reasons explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the question of W &amp; G's liability was a close enough question to present to the jury for consideration. A reasonable jury could have inferred that W &amp; G performed the asbestos insulation work in the boiler room at LRHS, the dust from which was a substantial causative factor in Mr. Busch's mesothelioma. Thus, the Buschs shall prevail with their \"horseshoes and hand-grenades\" body of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   WGAST's second contention on appeal is that the circuit court erred in informing the jury that McCormick had been dismissed from the lawsuit. As noted earlier, Mr. Busch included McCormick as one of seven original co-defendants to the lawsuit. To set the stage, we shall attempt first to make clear McCormick's involvement in, and ultimate disengagement from, this litigation, and then address WGAST's argument on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is not unusual for an asbestos lawsuit to be brought against multiple defendants. As such a case proceeds, and\n   more information is uncovered in the pre-trial stage (and even during trial), it is common for some defendants to be dismissed or otherwise \"disappear\" from the proceedings before the case is sent to the jury. Additionally, it is not uncommon for co-defendants to file cross-claims against each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, Mr. Busch brought suit initially against seven entities, including McCormick and WGAST. WGAST asserted cross-claims against McCormick, alleging that McCormick was responsible for insulating the boilers at LRHS using asbestos-containing insulation. Despite this, McCormick\n   was not a party when the case was given to the jury. It had been dismissed from the proceedings, before trial commenced, by the grant of an unopposed summary judgment motion because no party could identify sufficient and competent evidence upon which it could be surmised that McCormick performed any work or supplied any product involving asbestos insulation regarding the LRHS boilers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   At trial, WGAST caused to be admitted into evidence various documents, including Busch's original Complaint, which listed all of the original defendants. WGAST moved successfully into evidence also historical Baltimore City Asbestos Personal Injury Master Complaints and Amendments by Interlineation, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s. These documents included excerpts from:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 Master Complaint from\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases CT-2 Trades Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 10 July 1987;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 Amendment by Interlineation to Master Complaint from\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases, CT-1 Trades Cases, CT-2 Bethlehem Steel Case, CT-3 Railroad Cases, CT-4 Other Asbestos Cases, and CT-5 Shipyard Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 4 April 1989;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 Amended Master Complaint from\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases, CT-1 Trades Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 20 June 1990;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 Amendment by Interlineation to Master Complaint filed in\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases, CT-1 Trades Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 12 November 1990;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Amendment by Interlineation to Master Complaint from\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases, CT-1 Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 5 February 1991;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 Amendment by Interlineation to Master Complaint filed in\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases, CT-1 Trades Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 27 February 1991; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 Amendment by Interlineation to Master Complaint from\n   <em>\n    In Re: Personal Injury Asbestos Cases, CT-1 Trades Cases\n   </em>\n   , dated 27 October 1994.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The exhibits introduced by WGAST identified many different entities as defendants. All seven defendants named initially in the Buschs's Complaint were identified, as well as other entities that had gone bankrupt over the past twenty-five years, and all entities believed by the Buschs to be responsible for contributing to the development of Mr. Busch's mesothelioma. In total, there were at least 23 other entities identified in these documents introduced by WGAST that were not defendants being tried in the trial in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response to these documentary admissions by WGAST, the Buschs sought to admit the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in favor of McCormick as to all cross and third-party claims against it by third-party defendants on its unopposed motion, preceded by a stipulation by the Buschs dismissing their claims against McCormick. According to the Buschs, this was necessary because WGAST, in what to them seemed an attempt to muddy the water, had created jury confusion by its use of the Complaint and pleadings in other cases having questionable relevance. The Buschs sought to dispel any confusion by informing the jury simply that McCormick was dismissed by summary judgment and thus was no longer a party in the pending lawsuit. WGAST objected to the Buschs's proposals on various grounds, including relevance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   After hearing argument, the trial judge concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   But I think it creates an unfair confusion regarding what happened when the defense\n   has it - has entered into the record the fact that these parties [McCormick] were sued,\n   and to not tell the jury that these parties have now been dismissed. I think it creates confusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [Y]ou've put in the record the complaint identifying McCormick, and now you're saying now in your argument that you [W &amp; G] have a defense of mistaken identity. But you have put in as evidentiary support of that defense the complaint by the plaintiff, and I think that does open up questions for the jury as to what happened to that complaint [as to McCormick].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At that point, trial counsel for WGAST acquiesced in informing the jury of the dismissal of McCormick, but not the court's ruling on McCormick's Motion for Summary Judgment. Counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   If you want to tell the jury they're dismissed and they shouldn't consider any reason for it, that's fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   If they want to say it's dismissed to complete the record, that's fine. But I'm objecting to any explanation ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The circuit court permitted ultimately the Buschs to inform the jury that McCormick had been dismissed. It did not allow them, however, to make reference to the Buschs's dismissal of their claims against McCormick, McCormick's unopposed motion for summary judgment, or the order granting the motion. The trial judge explained that there was a difference between informing the jury that former parties mentioned by WGAST in its evidentiary submissions were dismissed and informing the jury specifically of the legal vehicle by which its exit from the case was accomplished. Accordingly, the judge ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   But I guess my ruling then is allowing in the fact that these parties were dismissed, are no longer in the case but stripped of any content or context for that dismissal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Because I believe that the content and the context has the potential for creating unfair prejudice by invoking the Court's reasoning, or if not the Court's reasoning, in the case of a motion for summary judgment, it invites the jury\n   to speculate as to the amount or the reasons why other parties may have settled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   So I want to avoid that, and I think that all parties should take care to avoid that. And that goes to the defense as well. Because I can imagine ways you could craft your closing argument that would invite further inquiry. So I would say all parties should proceed very cautiously to avoid any inferences as to why other parties aren't here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Consistent with this ruling, counsel for the Buschs informed the jury: \"Plaintiffs dismissed any and all claims against [McCormick] in Mr. Busch's case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We review a trial court's evidentiary determinations generally for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Maryland v.

It continues that admitting evidence that McCormick had been sued, but was no longer in the case, was not confusing, so no corrective action was necessary. WGAST argues that the \"opening the door\" doctrine, relied on by the Court of Special Appeals, was applied in error because: 1) there was no actual or potential problem requiring an\n   evidentiary cure; and, 2) there was no unfair prejudice relating to confusion as to McCormick's status, so no \"door\" was \"opened.\" We cast a jaundiced eye on WGAST's urgings in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The \"opening the door\" doctrine expands relevancy in an attempt to quell confusion regarding previously admitted other evidence.

Here, I believe the Majority is departing from our long-held standard. The Majority is permitting the baseline requirement that Mr. Busch must link W &amp; G to the asbestos insulation to be satisfied through impermissible inferences when we have no evidence that W &amp; G utilized\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   asbestos containing products\n   at LRHS, much less the boiler room, during the time Mr. Busch worked there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In review of the evidence before the jury, W &amp; G had a broad contractual undertaking for \"insulat[ing] various plumbing, heating and ventilating surfaces\" at LRHS and spent\n   many hours working at LRHS. As to the boiler room specifically, the evidence showed only that W &amp; G performed insulation work on the fire lines inside the boiler room, with insulation free of asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In his pre-trial interrogatory answers, Mr. Busch declared that McCormick was the contractor responsible for installing the asbestos-containing insulation in the LRHS boiler room. Specifically, Mr. Busch stated that he \"worked with and around asbestos-containing thermal insulation products sold, supplied, and installed by McCormick.\" At trial, Mr. Busch never renounced his assertion but instead stated that he now suffered memory loss. On the record, he acknowledged his answers to the interrogatories and that he had not attempted to repudiate or correct them before trial. The entirety of his testimony was that, despite his previous statements, he no longer recalled who performed the asbestos-containing insulation work in the boiler room at LRHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Mr. Huettel and Mr. Sheppard, co-workers of Mr. Busch, affirmed in their deposition, read into evidence at trial, that McCormick was the contractor responsible for installing the asbestos-containing insulation. When Mr. Huettel was asked at his deposition if he recalled which company hired the pipe coverers at LRHS, he responded: \"[t]hat was McCormick.\" When asked if he could identify what the pipe coverers did at LRHS, he responded, \"[w]ell, they insulated the boilers.\" Likewise, Mr. Sheppard identified McCormick as the installer of the asbestos-containing materials in the boiler room. He recounted specifically McCormick's name as printed on the workers' toolboxes and on the asbestos insulation packaging with \"made by McCormick\" labels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   W &amp; G produced invoices and other statements regarding its work at LRHS. Every document produced embracing the time in which Mr. Busch performed work at LRHS referred to specific materials such as foamglass, fiberglass, or \"power house cement.\" It is uncontroverted that those products did not contain asbestos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   W &amp; G also produced timesheets that identify when W &amp; G employees worked in LRHS generally and for how long. However, they do not reveal specifically what work was performed nor where in LRHS the work was performed except for the fire lines in the boiler room. At best, the timesheets demonstrate that W &amp; G was present somewhere in LRHS for relatively substantial periods of time. Construction in the high school spanned several months commencing in 1971 and ending in 1972. A claim that the timesheets give rise to an inference that W &amp; G performed insulation work using asbestos-containing materials in the boiler room is a bridge too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   By contrast, Mr. Busch produced no evidence showing that W &amp; G supplied or installed asbestos-containing materials anywhere in LRHS during the time Mr. Busch performed work there. It is unreasonable to draw from the more generalized evidence of W &amp; G's other work at LRHS an inference that it likely installed the asbestos insulation in the boiler room. Not one piece of evidence placed Mr. Busch in the same location or vicinity, at the same time, where W &amp; G used an asbestos-containing product at LRHS. For that matter, there was no evidence presented that demonstrated W &amp; G's installation of asbestos-containing materials\n   <em>\n    anywhere\n   </em>\n   in LRHS during the time Mr. Busch performed work there. In light of the dearth of such evidence, the jury's verdict amounted to impermissible speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I agree with the Majority that in asbestos cases, circumstantial evidence (and reasonable inferences available therefrom) can be sufficient to establish exposure or liability.\n   <em>\n    Op.\n   </em>\n   at 464 Md. at 490-91, 211 A.3d at 1175-76. However, in my view, based on the evidence presented here, the jury was not entitled to infer that W &amp; G was the insulator responsible for the asbestos-containing products in the LRHS boiler room. It is well established that a case resting on speculation, conjecture, or surmise is not sufficient to submit to a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baulsir v.

This is but one possible explanation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    WGAST points out that an inference is \"a fact determined through logical deduction from other proven facts[,]\" to support its contention that the only inference permissible from the evidence presented is that W &amp; G was the primary insulator at LRHS. Although that is certainly one reasonable inference that could have been drawn potentially by the jury, we believe that there are other permissible inferences which could have been (and were in fact) drawn.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Indeed, we have infused the verbatim text from Md.
