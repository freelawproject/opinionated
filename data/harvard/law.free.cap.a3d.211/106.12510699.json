In each case, the defendant was convicted, following a plea of guilty, of, inter alia, sale of narcotics and/or possession of narcotics with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) \u00a7 21a-278 (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was sentenced to a\n   term of\n   incarceration that included the statutorily mandated minimum sentence of five years. In each instance, the court made no finding, nor did the defendant admit, that he was not drug-dependent. Each defendant subsequently filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, alleging, in essence, that his sentence was illegal because, under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.

On March 12,\n   2013, the defendant Livorio Sanchez was convicted, following a plea of guilty, of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). During the plea canvass, the prosecutor recited the facts underlying the alleged sale of heroin by Sanchez, but he made no representation as to whether Sanchez was drug-dependent. Similarly, during the questioning of Sanchez by the court,\n   <em>\n    Arnold, J.\n   </em>\n   , there was no discussion of drug dependency. Sanchez was subsequently sentenced on May 15, 2013, in accordance with an agreed upon disposition, to a term of incarceration of twelve years, execution suspended after eight years, followed by three years of probation. As a condition of his probation, the court ordered that he undergo \"substance abuse evaluation and treatment including random urinalysis ....\" During the sentencing hearing, however, there was no discussion by the court, counsel, or Sanchez of the issue of drug dependency, nor did the court make explicit that the defendant's period of incarceration included a mandatory minimum period of five years pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 12, 2012, the defendant Michael A. Fernandes was convicted, following a plea of guilty, of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During a colloquy with defense counsel prior to canvassing Fernandes, the court,\n   <em>\n    Arnold, J.\n   </em>\n   , noted, and defense counsel agreed, that the narcotics charge included a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. During the canvass itself, although the court asked Fernandes if his counsel had advised him of the elements of the charge to which he was pleading guilty and the mandatory minimum penalties that he could receive, there was no mention by the court or counsel of\n   drug dependency. Having waived the requirement\n   of a presentence investigation report, Fernandes was immediately sentenced, pursuant to an agreed upon disposition, to a term of incarceration of ten years, execution suspended after five years, followed by a period of three years of probation. In reciting Fernandes' sentence, the court stated that the five year period of incarceration was the mandatory minimum sentence required by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 27, 2012, the defendant Francisco Rodriguez was convicted, following a plea of guilty, of possession of narcotics with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to a question from the court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J.\n   </em>\n   , at the outset of its canvass, Rodriguez confirmed that his counsel had explained the maximum and mandatory minimum sentences to which his plea could expose him. Rodriguez also acknowledged during the canvass that by pleading guilty, he was giving up a number of enumerated rights, including the right to present defenses on his behalf at trial. Throughout the proceeding, there was no mention by the court, counsel, or Rodriguez of the issue of drug dependency. Having waived the requirement of a presentence investigation report, Rodriguez was immediately sentenced, pursuant to an agreed upon disposition, to a total effective term of incarceration of ten years, five of which reflected the mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 9, 2013, the defendant Frank Slaughter was convicted, following a plea of guilty, of one count of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) and two counts of\n   possession of narcotics with the intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent also in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). As part of a plea agreement, the other charges then pending against Slaughter were nolled by the state. At the beginning of the canvass, the state informed the court,\n   <em>\n    Arnold, J.\n   </em>\n   , that all three counts required a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, and, in response to questioning from the court, Slaughter initially stated that he was unaware that the agreed disposition included a mandatory minimum period of incarceration of five years. After a brief colloquy, however, Slaughter stated to the court that he understood that the sentence to be imposed would carry a minimum term of five years of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record further reflects that before the court sentenced Slaughter, but after the court had stated the sentences to be imposed, Slaughter interjected as follows: \"[A]s long as I've been coming in and out of the courthouse, I've been drug-dependent. I been drug-dependent. Now that I'm being charged with a drug-dependent case, how is that ....\" At this juncture, the court pointed out to Slaughter the number of charges initially confronting him and the fact that, if he was convicted after trial, he could face \"close to eighty years' worth of exposure.\" The court continued to inform Slaughter that it would accept his guilty pleas only if they were made voluntarily, and it offered him the opportunity either to withdraw his pleas or to proceed with the sentencing. Slaughter responded, \"[p]roceed.\" After confirming Slaughter's response, the court found that his guilty pleas were knowingly and voluntarily made and found him guilty as to all\n   three counts. Because Slaughter waived the requirement of a presentence investigation report, the court proceeded immediately to sentence him, pursuant to an agreed upon disposition, to twelve years of incarceration for each count, execution suspended after seven years, five of\n   which were mandatory, followed by a five year period of probation. As a condition of his probation, the court ordered that Slaughter undergo \"substance abuse evaluation and treatment as deemed appropriate by the Department of Adult Probation.\" Other than Slaughter's statement that he was drug-dependent, there was no discussion by the court or counsel regarding the relationship between drug dependency and the criminal charges to which Slaughter pleaded guilty. Notably, when Slaughter raised the issue of his drug dependency, there was no discussion by the court or counsel as to whether such a claim could be a defense to any of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 26, 2011, the defendant Michael Anthony Thigpen was convicted, following a plea of guilty, of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the canvass, Thigpen confirmed with the court,\n   <em>\n    Iannotti, J.\n   </em>\n   , that his counsel had discussed with him the elements of the offenses to which he was pleading guilty, as well as the maximum and mandatory minimum sentences to which his guilty pleas would expose him. Thigpen also acknowledged that he was giving up his right to present defenses by pleading guilty. There was no discussion by the court, counsel, or Thigpen of the issue of drug dependency. On September 22, 2011, pursuant to an agreed upon disposition, Thigpen was sentenced to a term of incarceration of fifteen years, execution suspended after eight years, five of which were mandatory, to be followed by three years of probation. As conditions of his probation, the court ordered him to undergo substance abuse evaluation and treatment, as deemed necessary, and to attend \"ten weekly [Narcotics Anonymous] meetings.\" When asked if he wanted to speak prior to being\n   sentenced, Thigpen indicated to the court that he had a heart condition for which he required medication and treatment. At no time during this hearing was the issue of drug dependency raised or discussed by the court, counsel, or Thigpen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 22, 2014, the defendants filed the operative, amended motions to correct their allegedly illegal sentences pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   although each was filed separately, the motions were identical in substance. The defendants claimed, inter alia, that their sentences were illegal because, under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Jersey\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    570 U.S. at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the sentences \"exceed[ed] the relevant statutory maximum limits\" and \"the fact triggering the mandatory minimum sentence was not found by a proper fact finder or admitted by the defendant ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state opposed the defendants'\n   motions to correct, arguing, inter alia, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the motions attacked the validity of the defendants' guilty pleas rather than the sentences imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    E.

Following its comprehensive review of the factual record and the relevant federal and Connecticut appellate decisional law, the court concluded that the defendants were, in essence, attacking their convictions and not their sentences and, for that reason, the court dismissed their motions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendants appealed to this court, arguing that the trial court misconstrued their motions to correct and that, properly construed, they alleged cognizable claims of an illegal sentence under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 13, 2017, after the defendants had briefed their claims but before oral argument was scheduled, this court issued orders staying each appeal pending our Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498612\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/1184/\">\n    329 Conn. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498612\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/1184/\">\n    189 A.3d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499580\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/874/\">\n    329 Conn. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499580\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/874/\">\n    190 A.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12617860,12617861,12617862,12617863,12617864,12617865\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1233/\">\n    139 S.

In our view, however, the defendants' claims have since lost their hue. One of the primary reasons underlying the court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   regarding jurisdiction was the fact that there had been a \"lack of any case law from [our Supreme Court] squarely rejecting the defendant's proffered interpretation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b) as merely providing a penalty enhancement in view of the [United States] Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498612\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/1184/\">\n    Id., at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498612\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/1184/\">\n    189 A.3d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because our Supreme Court has now squarely rejected claims identical to those made by the defendants in the present cases, they no longer present colorable issues.

We make this suggestion in view of the fact that a guilty plea to this offense may, at least for the mandatory minimum period of incarceration, disqualify a defendant from participation in any intensive residential community based drug treatment program.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 provides: \"The judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In their motions to correct, the defendants also claimed that their sentences were illegal or imposed in an illegal manner because (1) the court relied on \"an inaccurate understanding\" of the relevant facts and legal principles, (2) the court was \"unaware of the available sentencing range [due to an erroneous belief] that it was required to impose the mandatory minimum sentence,\" and (3) the sentences violated the rule of lenity and the requirement of article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut constitution that no person shall be confined unless clearly warranted by law. In subsequently filed memoranda of law in support of the motions, the defendants additionally claimed that their sentences were illegal and imposed in an illegal manner because they violated the defendants' state and federal constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws and due process, in that there is no rational basis for punishing the same behavior with differing punishments under two separate statutes. The trial court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide these claims as well. The defendants do not challenge this determination on appeal, and we therefore do not address them further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    In conjunction with these motions, the court also heard a similar motion to correct filed by Albert Nalewajk. Nalewajk appealed from the same memorandum of decision giving rise to the present appeals. On February 6, 2019, while Nalewajk's appeal was pending, his counsel filed a suggestion of death indicating that Nalewajk had died. Consequently, this court dismissed the appeal as moot.
