STEWART\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 53, Sept. Term, 2018\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Court of Appeals of Maryland.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  June 25, 2019\n </decisiondate>\n <opinion id=\"p-5\">\n  <strong>\n   Background\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-6\">\n  Respondent Willie B. Stewart was charged in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County with various offenses that allegedly occurred at an ice cream store before it opened on August 12, 2016. In particular, he was charged with robbery of Brian Rampmeyer, the owner of the store, second-degree assault of Mr. Rampmeyer, and theft of property with a value less than $1,000.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  The trial took place on May 23, 2017. At the close of the evidence, the Circuit Court denied a defense motion for judgment of acquittal on each of the three counts, thus finding that there was sufficient evidence to create a jury issue as to each of the charges. The court then instructed the jury on the law governing the alleged offenses. Pertinent to this appeal, the court instructed the jury as follows concerning robbery:\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   The Defendant is charged with the crime of robbery. Robbery is the taking and carrying away of property from someone else by force or threat of force with the intent to deprive the victim of the property. To convict the Defendant of robbery, the State must prove that the Defendant took the property from Brian Rampmeyer, that the Defendant took the property by force or threat of force, and that the\n   Defendant intended to deprive Brian Rampmeyer of the property. Property means anything of value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The robbery instruction was evidently based on a pattern jury instruction developed by a committee of the Maryland State Bar Association (\"MSBA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also pertinent to this appeal, the court instructed the jury as follows concerning second-degree assault:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The Defendant is charged with the crime of assault. Assault is intentionally frightening another person with the\n   threat of immediate physical harm. To convict the Defendant of assault, the State must prove the Defendant committed an act with the intent to place Brian Rampmeyer in fear of immediate physical harm, that the Defendant had the apparent ability at that time to bring about physical harm, and that Brian Rampmeyer reasonably feared immediate physical harm, and that the Defendant's actions were not legally justified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Like the robbery instruction, the court's instruction on second-degree assault was based on an MSBA pattern instruction concerning second-degree assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties agree that the Circuit Court's instructions on robbery and second-degree assault were accurate statements of the law governing those charges. There was no dispute that the evidence presented at trial generated these two instructions. No objection was made to these instructions - or any of the court's other instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The jury found Mr. Stewart guilty of the robbery and theft charges, but acquitted him of the second-degree assault\n   charge. Immediately after the jury returned the verdict, Mr. Stewart's counsel requested a bench conference. At the bench conference, he told the court that, in his view, the verdicts on the robbery and second-degree assault charges were inconsistent and that the jury should be required to continue to deliberate until it reached consistent verdicts. The State responded that the verdicts were not inconsistent. The Circuit Court agreed with the State and declined to take further action on that ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At Mr. Stewart's sentencing on July 25, 2017, the Circuit Court merged the theft conviction into the robbery conviction and sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Stewart appealed his convictions, solely on the ground that the trial court had erred in accepting inconsistent verdicts. In an unreported decision, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the conviction on the robbery count. The intermediate appellate court based its holding on a distinction between \"legally inconsistent\" verdicts and \"factually inconsistent\" verdicts made in\n   <em>\n    McNeal v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708598\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/455/\">\n    426 Md. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708598\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/455/\">\n    44 A.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), which held that a verdict in a criminal case that is \"legally inconsistent\" (as opposed to a verdict that is only \"factually inconsistent\") is unacceptable. Applying that distinction to this case, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the guilty verdict on the robbery conviction should be reversed. It summarized case law concerning the elements of robbery and second-degree assault and reasoned that, in light of the \"uncontradicted evidence\" presented at trial, the guilty verdict on the robbery charge was legally inconsistent with the acquittal on the second-degree assault charge because the assault offense was a lesser-included offense of the robbery. Accordingly, the intermediate appellate court overturned the guilty verdict on the robbery count and remanded the case for\n   sentencing on the theft count.\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1291 (Sept. 2017 Term),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203777459\">\n    2018 WL 3777459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (August 8, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State filed a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , which we granted.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503408,12503407\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/461/613/\">\n    461 Md. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503408,12503405,12503406,12503407\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/905/\">\n    196 A.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A majority of this Court agrees that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals should be reversed and that the guilty verdict on the robbery count should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The members of the Court who agree with this disposition do so for somewhat different reasons. Three judges - in an opinion by Judge McDonald (joined by Chief Judge Barbera and Senior Judge Adkins) - would not be concerned with distinguishing a \"legally inconsistent\" verdict from a \"factually inconsistent\" one, but rather with whether the verdict demonstrates that the jury disregarded the trial court's instructions on the law. In their view, a reviewing court must consider the instructions given by the trial court and whether the jury's verdict, on its face, shows that the jury disregarded those instructions. Concluding that the verdict in this case does not demonstrate that the jury disregarded the court's instructions, they would hold that the guilty verdict on the robbery count should not be reversed on the ground of inconsistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two judges - in an opinion by Judge Watts (joined by Judge Getty) - would apply a two-step analysis in which the reviewing court first confirms that the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the elements of the offenses and then ascertains whether the verdicts are \"legally inconsistent\" - that is, whether the charge of which the jury found the defendant not guilty is a lesser-included offense of the charge of which the jury found the defendant guilty. Applying that analysis, they would reach a different conclusion from the Court of Special Appeals and hold that the guilty verdict on\n   the robbery charge in this case was not \"legally inconsistent\" with the not guilty verdict on the second-degree assault charge because, in their view, second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type is not a lesser-included offense of robbery. In addition, upon review of the evidence at trial, they conclude that the evidence satisfied the elements of robbery, but did not establish the elements of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Two members of the Court dissent from the Court's disposition of this appeal. Judge Greene agrees with Judge Watts that the analysis should distinguish \"legally inconsistent\" verdicts from \"factually inconsistent\" verdicts. However, he would adopt the analysis of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that, because second-degree assault is generally a lesser-included offense of robbery, the guilty verdict on the robbery count in this case was \"legally inconsistent\" with the not guilty verdict on the second-degree assault count and therefore should be reversed. He would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judge Hotten would follow the same framework as Judge Watts and Judge Greene -\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., she would assess whether a verdict is \"legally inconsistent\" by looking to whether one of the charged offenses is a lesser-included offense of another charge. In her view, case law has established that second-degree assault, of either the battery or intent-to-frighten variety, is a lesser-included offense of robbery. She disagrees with Judge Watts as to whether the evidence at trial fell short of proof of second-degree assault. Accordingly, Judge Hotten would hold that the verdicts in this\n   case were legally inconsistent and the guilty verdict on the robbery count must be reversed. She would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTION TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY. RESPONDENT TO PAY COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Opinion by McDonald, J., which Barbera, C.J., and Adkins, J., join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I agree with the Court's disposition of this case and have no quarrel with Judge Watts' thorough discussion of the recent case law in Maryland on inconsistent verdicts. That case law, however, has led me to reconsider our approach to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has held that, under federal law, inconsistent verdicts in a criminal case generally do not entitle the defendant to have a guilty verdict overturned.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958569\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/57/\">\n    469 U.S. 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958569\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/57/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958569\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/57/\">\n    83 L.Ed.2d 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Until relatively recently, this Court had a similar view.\n   <em>\n    E.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    State v.

There has been a fair amount of commentary expressing discomfort with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   and an effort in some courts, including this one, to come up with a theory of when one's tolerance for seemingly inconsistent verdicts is exhausted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Eric L.

Other courts have made similar distinctions, sometimes devising additional categories of inconsistent verdicts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motivation for making\n   such distinctions seems to be a concern that a court not intrude on the jury's\n   factfinding function while also ensuring that the jury has not taken the law into its own hands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In my view, the attempt to define and contrast a \"factually inconsistent\" verdict from a \"legally inconsistent\" one has been a valiant attempt to distinguish between inconsistent verdicts that we can live with and those that we cannot. However, the effort to discern the difference between the abstract categories of \"factually inconsistent\" and \"legally inconsistent\" has proven to be more of a distraction than a useful rubric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Upon reflection, the critical factor in these cases for determining when a guilty verdict that is allegedly inconsistent with an acquittal on another charge should be reversed on the ground of inconsistency is evident. Under the concurring\n   opinion in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , the Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    McNeal\n   </em>\n   , and subsequent opinions, the key question is whether the jury verdict on its face indicates that the jury failed to follow the trial court's proper instructions on the law governing the charged offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the answer to that question is \"yes,\" then the guilty verdict warrants reversal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, if the trial court's instructions accurately describe the elements of the offenses and if the jury verdict does not indicate on its face that the jury failed to follow those instructions, then the guilty verdict should be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the end, it seems easier to conduct the analysis by going directly to that question without the intermediate step of trying to fit the verdict into one of two - or more\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   - abstract categories. The real concern with a seemingly inconsistent verdict is not what label we can attach to it, but whether the jury disregarded the trial court's instructions on the law in reaching a guilty verdict on a particular count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, when confronted with the possibility of an inconsistent verdict, a court should first consider the specific instructions that the trial court gave the jury on the particular charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To illustrate, assume\n   the jury was told in the court's instructions that it must find A to convict on the first charge and must find A + B to convict on the second charge. If the jury finds the defendant not guilty on the first charge, a guilty verdict on the second charge means that the jury necessarily disregarded the court's instructions on the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the other hand, if the jury was told that it must find A to convict on the first charge and B + C to convict on the second charge and the jury finds the defendant not guilty on the first charge, a guilty verdict on the second charge does not mean, in and of itself, that the jury disregarded the court's instructions on the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This would be true even if, had the jury returned\n   <em>\n    guilty\n   </em>\n   verdicts as to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   charges, the first charge would be merged into the second for purposes of sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When a reviewing court resolves a claim that a jury verdict in a criminal trial should be overturned on the ground of inconsistent verdicts, it is important to respect the boundary between the different functions of the trial judge - instructing on the applicable law - and the jury - determining the facts. The jury's verdict should be overturned on the basis that it is \"inconsistent\" only when that inconsistency means that the jury necessarily crossed that boundary by ignoring the trial judge's instructions on the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, a reviewing court should not try to resolve a claim of inconsistent verdicts by speculating how the jury carried out its function of sorting out the evidence at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this case, there is no dispute that the jury instructions were generated by the evidence at trial and accurately described the elements of the offenses with which Mr. Stewart was charged. The trial court instructed the jury that a conviction\n   for the assault count required that they find beyond a reasonable doubt that, among other things, the defendant intended to place the victim \"in fear of immediate physical harm\" and \"had the apparent ability at that time to bring about the physical harm.\" It also instructed the jury that a conviction on the robbery count required that they find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant took property from the victim \"by force or threat of force.\" In my view, a \"threat of force\" does not always or necessarily equate to an intent to place another in fear of\n   <em>\n    immediate physical harm\n   </em>\n   or necessarily involve the apparent ability to do so. The fact that a jury may acquit a defendant on an assault charge after receiving such instructions does not mean that it has ignored the court's instruction on the robbery charge in finding the same defendant guilty of that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, we cannot say, simply from looking at the verdicts in this case, that the jury failed to follow the court's instructions on the law. Accordingly, I would hold that Mr. Stewart's conviction of robbery should not be overturned on the basis of an \"inconsistent\" acquittal of second-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Chief Judge Barbera and Judge Adkins have advised that they join this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Opinion by Watts, J., which Getty, J., joins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is well-settled by this Court's case law that a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict can be inconsistent in one, or both, of two ways: factually and legally. A guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict may be factually inconsistent where the two crimes \"have common facts but distinct [ ] elements[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Givens v.

At trial, Rampmeyer testified that, while he was working at the Baskin Robbins, Stewart, without openly displaying a gun, threatened to shoot and kill him if he did not follow Stewart's instructions, then told him to empty the cash register. Rampmeyer obeyed, and Stewart took the cash and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The jury found Stewart guilty of robbery and theft, and not guilty of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten variety.

The State argues that a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent if and only if the jury violates the jury instructions by finding that, with respect to two crimes, the State has both proven, and not proven, a fact that, according to the jury instructions, is an element of both crimes. Stewart responds that the verdicts are legally inconsistent because second-degree assault is a lesser-included offense of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I would conclude that, to determine whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, a court must first confirm that the trial court correctly instructed the jury regarding the two crimes' elements, then ascertain whether the crime of which the jury found the defendant not guilty is a lesser-included offense of the crime of which the jury found the defendant guilty. In so ascertaining, the court may, if necessary, consider case law regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense. In other words, the court is not required to limit its analysis to an examination of the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I would also hold that, here, the verdicts are not legally inconsistent because, as the parties agree, the circuit court correctly instructed the jury regarding the two offenses' elements, and because second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type is not a lesser-included offense of robbery. Second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type includes elements that robbery lacks. To secure a conviction for second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type, the State must prove that: (1) the defendant committed an act with the intent to place a victim in fear of immediate physical harm; (2) the defendant had the apparent ability, at the time, to bring about the physical harm; and (3) the victim was in reasonable apprehension of the physical harm. By contrast, to secure a conviction for robbery, the State must prove that the defendant took and carried away the property of someone else by\n   force or threat of force with the intent to deprive the victim of the property. The State need not prove that the victim reasonably feared immediate physical harm, that the defendant intended to create such fear, or that the defendant was apparently able to physically harm the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At trial, as a witness for the State, Rampmeyer testified that, on August 12, 2016, he was working at a Baskin Robbins in Owings Mills. Stewart entered the Baskin Robbins and asked: \"[I]s there anyone here in the store with you?\" Rampmeyer \"felt threatened\" and \"felt like [his] life could be in danger[.]\" Rampmeyer falsely said that there was another employee in the back, and asked: \"[W]hat can I help you with today?\" Stewart responded that, if Rampmeyer did not \"make any sudden moves\" and \"follow[ed] his instructions[, Rampmeyer] would not be shot and killed.\" Although Rampmeyer did not see a gun, any other kind of weapon, or a bulge in Stewart's clothing, Stewart's left hand was close to his waistband when he threatened Rampmeyer. Stewart told Rampmeyer to empty the cash register, and he obeyed. Stewart took the cash, which was between $150 and $200, and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After both parties rested, the circuit court instructed the jury regarding the elements of robbery and second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The Defendant is charged with the crime of robbery. Robbery is the taking and carrying away of property from someone else by force or threat of force with the intent to deprive the victim of the property. To convict the Defendant of robbery, the State must prove that the Defendant took [ ] property from Brian Rampmeyer, that the Defendant took the property by force or threat of force, and that the Defendant intended to deprive Brian Rampmeyer of the property. Property means anything of value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Defendant is charged with the crime of assault. Assault is intentionally frightening another person with the\n   threat of immediate physical harm. To convict the Defendant of assault, the State must prove the Defendant committed an act with the intent to place Brian Rampmeyer in fear of immediate physical harm, that the Defendant had the apparent ability at that time to bring about the physical harm, [ ] that Brian Rampmeyer reasonably feared immediate physical harm[,] and that the Defendant's actions were not legally justified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Stewart's counsel did not object to any of the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The jury found Stewart guilty of robbery and theft, and not guilty of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type. Immediately after the jury's foreperson announced the verdicts, Stewart's counsel requested a bench conference, which the circuit court granted. At the bench conference, Stewart's counsel contended that the verdicts were inconsistent, and requested that the circuit court instruct the jury to resume deliberating until it reached consistent verdicts. The prosecutor responded that the verdicts were consistent because one of the elements of robbery is \"a threat of force[,]\" whereas one of the elements of second-degree assault is \"an overt act.\" The prosecutor observed that it was possible that the jury believed that Stewart had not committed an overt act. The circuit court concluded that the verdicts were consistent, and denied\n   Stewart's counsel's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Opinion of the Court of Special Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Stewart appealed.

The\n   State argues that, in prior cases, when determining whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have focused on the jury instructions in each case. The State asserts that Stewart's counsel also relied on the jury instructions, given that, when he requested that the circuit court instruct the jury to continue deliberating until it reached consistent verdicts, he did not request that the circuit court provide the jury with case law regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense. The State maintains that, accordingly, Stewart's counsel took the position that the jury should resolve the alleged legal inconsistency based on the jury\n   instructions, as opposed to case law regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense. The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals's approach in this case-namely, focusing on legal principles established in case law governing whether one crime is a lesser-included offense of another crime-usurps the jury's role as the finder of fact, would result in courts determining whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent based on principles on which the jury was not instructed, and essentially ignores the evidence and jury instructions in each case. The State argues that, here, the verdicts are legally consistent because the crimes of robbery and second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type have different elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Stewart responds that the verdicts are legally inconsistent because second-degree assault is a lesser-included offense of robbery. Stewart contends that, to determine whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, a court must first confirm that the trial court correctly instructed the jury regarding the two offenses' elements; if so, the court must then ascertain whether the crime of which the jury found the defendant not guilty is a lesser-included offense of the crime of which the jury found the defendant guilty. Stewart asserts that, during the second step of the analysis, the court must apply the \"required evidence\" test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In a reply brief, the State agrees with Stewart that a court should engage in a two-step analysis to determine whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, and that the first step is to confirm whether the jury instructions regarding the two crimes' elements were correct. The State clarifies that, whereas Stewart contends that the second step is to review the crimes' elements in light of case law to determine whether one crime is a lesser-included offense of the other, its position is that the second step is to review the offenses' elements, as stated in the jury instructions, to determine whether the jury complied with the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court's conclusion as to whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Givens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778648,12486894\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/433/\">\n    449 Md. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778648,12486894\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/433/\">\n    144 A.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Legally Inconsistent Verdicts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This Court has held that guilty verdicts may not be legally inconsistent, regardless of whether a jury or a trial court tried the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Givens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778648,12486894\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/433/\">\n    449 Md. at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778648,12486894\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/449/433/\">\n    144 A.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Such an inquiry may require the appellate court to consider case law regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I find unworkable the State's position that, once the appellate court confirms that the trial court correctly instructed the jury regarding the two crimes' elements, the appellate court should \"review the elements of the [two crime]s in light of the jury instructions to determine whether the jury acted 'contrary to' them.\" According to the State, an appellate court should not \"review the elements of the offenses in light of case law\" regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense. From my perspective, if an appellate court could not consider case law regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense, the appellate court would essentially be unable to review the two crimes' elements to determine whether the guilty verdict and the not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent. Jury instructions are intended to aid the jury by providing an accurate and succinct description of the elements of an offense. The elements of crimes are defined by case law or statutes, and jury instructions are intended to accurately set forth the elements of crimes as embodied in case law or statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Further, in evaluating whether verdicts are legally consistent or inconsistent, an appellate court applies case law, such as\n   <em>\n    Abeokuto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2830599\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/391/289/#p353\">\n    391 Md. at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2830599\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/391/289/#p353\">\n    893 A.2d at 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that explains how to use two crimes' elements to determine whether one of the crimes is a lesser-included offense of the other. The appellate court could not make such a determination if it considered nothing but the jury instructions, and blinded\n   itself to case law regarding what constitutes a lesser-included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As I understand it, the State's position is that a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent only where it can be determined that the jury acted contrary to the trial court's instructions. I would decline to adopt the State's position, which renders the outcome of a purely legal question-namely, whether a guilty verdict as to one crime and a not-guilty verdict as to another crime are legally inconsistent-solely dependent on the jury instructions and the verdicts in each particular case. Although not the circumstance here, this approach would ignore the possibility that the jury may have been improperly instructed as to the law. Simply put, a guilty verdict as to Crime A and a not-guilty verdict as to Crime B either are, or are not, legally inconsistent in all cases based on the elements of the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   I am unconvinced by the State's premise that, under holding that I propose, \"the jury [would] use one approach to determin[e] consistency and inconsistency, and [ ] the appellate court [would] use a different approach.\" Where a defendant's counsel contends that a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, the trial court does not submit to the jury the purely legal question of whether the guilty verdict and the not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent. Instead, the trial court independently decides that question. If the trial court determines that the guilty verdict and the not-guilty verdict are not legally inconsistent, the trial court should let the verdicts stand; and, if the trial court determines that guilty verdict and the not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, the trial court should instruct the jury to resume deliberating until it reaches legally consistent verdicts. In no instance\n   should a trial court allow a jury to decide whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent; that decision is exclusively for the trial court to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Having clarified the two-step test for determining whether a guilty verdict and a not-guilty verdict are legally inconsistent, I would apply that test to the question of whether Stewart's conviction for robbery and his acquittal of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type are legally inconsistent. First, I would confirm that the circuit court correctly instructed the jury regarding the two crimes' elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Fortunately, here, the parties agree-and, I also agree-that the circuit court correctly instructed the jury regarding the elements of robbery and second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type.

Although the use of force element of robbery has been described as the use of violence or putting in fear, this description in no way encompasses the elements of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type. An examination of the robbery statute, case law, and the relevant Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions demonstrates that the circuit court correctly instructed the jury as to the elements of the two offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Having confirmed that the circuit court correctly instructed the jury regarding the two offenses' elements, I would next\n   answer the question of whether second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type (of which the jury found Stewart not guilty) is a lesser-included offense of robbery (of which the jury found Stewart guilty) to determine whether the jury's verdicts were legally inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   I would answer that question in the negative, as not \"all of the elements of\" the offense of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type \"are included in\" the offense of robbery.\n   <em>\n    Abeokuto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2830599\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/391/289/#p353\">\n    391 Md. at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2830599\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/391/289/#p353\">\n    893 A.2d at 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Indeed, as explained above, second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type includes elements that robbery lacks. To secure a conviction for second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type, the State must prove that: \"(1) the defendant commit[ted] an act with the intent to place a victim in fear of immediate physical harm; (2) the defendant ha[d] the apparent ability, at the time, to bring about the physical harm[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307389\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/450/#p455\">\n    440 Md. at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307389\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/450/#p455\">\n    103 A.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up); and (3) the victim was \"in reasonable apprehension of\" the physical harm,\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491766\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/407/202/\">\n    407 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   209 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3491138,3491766\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/963/1184/\">\n    963 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1188 n.3 (cleaned up). By contrast, to secure a conviction for robbery, the State need not prove that the victim reasonably feared immediate physical harm, that the defendant intended to create such fear, or that the defendant was apparently able to bring about the physical harm to the victim. To be sure, the State must prove that the defendant used either force or a threat of force against the victim, and those elements have been discussed as violence or putting in fear. That said, the threat of force or putting in fear has not been defined in our case law as needing to create reasonable fear of immediate physical harm, the defendant needing to intend to create such fear, or the defendant needing to have an apparent ability to physically harm the victim. For example, a defendant's oral threat of force that puts another in fear would be sufficient to satisfy the \"threat of force\" element of robbery without proof that the victim reasonably feared immediate physical harm, that the defendant intended to create that fear, or that the defendant had an apparent ability to physically harm the victim. In other words, the putting in fear associated by case\n   law with robbery is not the equivalent of the elements of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   An analysis of the circumstances of this case reveals that Stewart's conduct satisfied the elements of robbery, but not those of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type. Rampmeyer, the victim, testified that Stewart told him that, if he did not \"make any sudden moves\" and \"follow[ed] [Stewart's] instructions[, he] would not be shot and killed.\" Rampmeyer acknowledged that he did not see a gun, any other kind of weapon, or a bulge in Stewart's clothing. Instead, Rampmeyer testified that Stewart's left hand was close to his waistband when he threatened Rampmeyer. Although Rampmeyer's testimony established that Stewart used a \"threat of force,\"\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702209\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/422/#p439\">\n    422 Md. at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702209\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/422/#p439\">\n    30 A.3d at 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted), and that Rampmeyer may have, indeed, been put in fear, the facts of the case do not establish the elements of second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten variety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   I note that there are other cases in which, in contrast to Stewart, defendants were apparently able to physically harm victims.

Unlike the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , Stewart did not point a weapon and did not act with a group that was capable of overpowering Rampmeyer. Where, as here, a defendant orally threatens a victim, that act, without more, is not automatically second-degree assault of the intent-to-frighten type, one element of which is that the defendant \"has the apparent ability ... to bring about the physical harm\" to the victim.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307389\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/450/#p455\">\n    440 Md. at 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307389\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/450/#p455\">\n    103 A.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   I am unpersuaded by Stewart's reliance on cases in which this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have stated that assault is a lesser-included offense of robbery.

In other words, all of the elements of battery-assault are subsumed by the elements of robbery, with the exception of the taking of property from the victim.

In essence, Judge Watts's opinion differentiates between (i) physical, intentional, and offensive contact (elements of battery-assault) and (ii) acts intending to place a victim in fear of immediate physical harm (elements of intent-to-frighten assault) in order to conclude that the former elements are \"swallowed by\" robbery, while the latter elements are distinct from robbery. By making this distinction, Judge Watts's opinion concludes that the case law holding that assault is a lesser-included offense of robbery largely dealt with battery-assault, and that, while battery-assault is a lesser-included offense of robbery, intent-to-frighten assault is not a lesser-included offense. However, this is not what our case law reveals, because we have not explicitly created such a discrepancy between the forms of second-degree assault for the purposes of merger. If anything, our case law demonstrates that \"threat of force\" can sufficiently serve as \"an act with the intent to place [the victim] in fear of immediate physical harm\", such that intent-to-frighten assault has elements that are subsumed by, and merged into, robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <strong>\n    CASE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Judge Watts's opinion thoroughly considers a body of case law.

He then told me to empty all of the money out my register and move slowly and I would not be harmed.\" The victim was afraid that Respondent was armed, but he never saw Respondent with a weapon. Despite never seeing a weapon, the victim testified that \"[Respondent's] hand was down by his waist side when he made the comments to me. So with that being said, I immediately thought that he had a weapon and I had no idea what he was going to do.\" On cross-examination, the victim clarified that \"[w]ith [Respondent's] hand continued [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to be on his waist line, left hand, and not really leaving, that made me believe that there was a weapon of some sort that could have been involved.\" Video surveillance from the store, which captured the incident, revealed that Respondent leaned over towards the victim during the robbery.
