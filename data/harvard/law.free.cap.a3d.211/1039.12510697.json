Abdus-Sabur, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a and criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1). The defendant claims on appeal that (1) there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the specific intent to kill, as required for the crime of murder, (2) the trial court improperly denied his request for a third-party culpability instruction, and (3) that the court improperly admitted evidence of his gang affiliation. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts, as could have been reasonably found by the jury, and procedural history, are as follows. On the evening of January 17, 2014, the defendant was at an apartment on the third floor of a Waterbury housing complex known as \"Brick City.\" The defendant's\n   friends, Arvaughn Clemente and Daniel Clinton, were hosting a house party at the apartment. The defendant's brother, Isa Abdus-Sabur (Isa), and Ryan Curry, Sthalron Freeman, and Katrina Montgomery were also in attendance. Clemente was dating Ja-Ki Calloway, who was also in the apartment. Calloway's father, Kareem Morey, Sr. (victim), rented a second floor apartment in the same complex, where he resided with his adult son, Kareem Morey, Jr. (Kareem). On the evening of January 17, 2014, his other son, Kentrell Morey, was also at the housing complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   That night, Calloway's brother, Kareem learned that Clemente had assaulted Calloway, and became angry. Kareem and Kentrell then presented themselves at the third floor apartment and demanded that Calloway leave the apartment, but she refused. Kareem wanted to fight Clemente for having assaulted his sister. A verbal altercation then ensued between the Morey brothers and the men inside the apartment, which spilled onto the landing outside the apartment. The altercation escalated into a fist fight between a number of the party attendees and the Morey brothers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the fight ended, the Morey brothers, upset by the altercation, left and walked to a nearby neighborhood to recruit additional people to renew the fight. They also called the victim, who had not been present at the initial altercation, and he informed them that he would return home. When the Morey brothers left, the partygoers returned to the third floor apartment. At this point, Montgomery overheard the defendant mention a gun to the other men at the party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At about 10:30 p.m., the Morey brothers returned to Brick City with four additional men. Around this time, the victim also returned and parked his car on the street outside of the housing complex. The Morey brothers then entered the interior courtyard of Brick City through a passage from the street and climbed the\n   stairs to the landing outside of Clemente and Clinton's third floor apartment. The victim remained standing at ground level in the courtyard near the foot of the stairs. The Morey brothers began kicking Clemente and Clinton's apartment door. Eventually, the door to the apartment opened, but all the lights were off inside the apartment. Shortly thereafter, Kareem heard the \"click, click\" sound of a gun. The Morey brothers then fled by descending the stairs toward the courtyard.\n   As the Morey brothers retreated down the stairs, the occupants of Clemente and Clinton's apartment emerged onto the third floor landing overlooking the courtyard. Within the crowd on the third floor porch were the defendant, Isa, Clemente, Clinton, Curry, and Freeman. The defendant then began firing a black hand-gun from the railing of the landing toward the people in the courtyard below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By the time the defendant started shooting, the Morey brothers had arrived at the bottom of the stairs, where the victim was standing. When the victim heard the first gunshot, he pushed Kareem out of the way. The victim was then struck in the chest with a .45 caliber bullet. He told his sons that he had been hit and ran out of the courtyard through the passage toward his parked vehicle. The victim was driven to St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, where he later died as a result of the gunshot wound to his chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the shooting, the defendant and Isa ran to the defendant's car and left Brick City. The next day, the defendant and Isa pulled up in a sports utility vehicle alongside Kentrell's girlfriend, Zyaira Cummings, while she was walking on a street near Brick City. The defendant then said to Cummings, \"they're next,\" which she interpreted to be a threat against the Morey brothers, whom she then warned about the interaction. On January 18, 2014, the day after the shooting, the defendant\n   fled to Southington. On January 21, 2014, the defendant traveled to New York City. That same day, the police obtained a warrant for his arrest. The defendant eventually turned himself in on January 27, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a trial by jury, the defendant was convicted of murder and criminal possession of a firearm. The court sentenced the defendant to forty-five years of incarceration for his conviction of murder and two years of concurrent incarceration for his conviction of criminal possession of a firearm, for a total effective sentence of forty-five years of incarceration. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the specific intent to cause the death of the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this claim. At the close of the state's evidence, the defendant made a motion for a judgment of acquittal, contending that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to cause the death of the victim. Specifically, defense counsel argued that the evidence that the defendant possessed and fired a firearm was insufficient to establish the requisite intent to cause the death of the victim. The court denied the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable\n   doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Perkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2608442\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/218/#p246\">\n    271 Conn. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 246,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=856%20A.2d%20917\">\n    856 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Because [t]he only kind of an inference recognized by the law is a reasonable one [however] ... any such inference cannot be based on possibilities, surmise or conjecture....

[T]he line between permissible inference and impermissible speculation is not always easy to discern.

If that correlation is sufficiently compelling, the inference is reasonable. But if the correlation between the facts and the conclusion is slight, or if a different conclusion is more closely correlated with the facts than the chosen conclusion, the inference is less reasonable.

Therefore, an intent to kill can be inferred based solely on the defendant's use of a deadly weapon on another person. Moreover, even if Kareem was the intended target, the fact that the defendant struck the victim does not undermine the existence of the necessary specific intent to cause the death of another person.

The shooting followed an altercation earlier in the night between the partygoers, including the defendant and the Morey brothers. Accordingly, the defendant had a motive to seek retribution. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709092\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/393/#p411\">\n    273 Conn. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=869%20A.2d%201236\">\n    869 A.2d 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (evidence that defendant had been involved in altercation with intended victim on night of murder, and intended victim had punched defendant, supported inference that defendant had motive to kill).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Additionally, there was evidence that the defendant fled the scene directly after the shooting, travelled out of town the next day, and travelled out of state later that week. These facts are indicia of an intent to kill.

Finally, there was evidence that the defendant threatened the Morey brothers\n   the day after the murder by stating \"they're next\" to Cummings. This evidence further supports the conclusion that the defendant had the specific intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, from the cumulative weight of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the specific intent required for murder. Accordingly, we reject the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his request for a third-party culpability instruction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The following facts are relevant to this claim. Nunez, who lived in Brick City and was present at the shooting, identified the defendant as the shooter on several occasions during her testimony. Nunez also stated that she did not see anyone other than the defendant with a gun. Nunez was impeached, however, by a prior inconsistent statement that she admitted she had made to her friend, Queyla Martinez, that she did not see the shooter. She also testified that Kareem told her that Clinton was the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the trial, the court instructed the jury that the testimony of Nunez, Kareem, and Martinez given on December 7, 2016, that related to whether Clinton was the shooter was not substantive evidence in the case but, instead, could be considered only for impeachment purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Following closing arguments, but before the court charged the jury, defense counsel, contending that Clinton was the actual shooter on the night of the incident,\n   requested a jury charge on third-party culpability. Specifically, defense counsel relied on testimony from Nunez that Kareem had told her that Clinton was the shooter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court denied the request for a third-party culpability instruction. After the court charged the jury, defense counsel took an exception to the charge and renewed his request for a third-party culpability charge. The state argued that it would be inappropriate to give such a charge because the only evidence before the jury suggesting that Clinton was the shooter was admitted for impeachment purposes only. The court again declined to instruct the jury on third-party culpability, stating that there must be more than a mere suspicion that Clinton was the shooter, and that there was no substantive evidence that Clinton was the shooter in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, defense counsel conceded during oral argument that there was no evidence regarding Clinton's culpability that was admitted for substantive purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the defendant does not\n   challenge on appeal the court's decision limiting the testimony to impeachment purposes only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"In determining whether the trial court improperly refused a request to charge, [w]e ... review the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to\n   supporting the ... proposed charge. ... A request to charge which is relevant to the issues of [a] case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given.... If, however, the evidence would not reasonably support a finding of the particular issue, the trial court has a duty\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to submit it to the jury.... Thus, a trial court should instruct the jury in accordance with a party's request to charge [only] if the proposed instructions are reasonably supported by the evidence....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"It is well established that a defendant has a right to introduce evidence that indicates that someone other than the defendant committed the crime with which the defendant has been charged.... The defendant must, however, present evidence that directly connects a third party to the crime.... It is not enough to show that another had the motive to commit the crime ... nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which the defendant is accused....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The admissibility of evidence of third party culpability is governed by the rules relating to relevancy.... Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.... Accordingly, in explaining the requirement that the proffered evidence establish a direct connection to a third party, rather than raise merely a bare suspicion regarding a third party, we have stated: Such evidence is relevant, exculpatory evidence, rather than merely tenuous evidence of third party culpability [introduced by a defendant] in an attempt to divert from himself the evidence of guilt.... In other words, evidence that establishes a direct connection between a third party and the charged offense is relevant to the central question before the jury, namely, whether a reasonable doubt exists as to whether the defendant committed the offense. Evidence that would raise only a bare suspicion\n   that a third party, rather than the defendant, committed the charged offense would not be relevant to the jury's determination. A trial court's decision, therefore, that third party culpability evidence proffered by the defendant is admissible, necessarily entails a determination that the proffered evidence is relevant to the jury's determination of whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the defendant's guilt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[I]f the evidence pointing to a third party's culpability, taken together and considered in the light most favorable to the defendant, establishes a direct connection between the third party and the charged offense, rather than merely raising a bare suspicion that another could have committed the crime, a trial court has a duty to submit an appropriate charge to the jury.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956601\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/597/#p607\">\n    284 Conn. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=935%20A.2d%20975\">\n    935 A.2d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the present case, there simply was no evidence that tended to establish a direct connection between Clinton and the\n   charged offense. The defendant cites only to testimony by Nunez that she had told Martinez that she did not know the identity of the shooter, and that she had heard from Kareem that Clinton was the shooter. Importantly, this testimony was not admitted for its truth, but rather only to assess the credibility of the witnesses' testimony. Defense counsel conceded at oral argument before this court that there was no substantive evidence that Clinton was the shooter. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly determined that the defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on third-party culpability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by permitting Nunez and Kareem to testify\n   regarding the defendant's gang affiliation. In particular, the defendant argues that this evidence was improperly permitted because it constituted uncharged misconduct and did not fall within one of the exceptions provided by \u00a7 4-5 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the defendant argues that the evidence was unduly prejudicial and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. We decline to reach this claim because the defendant failed to brief whether the admission of this testimony constituted harmful error. Accordingly, we deem the claim abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to trial, the state filed a notice of uncharged misconduct evidence, indicating that it intended to present evidence of the defendant's gang affiliation. The defendant objected to admission of such evidence, and the court deferred ruling on the evidentiary issue. Thereafter, prior to the start of trial, the court directed that, until it had ruled on an offer of proof outside the jury's presence, witnesses were not to mention the defendant's gang affiliation. The court stated that it would consider each offer of each witness' testimony individually, and would not make a blanket ruling on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At trial, during Nunez' direct examination, the state asked for the jury to be excused and, outside the jury's presence, notified the court that it anticipated asking Nunez about the defendant's gang affiliation. The state then examined Nunez outside the presence of the jury, where she stated that she had not reported the shooting to the police on the night it occurred because she was afraid \"that somebody would do something to [her].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When asked who she meant by \"somebody,\" she replied, \"the Bloods.\" After hearing this proffer, the court ruled that it would allow the examination, but that it would provide a limiting instruction. The jury returned and the prosecutor elicited the proffered testimony from the witness that implied that the defendant was a member of the Bloods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Kareem also testified that the defendant was in a gang. There was a proffer of this testimony outside the presence of the jury before it was admitted. At the request of defense counsel, when the prosecutor questioned the witness he specifically used a transcript of the approved questions from the proffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We now turn to the relevant law. \"Evidence of a defendant's uncharged misconduct is inadmissible to prove that the defendant committed the charged crime or to show the predisposition of the defendant to commit the charged crime.... Exceptions to this rule have been recognized, however, to render misconduct evidence admissible if, for example, the evidence is offered to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime.... To determine whether evidence of prior misconduct falls within an exception to the general rule prohibiting its admission, we have adopted a two-pronged analysis.... First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crime evidence.... [Because] the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence is a decision within\n   the discretion of the trial court, we will draw every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court's ruling.... We will reverse a trial court's decision only [if] it has abused its discretion or an injustice has occurred....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"It is well settled that, absent structural error, the mere fact that a trial court rendered an improper ruling does not entitle the party challenging that ruling to obtain a new trial. An improper ruling must also be harmful to justify such relief. ... It is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if [the] error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling [that] was probably harmful to him....

Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the ... evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial....
