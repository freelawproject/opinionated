We are asked to consider under what circumstances the dangers of heroin would justify holding a dealer liable for involuntary manslaughter for supplying the means by which his customer fatally overdoses. The issue is fraught. The perception of an epidemic cannot solely dictate its legally recognized danger. As our role requires, we address the issue in the specific context of\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   sale of heroin to determine where the act falls on the continuum of culpability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The question presented is at once straightforward and weighty: whether the evidence in the trial court was sufficient to sustain Patrick Joseph Thomas' (\"Thomas\") conviction for\n   involuntary manslaughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We resolve this case in favor of Petitioner, holding that there was sufficient evidence to convict Thomas of gross negligence involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State charged Thomas with three counts: distribution of heroin, reckless endangerment, and involuntary manslaughter. Thomas entered, what we have termed before, a \"hybrid plea,\" wherein the parties \"agree to the ultimate facts,\" while \"maintain[ing] the ability to argue legal issues, as well as sufficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

These agreed factual findings were read into the record by the State's Attorney and are quoted at length below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As an initial matter, Thomas objects to the State's citation of \"at least ten journal articles, newspaper reports, and internet websites\" to support its argument, because, he asserts, we are confined to the record \"as presented to the lower court.\" Moreover, Thomas states that he \"does not agree to the facts identified by the State\" in its brief, particularly considering that they are not placed in the context of the time in which this incident occurred, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We agree with Thomas that newspaper articles-excepting those referenced in the agreed statement of facts-play no role in consideration of this case. Still, this Court is able to take judicial notice of facts \"not subject to reasonable dispute\" and \"capable of accurate and ready determination by\n   resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Maryland Rule 5-201(b).

[in] Ocean Pines, Worcester County, Maryland. Tammy advised that she had located her son, Colton Lee Matrey [ (\"Colton\") ], locked in her bathroom. Colton was unresponsive, had no pulse and was not breathing. Tammy would testify that she had previously seen Colton earlier that day, alive and well, and had found him at this particular time of evening or early morning hours of the 26th of June unresponsive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   At 3:27 in the morning Ocean Pines Emergency Medical Services and Ocean Pines Police Officer Kerrigan arrived at the residence and located Colton seated on the toilet in the bathroom with his head propped on the vanity top. They pronounced Colton deceased. Because of the scene, it was determined that Colton died of a probable heroin overdose. And, therefore, the Worcester County Criminal Enforcement Team was contacted and asked to respond to conduct\n   a criminal investigation of the circumstances surrounding Colton's death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   At approximately 4:30 in the morning, Detective Jeff Johns [ (\"Johns\") ] of the Ocean City Police Department, assigned to the Worcester County Criminal Enforcement Team, arrived at the residence. Without objection, Johns would have been offered and accepted as an expert in the valuation and identification of controlled dangerous substances [ (\"CDS\") ], the common practices of users and dealers of [CDS] and [CDS] investigations generally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Johns arrived at the residence, went into the bathroom of the residence, observed Colton, determined that Colton's body had not been moved....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Johns located one white wax paper bag inside of Colton's right hand. There were three additional identical white wax paper bags on the ground directly beneath Colton between the toilet and the vanity. Each one of these bags was stamped [\"banshee\"] in blue, with a blue-colored emblem. Those packages contained trace amounts of suspected contraband [and] are what Johns knows is commonly used to contain heroin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [State's exhibits] reflect the photograph of Colton's right hand which contained the one empty package of banshee and the other photograph depicts what was found in Colton's pants pocket, which was a syringe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Colton's bedroom was searched with the consent of his mother. And located in Colton's bedroom were four additional hypodermic syringes, a spoon and a Q-tip inside of a folded pair of Colton's jeans in the closet. These were identified by Johns as heroin paraphernalia. There was also a prescription pill bottle with the label torn off that contained six 50-milligram tramadol pills, which is a Schedule IV [CDS]. It was determined that Colton did not have a prescription for the tramadol pills and possibly had taken these pills, unknowingly, from his mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Johns spoke with the individuals who were present in the residence at the time [of Colton's death]. In addition to Tammy, ... there was also James Godino [ (\"Godino\") ], who was the boyfriend of Tammy, and Carissa Koons [ (\"Koons\") ], who was the girlfriend of Colton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   It was determined ... by interrogating or questioning those three individuals that Colton had been abusing heroin for approximately four[-]and[-]a[-]half years. He resided in Pennsylvania up until February of 2015, when he moved to Ocean Pines, Maryland to live with his mother....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Koons had been in a relationship with Colton for four years. She advised that Colton had always had a heroin addiction. Approximately two[-]and[-]a[-]half years ago Colton had overdosed after being released from a halfway house where he had become clean of opiates. Narcan, or naloxone, was administered, and he had survived that overdose. However, Koons advised that he continued to abuse heroin after that overdose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In February of 2015[,] Colton moved out of the Pennsylvania area and into his mother's home in an attempt to isolate himself from the lifestyle of heroin abuse in Pennsylvania....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [O]n June 25th[,] Colton had asked his mother to borrow her debit card. Tammy allowed Colton to have her debit card so that he could rent a couple of movies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   After his death, she checked her bank transactions. She observed that Colton had rented two movies and then withdrew $ 40 in U.S. currency. This $ 40 in U.S. currency was withdrawn at 11:59 in the evening on the 25th of June ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 25th of 2015[,] at approximately 11:50[,] Koons woke up from her sleep and observed that Colton had her car keys.... He then left the residence....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Approximately five minutes after Colton left the residence, Koons called Colton. He did not answer. She woke up at approximately [1:00] in the morning, noticed that Colton\n   was not in the bedroom with her and called him again. He did not answer, and she fell back asleep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   At approximately 3:10 to 3:15 in the morning[,] Koons woke up again. Colton was still not back in the bedroom. She then checked the bathroom and noticed that the door was locked, looked under the door crack and observed Colton's shoes. She then woke up Colton's mother, Tammy, and Godino. Godino removed the door hinges, at which time they were able to locate Colton's body in the bathroom. He was checked for a pulse. It was determined that he was not breathing and that's when 911 had been called.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Johns, as part of the investigation, seized Colton's black in color cellular telephone.... Tammy granted Johns permission to search the contents of the phone in an attempt to identify Colton's supplier of heroin....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Later in the day[,] Tammy contacted Johns and advised that she had found a piece of paper inside Colton's wallet that had two names and phone numbers written down....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The names and numbers written down on this piece of paper was [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the name Pat, with the number ..., and also the name G - G ... and his number ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Johns, utilizing the LInX Law Enforcement database, input the number that corresponded with the name of Pat. The database search identified Patrick Joseph Thomas [ (\"Thomas\") ], with a date of birth of 8/16/56, a 58-at the time-year old white male as the owner of the phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Koons] indicated [to Johns] that when she woke up at approximately 11:50 on June 25th of 2015, and Colton was still in the house, she heard Colton complaining that Pat was not answering the phone. This was right before Colton left the residence in Koon's car. There was no real familiarity with Pat. Koons had never met Pat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A physical examination of Colton's phone ... shows that an individual by the name of Pat was saved as one of his\n   contacts. And the phone number ... corresponded with the number found in Colton's wallet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Johns then looked through the ... call log on Colton's phone and observed the following: On June 25, 2015, starting at 11:45 in the evening, [23:45] hours, Colton called Thomas 27 times ... between 11:45 and 12:07 a.m. All of those call durations, except for the last one, were zero seconds, indicating no answer,\n   no contact. That last call was 27 seconds long, indicating contact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, there were text messages sent from Colton's cellular telephone sent to the number associated with Thomas. Those text messages were sent on June 25, 2015, at [23:46] hours, which stated, \"I got $ 30, man, call me, please.\" June 25, 2015, at [23:48] hours, \"Call me.\" June 25, 2015, [23:48], \"I'll come to you.\" June 26, 2015, at two minutes past midnight, ... \"I'm here, I need 4.\" ... June 26, 2015, at [00:05] hours, \"Yo, I'm here.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Johns would testify, based on his training, knowledge, and experience ... that these were outgoing cell phone calls and text messages reaching out to Thomas, inquiring about purchasing five\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] bags of heroin during those several minutes....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [F]rom Colton's last communication until the time he's pronounced dead, the only person he attempted to communicate with was Thomas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on that information, a search and seizure warrant was authored by Johns. And on July 2nd of 2015, a search and seizure warrant was executed on the person of Thomas and [his residence.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Johns located a total of 60 individual white wax paper bags. These bags were stamped [\"banshee\"] in blue, with a blue emblem. These bags were identical in appearance to the bags recovered from Colton from the date that he\n   expired. These bags were on a table that was directly next to the chair where Thomas was seated during the warrant execution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Each of these bags contained a light brown powdery substance that was suspected heroin.... [E]ight bags were loose on the table, and there were another 52 bags that were packaged in four bundles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   There were several hundred empty ... wax paper bags[ ] on the floor directly next to the chair where Thomas was seated and on the table next to Thomas.... Johns noticed a combination of the following: ... wax paper bag[s] stamped \"banshee\" in blue with a blue emblem[;] ... white wax paper bags stamped \"banshee\" in blue with no emblem[;] ... white wax paper bags stamped \"New York\" in black with a black mask emblem[;] ... blue wax paper bags stamped \"Gucci\" in red with a red emblem[;] ... [and] blue wax paper bags stamped \"slam\" ... in red with no emblem.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Also seized from Thomas was an LG brand cellular telephone that was on the table next to where he was seated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [Johns examined Thomas' phone.] [A] screen shot of the LG phone ... identified as Thomas' identif[ied] an individual logged ... as a contact. The name is \"Colton\".... [The number] corresponds with Colton's cellular telephone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Toll records show that the cellular telephone that was in Thomas' possession received 28 incoming phone calls from Colton's phone number, starting as [23:45] hours, or 11:45, on the evening of June 25th of 2015, and continued through seven minutes after midnight on June 26th of 2015....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Johns would testify that the inconsistency, meaning there was 27 versus 28\n   [calls], would be that one of those calls would have been deleted by Colton accidentally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The 60 bags recovered from Thomas' residence [were] ... submitted ... for testing and analysis.... [T]hat report reflects that the gross weight was 13.10 grams.... Five specimens were analyzed separately, resulting in the conclusion that those items contained the substance of heroin, a Schedule I [CDS].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [H]ad this matter gone to trial, ... the State would have introduced the postmortem examination of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.... [The] autopsy [was] performed by [Theodore M. King, M.D. (\"King\") ].... [T]he toxicology report and findings [stated:]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"This 23-year-old white male, Colton Lee Matrey, died of alcohol and narcotic (free morphine ) intoxication. The manner of death could not be determined. Autopsy detected increased levels of alcohol and a drug (free morphine ) in the heart blood of the deceased and also showed evidence of heart disease and injuries to the head, neck, back, upper extremities and lower extremities. The additional finding in the prostate gland was incidental to the man's death. The deceased had been consuming alcoholic beverages and heroin (a drug) a [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] prior to death. Post mortem testing for additional drugs was negative.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   During Johns' testimony, ... inquiry would have been made regarding the general public awareness regarding the dangers of heroin. It would be his testimony that Worcester County, this particular region, and the State of Maryland has been consumed with heroin overdoses, some resulting in deaths, and that these overdoses have resulted in an acute awareness of the dangers of heroin. Simply put, he would say, heroin kills, and everyone knows it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   He would also testify that even ... outside of the drug use or abuse realm, it is still commonly known. He would testify that one local paper is currently running a weekly series of articles regarding the dangers of heroin use ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   He would testify that the community itself has come together and formed groups in order to address the opioid and heroin problems facing this particular community.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would be his testimony ... that anyone in Thomas' situation would understand the dangers of heroin, and its propensity to harm physically, if not kill, individuals who are ingesting it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Following Thomas' arrest, he was transported to the Worcester County Sheriff's Office.... Corporal Wells [ (\"Wells\") ] and [other officers] ... met with Thomas at the sheriff's office in the processing room. Wells advised Thomas of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights .... [T]here is no argument as to the voluntariness of [Thomas'] statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Wells asked Thomas, \"How many bags of heroin do you use a day?\" Thomas replied, \"About 12.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"How many bags do you use in a single shot?\" Thomas replied, \"Four.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Wells advised Thomas that investigators were aware that he was travelling to Delaware to get his supply of heroin. Wells asked Thomas, \"How often do you go to Delaware to get heroin?\" Thomas replied, \"Every two to three days.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"How many bundles do you get at a time?\" Thomas replied, \"Five.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"How much ... did you pay today for the five bundles?\" Thomas replied, \"Three hundred dollars.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A bundle ... would be testified by Johns as [being] ... anywhere from ten to thirteen ... individual bags of heroin. They are rubber-banded together and sold as a bundle....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Wells asked Thomas, \"When did you last go to Delaware to get heroin?\" Thomas replied, \"Today.\" ... Wells asked Thomas, \"How much do you sell a bag of heroin for?\" Thomas replied, \"Ten to fifteen dollars.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"So out of the five bundles you got today, how many bags would you normally sell?\" Thomas replied, \"About 30.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Wells asked Thomas, \"What is the best heroin out there now?\" Thomas replied, \"Banshee.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"How long have you been selling the banshee bags?\" Thomas replied, \"A month or a month and a half.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Wells advised Thomas, \"We saw you sell some heroin to a boy named Colton, or something like that, the other week.\" Thomas replied, \"Yeah, you mean Colt.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"What do you know about Colt?\" Thomas replied, \"He is a young boy. He told me he did some prison time in Pennsylvania.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"How many times have you sold heroin to Colt?\" Thomas advised, \"A few times.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Wells told Thomas, \"When we saw you sell to Colt, it was like midnight. Do you remember that?\" Thomas replied, \"Yeah, it was late.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"Is that what time you normally meet with Colt?\" Thomas replied, \"No, that was weird. I usually met him earlier.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"So that was the only time you sold heroin to Colt at around midnight?\" Thomas replied, \"Yeah.\" Wells advised Thomas, \"Do you remember how many bags you sold him?\" Thomas replied, \"Four.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Wells asked Thomas, \"Where did you meet with Colt on this night?\" Thomas replied, \"I can't remember where I met him. It could have been the Food Lion parking lot. No, I think I met him on the street in Ocean Pines.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"Was Colt driving a car?\" Thomas replied, \"No, he was walking.\" Wells asked Thomas, \"What kind of bag did you sell Colt?\" Thomas replied, \"Banshee bags.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Wells then showed Thomas a photograph taken of Colton. This photograph depicted Colton deceased in the bathroom of Colton's mother's house. Wells asked Thomas, \"Is this the\n   person you know as Colt?\" Thomas looked at the photograph and replied, \"Yeah, that's him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Thomas has a puzzled look on his face. Thomas asked Wells, \"Is he dead in that picture?\" Wells replied, \"Yes. This picture was ... taken just hours after [Colton] met with you and bought heroin.\" Thomas replied, \"He couldn't have overdosed off what I sold him. I only sold him four bags.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Wells then showed Thomas a picture of four banshee bags of heroin that were recovered from the bathroom that Colton was found deceased in. Wells asked Thomas, \"You mean these four bags?\" Thomas' eyes opened widely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Wells asked Thomas, \"Do you know how old Colt was?\" Thomas replied, \"I think he was like 19.\"\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Wells and Thomas sat quietly for a moment.

To address it, we rely on the principles enumerated above, as well as relevant out-of-state case law, to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in the record to permit the trier of fact to conclude that Thomas was grossly negligent and that his conduct caused Colton's death. But first, we address Thomas' curious contention that a conviction for gross negligence manslaughter cannot be premised upon the commission of a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   criminal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    (i) Gross Negligence Manslaughter and\n   </em>\n   Malum in Se\n   <em>\n    Offenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Thomas proposes that Maryland should not recognize gross negligence manslaughter when the defendant is accused of committing a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   offense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   as opposed to a\n   <em>\n    malum prohibitum\n   </em>\n   offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Distribution of heroin, says Thomas, is a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   offense and, consequently, may only be tried under the unlawful act theory of manslaughter. Thomas contends\n   that allowing\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   crimes to be charged as gross negligence manslaughter \"hybridizes\"\n   the two involuntary manslaughter crimes, making them easier to prove. In other words, Thomas argues that charging\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   crimes as gross negligence manslaughter allows the State to take advantage of the less stringent causation showing of gross negligence manslaughter, while benefiting from the higher culpability presumed in a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The State disagrees, providing that \"whether distribution of heroin is a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    malum prohibitum\n   </em>\n   only matters if the State is proceeding on the unlawful act variety of involuntary manslaughter,\" which it is not. Whenever a party is charged with gross negligence manslaughter, according to the State, the prosecution must prove that the act was grossly negligent, regardless of whether the crime at issue is\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    malum prohibitum\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the State characterizes Thomas' argument as \"nonsensical,\" maintaining that it allows some perpetrators to escape criminal liability when they commit a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   offense in a grossly negligent manner-the gross negligence manslaughter\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   -but death does not occur in the commission of, or escape from, the crime-a causation requirement for unlawful act manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We agree with the State.

But, significantly, it did not decide whether an act \"dangerous to life\" would suffice for the charge, regardless of whether it was\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    malum prohibitum\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"865609\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/355/287/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Moylan,\n   <em>\n    Criminal Homicide Law\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.5, at 215.

In\n   <em>\n    Schlossman\n   </em>\n   , the intermediate appellate court stated that \"homicide resulting from the perpetration of a\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   unlawful act not amounting to a felony is manslaughter, regardless of whether the unlawful act was 'dangerous to life.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2351885\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/105/277/#p289\">\n    105 Md.

Thus, the intermediate appellate court reasserted the underlying rationale for the unlawful act-gross negligence manslaughter distinction-the State is relieved from the burden of demonstrating the higher level of culpability for unlawful act manslaughter due to the seriousness of the underlying offense. The inverse of this concept is also true. When the State seeks to proceed under a gross negligence manslaughter theory, it must demonstrate the higher level of culpability, irrespective of whether the underlying offense is\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    malum prohibitum\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, the State does not benefit from any presumption in this circumstance-notwithstanding whether distribution of heroin is\n   <em>\n    malum in se\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    malum prohibitum\n   </em>\n   -and must prove the grossly negligent\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) Gross Negligence\n   </em>\n   Mens Rea\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The State next argues that the Court of Special Appeals \"usurped the role of the trier of fact and relied on unsupported assumptions\" when it determined there was sufficient evidence of negligence, but not gross negligence. The State particularly\n   takes issue with the intermediate appellate court's statement that drug dealers have \"no rational interest\" in making drug use more dangerous, as it believes this is \"not supported by the record or reality.\" Specifically, the State points to the following facts to show sufficient evidence for the conviction: Thomas had no way of knowing the purity of the heroin he sold; the circumstances surrounding the timing of the sale; Thomas knew Colton was a \"young boy\"; Thomas knew that Colton was an addict who recently came to Maryland after a stay in prison; and Thomas knew that Colton was\n   \"desperate\" for heroin and, \"by inference,\" that he would likely consume all four bags. Thomas asserts that the evidence in this case cannot support his conviction under a gross negligence theory because it does \"not show the requisite wanton disregard for human life necessary to constitute gross negligence.\" He states that, \"absent proof that the accused or someone in his or her situation should know that amount of the substance is probably fatal,\" the evidence is insufficient to establish gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   We have already discussed the general principles of gross negligence in Maryland, but, before this case, Maryland appellate courts have never been asked to apply them to the distribution of drugs. Our search for law on this issue in other states has revealed only a few relevant decisions. While some states have reviewed this matter based on a theory of common law manslaughter, others have avoided such a ruling due to supervening legislation addressing drug distribution resulting in death.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2018-3-102\">\n    Colo.

The agreed facts provide that Thomas was surprised that Colton fatally overdosed from four bags of Banshee heroin. Assuredly, he may have felt pangs of conscience. But these facts do not overcome the risk and inherent dangerousness of the underlying activity. Indeed, according to the agreed statement of facts, \"anyone in Thomas' situation would understand the dangers of heroin, and its propensity to harm physically, if not kill, individuals who are ingesting it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The agreed facts also include a description of what Detective Johns, testifying as an expert in CDS investigations, would say at a trial-that Worcester County \"has been consumed with heroin overdoses, some resulting in deaths, and that these overdoses have resulted in an acute awareness of the dangers of heroin.\" In his words, \"heroin kills, and everyone knows it.\" His proffered testimony is consistent with data collected by the State of Maryland's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene regarding fatal overdoses from heroin and other opioids. In 2015, the year Colton died, there were 1,259 deaths from alcohol and drugs in Maryland-86% of these were opioid-related.\n   <em>\n    See Drug- and Alcohol-Related Intoxication Deaths in Maryland, 2015\n   </em>\n   , Md. Dep't of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene 1, 5 (Sept. 2016), https://bha.health.maryland.gov/OVERDOSE_PREVENTION/Documents/2015% 20Annual% 20Report_revised.pdf [\n   <em>\n    archived at\n   </em>\n   https://perma.cc/48X6-DHKJ]. In this State, fatal overdoses from heroin rose dramatically between 2011 and 2015, from 247 to 748 overdoses, vastly exceeding the number of deaths caused by any other drug, including fentanyl.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at fig.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In 2015, the rural counties of the Eastern Shore suffered 51 heroin-related deaths, including 11 deaths in Worcester County and 13 deaths in neighboring Wicomico.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at fig.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It is also fair to infer that Thomas subjectively knew an overdose was possible based on his statement that Colton \"couldn't have overdosed\n   <strong>\n    off [the amount] I sold him\n   </strong>\n   .\" It is enough that Thomas knew about the overdose risks of heroin. That he knew about the risk but wrongly estimated the amount of heroin sufficient to kill his customer does not remove his conduct from the reckless and wanton category. Again, involuntary manslaughter does not involve an intent to\n   kill, but only a reckless disregard of another person's life. When some quantity of heroin will kill, but variable circumstances render that quantity unpredictable, a person takes a large risk in distributing any amount above an exceedingly de minimis threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Considering the agreed statement of facts, reinforced by Maryland governmental data pertaining to 2015, we are asked to decide a legal question regarding Thomas' culpability. A major component of that question relates to the degree of increased risk we attribute to the heroin, itself-or how \"wanton or reckless\" the distribution of heroin is exclusive of other factors. After much consideration of precedent in Maryland and elsewhere, we reach the same conclusion as the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which stated that \"the consumption of heroin in unknown strength is dangerous to human life, and the administering of such a drug is inherently dangerous ....\"\n   <em>\n    Catalina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20N.E.2d%20973\">\n    556 N.E.2d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). We do so with the caveat, as indicated earlier, that distribution, alone, does not\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   amount to gross negligence. This caveat is unavailing to Thomas, however, because this is not a case involving the \"mere act of distributing heroin,\" as Thomas portrays it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   A reasonable person in Thomas' place would have understood that Colton was desperate for heroin and would have realized that increased the risk of the transaction. The facts state that Colton had been abusing heroin for approximately four-and-a-half years, and Thomas knew he was a \"young boy\" who had been in prison in Pennsylvania sometime in the past. On the night of his fatal overdose, Colton called Thomas 27 or 28 times between 11:45 p.m. and 12:07 a.m.-more than one call per minute-until Thomas finally answered. Colton also sent multiple text messages to Thomas in that same timeframe, imploring him to \"call me, please\" and stating that he would \"come to [Thomas]\" to get the heroin. Moreover, Thomas recognized that it was \"unusual\" for him to meet Colton at midnight and that he \"usually met him earlier.\" All of these facts support the inference that Colton was desperately in\n   need of heroin and might well ingest the entire four bags of heroin immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   It is also relevant to distinguish the systematic and sustained heroin distributor from the infrequent or inexperienced provider. The agreed statement of facts reveals a substantial amount about Thomas' heroin distribution practices. Thomas resupplies his heroin stock \"every two to three days,\" when he travels to Delaware to purchase five bundles (50-65 total bags of heroin) for $ 300. Thomas is a heroin abuser, himself; presumably consumes between 24 to 36 bags of each resupply; and sells the remainder for $ 10-$ 15 per bag, an amount which consistently nets him a profit. At the time of his arrest, Thomas possessed 13.10 grams (60 bags) of heroin. From all this, it is evident that Colton was not Thomas' only client and that Thomas consistently distributed heroin to a substantial\n   network of associates. Thus, we can infer that Thomas was aware of the risk to life posed by consistent heroin abuse, cognizant of its ill-effects, and, yet, continued to sell the drug notwithstanding its danger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11510906\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/999/207/#p218\">\n    999 P.2d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In addition to the actor's knowledge and experience, a court may infer the actor's subjective awareness of a risk from what a reasonable person would have understood under the circumstances.\");\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

Under interrogation by police, Thomas admitted that he typically used 12 bags of heroin per day and four bags in a single shot. Thomas attempts to use these factual details as a defense, stating that he used the same amount of Banshee heroin as Colton and never overdosed from it. Yet, this information is as much a sword as a shield. Based on his own admissions, Thomas should have reasonably concluded that Colton was also likely to use all four bags in\n   one shot-as Thomas himself does-a fact he implicitly recognized when he stated that \"he couldn't have overdosed off what I sold him\" because it was only four bags. Thomas sold Colton four bags of heroin, likely to be used at once, without knowing anything about the composition of the heroin he sold, about what other substances Colton was taking or might have used that day, or about Colton's tolerance given his age and recent incarceration. To knowingly distribute a dangerous, and sometimes lethal, substance without such information qualifies as \"a gross departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinarily careful and prudent person under the same circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    Albrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n    336 Md. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n    649 A.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

The consequences of ingesting heroin are unpredictable and what constitutes a lethal dose varies based on the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   When dealing with street heroin, what is lethal will depend not only on the health of the particular individual and his tolerance for heroin, but on what other toxic substances are mixed with the heroin, as well as what other substances the individual has ingested. The specifics as to the cause of Colton's death are revealed by the Medical Examiner's report and discussed in detail in the following section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   To review, we consider whether Thomas' conduct amounted to a \"wanton and reckless disregard for human life,\"\n   <em>\n    Albrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n    336 Md. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n    649 A.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted)-a gross departure from the conduct of an ordinarily prudent person, without regard to the consequences or the rights of others, and likely to bring harm at any moment. Thomas sold heroin\n   to a desperate young man, knowing that the\n   consumption of heroin could be deadly. He had extensive experience with heroin-distributing it widely, in a manner sure to net a profit, and with such frequency that he travelled across state lines two to three times a week to procure it-and was knowledgeable of its dangers. Yet, he either willfully failed to obtain the necessary information to help reduce the risks of his behavior, or he was indifferent to mitigating these risks. Either way, his conduct posed a high degree of risk to those with whom he interacted. Whether Thomas' motivation was to create a steady source of income, to feed his own addiction, or something more sinister, is of no moment, as intent to kill is not an element of gross negligence involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Nor do we agree with the Court of Special Appeals' rationale that requisite intent for involuntary manslaughter cannot be found because we should infer that a drug dealer wishes for his customers to remain alive, so he can sell them more heroin. The intention required for manslaughter must \"amount[ ] to a disregard of the consequences which might ensue and indifference to the rights of others ....\"\n   <em>\n    Albrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n    336 Md. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993563\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/475/#p478\">\n    649 A.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). This criminal disregard of consequences can well co-exist with a desire to make a profit with more drug sales. Thus, we hold that that the record contained sufficient evidence of gross negligence to support a conviction for gross negligence manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    (iii) Actual and Legal Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Finally, the State disagrees with the Court of Special Appeals' determination that the \"causal chain\" has been broken and argues that it incorrectly applied the same causation analysis to both unlawful act and gross negligence manslaughter. It contends that the intermediate appellate court's view of causation is too narrow and inconsistent with Maryland precedent. Specifically, the State urges that Thomas is the \"but for\" cause of Colton's death-selling him four bags of heroin when he was \"clearly desperate to get high\"-and that Colton's death \"was neither remote nor unforeseeable.\" Moreover, the\n   State maintains, the defendant's act need not be the \"sole reason\" for the harm, and it is not material that Colton \"injected himself or that Thomas did not adulterate the heroin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Thomas does not appear to contest the State's argument.

Maj. Op. at 178, 211 A.3d at 300. However, when police officers searched Mr. Matrey's bedroom, they discovered a prescription pill bottle containing tramadol, an opioid analgesic, Schedule IV - Controlled Dangerous Substance. Importantly, both tramadol and heroin convert into free morphine when they are metabolized in the body. It is therefore unclear whether Mr. Matrey also ingested tramadol, along with heroin and alcohol, and how that may have impacted his fatal overdose. Accordingly, the Majority's reasoning that Mr. Matrey's \"death was either caused by heroin or alcohol, and the evidence and common sense demonstrate that it was not caused by alcohol[,]\" is flawed. Maj. Op. at 177, 211 A.3d at 300. The evidence does not establish that the heroin was independently sufficient to cause Mr. Matrey's death.

S.B. 539 (2017 Legis. Session). The original text of the bill provided that anyone convicted of such conduct would be found guilty of a felony and subject to imprisonment for up to 30 years. While the bill ultimately passed in both Houses and was signed into law by the Governor, it was amended beyond recognition. The final bill, codified at Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article (\"Crim.

Notably, the Chapter Law did not address the distribution of opioids resulting in death, let alone further criminalize and provide specific penalties for such conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Efforts taken by the General Assembly make clear that the establishment and recognition of such a crime as charged in the present case is a task for legislators and policy-makers, not judges.

By holding that the State, under the facts before us, may convict an individual of a murder-related offense for a death connected to the distribution of heroin, the Majority is stepping into the role of a policy-maker, an action in direct contravention of the General Assembly's unambiguous election not to pass equivalent legislation criminalizing such conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The State has not provided sufficient evidence establishing legal, but-for causation between Mr. Thomas's distribution of heroin and Mr. Matrey's fatal overdose to sustain an involuntary manslaughter conviction.
