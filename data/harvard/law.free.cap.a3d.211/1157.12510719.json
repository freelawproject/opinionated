We are asked for the first time to address the scope of that immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b62] Nancy J. McCandless appeals from a summary judgment entered by the Superior Court (Washington County,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mallonee, J.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ) concluding that John and Tracy Ramsey's daughter is immune from liability on McCandless's complaint alleging that the child negligently rode a horse in an arena, causing injury to McCandless. We affirm the Superior Court's judgment holding that the immunity statute precludes the liability that could otherwise arise from the equine activities at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] The basic facts are these: McCandless was standing on a track inside a riding arena when a horse ridden by the Ramseys' ten-year-old daughter, after passing directly by McCandless three times, made contact with her during a fourth circuit. McCandless fell and injured her wrist, and she has now sued the child through her parents, seeking damages for her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] The following details of the event are taken from the parties' statements of material facts and reflect the record as viewed in the light most favorable to McCandless as the nonprevailing party.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Avis Rent A Car Sys., LLC v.

On July 7, 2010, McCandless went to a horse arena to watch children ride horses. In the arena, a circular track one to two inches deep had been worn into the dirt and was visible to onlookers. Horses were not restricted to this track, however, and they rode throughout the arena and near the doors to the barn in which the arena was situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] Spectators were accommodated in the interior of the barn, which included an observation room with a plexiglass window where people could observe the activities inside the structure. McCandless had been sitting outside of the observation room in one of a set of folding chairs that were arranged along the side of the indoor arena away from the horses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] McCandless got up from her seat and began walking from the folding chairs toward what she considered to be the most\n   convenient barn exit. On her way, McCandless walked around some hay bales, which McCandless admits caused her to walk in the area where people rode horses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] The Ramseys' daughter, then ten years old, was riding a horse she had not ridden before in the indoor arena area. The girl completed three circuits in the arena, passing McCandless and others each time. At some point during her fourth circuit in the arena, the horse was slow to respond to the child rider's directions, and the horse made contact with McCandless when she was between five and fifteen feet from the barn door. McCandless fell and injured her wrist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] On July 6, 2016, McCandless filed a complaint against the Ramseys \"as parents\" of their daughter seeking damages for medical bills, pain and suffering, lost enjoyment of life, and permanent impairment allegedly incurred due to the Ramseys' daughter's negligence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   M.R.

The court concluded that none of the statutory exceptions to immunity applied.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860013\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/677/64/#p67\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4103-A(2)-(4).

These dangers and conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   The propensity of an equine to behave in ways that might result in damages to property or injury, harm or death to persons on or around the equine.

The Ramseys' ten-year-old daughter was riding this particular horse for the first time. When the girl approached McCandless on her fourth circuit, she attempted to steer the horse to avoid a collision, but the horse took longer than the girl expected to respond to her directions, and she had difficulty getting the horse to turn, which led to the collision at issue. Although these facts may suggest negligence, and indeed it is negligence that McCandless has alleged in her complaint, they are not facts from which a trier of fact could find that McCandless was injured because the child consciously disregarded a known safety risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B.

Specifically, McCandless was standing in an area where horses were ridden, and she saw the Ramseys' daughter ride directly past her three times before the accident.

A designated observation room was available, but the incident did not occur in that observation room. In the arena grounds where McCandless suffered her injury, there was no differentiation between horse traffic areas and pedestrian traffic areas. Although the area near where McCandless stood was used by pedestrians to exit the arena, she was standing in an area that was intended to be used-and was actually being used-for equestrian activities and not an area \"designated or intended ... for spectators.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7962377\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/407/268/#p280\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The specifically designated spectator area is not where McCandless was standing, or exiting from, when the collision occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b626] Because the facts-viewed in the light most favorable to McCandless-show that no statutory exception to immunity applies, we conclude, as did the trial court, that the Ramseys' daughter is entitled to immunity pursuant to section 4103-A(1) as a matter of law.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Zuckerman v.

I do not disagree with the Court's description of the immunity from liability for equine activities established by Section 4103-A of Title 7 of the Maine Revised Statutes and the court's discussion of the objectives behind that statute. It is clear that the Maine Legislature created a broad immunity, with narrow exceptions, for liability resulting from equine activities. I diverge from the Court's conclusions, however, based upon the Court's application of our standard of review of summary judgments to two of the narrow exceptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reviewing the Superior Court's granting of summary judgment de novo, and viewing the facts of this matter in the light most favorable to McCandless as we must, I would conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the application of two exceptions to the statutory immunity for equine activity. I would vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for trial on those limited issues only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b628] Subsection 4 of 7 M.R.S. \u00a7 4103-A provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Exceptions; persons who are not participants.\n   </strong>\n   Nothing in subsection 1 prevents or limits the liability of an equine activity sponsor, an equine professional or any other person engaged in an equine activity, if that equine activity:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Causes injury or death to a person who is not a participant and who is in a place where a reasonable person would not expect an equine activity to occur; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   B. Causes injury or death to a spectator and that spectator was in a place designated or intended by an activity sponsor as a place for spectators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b629] Under subsection (4)(A), the Ramseys would not be immune from liability if McCandless's injury occurred in a place where a reasonable person would not expect an equine activity to occur-an objective inquiry that is ordinarily entrusted in the first instance to the trier of fact, not an appellate court on a review of a summary judgment. In their statement of material facts supporting their motion for summary judgment, the Ramseys asserted that the collision occurred in an area where it was typical to see horses. This assertion, if uncontroverted, would be dispositive of the issue: the subsection (4)(A) exception would not be available to McCandless to avoid the immunity provided by 7 M.R.S. \u00a7 4103-A(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b630] McCandless properly controverted that fact, however, asserting that horses did not ride in the area regularly used by pedestrians to exit the building when pedestrians were present. Accepting that fact, as we must, in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment has been granted, McCandless has established, for the purposes of summary\n   judgment review, that equine activities would not take place in the vicinity of the collision\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     if pedestrians were present\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The questions of (1) whether or not this conditional practice actually existed, or (2) whether it indeed occurred on July 7, 2010, or (3) whether a reasonable person would have held McCandless's opinions and perceptions at the moment of the collision, are categorically questions of fact that are exclusively the province of the finder of fact and cannot be resolved by summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Curtis v.

The undisputed facts establish that the indoor arena was located in a barn with an observation room from which spectators could observe the goings-on in the barn. Additionally, folding chairs had been placed along the interior wall of the barn in the indoor arena; horses were not typically present in this area. The parties do not dispute that the observation room and the chairs along the wall were designated as places for spectators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b632] Prior to the incident, McCandless had been sitting in one of the folding chairs. The collision occurred after she left the area of the chairs and was proceeding to the south barn exit to leave the arena. The fact that the observation room and the folding chairs were located inside the building and could be accessed by a spectator only by entering or exiting through one or the other of the doors presents a plausible conclusion: the exit routes between the observation points and the doors may be deemed, by extension, places designated for spectators. That conclusion, and the purely factual question of whether McCandless's most direct exit route required her to pass through the area where the collision occurred are, again, questions of fact that cannot be determined on this summary judgment record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b633] Because unresolved questions of material fact remain surrounding the issue of whether the subsection 4(A) or 4(B) statutory exceptions to liability apply, we should not conclude that the Ramseys are entitled to immunity under section 4103-A(1) as a matter of law.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Zuckerman v.
