Decedent and a group of his friends - all of whom were likewise young adults under the legal drinking age of twenty-one - then converged at the home of one of the young men. They drank the purchased alcohol in the young host's bedroom. Decedent then left the house as a passenger in the car of one of the inebriated youths. He died when the driver lost control of the car and it flipped over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The decedent's estate sued the car driver and its owners for negligence and the liquor store under the Dram Shop Act. The liquor store pled a third-party complaint\n   against the young man who had hosted the gathering and his parents, although the estate declined to name them as direct defendants. The estate eventually settled its claims with the liquor store and the driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The third-party defendants moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion, finding that neither the underage adult host nor his parents had breached any established legal duty. The liquor store now appeals, urging us to recognize and enforce such duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that, under the circumstances presented, the parents had no statutory or common law duty to prevent their adult underage son from allowing his adult underage friends to drink alcohol in their home without the parents' proven knowledge or consent. Nor did the son have an established duty of care under current law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Going forward, however, we prospectively hold that an adult who is under the legal drinking age shall owe injured parties a\n   duty under the common law to desist from facilitating drinking by underage adults in his or her place of residence. The recognition of such a legal duty is a logical extension of case law, and is consistent with the general public policies that underpin the related statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We summarize the pertinent facts presented in the summary judgment record, mindful that there are a few variations in the witnesses' narratives. We consider those facts in a light most favorable to appellant as the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   4:46-2;\n   <em>\n    Brill v. Guardian Life Ins.

(\"Amboy\"). Three young men - Xavier Pinto, Zachary Johnson, and Mark\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zwierzynski - accompanied Narleski to the liquor store. Notably, all four individuals were adults over the age of eighteen but were under the legal drinking age of twenty-one. When Narleski went to the counter to make his purchase, Amboy's retail clerk did not ask him for a driver's license or other identification to confirm he was of legal drinking age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Once Narleski purchased the alcohol, the young men drove to Mark's house, where he lived with his mother, Mercedes Apraez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While at the residence, the four friends \"hung out\" in Mark's bedroom, drank the purchased alcohol, and played games. Mark's mother was not home when they arrived. Apparently, she had been out of the house since the night before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At some point during the gathering, Narleski sent a text message to Nicholas Gomes, who also was an adult under the age of twenty-one, to come to Mark's house to join the group in drinking. According to Gomes, he arrived at Mark's house around 9:00 p.m. Gomes claimed he \"downed\" two cups filled with approximately two inches of vodka mixed with orange juice while he was there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is undisputed that Mark's mother eventually came home that evening. However, there is some dispute about exactly what time she arrived. According to Gomes's deposition testimony, after he was at Mark's residence for about fifty minutes, Mark received a call that his mother was coming home. Gomes and Narleski then left the residence to go to another friend's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before coming home, Apraez picked up Mark's daughter from the house of the child's mother. Apraez testified at her deposition that, except for her son Mark, she never saw any of the other young men in her house that night, or knew that they were drinking alcohol there. She insisted that she did not leave alcohol in her home, nor did she allow Mark to drink there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Apraez, upon arriving at the house, she sent Mark a text message and asked him to help bring his daughter inside. Apraez testified that Mark met her at the front door and assisted her with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mark provided slightly different accounts of what occurred. He testified at his deposition that he could not recall whether his daughter was present in the house while he and his friends were drinking. However, in an earlier statement to the police, Mark stated that, on that night, he \"departed his bedroom to tend to his child in another room of the residence for a time period of approximately twenty ... minutes, and upon his return, at approximately\n   10 p.m. ... [he] briefly spoke to Brandon [Narleski] and Nicholas [Gomes] who then departed the residence in Gomes's vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mark did admit at his deposition that he had accompanied Narleski to purchase the alcohol at the liquor store, and that he and his friends drank the alcohol in his bedroom. He denied that Gomes and Narleski appeared to him to be intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Gomes and Narleski left the house, they got into Gomes's car, intending to go to a friend's house about fifteen minutes away. Gomes got into the driver's seat and fastened his seatbelt. Narleski got into the passenger's seat, but did not fasten his own seatbelt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While Gomes was driving on a highway, he lost control of the car and crashed into the center median. As a result of the crash, Narleski was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An analysis of Gomes's blood revealed his blood alcohol content (\"BAC\") was .161 at the time of the accident, well above the .08 legal limit for BAC specified by N.J.S.A. 39:4-50(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the wake of this tragedy, the Estate of Brandon Narleski and his parents filed a wrongful death complaint in the Law Division. As amended, the complaint alleged that Gomes was liable for his intoxicated operation of the vehicle that resulted in the crash and Narleski's death, and that, in addition, Amboy was liable under the Dram Shop Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:22A-1 to -7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With leave of court, Amboy filed a third-party complaint against Mark Zwierzynski and his parents, seeking contribution and indemnity. The third-party complaint alleged that Mark and his parents were negligent in failing to supervise Narleski and Gomes, enabling those underage adults to consume alcohol in their home. Notably, plaintiffs declined to name Mark and his parents as direct defendants after Amboy brought them into the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the close of discovery, the third-party defendants moved for summary judgment. After hearing oral argument, the trial court granted the motion in an oral ruling on March 29, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In granting summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that the third-party defendants did not have a legal duty to supervise the underage persons who had been drinking alcohol in their home because those persons were adults. The judge also found that Mark's father did not reside in the home at the time and that he clearly had no duty to supervise the visitors. Additionally, the judge found that Mark's mother Apraez had no duty under the circumstances presented. The judge noted in particular that Apraez did not make her home available \"for the purpose of\" underage drinking pursuant to the disorderly persons statute relied upon by Amboy, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-17(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amboy moved for reconsideration, which the judge denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thereafter, plaintiffs settled their claims with the direct defendants, i.e., Amboy and Gomes. In the consent order memorializing that settlement, Amboy preserved its right to appeal the court's dismissal of its third-party claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, Amboy urges that we reverse the trial court, and hold that both Mark Zwierzynski and his parents owed and\n   breached a legal duty by allowing underage adults to consume alcohol in their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The third-party defendants counter that no such novel duty should be recognized by this court. They assert that the existing statutory scheme and the common law should not be extended to impose liability as Amboy proposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We rest our analysis upon both common law principles and the public policies expressed in various statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Fundamentally, Amboy asserts that Mark and his parents respectively engaged in negligent conduct that supports civil liability. The well-established elements of negligence are: (1) a duty of care, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) proximate causation of harm, and (4) damages.\n   <em>\n    Townsend v.

In particular, we consider the laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol by underage persons. We also\n   consider the laws that impose responsibility upon certain social hosts for enabling visibly intoxicated guests from consuming alcohol at their homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   N.J.S.A. 9:17B-1(b) provides that persons must be the age of twenty-one or older in order to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. In addition, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-15 makes it a disorderly persons offense for a person under the age of twenty-one to knowingly possess or consume alcoholic beverages in any public place or motor vehicle. The age limit is presumably predicated on a legislative judgment that persons of a younger age are not generally capable of drinking responsibly or making reasonable decisions about their personal use of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Our State also has long-standing public policies holding certain social hosts accountable for allowing their visibly intoxicated guests to imbibe alcohol in their homes. The Supreme Court initially recognized such policies in\n   <em>\n    Kelly v. Gwinnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1365472\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/96/538/#p548\">\n    96 N.J. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20A.2d%201219\">\n    476 A.2d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), when it held that \"a host who serves liquor to an adult social guest, knowing both that the guest is intoxicated and will thereafter be operating a motor vehicle, is liable for injuries inflicted on a third party as a result of the [vehicle's] negligent operation ... by the adult guest when such negligence is caused by the intoxication.\" In fashioning that rule of liability under the common law, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   underscored the public need to reduce fatalities and other injuries caused by drunken driving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 544-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20A.2d%201219\">\n    476 A.2d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Three years after the Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , the Legislature enacted N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.5 to -5.8, an untitled law which we shall refer to as the \"Social Host Liability Statute.\" The statute imposes civil liability upon adult social hosts to injured third parties where:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) The social host willfully and knowingly provided alcoholic beverages either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (a) To a person who was visibly intoxicated in the social host's presence; or\n   (b) To a person who was visibly intoxicated under circumstances manifesting reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) The social host provided alcoholic beverages to the visibly intoxicated person under circumstances which created an unreasonable risk of foreseeable harm to the life or property of another, and the social host failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence to avoid the foreseeable risk; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (3) The injury arose out of an accident caused by the negligent operation of a vehicle by the visibly intoxicated person who was provided alcoholic beverages by a social host.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.6(b).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Notably, the Social Host Liability Statute defines \"social host\" in a limited fashion as a person \"who\n   <em>\n    legally\n   </em>\n   provides alcoholic beverages\n   <em>\n    to another person who has attained the legal age\n   </em>\n   to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.5 (emphasis added). The statute provides \"the exclusive civil remedy for personal injury or property damage resulting from the negligent provision of alcoholic beverages by a social host\n   <em>\n    to a person who has attained the legal age\n   </em>\n   to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.6(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Social Host Liability Statute therefore does not apply by its terms to a situation such as the present case, because neither Mark nor his parents qualify as social hosts under the statutory definition. It is undisputed that Mark, being underage, could not legally provide alcohol to anyone. Moreover, all four of the young men at the house were under the legal age to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In addition, the statute \"does not recognize a first-party liability claim on behalf of an intoxicated driver. A social host cannot be liable to the person to whom the beverages are served, although [he or she] may be ultimately liable if that person injures a third party.\"\n   <em>\n    AAA Mid-Atlantic Ins. of N.J. v.

Accordingly, Narleski is not a third party who could assert liability under the Social Host Liability Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Hence, although the Social Host Liability Statute and the Court's preceding opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   exemplify important public policies to deter the provision of alcohol by social hosts to persons who are too inebriated to drive, the specific terms of the statute do not extend to Mark and his parents. The question then becomes whether the common law or other statutes provide support for civil liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In an effort to identify such support, Amboy places reliance upon a quasi-criminal statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:33-17, which we have already mentioned. This statute makes it a disorderly persons offense to, among other things, offer, serve, or make available alcoholic beverages to underage persons in certain circumstances. Specifically, the statute, which was first enacted in 1985 and thereafter amended in 1995 and 2015, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   a.

Even viewing the record in a light most favorable to Amboy, at most Mark's statement to the police indicates that his mother arrived home at\n   some point after the young men were already drinking in Mark's bedroom. There is no evidence the mother went into the bedroom at any point or knew what was going on there. The father, moreover, was not living in the residence at that time. Neither parent therefore violated N.J.S.A. 2C:33-17(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Subsection (b) of N.J.S.A. 2C:33-17, which applies to certain homeowners, tenants, and building managers also does not inculpate Mark's parents. There is no evidence that Apraez or Mark's father had a \"purpose\" to make alcoholic beverages available at the residence to underage drinkers. Our criminal code defines the term \"purposely\" to entail a person acting with a \"conscious object\" to cause a desired result. N.J.S.A. 2C:2-2(b)(1). Such proof of a conscious object is lacking here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The deposition testimony of Apraez attesting that she did not drink and did not keep alcohol in the house is unrefuted. Furthermore, there is no evidence - beyond pure speculation - that Apraez knew that underage drinking was occurring on the night in question, or that she facilitated or condoned it. And, as we have stated, Mark's father was not living there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although it is a closer question, we are further persuaded that the evidence cannot establish the elements of either N.J.S.A. 2C:33-17(a) or (b) as to Mark. Subsection (a) does not apply because the vodka and beer was purchased by Narleski, and there is no proof that Mark made any other alcohol available. Subsection (b) does not cover Mark because there is no evidence that he \"owned, leased, or managed\" his parents' house. At most, the evidence merely shows that Mark kept a bedroom there, as is common among many young adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because there is no express statutory basis to impose responsibility upon Mark and his parents in this case, we turn to whether\n   Amboy's claims against them can be founded upon the common law.

In a footnote to our opinion, we recognized that, under the circumstances, it would be appropriate to treat both the supervisor and the son as adults with respect to such common law civil liability, even though neither of them was\n   old enough to legally purchase or consume alcoholic beverages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20A.2d%20881\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 611 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20A.2d%20881\">\n    563 A.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Neither\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Morella\n   </em>\n   is directly on point with our present case. In both of those cases, the persons drinking alcohol at the parents' residence included some minors. By contrast, in the present case Mark and his guests at the house were all adults, albeit under the legal drinking age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We agree with the motion judge that, in the absence of a statutory directive or controlling case law that dictates otherwise, it would be inappropriate to impose civil liability upon Mark's parents in the circumstances presented - where their adult son and his adult friends consumed alcohol in the confines of Mark's bedroom without proof of the parents' acquiescence or awareness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Amboy suggests that the parents should have been obligated to take measures to \"supervise\" their adult son or otherwise prevent him from hosting a party with underage adult drinkers. It is unrealistic to expect a parent of an adult in such circumstances to prevent such underage drinking on the premises. We do not conceive the law to require parents of such adults to hire a \"chaperone\" or \"supervisor\" every time they leave their adult child alone in the house. Nor should parents be obligated to install video surveillance cameras, which probably could be readily evaded anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Our State has not specifically addressed the issue of whether a parent has a duty to supervise his or her adult children when they engage in or facilitate drinking by other underage adults. However, several other jurisdictions have held, for public policy reasons, that parents generally do\n   not have a duty to control the wayward conduct of their adult offspring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 319 of the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts\n   </em>\n   (1965), states: \"One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily injury to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.\" However, New Jersey has not adopted that Restatement provision in the context of parental social host liability. Nor, to our knowledge, has any other jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We are mindful that some courts have recognized a parents' duty of care for an adult child's conduct where a \"special relationship\" between the parent and the child has been demonstrated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Silberstein v.

Again, New Jersey has not adopted this principle in the setting of social host liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor apparently has any other jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We decline to adopt such a novel principle of liability with respect to the parents in this underage drinking case. That said, we do not reach whether a factual setting might conceivably arise in the future in which a parent should have such liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Turning to Mark's status as a third-party defendant, we are aware of no established precedent in New Jersey that imposes liability upon him in the circumstances of this case. Even so, we conceive of his potential culpability as being materially different from that of his parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Mark accompanied Narleski and the other friends to the liquor store to make the illegal purchase. He invited them back to the house. He furtively confined the drinking to his bedroom, over which he presumably exercised a substantial degree of control even though he did not own or apparently rent his quarters. Mark actively participated in the drinking. He did not inform his mother of what was occurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, Mark was already a parent himself. It does not seem unwise or unfair to expose a young adult in his shoes to liability. Such liability would be a logical extension of case law, such as\n   <em>\n    Morella\n   </em>\n   , in which we held the seventeen-year-old son had liability for providing alcohol to\n   <em>\n    minors\n   </em>\n   at the party he hosted while his parents were away, and in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   in which we implicitly recognized potential liability but affirmed a jury verdict declining to find negligence for reasons that were unclear from the verdict form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although the imposition of liability upon Mark in this factual scenario seems consistent with sound public policy, we stop short of imposing upon him a novel rule of liability that he might not have reasonably anticipated. We discern no equitable or practical necessity to impose such a principle retroactively. Amboy suggests that we should do so to generate an additional source of compensation for accident victims who are killed or injured by drunk drivers. However, as we noted, plaintiffs in this case declined to add Mark as a direct defendant, and apparently were satisfied to pursue recovery from only the liquor store and Gomes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Prospectively, however, we hold that an adult such as Mark Zwierzynski who is under the legal drinking age shall owe a common law duty to injured parties to desist from facilitating the drinking of alcohol by underage adults in his place of residence, regardless of whether he owns, rents, or manages the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a rule of law is a logical extension of\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morella\n   </em>\n   , and is consistent with the policy objectives of related statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Out of respect for the greater authority of the Supreme Court and the Legislature on the subject, we defer the effective date for\n   conduct covered by our prospective holding for 180 days to enable possible further judicial review or responsive legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For these reasons, the trial court's summary judgment dismissal of Amboy's third-party complaint is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    A \"handle\" consists of 1.75 liters of alcohol, or about a half-gallon.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    We use Mark's first name to distinguish him from his father, Zdzislaw Zwierzynski, intending no disrespect in doing so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Mark's father owned the residence with Apraez.
