We have been called upon to interpret Section 9-736 of the Labor and Employment Article, Maryland Code (1991, 2016 Repl. Vol),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and consider whether the Workers' Compensation Commission is statutorily authorized to modify\n   an order that\n   provided Officer Gang a compensation award for a permanent partial disability resulting from his workplace injury, by retroactively adjusting the rate of compensation as a result of his application within the five-year statutorily defined period of time. The Commission adjusted the rate of compensation because, as a public safety employee, Officer Gang had been entitled to a higher rate of compensation than that which he initially received, a fact that is not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed the decision of the Commission, but the Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that the Commission was not statutorily authorized to retroactively modify Officer Gang's rate of compensation.\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Cty. v.

For the reasons that follow, we shall hold that the Commission may modify the compensation award within five years from the date of the last compensation payment under Section 9-736(b) of the Workers' Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 17, 2011, Officer Peter Gang was injured while working as a Montgomery County correctional officer and, subsequently, filed a claim with the Workers' Compensation Commission (\"Commission\"), seeking compensation. The Commission held a hearing to determine the nature and extent of Officer Gang's injury under the Workers' Compensation Act (\"the Act\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, thereafter,\n   in May of 2012, issued an Award\n   of Compensation, providing Officer Gang recompense \"at the rate of $ 157.00, payable weekly, beginning October 21, 2011, for a period of 70 weeks\" based on a 14% industrial loss of the use of his body, which was attributable to the accidental injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nearly four years later, Officer Gang filed a form entitled\n   \"Request for Document Correction\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the Commission, seeking an adjustment of the 2012 award, alleging that the rate of his compensation was incorrectly calculated, because he qualified as a \"public safety employee\" under Section 9-628(a)(5) of the Labor and Employment Article,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as such, was entitled to a greater rate of compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also posited, in his Request for Document Correction, that the Commission had the power to amend his previous award because it possessed \"continuing jurisdiction\" over the previous order. The Commission agreed, and issued an amended award retroactively changing Officer Gang's rate of compensation from $ 157.00 to $ 314.00 per week for seventy weeks beginning October 21, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Montgomery County, however, filed a Request for a Rehearing on the matter with the Commission, stating: \"The County did not agree to this document correction and was not asked for its agreement. Please rescind the revised order and reinstate the original order as there was no agreement to the document correction. Moreover, the original order was issued on May 2, 2012, almost four years ago.\" The Commission held a hearing on the matter, and after hearing arguments, affirmed the Order which increased the rate of compensation for\n   Officer Gang's permanent partial disability award from $ 157.00 to $ 314.00 a week, beginning October 21, 2011, for a period of seventy weeks based on his status as a \"public safety employee\" at the time of his injury. At the hearing, the Commissioner stated that he believed the Commission had the jurisdiction to correct an error such as this, particularly if it was\n   a mistake made by the Commission of which none of the parties was aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Montgomery County filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Circuit Court held a hearing on the matter, and by order, affirmed the decision of the Commission, reasoning that the Act \"provides the Commission with broad authority to make any changes that it believes are justified within five years from the latter of the date of the accident, the date of disablement or the last compensation payment, without the occurrence of\" an aggravation, diminution or termination of disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Montgomery County appealed the decision of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals, and in a reported opinion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   our intermediate appellate court reversed the decision of the Circuit Court, holding that the Commission erred in retroactively modifying Officer Gang's workers' compensation award.\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Cty. v.

The employer filed a motion to dismiss, which the Circuit Court granted on the basis that the Commission was not authorized to reopen a case in which it had already issued a final order. When we were asked to review the decision, the wife argued that the Commission was authorized to re-open the claim based on an error in the calculation of her husband's average weekly rate, while the employer argued that the Commission was not authorized to re-open the claim because Section 43, the predecessor to Section 9-736(a), limited Section 54, the predecessor to Section 9-736(b). We agreed with the wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In holding that the Commission possessed the authority to reopen its previous order, we distinguished the Commission's power under Section 54 and Section 43 of Article 101, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   If the power to reopen cases was intended to be confined to those in which the disability had become aggravated, diminished,\n   or terminated, the limitation of time as to the exercise of the power could readily have been included in section 43, and the enactment of section 54 would have been superfluous. In our opinion section 54 was intended to have a broader effect than section 43 in the scope of the authority granted to the commission to reopen cases under circumstances justifying such actions. Therefore, we are unable to agree with the view that the reopening and modifying order of the commission in the present case was beyond its legitimate power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20A.%20551\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20A.%20551\">\n    at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20A.%20551\">\n    185 A. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the two statutory provisions were wholly independent of one another and that Section 54 was not restricted by the language of Section 43, as both sections embodied separate considerations, thereby reversing the decision of the Circuit Court and remanding the case to consider the claimant's argument as to why she should receive a higher rate of compensation. We were clear that the Commission had the \"legitimate power\" to reconsider the rate of compensation set forth in a prior order even where there was no aggravation or diminution of disability, pursuant to its continuing jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   case itself supports the conclusion herein that the Commission has continuing jurisdiction to reopen Officer Gang's case to correct an error of law as long as the application for the modification was filed within five years, as it was.

In 1957, the Study Commission submitted a report to then-Governor Theodore McKeldin\n   and the General Assembly, recommending that portions of the Act be repealed, replaced and consolidated. The Study Commission recommended that a portion of Article 101 be revised by creating one section to \"include all provisions of law relating to the power and authority of the Commission with respect to hearings, orders and its continuing jurisdiction with respect to the same.\" Second Report to The Commission to Study Maryland's Workmen's Compensation Laws and the Operation of The State Industrial Accident Commission, p. 15. The amendment proposed by the Study Commission was adopted and codified as Section 40 of Article 101. The statutory language of Section 40(b) and (c) did not alter or otherwise deviate from the language that existed in the sections prior to the 1957 code revision.\n   Because the Legislature did not indicate, in its 1957 code revision of the Workers' Compensation Act, an intent to alter the previous meaning of the two sections when it repealed and re-enacted them within Section 40 of Article 101, Maryland Code (1957), we adhere to the presumption that changes as a result of a code revision \"are presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than for a change in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Blevins v.

Certainly, the ability to modify under the Commission's continuing power and jurisdiction would be a nullity, indeed, were it to be limited to prospective relief when the only relief to be had is retrospective, as here, when the final payment already has been made. We have found no bases in the statute nor in our cases to limit the breadth of Section 9-736(b) to only prospective application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealy Furniture of Maryland v.

In\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   , however, the claimant's \"Petition to Reopen for Worsening of Condition\" was barred by the statute of limitations in Section 9-736(b), because more than five years had transpired between the last payment of compensation and the application for modification.
