Thereafter, appellants, Marcia Rankin, individually and as personal representative of her father's estate, Mark Allen, and Dawn Tracey brought, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a negligence action for survival and wrongful death claims against several Brinton Woods entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Brinton Woods responded to the complaint by filing a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to provisions of the admission contract, which had been executed by Rankin on behalf of Mr. Charles. The circuit court ruled that Rankin had acted as her father's agent - on an apparent agency theory - when she executed the admission contract on his behalf and, therefore, the estate was bound by the arbitration agreement provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court granted Brinton Woods' motion as to the survival claims, but denied the motion as to the wrongful death claims. The Court ordered a stay of the wrongful death proceedings pending arbitration of the survival claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Estate asserts that the circuit court erred in granting Brinton Woods' petition to compel arbitration, based on its finding of apparent agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, it asks this Court to hold the arbitration clause unenforceable as unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because we shall hold that the circuit court erred in finding Rankin to have been Mr. Charles' agent, and therefore erred in ordering arbitration based on that finding, we shall reverse and remand the matter for further proceedings. Moreover, we find the arbitration provisions of the contract to be unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Charles entered Brinton Woods Post-Acute Care Center on June 19, 2015. The day prior to his admission, Rankin executed an admission contract on his behalf. The contract included a clause that required all disputes that \"arise[ ] regarding the care or treatment of the Resident while residing at this Facility,\" be submitted to a mediator for resolution. The resolution clause further provided that, if mediation efforts failed to resolve the disputes, \"any controversy that remains unsettled after mediation[,]\" must be submitted to an arbitration process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Estate's Complaint alleged that, while in the care of Brinton Woods, Mr. Charles developed serious health concerns including \"painful pressure ulcers [bed sores ] and penile necrosis [gangrene ],\" as a result of being deprived of adequate toileting, skin, and catheter care. These adverse conditions were alleged to have been caused by Brinton Woods' negligence and, thus, responsible for having caused and expedited his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Estate's Complaint was filed on November 14, 2016. Prior to answering the complaint, Brinton Woods filed a Petition to Compel Mediation and/or Arbitration and Motion to Dismiss or Stay Proceedings. Brinton Woods asserted that Rankin executed the admission contract as the health care agent for Mr. Charles, thus binding the Estate to the arbitration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the Estate's response, it argued that Rankin was not Mr. Charles' agent, and had neither actual nor apparent authority under his advance directive, or otherwise, to enter into an arbitration agreement on his behalf. Alternatively, it argued that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and should not be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following a hearing, the circuit court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting Brinton Woods' petition as to the\n   survival claim only and stayed the wrongful death claim. The motion to dismiss was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When our review of a circuit court's decision involves both questions of fact and of law,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   we apply different standards of review to the questions of fact and to the questions of law. One of our considerations is whether [the signing party] was [the patient's] agent for purposes of binding him to the arbitration agreement. This is a factual determination that we review using the clearly erroneous standard. Under the clearly erroneous standard, we will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court [i]f there is any competent evidence to support th[ose] factual findings. As to questions of law, both parties have presented legal arguments based on their interpretation of statutory and case law. We consider those arguments\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   ; in other words, we review the questions as a matter of law....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v.

Based on those findings, the court concluded that \"[Mr. Charles] was fully aware and complicit in allowing [Rankin] to act as his apparent agent, and that [Brinton Woods] reasonably relied on that apparent agency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At that juncture, the record before the circuit court consisted of, in addition to the pleadings: the initial complaint, with the attached Letters of Administration of a Small Estate and\n   the Certificate of Merit and Report; the petition to compel arbitration, with the attached copy of the admission contract and the Daren Cortese\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   affidavit; the response opposing the petition,\n   with a copy of the advance directive and Rankin's affidavit; and Brinton Woods' reply to the response opposing the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Brinton Woods' petition to compel arbitration, and supporting memorandum, asserted that Rankin \"is identified in the Admission Contract as her father's agent[,]\" and that \"she had provided documentation to Brinton Woods identifying her as the health care agent of Mr. Charles.\" Those assertions were supported by repeated references to the Cortese affidavit and excerpts from the admission contract. The advance directive executed by Mr. Charles, referred to in the Cortese affidavit, however, was not appended to the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Cortese affidavit, relied on by Brinton Woods, does not in fact support those assertions or the court's finding that the advance directive had been provided to Brinton Woods at the time the admission contract was executed. The affidavit, executed by Cortese as \"President and Owner of Defendant Brinton Woods Health Care Center, LLC[,]\" provides that the affiant is \"familiar with the operations\" and that he reviewed \"materials\n   <em>\n    relating\n   </em>\n   to the admission\" of Mr. Charles. (Emphasis added). Further, based on his review of those materials, he \"can attest that the Admission Contract is a true and accurate copy of the Admission Contract from the Brinton Woods business records governing the admission [sic] Willie Charles, Jr.\" While the affidavit might have supported the accuracy of\n   the copy of the admission contract provided from the business records, it does not support the circumstances surrounding the contract's execution or the receipt of the advance directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Cortese affidavit also affirms an inaccurate representation, purporting that the advance directive \"authorized Ms. Rankin to make health care decisions on [Mr. Charles'] behalf[,]\" which was contradicted by both Rankin's affidavit and the language of the advance directive itself, as it failed to include that such authority was conditioned on Mr. Charles being certified as incapable of making informed decisions regarding his own health care. The language of the advance directive clearly established the condition precedent for its efficacy, by stating \"[m]y agent's authority becomes operative when my attending physician and a second physician determine and certify in writing that I am incapable of making an informed decision regarding my health care ....\" To this point, the circuit court correctly concluded that \"Rankin did not have actual authority since the decedent's Advance Directive only conveyed actual authority to [Rankin] at such time that decedent was incapacitated.\" Notwithstanding that finding, the court appears to have relied on the advance directive and, possibly, the Cortese affidavit's reference, as evidence of Rankin's apparent agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of its finding of Rankin's apparent agency, the court posed the rhetorical question: \"Why else would [Rankin] have shown the Advance Directive to [Brinton Woods] if not to satisfy [it] that she had the ability/authority to sign the admissions contract?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The circuit court challenged the Estate's arguments during the petition hearing, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   It is disingenuous to argue, as Plaintiff's [sic] counsel did at the hearing, that the decedent was not aware that an admission contract of some kind was signed before he was admitted to Defendant Brinton Woods. To insist on one hand that he was totally competent as to invalidate the Advance Directive but not competent enough to know a\n   nursing home would require signed paperwork before he moved into the facility seems inconsistent....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This finding, however, does not take into account the scope of the agency. As the\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   Court noted, \"an agent cannot extend his or her own authority beyond the authority granted to him or her by the principal.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n    414 Md. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n    995 A.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Further, the court's assumption that arbitration clauses are common in nursing home admission contracts, is a fact which the\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   Court acknowledged is not always the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is an absence of evidence of past assent to the execution of an admission contract that contained an arbitration clause, or that such clauses are common in nursing home admission contracts, so that an applicant should reasonably expect an admission contract to contain such a clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Brinton Woods does not suggest that Rankin represented that Mr. Charles had been certified incompetent and that she had the authority bestowed in the advance directive, as his health care agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained in the admission contract, advance directives are to assist in the making of \"future medical treatment\" decisions if the patient becomes incapable of doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The complaint alleges that Mr. Charles was placed in Brinton Woods because his medical conditions \"needed close medical and nursing supervision\" that \"required professional attention,\" so that he could \"receive that specialized care.\" The complaint also alleges, and Brinton Woods does not contest, that prior to his admission, Brinton Woods \"had full knowledge of Mr. Charles' medical condition[.]\" As such, in the case of Mr. Charles, an advance directive would have been necessary if, or when, he was to become incapable of making a health care decision, and certified as such, while in the care of Brinton Woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals qualified the applicability of the Health Care Decisions Act (HCDA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that \"the HCDA pertains only to 'health care decisions,' \" and \"establishes procedures by which an individual may make health care decisions to be carried out if he or she is unable to make those decisions for him or herself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n    414 Md. at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n    995 A.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"intent is demonstrated by the HCDA's mandate that treatment may only be provided, withheld, or withdrawn pursuant to the HCDA\n   <em>\n    if the patient is incapable of making an informed decision regarding the treatment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Notwithstanding, the\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   Court also noted that \"[n]othing in the HCDA ... restricts the ability of an individual to appoint a health care agent when, as in the present case, the individual who is to receive health care is apparently capable\n   of making informed decisions on his or her own behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The circuit court found that Rankin, by crossing out the word \"Resident\" and writing the word \"agent\" below it on the contract, coupled with Mr. Charles' move into the facility, was \"conduct by the principal which caused [Brinton Woods] to believe [Rankin] was authorized[.]\" However, that action alone should not support the court's finding of what Brinton Woods \"reasonably relied\" on as evidence of an apparent agency, particularly in view of the existence of the advance directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Brinton Woods asserts that the advance directive acted \"as additional evidence to support [its] reasonable reliance on the apparent authority Mr. Charles invested in Ms. Rankin.\" It contends that \"[t]he clearest indication that Mr. Charles authorized his daughter to reach a decision about a nursing facility in which he would reside was Mr. Charles moving into Brinton Woods the day after Ms. Rankin executed the Admission Contract.\" Brinton Woods also found support in the admission contract, where Rankin \"acknowledged herself to be both 'agent' and 'daughter' of Mr. Charles[,]\" and \"had supplied [Brinton Woods] with a copy of the Advance Directive executed by her father in 2008.\" Brinton Woods attaches significance to the fact that \"none of the terms of the Admission Contract became applicable unless Mr. Charles actually became a resident of the facility.\" The Estate disagrees and contends that, under\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , agency law is inapplicable when the receipt of health care is conditioned on signing an arbitration clause and waiving the right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Rankin's apparent crossing out of the word \"Resident\" and writing the word \"agent\" below it on the contract does not alone support a finding that she held herself out as her father's agent. However, whether this act alone could be sufficient to support a nursing home's reasonable reliance on that act as evidence of her authority to execute an admission contract, is another issue. As the\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   Court addresses, \"[r]egardless of how she held herself out to others, [she] could\n   not expand her own authority and bind [the applicant] to the arbitration agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n    414 Md. at 449-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692788\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/414/419/#p432\">\n    995 A.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other than Rankin's act of writing the word \"agent\" on the contract, there is little evidence that Mr. Charles had granted her the authority to make a health care decision on his behalf at the time she executed the admission contract, let alone one that also impacted his right to a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Before the motions court, Brinton Woods argued that Rankin \"didn't say I don't have the authority to sign this [agreement][,]\" and explained that \"[w]hat they were presented with was an advance directive, ... and they were dealing with the person that's designated as the responsible party or acted as a responsible party.\" Brinton Woods argued further, claiming that \"[a]dvanced directives are of no import[,]\" and that it is, \"at best, an indicia to the nursing home that the person before them has authority to sign the contract because that person has been designated by the resident to act if the resident becomes incapacitated.\" Brinton Woods continued that \"the best evidence of actual authority is how did the parties comport themselves after the contract was signed[;] [t]hey moved the resident in [sic] the facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Even were we to accept the court's apparent agency finding, the question remains: Did that apparent authority extend to the execution of an admission contract that contained a binding arbitration clause?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Existence of a Binding Arbitration Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   When interpreting an arbitration clause in a contract, we follow the objective law of contract interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Freedman v.

The Court of Appeals has defined a contract of adhesion as one \"that is drafted unilaterally by the dominant party and then presented on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' basis to the weaker party who has no real opportunity to bargain about its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Walther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172013\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/386/412/\">\n    386 Md. at 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172013\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/386/412/\">\n    872 A.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citation omitted). The contract at issue was drafted by Brinton Woods and presented in standard form. As we shall note, an imbalance leans heavily in favor of the drafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The initial paragraph of the admission contract provides misleading information about what an applicant will find in its contents, stating that: \"This contract contains\n   <em>\n    your financial obligations\n   </em>\n   , as well as\n   <em>\n    your rights as a Resident\n   </em>\n   of this Facility.\" (Emphasis added). This language fails to inform applicants that the contract also contains an additional provision that is neither a financial obligation nor a right as a resident - the waiver of the constitutional right to a jury trial. Similarly, under the \"Additional Documents\" section, the document explains that it's \"not possible [in the contract] to cover everything that is important to your stay ....\" so \"additional important documents [are attached] as Exhibits.\" Although the admission contract\n   provided that those \"Exhibits are part of this Contract[,]\" none of those documents are included in the record. Furthermore, despite the ambiguous language of\n   the mediation and arbitration clauses, and the importance of one's constitutional right to a jury trial, no \"additional important documents\" concerning those provisions were included with the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Procedural unconscionability is also evident from the format of the document and the location of the mediation and arbitration clauses within the contract. These two sections are simply numbered paragraphs that are presented in the same format as every other provision. Neither of these two sections contain any apparent emphasis by either bolded, underlined, or italicized language, as is apparent in other sections, denoting important provisions or concepts. The failure to highlight the binding nature of mediation and arbitration clauses or the significance of what the applicant is being compelled to waive, supports a finding of a procedural unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172013\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/386/412/\">\n    386 Md. at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172013\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/386/412/\">\n    872 A.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Substantive Unconscionability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Addressing the claim of substantive unconscionability, the Estate avers generally that \"there is no mechanism or procedure for how the mediator is to be selected, who has the right and power to select, how much the mediator will cost, where the mediation will take place or who will pay for the mediator.\" The Estate also outlines additional factors to support substantive unconscionability, stating that the admission contract \"then details its own rules and procedures drafted exclusively by Appellees, including [that] there be a three-person Arbitration Committee, a 'loser pays' provision, evidentiary rules and presumptions if the matter is pursued in State Court, and waiver of all appeal rights[,]\" as well as a $1,000 deposit requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The significant difference between the arbitration clauses in\n   <em>\n    Walther,\n   </em>\n   and those before us, appears in the clear and informative language of the\n   <em>\n    Walther\n   </em>\n   clause, as well as its location and format.

Such is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The binding nature of the Brinton Woods arbitration clause and the waiver of the right to a jury trial lack clarity and transparency. In addition to the misleading statement in the first paragraph of the admission contract,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the mediation and arbitration provisions, are also unclear and misleading. The contract imposes an initial mediation requirement, prior to any issue being submitted to arbitration. In addition to failing to provide any criteria for selection of mediators or scheduling and timing details of a mediation, the provision fails to address the allocation of fees or costs associated with the mediation requirement. The contract then imposes a requirement that any issue left unresolved\n   in mediation, must be submitted to arbitration. Moreover, the language of the arbitration clause lacks clarity and includes apparent conflicting provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For instance, the language concerning the arbitration process provides that it will be \"consistent with the American Arbitration Associate [sic] rules.\" Next, the clause includes a requirement that the parties abide by any decision made by the undefined \"Arbitration Committee\" and that each will consent to such a decision being made by a \"majority of the subcommittee of three (3), appointed to act in this case.\" Not only is the \"Arbitration Committee\" not defined, the clause also introduces the undefined \"subcommittee of three (3),\" a term not again referred to in any other section. It is that\n   group who would be the arbiters of the dispute. It is not until section D of the arbitration clause, that the word \"binding\" is used for the first and only time. Section D provides that \"[t]he findings of the Arbitration Committee shall be as binding on us ... as would be a decision of Court of Last Resort of the State of Maryland.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The last two paragraphs of section D appear to present conflicting rights and obligations. The first paragraph suggests that a party who loses in arbitration can \"decide to then submit this matter to a State Court for its consideration,\" requiring the losing party to pay the court costs and attorneys' fees of the winning party during the state court proceeding. However, in the paragraph that follows, it states that \"the judgment shall not be appealable and shall not be stayed[,]\" using the term \"judgment\" for the first and only time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   It then provides that if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   the party against whom the decision is made shall appeal from any such decision or file or cause to be filed a Complaint 3 [sic] with any State Court\n   <em>\n    after the issuance of the Arbitrators' findings\n   </em>\n   , ... [that party] agrees, without questions [sic], to pay and be responsible for paying any and all Court costs, attorneys' fees and/or any cost incurred by the [other party] regardless of the outcome of the litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We find those conflicting statements to create ambiguity. In nearly every instance we can imagine, Brinton Woods would be considered a sophisticated party and the patient an unsophisticated party. A reasonable person - particularly a lay person - would not easily understand his or her rights and responsibilities under the contract. Such errors and ambiguities likewise support a finding of procedural as well as substantive unconscionability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The contract also lacks detail of the procedures and cost allocation for the alternative dispute procedures. Other than the initial $1,000 deposit requirement, refundable only if the patient prevails, there is no guidance offered to reflect even an estimated range of potential fees and costs.
