The petitioner's sole claim on appeal is that the habeas court improperly dismissed his claim that the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, entered into, and subsequently breached, a purported contract with the petitioner to award him risk reduction credit in exchange for his adherence to his offender accountability plan. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. The petitioner was found guilty, following a jury trial, of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a (a) and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). The charges stemmed from a shooting death that occurred on September 19, 2005.

On November 6, 2017, the petitioner, after obtaining counsel, filed the operative amended petition alleging, inter alia, breach of contract. Specifically, the petitioner's breach of contract claim alleges that the respondent, by virtue of having the petitioner sign his offender accountability plan, agreed to award the petitioner five days of risk reduction credit per month in exchange for the petitioner's adherence to the offender accountability plan. Further, he alleges that, once No. 15-216 of the 2015 Public Acts (P.A. 15-216) came into effect, which rendered the petitioner unable to earn further risk reduction credit, the respondent nonetheless breached the parties' agreement by failing to award further risk reduction credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 19, 2018, the court, sua sponte, dismissed the amended petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which habeas relief could be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Practice Book \u00a7 23-29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court in its memorandum of decision did not address each of\n   the petitioner's counts but, instead, broadly concluded that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner's claims and that the petitioner had failed to state a claim on which habeas relief could be granted.

With these legal principles in mind, we now turn to the petitioner's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The petitioner argues that his claim that the respondent breached a contract by failing to award him risk reduction credit in exchange for adherence to his offender accountability plan implicates a cognizable liberty interest sufficient to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction. The petitioner does not dispute our well established jurisprudence that there is no liberty interest in risk reduction credit. See\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p368\">\n    326 Conn. at 370-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489956\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/597/#p368\">\n    163 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the petitioner essentially argues that he has a contractual interest in earning risk reduction credit by virtue of his\n   alleged agreement with the respondent to adhere to his offender accountability plan in exchange for risk reduction credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   To bolster this claim, the petitioner argues that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    404 U.S. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    92 S.

Ed. 2d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971), his breach of contract claim is sufficient to invoke the court's subject matter jurisdiction. We do not find\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   to be applicable in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   , the defendant agreed to plead guilty to a lesser offense if the prosecutor agreed not to make a recommendation as to the length of the defendant's sentence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    Id., at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    92 S. Ct. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time of the defendant's sentencing, a different prosecutor, who was unaware of the plea agreement, recommended the maximum sentence, which the court imposed, in violation of the agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    Id., at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    92 S. Ct. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that a\n   <em>\n    prosecutor\n   </em>\n   has an obligation to honor a plea agreement with a criminal defendant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    Id., at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    92 S. Ct. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Central to the court's holding was the importance of plea bargaining to our judicial system and the need to ensure fairness during that phase of the judicial process.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172366\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/257/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]his [plea bargaining] phase of the process of criminal justice, and the adjudicative element inherent in accepting a plea of guilty, must be attended by safeguards to insure the defendant what is reasonably due in the circumstances\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By contrast, in the present case, the alleged agreement between the petitioner and the respondent did not take place during the plea bargaining process, but, rather, after the petitioner had been convicted and was incarcerated. Thus, the concerns regarding fairness during the plea bargaining process are not present here as they were in\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, our reading and application of\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   in the present case is consistent with our prior holding in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501962\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/857/#p85\">\n    184 Conn.

This court rejected the petitioner's assertion in that case that the respondent, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Santobello\n   </em>\n   , was required to honor the purported contract because it found that the habeas action \"present[ed] a completely different procedural posture\" than the plea bargaining process.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501962\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/857/#p85\">\n    Id., at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501962\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/857/#p85\">\n    194 A.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.7. Additionally, this court concluded that, even if the petitioner properly had alleged a breach\n   of contract claim against the respondent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   a breach of contract claim did\n   not invoke the habeas court's subject matter jurisdiction because \"the petitioner, at best, has a contractual interest in such [credit] rather than a constitutionally protected liberty interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501962\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/857/#p85\">\n    Id., at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12501962\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/194/857/#p85\">\n    194 A.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The petitioner, citing to\n   <em>\n    Vandever\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20231\">\n    315 Conn. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20A.3d%20266\">\n    106 A.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), also argues that his claim raises a valid liberty interest because, if he does not comply with his offender accountability plan, he can potentially receive a disciplinary ticket and, as a result, may be segregated from the general inmate population. In\n   <em>\n    Vandever\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court recognized that \"prison inmates have a protected liberty interest in avoiding certain conditions of confinement if, pursuant to state statute or regulation, they can be subjected to such conditions only if certain procedural requirements are met, and those conditions impose an atypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 232-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20A.3d%20266\">\n    106 A.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court therefore examined whether the petitioner in that case had a liberty interest in avoiding administrative segregation and was accordingly afforded due process before his segregation. Id., at 233,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20A.3d%20266\">\n    106 A.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the present case, the petitioner has not been segregated from the general prison population and, as a result, there is no concern that he has not been afforded due process in avoiding segregation. We also find dubious the petitioner's assertion in his appellate brief that, if he had not signed the offender accountability plan, he would not be subject to the same punishment. It defies logic that the respondent would be unable to discipline an inmate for disobedience in the absence of an offender accountability plan. Accordingly, because the petitioner's claim in the present case\n   does not give rise to a cognizable liberty interest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that the habeas court properly dismissed the petitioner's breach of contract claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Specifically, the petitioner was sentenced to forty years of incarceration for manslaughter with a firearm in the first degree and five years of incarceration for carrying a pistol without a permit, to be served consecutively.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    In a separate proceeding on a different petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the habeas court vacated the petitioner's manslaughter conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial, after which the respondent filed an appeal to this court.
