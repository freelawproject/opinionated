Maryland Rule 4-345(c) contemplates such a circumstance, stating: \"The court may correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence if the correction is made on the record before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is the first case in which this Court has been called upon to interpret Maryland Rule 4-345(c). Specifically, we are asked to determine what constitutes \"an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence\" under Maryland Rule 4-345(c). We are also asked to ascertain the circumstances under which an appellate court may determine that a trial court has corrected such a mistake under Maryland Rule 4-345(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the State, Petitioner, charged Andrew Brown, Respondent, with several crimes that arose out of the attempted armed robberies and nonfatal shooting of William Rich and Demaris Glover. A jury found Brown guilty of, among other crimes, attempted robbery with\n   a dangerous weapon as to Rich and Glover, conspiracy to rob with a dangerous weapon as to Rich and\n   Glover, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At a sentencing proceeding, the circuit court imposed three concurrent sentences of twenty years of imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation, for attempted robbery of Rich with a dangerous weapon,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   conspiracy to rob Rich with a dangerous weapon, and attempted robbery of Glover with a dangerous weapon. In the same proceeding, the circuit court announced Brown's sentences as to conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Count 10, conspiracy to rob with a dangerous weapon as to [ ] Glover, the sentence of the Court is\n   <strong>\n    20 years, suspend all but time served, place him on two years supervised probation\n   </strong>\n   .... Count 19, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, 10 years to the [Division] of Correction[ ], first five without parole, will run\n   <strong>\n    consecutive to Count 10.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Emphasis added). After the circuit court announced Brown's sentences, Brown asked: \"Count 19, that's to be run consecutive?\" The circuit court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Right. So what happens is,\n   <strong>\n    basically you got a 20 year sentence, suspend all but 10\n   </strong>\n   and then the handgun,\n   <strong>\n    use of a handgun in a crime of violence runs consecutive so once you finish the -- and you got to do at least five years without parole on that[.]\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Emphasis added). Shortly afterward, Brown's counsel stated: \"So you have 20 years to serve; right?\" The circuit court\n   responded: \"20 years suspend all but 10. Well, 20, yeah, altogether[.]\" The commitment record, probation order, and docket entries indicate that the circuit court sentenced Brown to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation, for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon (Count 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brown appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed his convictions, but remanded with instructions to amend the commitment record, probation order, and docket entries to reflect that the circuit court sentenced Brown to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but time served suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation, for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrew Brown v.

The State argues that the circuit court's use of the term \"time served\" was, under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), \"an evident mistake in the announcement of\" Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. The State asserts that the circuit court intended to say \"ten years\" instead of \"time served.\" The State maintains\n   that, under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), the circuit court corrected the evident mistake by later making informal statements that were seemingly inconsistent with the circuit court having sentenced Brown to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but time served suspended, for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. Brown responds that the circuit court did not make an evident mistake in the announcement of that sentence, and that, to correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), a trial court must do so expressly-and the circuit court did not.\n   We conclude that, for a \"mistake in the announcement of a sentence\" to be \"evident\" under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), the mistake must be clear or obvious. Where a trial court has imposed a sentence that is merely unusual or anomalous compared to other sentences that the trial court imposed during the same sentencing proceeding, that circumstance alone does not establish that the trial court made an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(c). An appellate court may determine a trial court to have corrected an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(c) where the trial court acknowledges that it made a mistake in the announcement of a sentence, and indicates that it is correcting that mistake. Where a trial court merely discusses a sentence in a manner that could be construed as inconsistent with the announcement of the sentence, that discussion alone does not constitute a correction of an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Applying our holdings to this case's facts, we conclude that, under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), the circuit court did not make an evident mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon was unusual or anomalous, as it appears to be inconsistent with Brown's sentences for attempted robbery of Rich with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to rob Rich with a dangerous weapon, and attempted robbery of Glover with a dangerous weapon. The record of the sentencing proceeding, however, falls far short of demonstrating that the circuit court made an evident-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , clear or obvious-mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, or that the circuit court intended to suspend all but ten years, as opposed to time served, as to conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. In addition to the record not demonstrating that the circuit court made an evident mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, the record does not demonstrate that the circuit court corrected a mistake\n   under Maryland Rule 4-345(c). At no point did the circuit court acknowledge that it had made a mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, or indicate that it was correcting such a mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Glover's Trial Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although this case's facts are not dispositive of the issues that are before this Court, we set forth the following summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, as a witness for the State, Glover testified that, on January 18, 2017, at approximately 10 or 11 p.m., he went to Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore City. Glover\n   gambled for approximately an hour, after which Rich,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a friend of his, met with him. Glover and Rich gambled for a few hours. At approximately 3 or 4 a.m., Glover and Rich went to a bar in the casino. There, two women, whom Glover did not recognize, approached him and Rich. The four of them talked to each other, and initially agreed to go to Glover's residence. But, after the four of them left the casino and went to a nearby gas station, they agreed to go to the women's residence instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The four of them went to a house on Sterrett Street and went inside. Eventually, there was a knock on the front door, and one of the women opened it. Brown and another man entered the house. Brown was holding a handgun, and said: \"You know what it is.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Give it up.\" Brown fired in Glover's direction, and the bullet grazed the top of his head and struck Rich in his leg or back. Glover hit Brown's arm, and Brown\n   dropped the handgun. Glover and Brown struggled for the handgun. Glover got ahold of the handgun and ran out of the house. Once outside, Glover fell and dropped the handgun. Brown ran out of the house, and he and Glover struggled for the handgun again. Glover repeatedly struck Brown with the handgun, which fell apart. Glover ran to a friend's house on Wyeth Street. Eventually, an ambulance transported Glover to University of Maryland Medical Center, where he was treated for the bullet wound in his head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Guilty Verdicts and Sentencing Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The jury found Brown guilty of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon as to Rich and Glover (Counts 7 and 8, respectively), conspiracy to rob with a dangerous weapon as to Rich and Glover (Counts 9 and 10, respectively), use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (Count 19), wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun (Count 20), second-degree assault as to Glover (Count 22), conspiracy to commit second-degree assault as to Rich and Glover (Counts 23 and 24, respectively), and reckless endangerment as to Rich and Glover (Counts 25 and 26, respectively).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At a sentencing proceeding, the circuit court announced Brown's sentences as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Count 7, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon as to [ ] Rich, the sentence of the Court is 20 years to the [Division] of Correction[ ].

The State argues that the circuit court made an evident mistake in announcing Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon because sentencing Brown to twenty years, with all but time served suspended, was an unexplained departure from the three identical concurrent sentences of twenty years, with all but ten years suspended, that the circuit court imposed for attempted robbery of Rich with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to rob Rich with a dangerous weapon, and attempted robbery of Glover with a dangerous weapon. The State asserts that, because the circuit court made the ten-year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence consecutive to the sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, the circuit court intended to sentence Brown to twenty years, with all but ten years suspended, for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. The State maintains that the circuit court corrected Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon after it announced the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Brown responds that, to \"correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence\" under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), a trial court must do so expressly-and the circuit court did not. Brown argues that, even if Maryland Rule 4-345(c) allows a\n   trial court to implicitly correct an evident mistake in the\n   announcement of a sentence, there was no evident mistake in the announcement of his sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   An appellate court reviews without deference the legal questions of whether a trial court made \"an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence\" under Maryland Rule 4-345(c), and whether the trial court corrected such a mistake under Maryland Rule 4-345(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    Maryland Rule 4-345(c) and Its Rulemaking History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-345(c) states: \"The court may correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence if the correction is made on the record before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-345 has not always included language regarding \"an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence.\" On April 6, 1984, this Court adopted former Maryland Rule 4-345, which stated in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Illegal Sentence.\n   </strong>\n   - The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Modification or Reduction - Time for.\n   </strong>\n   - The court has revisory power and control over a sentence upon a motion filed within 90 days after its imposition (1) in the District Court, if an appeal has not been perfected, and (2) in a circuit court, whether or not an appeal has been filed.

The circuit court imposed twenty-year sentences for four crimes: attempted robbery of Rich with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to rob Rich with a dangerous weapon, attempted robbery of Glover with a dangerous weapon, and conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. The circuit court suspended all but ten years as to each of the first three crimes, then suspended all but time served as to conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. For use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, the circuit court sentenced Brown to ten years of imprisonment, the first five of which were to be served without parole, consecutive to his sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. To be sure, Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon differed from the three other twenty-year sentences that the circuit court imposed. But, the record of the sentencing proceeding does not demonstrate that the circuit court made a clear or obvious mistake in the announcement of the sentence, or that the circuit court intended to suspend all but ten years, as opposed to time served, as to conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   This case is easily distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Sayre\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   , which, as discussed above, provide examples of what constitutes \"an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence\" under Maryland Rule 4-345(c). In\n   <em>\n    Sayre\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   , as noted above, individuals in the courtroom brought the mistakes in the announcements of the sentences to the attention of the trial courts, which acknowledged the mistakes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sayre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033031\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/559/\">\n    314 Md. at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033031\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/559/\">\n    552 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   553-54 ;\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6035801\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/88/607/\">\n    88 Md.

By contrast, here, at the sentencing proceeding, no one suggested that the circuit court had made a mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, and the circuit court never acknowledged having made such a mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Under the sentences that the circuit court announced, Brown is serving the ten-year sentence for use of a handgun\n   in the commission of a crime of violence at the same time that he is serving the ten-year aggregate of his other sentences. The record does not reveal why the circuit court suspended all but ten years as to attempted robbery of Rich with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to rob Rich with a dangerous weapon, and attempted robbery of Glover with a dangerous weapon, but suspended all but time served as to conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, and imposed the sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence consecutively to that sentence. The absence of an apparent reason for a sentence, without more, does not mean that a trial court made a mistake in the announcement of that sentence-let alone that such a mistake was evident. On this record, we can conclude only that Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon was, at most, anomalous\n   compared to the twenty-year sentences that the circuit court imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In addition to the record failing to establish that the circuit court made an \"evident mistake in the announcement of\" Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, the record does not demonstrate that the circuit court corrected a mistake under Maryland Rule 4-345(c). To reiterate, Maryland Rule 4-345(c) provides that a trial court \"may correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the trial court may \"make or set right\" such a mistake.\n   <em>\n    Correct\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/correct [https://perma.cc/SZ8J-X56B]. Maryland Rule 4-345(c)'s plain language indicates that, to\n   \"correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence[,]\" a trial court must acknowledge that it made such a mistake, and indicate that it is correcting that mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-345(c)'s rulemaking history supports our interpretation. As explained above, it is reasonable to infer that the Rules Committee and this Court were of the view that, in\n   <em>\n    Sayre\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   , the trial courts made evident mistakes in the announcements of the sentences and attempted to correct those mistakes.

In\n   <em>\n    Sayre\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   , the trial courts acknowledged that they had made mistakes in the announcements of sentences, and indicated that they were correcting those mistakes. In our view, that is exactly what a trial court should do \"on the record\" to \"correct an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence ... before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceeding.\" Md. R. 4-345(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It will not be difficult for prosecutors, defense counsel, and trial courts to act in accord with our interpretation of Maryland Rule 4-345(c). Where a prosecutor or defense counsel believes that a trial court has made an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence, the attorney may raise that belief before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceeding, giving the trial court the opportunity to acknowledge and correct the mistake, if one was made. This would obviate the need for a party, as the State did here, to allege an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence for the first time on appeal. Once a mistake in the announcement of a sentence comes to a trial court's attention, the trial court need not recite any magic words to correct that mistake. Instead, as the trial courts in\n   <em>\n    Sayre\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simpkins\n   </em>\n   did, the trial court must simply acknowledge that it made a mistake in the announcement of a sentence, and indicate that it is correcting the mistake. This interpretation of Maryland Rule 4-345(c) will prevent a defendant from essentially being resentenced based on potentially stray remarks by a trial court at a sentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Applying our conclusion to this case's facts, we hold that the record neither demonstrates that the circuit court made an \"evident mistake in the announcement of\" Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, nor demonstrates that the circuit court corrected such a mistake. For conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, the circuit court sentenced Brown to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but time served suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation, concurrent with his five-year sentence for reckless endangerment of Glover. For use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, the circuit court sentenced Brown to ten years of imprisonment, the first five of which to be served without parole, consecutive to his\n   time-served sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. At no point did the circuit court acknowledge that it had made a mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon-much less indicate that it was correcting such a mistake. Indeed, in discussing the sentences with Brown and his counsel afterward, the circuit court never mentioned Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. It is just as likely that, in telling Brown: \"[B]asically you got a 20 year sentence, suspend all but 10[,]\" the circuit court was accurately referring only to the sentences that it had imposed as such-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Brown's sentences for attempted robbery of Rich with dangerous weapon, conspiracy to rob Rich with dangerous weapon, and attempted robbery of Glover with dangerous weapon. There is no indication in the circuit court's later remarks that it intended to impose the same sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon, or that the circuit court was correcting Brown's sentence for that crime. The Court of Special Appeals aptly described the situation by concluding that, at most, \"the [circuit] court's statements, which did not even indicate the conviction or count to which the [circuit] court was referring, cast[ ] some doubt over the [circuit] court's intentions with regard to\" Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205250003\">\n    2018 WL 5250003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15.\n   The exchange between Brown, his counsel, and the circuit court after the circuit court announced the sentences was confusing, and cannot be cast as a correction of an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence. It may be that, during the exchange with Brown and his counsel, the circuit court simply intended to inform Brown of what it believed to be his aggregate sentence. The circumstance that the circuit court began by stating \"So what happens is, basically\" indicates that the circuit court was about to refer to an aggregate sentence, not an individual sentence. The circuit court referred to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended-which, together with two years of supervised probation, was the aggregate of Brown's six concurrent sentences,\n   including his sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. During the exchange, Brown's counsel indicated that the circuit court had imposed an aggregate term of twenty years of imprisonment, and the circuit court sought to explain that Brown would have to serve only ten years. As discussed above, Brown's aggregate term of imprisonment was ten years, given that the circuit court made his ten-year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence consecutive to his time-served sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. At one point, in discussing the sentences, the circuit court stated that the sentence for \"use of a handgun in a crime of violence runs consecutive so once you finish the -- and you got to do at least five years without parole on that[.]\" Frankly, it is unclear what the circuit court meant by this. In any event, it appears that, during the exchange, Brown's counsel was confused about the aggregate sentence; and, the circuit court sought to explain the sentence but did not refer in any way to having made a mistake in imposing any sentence or to correcting a mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In sum, the record is subject to different interpretations. It is possible that, when the circuit court referred to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended, it was speaking of the aggregate of Brown's six concurrent sentences generally, as opposed to Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon specifically. It is equally plausible that the circuit court was misstating, or misremembering, Brown's sentences for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Perhaps, the circuit court was actually thinking of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Rich-not Glover-with a dangerous weapon, which was twenty years of imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation. The record is unclear, and certainly does not establish \"an evident mistake in the announcement of a sentence\" or an attempt to correct such a mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Whatever the case, we can only speculate as to the circuit court's intentions-and that is precisely the problem. It would\n   be contrary to Maryland Rule 4-345(c)'s plain language and its rulemaking history to conclude that the circuit court's informal remarks constituted a correction of an evident mistake in the announcement of Brown's sentence for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. Simply put, the circuit court's later statements were part of an informal discussion of Brown's sentences, and did not evince, in any way, an awareness of it having made a misstatement in the announcement of a sentence-let alone an intent to correct such a misstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In conclusion, the record demonstrates that the circuit court sentenced Brown to twenty years of imprisonment,\n   with all but time served suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation, for conspiracy to rob Glover with a dangerous weapon. The commitment record, probation order, and docket entries indicate that, for that crime, the circuit court sentenced Brown to twenty years of imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation. \"When there is a conflict between the transcript and the commitment record, unless it is shown that the transcript is in error, the transcript prevails.
