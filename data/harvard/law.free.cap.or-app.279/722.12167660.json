The trial court granted a limited judgment declaring that the buyout election, which is available after \u201cthe filing of a proceeding under\u201d ORS 60.952(1), does not apply to the third-party complaint filed by the minority shareholder, because that pleading did not commence an action and did not assert a claim of the type addressed in ORS 60.952(1). We conclude that the filing of the third-party complaint constitutes \u201cthe filing of a proceeding\u201d for purposes of ORS 60.952(6). We also conclude that the real character of at least some of the third-party claims is a claim for oppression against the majority shareholder for purposes of ORS 60.952(1). Accordingly, we reverse the limited judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Graydog Internet, Inc., founded in the mid-1990s, has two shareholders. Westervelt is the majority shareholder and Giller is the minority shareholder. In 2004, the parties signed a shareholder agreement that is at the heart of their current dispute. One provision of the agreement specifies that, if a shareholder\u2019s employment ends, the terminated shareholder shall be deemed to have offered to sell all of his shares to the corporation and the other shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In 2013, Graydog filed a complaint against Giller in circuit court seeking a declaration that Giller is an at-will employee and that it has a right to terminate Giller\u2019s employment. In his answer, Giller denied that he is an at-will employee, included counterclaims alleging that the shareholder agreement is unenforceable, and sought injunc-tive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The following day, Giller also filed a third-party complaint against Westervelt, in which he incorporated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>allegations of his answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims against Graydog. The third-party complaint includes claims for (1) a declaration that the \u201cshareholder agreement is void and unenforceable,\u201d (2) \u201cbreach of contract\u201d based on Westervelt allegedly violating the corporate bylaws by \u201ctak[ing] unilateral action in his personal capacity and for his personal interests,\u201d and (3) \u201cbreach of [the] contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing\u201d based on Westervelt allegedly \u201chaving acted for the sole purpose of trying to force David Giller to unwillingly sell his shares to him.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Graydog and Westervelt took the position that Giller\u2019s counterclaims and third-party complaint triggered the statutory buyout provision in ORS 60.952(6). Accordingly, Graydog elected, in writing and in the requisite timeframe, to purchase Giller\u2019s shares for $300,000. Giller responded by amending his answer to add a fifth counterclaim that sought a \u201cdeclaratory judgment that ORS 60.952(6) does not apply to this suit.\u201d He then sought summary judgment on that counterclaim, and Graydog filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the same issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the court issued a letter opinion granting Giller\u2019s motion and denying Graydog\u2019s motion. The court then entered a limited judgment in which it incorporated its letter opinion and declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u201c1. ORS 60.952(6) does not apply to this case because ORS 60.952(6) may be triggered only against one who commences an action, not against a party who files counterclaims or a third-party complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201c2. ORS 60.952(6) does not apply to this case for the further reason that the claims made by Mr. Giller are not of the type described in ORS 60.952.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATcN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Graydog and Westervelt (jointly, \u201cappellants\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeal from the entry of that limited judgment, assigning error both to the trial court\u2019s granting of Giller\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and its denial of Graydog\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In this appeal from a judgment addressing cross-motions for summary judgment, in which appellants have assigned error to the trial court\u2019s rulings on both motions, both rulings are subject to review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Adair Homes, Inc. v. Dunn Carney, </em>262 Or App 273, 276, 325 P3d 49, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 879 (2014). \u201cWe review the record for each motion in the light most favorable to the party opposing it to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing ORCP 47 C and <em>Eden Gate, Inc. v. D&amp;L Excavating &amp; Trucking, Inc., </em>178 Or App 610, 622, 37 P3d 233 (2002)). As to the issues raised on appeal, the parties agree that there are no disputed issues of fact and that we should determine as a matter of law whether the buyout election of ORS 60.952(6) is available to Graydog.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Whether ORS 60.952(6) applies is a question of statutory construction that we resolve by applying the methodology articulated in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Under that methodology, we seek to determine the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the statute, followed by consideration of the legislative history to the extent it \u201cappears useful to the court\u2019s analysis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Until 2001, corporate dissolution \u2014 authorized under ORS 60.661 \u2014 was the only statutory remedy to address claims of oppression or misconduct in closely held corporations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>Hickey v. Hickey, </em>269 Or App 258, 268-69, 344 P3d 512, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 415 (2015). The legislature addressed that perceived problem by asking an Oregon State Bar task force to draft the bill that became ORS 60.952. In testimony before the House subcommittee that approved the bill, the chair of the task force emphasized that dissolution of the corporation by judicial order was \u201c\u2018typically the worst remedy available, both for the plaintiff and the corporation and for the economy\u2019\u201d and that the proposed legislation would codify alternative remedies that Oregon courts were already granting. <em>Hickey, </em>269 Or App at 269 (quoting Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee on Civil Law, SB 118, May 2, 2001, Tape 89, Side A (statement of Robert Art)).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">ORS 60.952(1) provides in material part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201c[i]n a proceeding by a shareholder in a [closely held] corporation[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] * * * the circuit court may order one or more of the remedies listed in subsection (2) of this section if it is established that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201c(a) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock and irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered, or the business and affairs of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally, because of the deadlock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201c(b) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201c(c) The shareholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">\u201c(d) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Subsection (2) contains a long list of specific remedies that \u201cinclude but are not limited to\u201d various types of equitable relief to alter the corporate structure or operations, \u201c[t]he award of damages to any aggrieved party,\u201d and a corporate buyout \u201cof all of the shares of one or more other shareholders for their fair value.\u201d ORS 60.952(2)(a) - (m). Subsection (5) specifies considerations and a procedure for the trial court to follow if it orders the remedy of share purchase for value.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">We have described the remedy of a \u201ccourt-ordered share purchase for fair value\u201d as \u201cOregon courts\u2019 preferred remedy for oppression in closely held corporations.\u201d <em>Hickey, </em>269 Or App at 268. The legislative history of ORS 60.952 suggests that the bill was designed to encourage courts to use that remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 269 (quoting Testimony, Senate Committee on Business, Labor and Economic Development, SB 116, Jan 15, 2001 (later incorporated into SB 118), Tape 2, Side A (statement of Robert Art)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In addition, ORS 60.952(6) \u2014 the provision at issue here \u2014 allows \u201cthe corporation or one or more shareholders\u201d to resolve the litigation by \u201celect [ing] to purchase all of the shares owned by the shareholder who filed the proceeding for their fair value.\u201d In the event of that election, the parties are allowed 30 days to \u201creach agreement as to the fair value,\u201d or, if they are unable to reach an agreement, \u201cthe court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceeding under subsection (1) of this section and shall *** determine the fair value and terms of purchase of the shares of the shareholder who filed the proceeding.\u201d ORS 60.952(6)(e), (f). The legislative history suggests \u2014 as does the text \u2014 that ORS 60.952(6) \u201c\u2018provides a means to bring the litigation to an early end\u2019\u201d by providing that \u201c\u2018[a]ny of the defendants or the corporation can make an offer at an early stage of the litigation to buy the shares of the aggrieved shareholder.\u2019\u201d <em>Hickey, </em>269 Or App at 270 n 6 (quoting Tape Recording, Senate Committee on Business, Labor and Economic Development, SB 116, Jan 15, 2001 (later incorporated into SB 118), Tape 2, Side A (statement of Robert Art)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">If the parties cannot reach agreement as to the fair value, then the court is directed to \u201cdetermine the fair value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>and terms of purchase of the shares,\u201d using the procedure described in ORS 60.952(5). ORS 60.952(6)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">A. <em>The Meaning of \u201cfiling of a proceeding\u201d Under ORS 60.952</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">As described above, the trial court ruled that that ORS 60.952(6) cannot be used \u201cagainst a party who files counterclaims or a third-party complaint.\u201d Appellants argue that the third-party complaint created a \u201cproceeding\u201d for purposes of triggering the shareholder buyout protection of ORS 60.952(6), regardless of the fact that Giller joined his claims to the existing circuit court action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They argue that that interpretation is consistent with both the statutory language and intent of the legislature. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The pertinent text of ORS 60.952(6) provides that \u201cthe corporation or one or more shareholders may elect\u201d to exercise the buyout option \u201cafter the filing of a proceeding under subsection (1).\u201d The term \u201cproceeding,\u201d as used in ORS chapter 60, means \u201ca civil, criminal, administrative or investigatory action,\u201d and had that meaning at the time the legislature adopted ORS 60.952. <em>Former </em>ORS 60.001(17) (1999), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 60.001(24) (2013). Although that definition does not directly answer the question presented, it suggests a legislative intent that the term \u201cproceeding\u201d be construed broadly. Moreover, the term \u201caction,\u201d as used in Supreme Court case law prior to adoption of ORS 60.952, was broad enough to treat third-party complaints as a separate civil action. <em>See Wallulis v. Dymowski, </em>323 Or 337, 342, 918 P2d 755 (1996) (using \u201cthird-party complaint\u201d and \u201cthird-party action\u201d synonymously); <em>O\u2019Connell, Goyak &amp; Ball v. Silbernagel, </em>297 Or 207, 210, 681 P2d 1159 (1984) (describing a third-party complaint as a \u201cseparate action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The structure of the statute also suggests that the legislature did not intend to limit the application of ORS 60.952(6) to claims brought by an aggrieved shareholder in an original complaint. First, nothing in the statutory text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>conditions the court\u2019s authority to grant the relief authorized by ORS 60.952 on the filing of a claim for such relief in an original complaint. When a subsequent complaint adds or joins claims that are addressed by ORS 60.952, the case becomes, at least to the extent of those claims, \u201ca proceeding\u201d to which ORS 60.952(1) applies and, thus, \u201ca proceeding under subsection (1).\u201d And if the first-filed complaint did not allege claims addressed by ORS 60.952, then the <em>filing </em>of what has become a \u201cproceeding under subsection (1)\u201d can only be attributed to the filing of the subsequent complaint containing the claims that are addressed by ORS 60.952.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Finally, the statutory purpose convinces us that we must construe \u201cthe filing of a proceeding under subsection (1)\u201d to include the filing of a new complaint alleging claims for relief under ORS 60.952(1), regardless of whether it is joined to an existing action. If Giller were correct that the \u201cfiling of a proceeding under subsection (1)\u201d occurs only with the filing of an original complaint, then any subsequent complaint alleging claims under ORS 60.952(1) \u2014 whether filed in the original action by choice or otherwise \u2014 would have to be litigated without the benefit of the subsection (6) remedy. As appellants emphasize, such a rule would allow feuding shareholders to strategically undermine the legislature\u2019s desire to allow the early buyout election as an alternative to protracted litigation. At least under the circumstances here, in which Giller\u2019s third-party complaint introduced the claims that, appellants contend, fall within the scope of ORS 60.952(1), we conclude that the filing of a third-party complaint can constitute the \u201cfiling of a proceeding under subsection (1),\u201d for purposes of ORS 60.952(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">B. <em>A \u201cproceeding under\u201d ORS 60.952(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We next consider appellants\u2019 arguments that Giller alleged the kind of claims against Westervelt that initiated a \u201cproceeding under subsection (1).\u201d As set out above, ORS 60.952 authorizes a range of equitable remedies or money damages for shareholders of close corporations when the shareholder \u201cestablished] that *** [t]he directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent.\u201d ORS 60.952(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Appellants argue that Giller\u2019s third-party complaint initiated a proceeding under ORS 60.952(1) because it alleges that Westervelt engaged in what amounts to \u201coppressive\u201d conduct within the meaning of ORS 60.952(l)(b) and seeks remedies that are the type specifically identified by ORS 60.952(2). Giller responds that he did not initiate a proceeding under ORS 60.952(1) because his third-party complaint alleges \u201ccontract\u201d claims, while the \u201coppressive\u201d conduct addressed by that statute equates to a breach of fiduciary duty, which is a tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">We begin by emphasizing that the label assigned to a claim does not necessarily define its character. We recognize that Giller labeled his claims for relief \u201cBreach of Contract\u201d and \u201cBreach of Contractual Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,\u201d and that he pleaded those claims without using the term \u201coppression\u201d or citing ORS 60.952. However, nothing in the statutory language suggests that the legislature intended the availability of the buyout election \u2014 or for that matter the availability of any remedy authorized by ORS 60.952 \u2014 to depend on how the plaintiff labels the claims. Rather, ORS 60.952(6) applies to a \u201cproceeding under\u201d ORS 60.952(1), which \u2014 in turn \u2014 means a \u201cproceeding by a shareholder\u201d in which certain factual circumstances are \u201cestablished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In another context, we have emphasized that we will look past the label a party gives to a claim to determine whether the claim truly sounds in contract, and instead focus on \u201c[t]he \u2018gravamen or the predominant characteristics\u2019 of an action, not the plaintiffs election.\u201d <em>Htaike v. Sein, </em>269 Or App 284, 294, 344 P3d 527, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 565 (2015) (quoting <em>Lindemeier v. Walker, </em>272 Or 682, 685, 538 P2d 1266 (1975)). <em>Htaike </em>discusses the rule that has long been applied in the context of determining whether a claim is subject to the contract or tort statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 293-94. Because the length and application of the statute of limitations differ between tort and contract claims, the court seeks \u201cto determine the statute of limitation appropriate to the \u2018real\u2019 character of the action rather than to leave this solely to the plaintiffs chosen statement of his cause of complaint.\u201d <em>Securities-Intermountain v. Sunset Fuel, </em>289 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>243, 252, 611 P2d 1158 (1980). We conclude that it is appropriate to place a similar emphasis on the \u201creal\u201d character of a claim when determining whether it constitutes a \u201cproceeding under\u201d ORS 60.952(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As we explained in <em>Htaike, </em>in general, \u201c[t]o determine the predominant characteristics of an action, we examine the legal source of the defendant\u2019s liability, the factual setting of the dispute, the injuries asserted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff\u2019s claimed measure of damages.\u201d 269 Or App at 294 (citing <em>Securities-Intermountain, </em>289 Or at 258-60). Here, we consider the facts that Giller proposed to establish, the sources of Westervelt\u2019s liability on those facts and the relief that Giller sought. From those considerations, we determine that the real character of at least some of Giller\u2019s third-party claims is a claim for oppression under ORS 60.952(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">As an initial matter, we observe that the factual setting \u2014 a dispute between shareholders of a closely held corporation \u2014 is consistent with the scope of ORS 60.952. In addition, the remedies that Giller seeks \u2014 including $1.2 million in money damages to himself directly \u2014 is consistent with the relief that ORS 60.952 authorizes courts to grant if a majority shareholder engages in oppressive conduct. <em>See </em>ORS 60.952(2)(b) and (j); ORS 60.952(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We also conclude that the alleged bases for Westervelt\u2019s liability to Giller describe the oppressive conduct for which ORS 60.952(1) affords a remedy. As guidance for determining what the legislature intended by \u201coppressive\u201d conduct, both sides point us to the Supreme Court\u2019s description of \u201coppressive conduct\u201d in <em>Baker v. Commercial Body Builders, </em>264 Or 614, 628-29, 507 P2d 387 (1973). The court held in <em>Baker </em>that \u201c\u2018oppressive\u2019 conduct by those in control of a \u2018close\u2019 corporation as its majority stockholders is closely related to what we agree to be the fiduciary duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>a good faith and fair dealing owed by them to its minority stockholders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629 (footnote omitted). Similarly, we explained in <em>Naito v. Naito, </em>178 Or App 1, 20-21, 35 P3d 1068 (2001), and in <em>Hickey </em>that, when conduct by majority or controlling shareholders in a closely held corporation violates their fiduciary duties, the conduct is likely to be considered \u201coppressive\u201d conduct. <em>Hickey, </em>269 Or App at 266 (citing <em>Naito, </em>178 Or App at 20). We conclude that at least some of the allegations of Giller\u2019s third-party complaint state claims against Westervelt for breach of his fiduciary duties to Giller and, thus, for \u201coppression\u201d under ORS 60.952(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\">1. <em>Giller\u2019s claim for \u201cBreach of Contract\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The real character of Giller\u2019s breach of contract claim is a proceeding for \u201coppressive\u201d conduct under ORS 60.952, because he alleges the breach of duties to which Westervelt \u201cwould be bound independent of the contract.\u201d <em>See Securities-Intermountain, </em>289 Or at 259 (explaining that that consideration can be an important indication that the \u201creal\u201d character of an action is not breach of contract.) The contract that Westervelt allegedly breached is the corporate bylaws. The breach that caused harm to Giller is alleged to consist of Westervelt \u201ctak[ing] unilateral action in his personal capacity and for his personal interests that violate his contractual duties under the Bylaws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We emphasized in <em>Naito </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201cthe heart of a corporate fiduciary\u2019s duty is an attitude, not a rule. \u2018The fiduciary best fulfills its duties if it approaches them with the attitude of seeking the beneficiary\u2019s interests rather than the personal interests of the fiduciary [.]\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">178 Or App at 21 (quoting <em>Chiles v.

Schoenborn, </em>116 Or App 464, 472, 841 P2d 682 (1992) (\u201cWhen the majority shareholders of a closely held corporation use their control over the corporation to their own advantage and exclude the minority from the benefits of participating in the corporation, absent a legitimate business purpose, the actions constitute a breach of their fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith and fair dealing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>That is the conduct that Giller alleges as the basis for his third-party claims. Westervelt\u2019s alleged wrongful actions include: Westervelt loaned himself $20,000 from the company without the board\u2019s approval; Westervelt elected his wife to the board of directors over Giller\u2019s objection; Westervelt threatened to force Giller to sell his shares if Giller did not agree to do so voluntarily, and had an attorney prepare and file Graydog\u2019s complaint to terminate Giller\u2019s employment before the board of directors voted on the proposal. As emphasized, Giller alleges that Westervelt took all of those actions \u201cfor his personal interests\u201d and harmed Giller as a result. It is Westervelt\u2019s fiduciary duty, not any provision of the bylaws, that prohibited him from taking action \u201cfor his personal interests\u201d that was harmful to Giller. Thus, while some of those allegations may describe the breach of a contractual obligation created by the bylaws,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they also describe a breach of the fiduciary duties that Westervelt owes to Giller by virtue of his relationship as majority shareholder, independent of any obligation created by the corporate bylaws. Indeed, Giller\u2019s claim that Westervelt has caused harm specifically to Giller through that allegedly self-interested conduct describes a traditional direct shareholder action for breach of fiduciary duties. <em>See Noakes, </em>116 Or App at 471 (stating that it is \u201cwell-recognized\u201d that \u201cminority shareholders may bring a direct action, rather than a derivative action, if they allege harm to themselves distinct from the harm to the corporation or a breach of a special duty owed by the defendant to the shareholders\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">2. <em>Giller\u2019s claim for \u201cBreach of Contractual Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">For reasons similar to those discussed above, we conclude that the gravamen of Giller\u2019s claim for breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the duty of good faith and fair dealing is a breach of the noncontractual duty of the same name that gives rise to a claim for oppression. The implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing is tied to the terms of a contract. It is imposed \u201c\u2018to facilitate performance and enforcement in a manner that is consistent with the terms of the contract and that effectuates the reasonable contractual expectations of the parties\u2019 * * * [but] may not be understood as modifying or inserting terms that are not present in the contract.\u201d <em>Grants Pass Imaging &amp; Diagnostic Center v. Marchini, </em>270 Or App 127, 139, 346 P3d 644 (2015) (quoting <em>Whistler v. Hyder, </em>129 Or App 344, 348, 879 P2d 214, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 453 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">By contrast, Giller\u2019s claim does not allege any specific contract or contract terms that Westervelt failed to perform in good faith or contractual rights that he failed to enforce in good faith. Rather, he alleges that \u201cWestervelt has a contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing in all of his dealings with his business associate, David Giller.\u201d He alleges that Westervelt breached that duty by \u201chaving acted on behalf of himself and for his own personal benefit alone, * * * and having acted for the sole purpose of trying to force David Giller to unwillingly sell his shares to him.\u201d Those allegations describe a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing that Westervelt owed Giller by virtue of his relationship as director and majority shareholder and reveal the real character of the claim to constitute a claim for oppression under ORS 60.952(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">C. <em>Giller\u2019s Final Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Giller argues that the practical effect of applying ORS 60.925(6) to plaintiffs claims will be precisely the \u201ccorporate squeeze-out\u201d of Giller that Westervelt sought from the outset. Giller insists that, to avoid such an oppressive result, we must give allegedly oppressed shareholders the power to control whether their intra-corporate dispute can be resolved under ORS 60.952(6). Ultimately, however, as Giller recognizes, any danger that the buyout election will be used as a \u201cweapon\u201d against a minority shareholder comes from the statute itself. Giller argues that \u201cORS 60.952(6) is truly unique,\u201d emphasizing that a similar provision in the Model Business Corporation Act allows the buyout election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>only against a shareholder who seeks to dissolve the corporation. <em>See </em>Model Business Corporation Act, \u00a7 14.34 (4th ed 2011). But the buyout provision in ORS 60.952(6) is the one that the legislature adopted. Giller\u2019s argument against Oregon\u2019s approach should be addressed to the legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We conclude that the trial court erred in granting Giller\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying appellant\u2019s cross-motion on Giller\u2019s Fifth Counterclaim for a declaration \u201cthat ORS 60.952(6) does not apply to this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> ORCP 22 provides that a third-party complaint is brought against a person who may be liable \u201cfor all or part of the plaintiffs claim against the third party plaintiff.\u201d Neither Westervelt nor Graydog, however, challenged Giller\u2019s use of a third-party complaint to bring his claims against Westervelt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> Giller also sought partial summary judgment on a sixth counterclaim against Graydog \u2014 that ORS 60.952(6) violates the Oregon and United States constitutions, but the trial court did not reach that issue, and the issue was not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> Although the summary judgment motions addressed Giller\u2019s counterclaim against Graydog, both Graydog and Westervelt filed notices of appeal from the limited judgment. Giller does not suggest that Westervelt is not a proper party on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\"> Given that authority, we reject without further discussion Giller\u2019s contention that appeal from the \u201cLimited Judgment Granting Declaratory Relief in favor of Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff David Giller\u201d was insufficient to put at issue the denial of Graydog\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on the same claim for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\"> By its terms, ORS 60.952(1) applies to \u201ca shareholder in a corporation that does not have shares that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are regularly traded in a market maintained by one or more members of a national or affiliated securities association.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\"> Appellants argued below that the counterclaims can also constitute the filing of a \u201cproceeding,\u201d but on appeal they argue only that the third-party complaint triggered the buyout provision, taking the position that we need not decide the significance of a counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> Although we borrow from the approach used to determine the real character of a claim for purposes of the statute of limitations, we do not suggest that our approach to deciding whether a claim initiates a \u201cproceeding under\u201d ORS 60.952(1) will necessarily be identical. The tests serve different functions, and significantly greater consequences flow from a determination of the real character of a claim for purposes of the statute of limitations \u2014 namely, a complete a bar to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> We recently described as \u201cwell-established legal principles that: (1) the bylaws of a corporation are a contract between the members of the corporation, and between the <em>corporation </em>and its members; and (2) directors, as agents of a corporation, ordinarily are not parties to the contracts of the corporation, <em>WSB Investments, LLC v.
