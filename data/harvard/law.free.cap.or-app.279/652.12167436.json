J.</author>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Petitioner seeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Parole and Post Prison Supervision (board), denying his request for a parole consideration hearing. Petitioner contends that the board\u2019s order denying his request either misinterprets and misapplies the relevant statute, ORS 144.228(1)(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or did not interpret the statute at all. The board responds that it properly applied ORS 144.228(1)(c). Because we conclude that the board erred in failing to interpret ORS 144.228(1)(e), we remand to the board for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We review an order of the board \u201con the same basis as provided in ORS 183.482(8).\u201d ORS 144.335(3) (2015).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1987, petitioner was convicted of first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, first-degree kidnapping, and ex-convict in possession of a firearm. Petitioner committed those crimes during a temporary leave from prison while he was serving a sentence for murder. He was sentenced as a dangerous offender under ORS 161.725(1) (providing for an increased maximum prison sentence if the court finds that \u201cbecause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>of the dangerousness of the defendant an extended period of confined correctional treatment or custody is required for the protection of the public\u201d and the \u201cdefendant is being sentenced for a Class A felony, and the court finds that the defendant is suffering from a severe personality disorder indicating a propensity toward criminal activity\u201d). After a defendant is sentenced as a dangerous offender, ORS 144.228(1)(a) provides that the board must set a parole consideration hearing on the earliest date that \u201cthe prisoner is eligible for parole under the board\u2019s rules.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the parole consideration hearing, the board determines whether the \u201ccondition which made the prisoner dangerous is absent or in remission,\u201d and, if the board makes one of those findings, it must set a release date for the prisoner. ORS 144.228(l)(b). If the board does not find that the dangerous condition is absent or in remission at the hearing, \u201creviews will be conducted at least once every two years until the condition is absent or in remission, at which time release on parole shall be ordered if the prisoner is otherwise eligible under the rules.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ORS 144.228(1)(c) and OAR 255-38-005(4) allow a prisoner to request a parole consideration hearing prior to the date set by the board. To obtain a hearing, the prisoner must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable cause to believe that the dangerous condition is in remission based upon the information provided in the request[.]\u201d ORS 144.228(1)(c). If the prisoner makes that showing, the board will \u201cconduct a review as soon as is reasonably convenient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, petitioner submitted a request to the board for a parole consideration hearing, asserting that there was reasonable cause to believe that the condition that made him dangerous \u2014 antisocial personality disorder \u2014 was in remission. In support of his request, petitioner attached evidence concerning the tendency of antisocial personality disorder to diminish with age, documentation showing that he did not require mental health treatment while incarcerated, copies of risk assessments conducted by the Department of Corrections that indicated that he was at low risk to reoffend if released from prison, and information about his good behavior while incarcerated that \u2014 according to petitioner \u2014 demonstrated that he no longer had antisocial personality disorder. Petitioner also argued that the phrase \u201creasonable cause\u201d in ORS 144.228(1)(c) established a \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard for granting a request for parole consideration hearing. According to petitioner, that standard required only that he make a \u201clow threshold\u201d showing that his claim was not \u201cinsubstantial\u201d or \u201cfrivolous\u201d and that his evidence was more than sufficient to meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The board denied petitioner\u2019s request in a written order. <em>See </em>ORS 144.228(1)(d) (2015) (requiring the board to \u201cissue a final order\u201d that is \u201caccompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d including \u201ca concise statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings as to each contested issue of fact and as to each ultimate fact required to support the board\u2019s order\u201d when it denies a request for an early parole consideration hearing). The board action form (BAF) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201cThe Board finds that the information submitted by inmate does not provide reasonable cause to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the condition that made inmate dangerous is in remission (ORS 144.228(1)(c) (1984)), or that necessary supervision and treatment are available in the community (ORS 144.228(1)(c) (1993)).[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Inmate does not provide evidence that he has identified and/or addressed the factors that led to his criminal behavior (kidnapping, rape, sodomy, and weapon possession while on prison leave from a murder sentence). Further, evaluations that are completed by the Department of Corrections for custodial purposes do not persuade the Board that inmate\u2019s danger to the community outside prison has diminished. Finally, compliant behavior in prison is not necessarily correlated with lawful behavior outside prison, as demonstrated by inmate\u2019s prior criminal sexual assaults while on temporary release, and following a \u2018successful\u2019 prison adjustment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Following the denial of petitioner\u2019s request, he submitted a request for administrative review. Petitioner argued that the order was not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason and that the board misinterpreted \u201creasonable cause\u201d and erroneously required him to meet too high a standard. The board denied petitioner\u2019s request in an administrative review response (ARR), reiterating the reasons offered in the BAF. Petitioner subsequently filed a timely petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On review, petitioner again contends that the board erroneously interpreted the term \u201creasonable cause\u201d in ORS 144.228(l)(c) by failing to interpret the term to mean \u201cprobable cause\u201d and imposing too high a threshold to obtain a parole consideration hearing under that statute. Petitioner also asserts that the board erred in failing to interpret the term at all. The board responds that the statute does not impose a specific standard but instead empowers the board to determine whether a prisoner has shown reasonable cause to believe that the dangerous condition is in remission at its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>When a court reviews an administrative agency\u2019s construction of the statute, the meaning of the statute is \u201ca question of law, \u2018ultimately for the court.\u2019\u201d <em>Bergerson v. Salem-Keizer School District, </em>341 Or 401, 411, 144 P3d 918 (2006) (quoting <em>Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 224, 621 P2d 547 (1980)). However, \u201cdepending on the nature of the statutory term at issue, an administrative agency\u2019s construction of a statute nevertheless may be entitled to a measure of deference.\u201d <em>OR-OSHA v. CBI Services, Inc., </em>356 Or 577, 585, 341 P3d 701 (2014) (citing <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 223). In <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 223-30, the Supreme Court set out three categories of statutory terms and specified the standard of review for each category. The court summarized those categories in <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp. v. Real Estate Agency, </em>331 Or 348, 353-54, 15 P3d 29 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">\u201cWhen an agency\u2019s interpretation or application of a provision of law is at issue, the reviewing court\u2019s standard of review depends upon whether the phrase at issue is an exact term, an inexact term, or a delegative term. <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 223. \u2018Exact terms\u2019 impart relatively precise meanings, and their applicability in a particular case involves only agency factfinding. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24. This court reviews agency application of \u2018exact terms\u2019 for substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 224. \u2018Inexact terms\u2019 are less precise. Although they embody a complete expression of legislative meaning, that meaning always may not be obvious. <em>Id. </em>As to \u2018inexact terms,\u2019 the task of the agency, and ultimately of the court, is to determine what the legislature intended by using those words. <em>Id. </em>\u2018Delegative terms\u2019 express incomplete legislative meaning that the agency is authorized to complete. <em>Id. </em>at 228. As to \u2018delegative terms,\u2019 the agency\u2019s task is to complete the general legislative policy decision. <em>Id. </em>This court reviews the agency decision concerning a \u2018delegative term\u2019 to determine whether it is within the range of discretion allowed by the more general policy of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 229.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\u201cReasonable cause\u201d is not an \u201cexact term\u201d; its meaning is not so precise that the question whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a prisoner\u2019s dangerous condition is in remission can be answered by factfinding alone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>See OR-OSHA, </em>356 Or at 589 (the phrase \u2018\u201creasonable diligence\u2019 *** lacks a meaning so precise as to require only factfinding\u201d); <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 223 (examples of exact terms include \u201c21 years of age, male, 30 days, Class II farmland, rodent, Marion County\u201d). Thus, we must determine whether \u201creasonable cause\u201d is an \u201cinexact\u201d or a \u201cdelegative\u201d term.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In <em>OR-OSHA, </em>the court identified four considerations that courts have used to distinguish inexact from del-egative terms. 356 Or at 590. First, courts have \u201ccompared a disputed term to those the court already has concluded are delegative in nature.\u201d Second, courts have \u201casked whether the disputed term is defined by statute or instead is readily susceptible to multiple interpretations.\u201d Third, courts have \u201cinquired whether the term in contention requires the agency to engage in policy determinations or make value judgments, as opposed to interpreting the meaning of the statute.\u201d Finally, courts have \u201clooked to the larger context of the statute in dispute, to determine whether other provisions suggest that the legislature did or did not intend a term to be regarded as delegative.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Applying those considerations to \u201creasonable cause\u201d as used in ORS 144.228(1)(c) leads us to conclude that the term is delegative in nature. First, the term is similar to other terms that courts have concluded are delegative in nature. <em>See id. </em>(\u201creasonable diligence\u201d is a delegative term); <em>Bergerson, </em>341 Or at 413 (\u201cunreasonable\u201d is a delegative term in part because it \u201cis among the examples of delegative terms this court has noted previously\u201d); <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 228-29 (\u201cgood cause\u201d is a delegative term) (citing <em>McPherson v. Employment Division, </em>285 Or 541, 549-50, 591 P2d 1381 (1979)). Second, \u201creasonable cause\u201d is not defined by statute, and it is readily susceptible to multiple interpretations. Petitioner\u2019s assertion that the term should mean \u201cprobable cause\u201d is plausible. <em>See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1081 (5th ed 1979) (providing that \u201cprobable cause\u201d is synonymous with \u201creasonable cause\u201d). However, it is telling that the legislature used the phrase \u201cprobable cause\u201d in two other sections of the same bill in which ORS 144.228(1)(c) was enacted. Or Laws 1981, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ch 644, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, 7. That suggests that the legislature meant something other than \u201cprobable cause\u201d when it used the term \u201creasonable cause\u201d in ORS 144.228(1)(c). <em>Cf. State v. Ortiz, </em>202 Or App 695, 699-700,124 P3d 611 (2005) (relying on other statutes promulgated as part of the same bill as context when construing a statute); <em>State v. Newell, </em>238 Or App 385, 392, 242 P3d 709 (2010) (\u201cIf the legislature uses different terms in statutes, we generally will assume that the legislature intends different meanings for those terms.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\">Third, the phrase appears to contemplate that the board make a value judgment or policy determination about what type of evidence provides \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that a petitioner\u2019s dangerous condition has diminished under the particular facts of each case. Put another way, it asks the board to determine what quality and quantum of evidence should be sufficient to establish \u201creasonable cause\u201d that a dangerous condition is in remission. Finally, there is nothing in the context of ORS 144.228(1)(c) to indicate that the legislature intended \u201creasonable cause\u201d to be something other than a delegative term. <em>See, e.g., J. R. Simplot Co. v. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>340 Or 188, 197-98, 131 P3d 162 (2006) (concluding that \u201creasonably necessary\u201d is an inexact term in the context of the broader statutory phrase \u201creasonably necessary to cover the cost of inspection and administration\u201d because it \u201ctells the department <em>how </em>to pursue the policy objective of funding an inspection program: It is to do so by setting fees that bear a defined relationship with the likely range of costs for the program\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Thus, \u201creasonable cause\u201d is a delegative term. Consequently, it authorizes the board to exercise its discretion to complete the general legislative policy embodied in the statute. In this context, ORS 144.228(1)(c) delegates authority to the board to establish a standard, within the confines of the general policy embodied by the term \u201creasonable cause\u201d and the rest of ORS 144.228, to determine whether a prisoner is entitled to a parole consideration hearing. <em>Cf. McPherson, </em>285 Or at 555 (the agency was required to \u201cdefine \u2018good cause\u2019 within the overall policy and provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>of the unemployment compensation law\u201d). The board may complete that task either through rulemaking or \u201cby adequate explanation in a final agency order following adjudication.\u201d <em>OR-OSHA, </em>356 Or at 598. The board\u2019s definition and application of \u201creasonable cause\u201d would then be reviewed to determine whether \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision is within the range of discretion allowed by the more general policy of the statute.\u201d <em>Springfield Education Assn., </em>290 Or at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">However, a court cannot review an agency\u2019s application of a delegative term if the agency has not first exercised the discretion granted to it by the legislature to define that term. <em>OR-OSHA, </em>356 Or at 599; <em>see also Bergerson, </em>341 Or at 416 (explaining that, in applying a delegative term, the agency \u201chad a duty to complete the legislative meaning of the delegative term * * * consistently with the general policy\u201d of the statute). If the agency has failed to exercise its discretion, the court must remand for the agency to do so. <em>OR-OSHA, </em>356 Or at 599; <em>Bergerson, </em>341 Or at 416 (where the agency failed to exercise its discretion \u201cremand [was] necessary to allow the [agency] to complete the legislative meaning of the [delegative] term \u2018clearly an excessive remedy\u2019 and to apply that legislative policy rationally to the facts of [the] case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The Supreme Court recently applied those principles in <em>OR-OSHA. </em>There, the agency, the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division (OR-OSHA), was charged with administering ORS 654.086(2). That statute provides that an employer is liable for a \u201cserious violation\u201d of the Oregon Safe Employment Act (OSEA) and its implementing rules \u201cunless the employer \u2018did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u2019\u201d 356 Or at 591. The employer in <em>OR-OSHA </em>was cited for two serious violations of OSEA after an OR-OSHA compliance officer observed two employees working high off the ground without sufficient safety protection. <em>Id. </em>at 579-80. The employer contested the violations before the agency, and an administrative law judge (AL J) determined that the employer was liable for serious violations of the OSEA because a supervisor had \u201csufficient time *** to observe either or both the workers subject to the citations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and * * * constructive knowledge [on the part of the employer] was established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">On review, the court noted that, in his final order, the ALJ \u201ccorrectly quoted from the statute\u201d and \u201ccorrectly construed whether the employer \u2018could not *** know\u2019 to refer to what the employer was capable of knowing or discovering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(ellipsis in original). However, it was not clear how the ALJ \u201cinterpreted or applied\u201d the term \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying the <em>Springfield Education Assn. </em>framework, the court concluded that \u201creasonable diligence\u201d was a delegative term, <em>id. </em>at 590-91, but explained that \u201cthe ALJ appear [ed] to have made his decision unaware of the delegative nature of the statutory standard of \u2018reasonable diligence.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. The ALJ\u2019s decision concluded that it was possible that employer could have discovered the OSEA violations but did not evaluate the \u201cpossibility of discovering the violation[s] *** in the context of \u2018reasonable diligence.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99. The court explained that, \u201c[f]or us to review an agency\u2019s decision for consistency with the discretion delegated to the agency by law, it must be evident that the agency exercised that discretion in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599; <em>see also id. </em>(an agency must offer \u201csome sort of explanation that enables a reviewing court to evaluate whether a decision comports with the authority granted under the law\u201d). The court therefore remanded to the agency. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Here, it also is not evident that the board exercised the discretion delegated to it by the legislature to complete the general policy embodied by the term \u201creasonable cause.\u201d Like the ALJ\u2019s decision in <em>OR-OSHA, </em>the board \u201ccorrectly quoted from the statute\u201d but did not make clear how it interpreted or applied the term \u201creasonable cause.\u201d The board does not define the term in the BAF or the ARR. The board also has not defined that term through rulemaking and did not reference any previous orders in which it defined the term or established criteria to determine whether a prisoner has established \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that a dangerous condition is in remission. We therefore cannot infer what the applicable standard is from the final agency order in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>In sum, as used in ORS 144.228(1)(c), \u201creasonable cause\u201d is a delegative term reviewed to ensure that the board acted within the scope of the discretion granted to it by the legislature. However, the board did not exercise its discretion to define \u201creasonable cause\u201d or determine the meaning of the term in the conclusions of law required by ORS 144.228(1)(d) (2015). The failure to interpret and apply that definition of the delegative term constitutes an \u201cerroneous!] interpret [ation] of a provision of law,\u201d and we must therefore remand for the board to interpret and apply that term to the facts of this case. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(a)(B) (2015) (where an agency \u201chas erroneously interpreted a provision of law and * * * a correct interpretation compels a particular action,\u201d a court shall \u201c[rjemand the case to the agency for further action under a correct interpretation of the * * * law\u201d); <em>Bergerson, </em>341 Or at 416-17 (remanding under ORS 183.482(8)(a)(B) in part because the agency failed to interpret and apply a delegative term).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\"> Except otherwise noted, all references to statutes and rules are to the versions in effect when petitioner committed his crimes in 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> Our disposition obviates any need to address petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error, that the order is not supported by substantial evidence and substantial reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> ORS 183.482(8) (2015) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">\u201c(a) The court may affirm, reverse or remand the order.

The information shall include [a written report by a psychiatrist and a written report of the prisoner\u2019s conduct in prison.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b676-6\"> The board stated both the standard in effect at the time petitioner committed his crime, whether the \u201ccondition that made the prisoner dangerous is in remission,\u201d and a standard subsequently adopted by amendment, whether \u201cnecessary supervision and treatment are available.\u201d Petitioner has never argued that there was reasonable cause to believe that necessary supervision and treatment for his condition are available in the community.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\"> Indeed, the board appears to have applied the standard for obtaining an early release date to the determination of whether to have a hearing on obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>an early release date. For example, the ARR concluded that some of the information presented by petitioner was \u201cnot so persuasive as to lead the Board to the conclusion that you no longer present a danger to the community.\u201d A determination that a prisoner\u2019s dangerous condition is \u201cabsent or in remission\u201d under ORS 144.228(1)(b) and qualifies for an early release date is made after a parole consideration hearing and must be based upon a record that includes, among other things, a psychiatrist report and an official record of the prisoner\u2019s conduct in prison. That is a different standard and record than the one used to obtain a parole consideration hearing under ORS 144.228(1)(c) (\u201creasonable cause to believe that the dangerous condition is in remission\u201d based on \u201cinformation provided\u201d by the prisoner).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
