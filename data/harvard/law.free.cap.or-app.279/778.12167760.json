J.</author>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of multiple offenses, including murder by abuse, ORS 163.115(1)(c), following the death of his infant son, appeals. Defendant contends that the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress material discovered as the result of a warranted search of his home computers, and (2) admitting evidence of a medical diagnosis of \u201cabusive head trauma.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As amplified below, we conclude that the warrant authorizing the seizure and forensic examination of defendant\u2019s home computers was imper-missibly overbroad, violating the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and, because that error was not harmless, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Except as specifically noted, the circumstances material to our assessment of the lawfulness of the search of defendant\u2019s computers are undisputed. On the afternoon of June 12, 2011, at about 2:22 p.m., defendant made a 9-1-1 call to report that his 11-week-old son, B, had stopped breathing. Emergency medical personnel responded within minutes, followed shortly thereafter by Detective Rookhuyzen of the child abuse unit of the Washington County Sheriffs Office. After the baby had been taken by ambulance to the hospital, Rookhuyzen interviewed defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Rookhuyzen ultimately applied for, and obtained, the warrant pursuant to which the challenged seizure and search of defendant\u2019s computers was undertaken. In his affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application, Rookhuyzen recounted the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b800-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>At the beginning of the interview, Rookhuyzen noted that defendant was \u201cnon-emotive\u201d \u2014 which, in Rookhuyzen\u2019s training and experience, was \u201chighly unusual\u201d in such circumstances because \u201c[p]arents are usually crying, sobbing, and exhibiting signs of sadness or anxiety.\u201d Defendant told Rookhuyzen that he had been home alone with B and his twin brother, while his wife was working. According to defendant, as he had been feeding B a mixture of formula and liquid vitamins, the mixture had started to come out of the baby\u2019s nose and the baby had started coughing, so defendant had turned him over, shaken him, and \u201csmacked\u201d him on the back. The baby\u2019s eyes became \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201cdroopy,\u201d and his breathing became \u201cvery much labored.\u201d Defendant told Rookhuyzen that he then shook B more, and the baby began going \u201ca minute or two between breaths.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\">Defendant did not call 9-1-1 at that point. Instead, he told Rookhuyzen, he \u201cwent online\u201d on a computer in the baby\u2019s room to conduct research about what he should do.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When, after 15 minutes, the baby\u2019s condition did not improve, defendant called 9-1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Defendant did not call his wife during that period\u2014 and, indeed, had not attempted to contact her by the time Rookhuyzen began to interview him. In Rookhuyzen\u2019s experience, that was \u201cextremely unusual\u201d: \u201c[W]ith these kind of incidents, spouses want to call each other instantly, even before speaking with law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit further recounted that, at the hospital, B was examined by a pediatrician, Dr. Lindsay, who determined that the baby had no brain activity and would die soon. Lindsay further determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that the baby had experienced head trauma resulting in a skull fracture, bi-lateral retinal hemorrhages, and an \u201cold rib fracture.\u201d In Lindsay\u2019s opinion, defendant\u2019s account was not consistent with the baby\u2019s condition, and he ultimately rendered a diagnosis of \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d as a result of intentionally inflicted abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>After Dr. Lindsay\u2019s examination, and still on June 12, Rookhuyzen prepared an application for a search warrant to be executed at defendant\u2019s residence. In the affidavit in support of that application, Rookhuyzen, as noted, recited the circumstances just recounted. Further, as specifically pertinent to the lawfulness of the seizure and search of defendant\u2019s computers, the affidavit included the following averment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\">\u201cI know based upon my training and experience that computers can be connected to the internet to find information using computer software that browse internet sites for information. Internet search engine sites such as Google and Yahoo! are often used to search the internet for information related to a user\u2019s requests. I know that the computer will retain a history of internet sites visited and the search terms used on the internet. I know that to retain the integrity of a computer\u2019s memory and how the system was used, the computer needs to be searched in a laboratory and carefully examined by a trained computer forensic examiner in order to ensure that the data is not corrupted, damaged, or otherwise changed from the time when the machine was seized. [Defendant] told me that he searched the internet between the time he noticed [B] was having difficulty breathing and the time he called emergency dispatch. He told me that he was using a computer to search the internet for advice on what he should do. When I was in the residence, I saw two laptop computers and two desktop computers. [Defendant] did not specify which computer he was using just before he called 911.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The affidavit also included a detailed description of defendant\u2019s residence. Finally, in a section titled \u201cConclusion,\u201d the affidavit stated Rookhuyzen\u2019s belief that there was probable cause to seize and search 11 types of evidence, including \u201c[t]wo laptop computers in the residence\u201d and \u201c[t]wo desktop computer towers located in the office/baby room.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Along with his affidavit, Rookhuyzen prepared and submitted \u201cATTACHMENT A/\u201d subcaptioned, \u201cITEMS TO BE SEARCHED FOR, TO BE SEIZED, AND TO BE ANALYZED\u201d (Attachment A), which, on a single page, reiterated verbatim the list of 11 types of evidence set out in the \u201cConclusion\u201d section of the affidavit. The text of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit does not itself refer to Attachment A.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Finally, Rookhuyzen also prepared and submitted a one-page form of search warrant. Under the heading \u201cPremise described as:\u201d, the warrant reiterated the description of defendant\u2019s residence from Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit, and, under the heading \u201cYou are to seize and search and forensically examine the following objects:\u201d, the warrant stated simply and without elaboration: \u201cSee attachment A.\u201d Thus, the warrant did not specify any protocol for the forensic examination of the computers, including prescribing temporal constraints on the material to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On the evening of June 12, the trial court issued the search warrant, and officers immediately executed the warrant, seizing, among other items, the four computers listed in Attachment A. Under the direction of detectives, a digital evidence forensic examiner then accessed and analyzed the data on the computers\u2019 hard drives. In searching defendant\u2019s desktop computer, as well as the other devices, the examiner began by focusing on internet searches done on June 12, 2011, that employed or referred to certain terms \u201cspecific to aiding an infant that was in trouble, references to calling 911, that sort of thing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those terms included \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cdad,\u201d and \u201cabuse.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ultimately, however, the examiner\u2019s search encompassed all data on the hard drives, including data dating back more than 10 years, long antedating B\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>With respect to the afternoon of June 12, the examination of the search history on defendant\u2019s personal desktop computer included Google searches by user \u201cKaliq\u201d at 2:07 p.m. for \u201cbaby pulse no breathing\u201d and at 2:14 p.m. for \u201cbaby not breathing, strong pulse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">As noted, the forensic examination was not limited to the 15-minute period preceding defendant\u2019s 9-1-1 call on June 12, or even to the entirety of June 12. Consequently, the search of defendant\u2019s desktop computer disclosed at least ostensibly inculpatory material antedating June 12 relating to prior internet searches by a person logging in with the user name \u201cKaliq.\u201d Specifically, the examination disclosed internet searches on: (1) April 19, 2011, for \u201cinfant abuse\u201d and \u201cinfant abuse symptoms\u201d; (2) April 30, for \u201csigns of abused infant\u201d; (3) May 19, for \u201csigns of newborn abuse\u201d; and (4) May 22, for \u201cabused newborn symptoms\u201d and \u201cabused newborns.\u201d Finally, the examination disclosed Google searches on June 9 for the terms \u201cnewborn abuse,\u201d \u201cabuser therapy,\u201d \u201cOregon child abuse laws,\u201d \u201cfather hates infant,\u201d \u201cafraid of abusing my baby,\u201d \u201chow do I deal with a screaming baby,\u201d and \u201cbaby, swelling, back of head.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The examination also disclosed that, on June 9, the user had visited a website and clicked on a file titled \u201cCan therapy help an abuser?\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Even as the forensic examination of the computers was being undertaken, defendant was charged by indictment with multiple crimes, including two counts of murder by abuse, ORS 163.115(1)(c), one count of felony murder, ORS 163.115(1)(b), one count of first-degree assault, ORS 163.185, three counts of third-degree assault, ORS 163.165, and three counts of first-degree criminal mistreatment, ORS 163.205.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Defendant subsequently moved, under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to suppress all evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>obtained from the seizure and search of the computers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so moving, defendant contended, in part, that \u201cthe warrant authorizing the search was worded so broadly as to constitute a general warrant\u201d and was otherwise defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Specifically, in his written motion to suppress/ memorandum, defendant posited several independent, but interrelated, challenges. <em>First, </em>the warrant was facially invalid, as unconstitutionally \u201cgeneral,\u201d because it did not specify the crime for which evidence was sought or impose any other limitation on the scope of the forensic examination of the computers. Further, that facial deficiency could not be cured by reference to the content of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit, because, defendant asserted, the affidavit was neither \u201cattached to,\u201d nor incorporated by reference in, the warrant when it was executed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>in all events and regardless of any reference to the affidavit, the warrant was insufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>particular because, <em>inter alia, </em>it failed to specifically identify the computer files that were lawfully subject to forensic examination. <em>Third, </em>the warrant also violated the particularity requirement, as being unconstitutionally overbroad, because it did not limit the forensic examination to those files or subjects for which (again, even assuming reference to Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit) there was probable cause to search. In that regard, defendant asserted that, even assuming that the content of the affidavit substantiated probable cause to search the computers for evidence of defendant\u2019s internet searches in the fifteen minutes preceding the 9-1-1 call, the warrant authorized \u2014 without any temporal or substantive qualification \u2014 the search of the computers\u2019 <em>entire </em>contents, including matters long antedating B\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\">In its written response to the suppression motion, the state did not address defendant\u2019s assertion that Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit had not been attached to, or otherwise incorporated with, the warrant when it was executed. The state asserted that the warrant itself, including its incorporation of Attachment A, was not unconstitutionally general, because the warrant specifically described defendant\u2019s residence as the \u201cplace\u201d to be searched and (in Attachment A) particularly described the \u201cthings\u201d to be seized and examined, including the computers. The state further remonstrated that Oregon law did not prescribe heightened standards of particularity with respect to the examination of electronic devices pursuant to a search warrant \u2014 and that, to the extent federal courts had sometimes mandated special protocols for such searches, those pertained to the protection of \u201cinnocent third parties]\u201d and not the subjects of criminal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">At the suppression hearing, the state introduced, as a single exhibit (Exhibit 1), certified copies of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit, with Attachment A appended, the signed search warrant, and the signed \u201cReturn of Search Warrant\u201d; all of those documents bore an identical time stamp, corresponding to the time they were filed with trial court clerk\u2019s office on June 17, 2011, several days after the execution of the warrant at defendant\u2019s residence. Neither party presented testimony as to whether Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit had, in fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>been attached or otherwise incorporated as of the time the computers had been seized from defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Instead, defendant\u2019s presentation focused on the asserted unlawfulness of examining the computers for any material <em>unrelated to the 15 minutes preceding the 9-1-1 call </em>and on the lack of any constraints, including search protocols, in the warrant, precluding a roving search of the computers\u2019 contents.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In making that argument, counsel stated, \u201cthe only guidance about what they were looking for in the computers came from the Affidavit to the Search Warrant,\u201d and that \u201cthat 15 minutes\u2019 worth of search could have been pulled up on-site and photographed by the police.\u201d Defense counsel subsequently reiterated that defendant did not \u201ccontest the 15 minutes prior to the 911 call that was discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The state, conforming to the defense presentation and argument, emphasized that reported Oregon appellate decisions had not prescribed, or even endorsed, search protocols for the examination of electronic devices. The state further remonstrated that the examination of the browser histories on defendant\u2019s computers was \u201ctargeted\u201d on search items pertinent to \u201cthe crime under the investigation\u201d and that, if the trial court was \u201cinclined to in any way to [temporally] circumscribe * * * the scope of the warrant, * * * the warrant in this case certainly describes sufficient probable cause to go back to the day [B and his twin brother] were born.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The trial court, for reasons set out in a careful and comprehensive letter opinion, denied the motion to suppress. As pertinent to our analysis that follows, the trial court began by observing that defendant has \u201cconceded that the search warrant properly permitted law enforcement officials to search [the computers] for internet searches relating to the fifteen minutes prior to defendant\u2019s placement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the 911 call\u201d and that \u201cthis concession narrow[ed] the scope of the defense\u2019s theory of suppression.\u201d The trial court further determined that, although Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit did not establish probable cause to search the computers for evidence of crimes \u201cother than those relating to [B\u2019s injuries] caused on June 12, 2011,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the warrant was not imper-missibly general, in that neither Article I, section 9, nor the Fourth Amendment required the specification of search protocols in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">At defendant\u2019s trial before a jury, the state presented evidence of the results of the forensic examination of defendant\u2019s computers, recounting the internet search history described above. <em>See </em>279 Or App at 782-83. The jury found defendant guilty of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">On appeal, defendant contends that the warrant authorizing the seizure and search of the computers, including his desktop computer, was unconstitutionally \u201cgeneral,\u201d as violating the particularity requirement, for either or both of two reasons: (1) the warrant was nonspecific in that it failed to identify the predicate crime and did not describe the electronic files or data that the police were authorized to search; and (2) the warrant was overbroad as permitting, without any limitations, the search of the computers\u2019 entire contents without predicate probable cause. Defendant contends that, in this case, the assessment of purported lack of particularity is properly limited to the face of the warrant itself, without reference to the contents of the warrant application affidavit, because (in defendant\u2019s view) the state failed to prove that the affidavit was attached to, or otherwise incorporated in, the warrant. Further, defendant contends, even if the content of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit can be considered, it fails to supply necessary particularity or to cure overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The state counters that the warrant was facially valid, because it specifically identified the computers as among the items to be seized and searched and probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>cause supported the search of the computers. Further, even if greater specificity and limitation of putative overbreadth were required, \u201cthe supporting affidavit cured that defect.\u201d The state repeatedly invokes <em>State v. Rose, 264 </em>Or App 95, 330 P3d 680 (2014), which we address in detail below, as \u201chighly similar\u201d \u2014 and at least implicitly controlling \u2014 precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We begin, as a logical and practical matter, with the question of whether our review of the warrant\u2019s validity is properly limited to the face of the warrant itself or also encompasses the content of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit. <em>See, e.g., State v. Radford, </em>223 Or App 406, 409-10, 196 P3d 23 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 362 (2009) (noting precedent precluding reliance on warrant application affidavit where affidavit was \u201cneither attached to nor incorporated by reference to the warrant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The premise of defendant\u2019s position is that, to the extent the state now seeks to rely on Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit to supplement the facial content of the warrant, it was incumbent upon the state to establish at the suppression hearing that the affidavit was, in fact, attached to the warrant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Proceeding from that premise, defendant asserts that the state failed to do so \u2014 and, indeed, relied solely on the face of the warrant without reference to the affidavit in responding to defendant\u2019s nonspecificity and overbreadth challenges \u2014 and, given that failure, the state\u2019s reliance on the affidavit for the first time on appeal constitutes an unreviewable alternative basis for affirmance. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (for appellate court to affirm on alternative basis, the record must \u201cmaterially be the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d before the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The state\u2019s primary response, as we understand it, is that the record developed in the trial court substantiates that the affidavit was, in fact, attached to the warrant. In that regard, the state points to suppression hearing Exhibit 1 described above, 279 Or App at 785-86, which, as noted, included certified true copies of the originals of (a) the warrant return, (b) the warrant, and (c) Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit, as filed with the clerk\u2019s office shortly after the execution of the warrant. Each of those documents bears an identical time stamp corresponding to its filing; Attachment A is appended to the certified true copy of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit as filed with the clerk\u2019s office. The state posits that, given the combination of the warrant\u2019s cross-reference to Attachment A and the fact that Attachment A was appended to Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit and not to the warrant, Exhibit 1 evinced that the affidavit was attached to the warrant when it was executed. Further, the state asserts, if defendant wished to dispute that proof, it was incumbent on him to do so before the trial court \u2014 and, because he did not, he cannot now contend that the affidavit\u2019s content is inapposite to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">In sum, each party\u2019s position is, in many respects, a mirror image of the other\u2019s, with each proceeding on obverse premises as to the allocation of burdens of production and persuasion. We conclude that, on this record, the state is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Although the state bears the burden of establishing the lawfulness of a warrantless search, \u201cthe defendant bears the burden of proving the unlawfulness of a warranted search.\u201d <em>State v. Walker, </em>350 Or 540, 554, 258 P3d 1228 (2011). That allocation of the burden of proof \u201cderives from the presumption of regularity that arises out of the fact that, in a warranted search, an independent magistrate already has determined that probable cause exists.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>335 Or 511, 521, 73 P3d 282 (2003). Further\u2014and significantly here\u2014that burden pertains even when a defendant asserts that circumstances rendered a search effectively \u201cwarrantless.\u201d As the court in <em>Walker </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">\u201cDefendant argues for a different allocation of the burden of proof. She contends that, when, as in this case, a defendant asserts that a search exceeded the <em>scope </em>of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>warrant, the burden should remain with the state to show that the search was valid. Defendant reasons that, if the search exceeded the scope of the warrant, the result is that it was essentially warrantless. The problem with defendant\u2019s argument is that it confuses the effect of prevailing on an argument with the burden of proving it in the first place. A defendant, for example, could challenge the <em>validity </em>of the warrant itself, and, if successful, the result would be that the search at issue was essentially warrantless. Yet, in such cases, the burden of proving the invalidity of that warrant rests squarely with the defendant. * * * The same is true in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">350 Or at 554-55 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Here, the seizure and forensic examination of the computers was undertaken pursuant to the warrant. Consequently, in challenging the lawfulness of that seizure and search, defendant bore the burden of establishing facts pertaining to his \u201cchallenge [to] the validity of the warrant itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555. Whether Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit was attached to, or otherwise sufficiently accompanied, the warrant when it was executed was such a fact. Accordingly, defendant bore the burden of proving that that circumstance did not exist. However, as noted, 279 Or App at 786, defendant adduced <em>no </em>proof on that matter at the suppression hearing \u2014 and, thus, failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Further, regardless of the burden of production and ultimate persuasion, the state <em>did </em>submit evidence at the suppression hearing \u2014 Exhibit 1 \u2014 pertaining to sufficient attachment. As the state contends, that exhibit, by way of permissible, albeit hardly indubitable, inference, constituted <em>prima facie </em>proof that Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit had been attached to the warrant at the time <em>of </em>execution. Defendant never disputed that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Finally, even if, as defendant asserts, the state\u2019s contention regarding reference to Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit is akin to an alternative basis of affirmance \u2014 a characterization that is far from patent \u2014 that contention is properly reviewable because it is unlikely that the record would have been materially different if that contention had been urged in the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Gutierrez v. Nooth, </em>275 Or App 171, 179-80, 364 P3d 725 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>359 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>39 (2016). That appears to be so for at least two reasons. First, as noted, even after the state submitted Exhibit 1, defendant presented no evidence of purported \u201cnonattachment.\u201d Second, defendant\u2019s position at the suppression hearing presumed that the affidavit properly supplemented the warrant\u2019s facial content. As noted, 279 Or App at 786, at the beginning of argument on that motion, defense counsel stated, \u201cThe only guidance about what they were looking for in the computer came from the affidavit for the search warrant.\u201d Moreover, defense counsel twice explicitly conceded the lawfulness of a search of the computers with respect to the 15 minutes preceding the 9-1-1 call. Because the warrant on its face simply listed the computers without any elaboration, the lawfulness of such a search depended (at least under defendant\u2019s own premises) on reference to the content of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit. Thus, defendant\u2019s concession at the suppression hearing was irreconcilable with a contention that, because of some failure to attach or incorporate, the affidavit\u2019s content was inapposite to the lawfulness of the search.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In sum, on this record, our review of the lawfulness of the warranted search of the computers encompasses, and is informed by, the content of Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit. With that baseline understanding, we proceed to the particulars of defendant\u2019s particularity and overbreadth challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The fundamental purpose of the constitutional particularity requirement is \u201cto protect the citizen\u2019s interest in freedom from governmental intrusion through the invasion of his privacy.\u201d <em>State v. Blackburn/Barber, </em>266 Or 28, 34, 511 P2d 381 (1973); <em>see also Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 US 332, 345, 129 S Ct 1710, 173 L Ed 2d 485 (2009) (\u201c[T]he central concern underlying the Fourth Amendment [is] the concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person\u2019s private effects.\u201d); <em>Maryland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>Garrison, </em>480 US 79, 84, 107 S Ct 1013, 94 L Ed 2d 72 (1987) (noting that the particularity requirement \u201censures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Thus, under Article I, section 9, as well as the Fourth Amendment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cthe command to seize must be sufficiently particular to guide the officer to the thing intended to be seized and to minimize the danger of unwarranted invasion of privacy by unauthorized seizures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\"><em>Rose, </em>264 Or App at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also State v. Reid, </em>319 Or 65, 71, 872 P2d 416 (1994) (\u201c[A] warrant must be definite enough to identify with a reasonable degree of certainty what is to be searched.\u201d). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">\u201c[i]f the search warrant describes premises in such a way that it makes possible the invasion of [the] interest in privacy without the foundation of probable cause for the search, the warrant is too broad and therefore constitutionally defective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-8\"><em>Blackburn/Barber, </em>266 Or at 34. <em>See generally State v. Ingram, </em>313 Or 139, 144-46, 831 P2d 674 (1992) (summarizing particularity inquiry and concluding that warrant authorizing search of \u201call vehicles * * * associated with the occupants of said premises\u201d was invalid as overbroad, in that executing officers \u201ccould invade privacy interests not intended by the magistrate to be invaded and could conduct searches not supported by probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Ultimately, the requisite \u201cdegree of specificity *** depends on the circumstances and the nature of the property to be seized and may also be affected by the nature of the right which is protected.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>264 Or App at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord State v. Massey, </em>40 Or App 211, 214, 594 P2d 1274, <em>rev den, </em>287 Or 409 (1979) (\u201cThe objective is that the search be as precise as the circumstances allow and that undue rummaging be avoided.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Thus, the constitutional particularity requirement implicates two analytically distinct, but frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>practically intertwined, concepts. First, the warrant, as supplemented by any attached or incorporated supporting documents, must so clearly describe the place to be searched and the items to be seized and examined that officers can, \u201cwith reasonable effort, ascertain\u201d that place and those items to \u201ca reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d <em>Blackburn/Barber, </em>266 Or at 34-35. Second, the warrant must, to the extent reasonably possible, be drawn in such a way as to preclude seizures and searches not supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Those two concepts \u2014 specificity and overbreadth\u2014 again, have independent significance. For example, a warrant can precisely and unambiguously identify items to be forensically examined, satisfying the specificity concern, but nevertheless be invalid as overbroad if there is no probable cause to examine some of those items. However, the two can, and frequently do, conflate. That is, failure to identify with sufficient specificity the place to be searched or the items to be seized and examined can sanction invasions of protected privacy unsupported by probable cause. <em>See, e.g., State v. Castagnola, </em>145 Ohio St 3d 1, 17, 46 NE3d 638, 656 (2015) (noting \u201coverlap\u201d of those concepts with respect to warranted searches of electronic devices).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Here, defendant\u2019s challenge appears to encompass both of those concepts. As we understand it, defendant argues alternatively that (1) the warrant (even in combination with Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit) was impermissibly imprecise, because it failed to identify the information on the computers\u2019 hard drives for which the police were authorized to search; and (2) in all events, the warrant was overbroad as authorizing examination of material on the computers beyond that pertaining to defendant\u2019s internet searches during the 15-minute period preceding the 9-1-1 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The fundamental premise of defendant\u2019s challenge is that, given the unique functionality and capacity of computers and similar electronic devices, as recognized in, for example, <em>Riley v. </em>California, _ US _, 134 S Ct 2473, 189 L Ed 2d 430 (2014), warrants authorizing the forensic examination of such devices must specifically identify and carefully circumscribe the information authorized to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>examined.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under that construct, the electronic device corresponds, broadly, to the \u201cplace\u201d to be searched \u2014 which, in turn, requires that the \u201citems\u201d within that \u201cplace\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>data and files on the computer) be identified with constitutionally sufficient particularity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Galpin, </em>720 F3d 436, 446 (2d Cir 2013) (\u201c[AJdvances in technology and the centrality of computers in the lives of average people have rendered the computer hard drive akin to a residence in terms of the scope and quantity of private information it may contain.\u201d); <em>Com. v. Dorelas, </em>473 Mass 496, 499 n 3, 501-05, 43 NE3d 306, 311-14 (2016) (given distinctions between \u201cthe physical world\u201d and \u201cthe virtual world,\u201d electronic devices are properly deemed to be analogous to residences for purposes of particularity analysis; concluding that warrant, albeit \u201cawkwardly written,\u201d satisfied constitutional requirements).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Defendant\u2019s thesis is not without reason \u2014 or support. Indeed, several other courts, including other state courts, have concluded that warranted searches of computers were unlawful because the predicate warrants were insufficiently specific or impermissibly overbroad. <em>See, e.g., Galpin, </em>720 F3d at 448 (concluding that warrant was facially overbroad, but remanding for reconsideration of, <em>inter alia, </em>alleged severability of the warrant); <em>United States v. Otero, </em>563 F3d 1127 (10th Cir 2009) (warrant authorizing seizure and examination of \u201cany and all information and/ or data\u201d stored on computer was invalid as violating particularity requirement, but application of federal \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to exclusionary rule precluded suppression); <em>State v. Henderson, </em>289 Neb 271, 854 NW 2d 616 (2014) (same); <em>Castagnola, </em>145 Ohio St 3d at 18-24, 46 NE3d at 657-61 (warrant that \u201cdid not contain any description or qualifiers of the \u2018records and documents stored on the computer\u2019\u201d was impermissibly general as failing to \u201cguide and control the searcher and to sufficiently narrow the category of records or documents subject to seizure\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><em>Wheeler v. State, </em>135 A3d 282, (Del 2016), is exemplary. In <em>Wheeler, </em>the defendant was the subject of a witness tampering investigation in potential civil litigation involving alleged incidents of juvenile sexual abuse in the 1980\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85. In connection with that investigation, police obtained warrants, derived as a \u201ccut-and-paste\u201d from child pornography investigation warrants, which authorized the seizure and search of, <em>inter alia, \u201cla\\ny </em>personal computer [or] computer system\u201d and the forensic examination of <em>\u201c[a]ny and all </em>data *** <em>stored by whatever means\u201d </em>on such devices. <em>Id. </em>at 289-92 (emphasis in original). The consequent, unrestricted forensic examination of the defendant\u2019s devices disclosed \u201cimage files\u201d and \u201cvideo files\u201d that disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>inculpatory titles associated with child pornography. Based on that discovery, the police obtained another warrant to search the devices for evidence of child pornography, which, in turn, yielded the evidence that resulted in the defendant being indicted on multiple child pornography charges. <em>Id. </em>at 291. The defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress that evidence, arguing that the initial warrants were invalid as impermissibly general under the state and federal constitutions, and he was subsequently convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The Delaware Supreme Court reversed and remanded, concluding that the trial court had erred in denying suppression. The court began by acknowledging the practical difficulties and detriment of prescribing \u201cspecific computer search protocols,\u201d given \u201cthe propensity of criminals to disguise files.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-01. Nevertheless, those concerns could not serve to excuse \u201cunrestrained general searches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. Instead, \u201cthe proper metric of sufficient specificity is whether it was reasonable to provide a more specific description of the items [of information on the computer] at that juncture of the investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistently with that principle, and after canvassing other authority including <em>Galpin </em>and <em>Castagnola, </em>the court concluded that \u201cwarrants, in order to satisfy the particularity requirement, must describe what investigating officers believe will be found on electronic devices with as much specificity as possible under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. The court further determined that an integral feature of that standard was temporal \u2014 that is, that, to the extent reasonably possible, the warrant must include \u201ctemporal constraints,\u201d limiting the search \u201cto the relevant time frame.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Applying that standard, the court determined that the predicate witness tampering warrants were impermis-sibly general because their temporal scope was not circumscribed, so as to correspond to the period, within the investigator\u2019s knowledge, corresponding to the alleged tampering conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 305-06. The court further determined that it was \u201clikely\u201d that the warrants were invalid because of their \u201csubstantive\u201d scope:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">\u201c[B]y their terms, the Witness Tampering Warrants permitted the State to search for anything \u2014 from child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>pornography to medical records, to consumer information to tax returns. In short, they permitted the species of wide-ranging, exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 307; <em>see also State v. Keodara, </em>191 Wash App 305, 317, 364 P3d 777, 783 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>185 Wash 2d 1028 (2016) (warrant authorizing search of contents of cell phone held to be impermissibly general as allowing \u201cphone to be searched for items that had no association with any criminal activity and for which there was no probable cause whatsoever,\u201d where warrant authorized examination of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201call call history logs,\u201d \u201call text messages,\u201d and \u201call documents, chat and internet activity,\u201d with \u201cno limit on the topics of information for which police could search\u201d and without \u201climit-ting] the search to information generated close in time to incidents for which the police had probable cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Under the reasoning of those decisions, the warrant here might well have been invalid. Although Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit described defendant\u2019s internet searches on June 12, 2011, nothing in the affidavit referred to any other searches or, by way of competent expertise, substantiated a likelihood that parents who physically abuse their children are likely to have engaged in prior internet searches pertaining to such conduct. Certainly, Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit did not purport to confine the requested forensic examination of the computers\u2019 content to information bearing on the events of June 12 \u2014 or even to events occurring during B\u2019s brief lifetime. Further, although, as noted, Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit did include general averments about internet search histories, <em>see </em>279 Or App at 780-81, the content of the affidavit did not limit the forensic examination to internet search history, precluding examination of other files located in the hard drives.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In sum, under the rationale of those cases, it is at least doubtful that the scope of the warrant here was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>limited, temporally and substantively, \u201cwith as much specificity as possible under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Wheeler, </em>135 A3d at 304. Concomitantly, the warrant here might well be deemed to be overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The reasoning of those authorities is not without appeal. Nevertheless, we are bound by our own precedent. Thus, our consideration necessarily begins with whether, as the state urges, <em>Rose </em>is, effectively, dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In <em>Rose, </em>the 16-year old victim informed the police, in mid-July 2010, that she and the defendant had been communicating \u201cover the last few months via telephone, e-mails, and instant-messaging chats online,\u201d and that those communications had included \u201csexually explicit details.\u201d 264 Or App at 98. The victim also told the police that, sometime in June or July 2010, as part of those communications, she had offered to send the defendant a photograph of her bare breasts, and \u2014 after he had responded by sending her a photograph of his bare chest \u2014 she had twice emailed him photographs of her breasts. <em>Id. </em>at 97. Based on those circumstances, as recited in a supporting affidavit, the police applied for a search warrant directed to Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), the defendant\u2019s (and the victim\u2019s) email service provider, compelling Yahoo to produce, and authorizing the police to search, \u201c[a]ny and all contents of electronic files that [the defendant] has stored in [his] Yahoo! Account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The trial court issued the requested warrant, which stated that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of the crimes of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct and encouraging child sexual abuse would be found in the requested account records. <em>Id. </em>The warrant did not limit the requested account information to \u201cthe last few months\u201d before the warrant issued \u2014 which would have corresponded to the period of potentially inculpatory email communication between the defendant and the victim, as recited in the supporting affidavit. Nor did the warrant limit the search to the defendant\u2019s communications with the victim. Yahoo complied, producing \u201clarge quantities of email.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. In examining that information, the police \u201cconcentrat[ed] on\u201d emails from June and July 2010 \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>ultimately found the two emails with the photographs of the victim\u2019s bare breasts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress that evidence on several grounds, including that the warrant was \u201cinsufficiently particular.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was ultimately convicted of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, ORS 163.670.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">On appeal, the defendant assigned error to the denial of the suppression motion, renewing his particularity challenge.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In pressing that challenge, the defendant contended, as pertinent here, that, although</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cthe police had probable cause to believe that the victim had e-mailed defendant photographs of her bare breasts in June or July 2010, * * * the warrant authorized a search of \u2018any and all contents of electronic files\u2019 stored on his Yahoo account and did not limit the search by any time period or subject matter, such as a search for photographs of bare breasts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">264 Or App at 107.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">We rejected that challenge. First, with respect to specificity, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">\u201cThe warrant stated that the police could search for, and seize, evidence of the crimes of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct and encouraging child sexual abuse located in the electronic files stored in defendant\u2019s Yahoo account. Thus, the warrant was limited to a particular location, and the description of the items to be seized left the officers with no discretion in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Second, with respect to overbreadth, relating to insufficient temporal and substantive constraints, we noted that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s premise, \u201cthe two photographs sent by the victim to defendant was not the only evidence of [the] crimes that could exist in defendant\u2019s Yahoo account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that regard, we pointed to the victim\u2019s statements to the police that, in her on-line \u201cconversations\u201d with the defendant, they had \u201cdiscussed sexually explicit details.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, those facts \u201cindicated that possible evidence of defendant\u2019s crimes, aside from the two photographs ***, [was] being stored by defendant in his e-mail account.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Ultimately, the determination of whether <em>Rose </em>is dispositive here, or can be materially distinguished from this case, turns on the scope of our holding there\u2014 and, especially, of our conclusion that the warrant was not overbroad. If we, in fact, held in <em>Rose </em>that \u2014 as a general matter \u2014 the lack of any temporal or substantive limitation corresponding to matters supported by probable cause (beyond a generic identification of the predicate crime) did not render the warrant there overbroad, then <em>Rose </em>would almost certainly control here. If, however, our holding in <em>Rose </em>was narrowly case-specific, as rejecting the defendant\u2019s overbreadth contention because its <em>premise </em>\u2014 viz., that the only potentially relevant evidence in the email accounts was the two photographs \u2014 was erroneous, then <em>Rose </em>is not conclusive of defendant\u2019s general overbreadth challenge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In truth, <em>Rose </em>is less than clear in that regard. Our holding that the warrant \u201cwas sufficiently particular,\u201d 264 Or App at 97, 109, is unqualified. However, our description of the defendant\u2019s challenge, and our rejection of the overbreadth contention, both refer explicitly to the two photographs. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 109. Upon careful review of the appellant\u2019s brief in <em>Rose, </em>we conclude that the defendant\u2019s overbreadth contention there was, in fact, much narrower than defendant\u2019s challenge here. The gravamen of that spare argument was simply that the police had probable cause only with respect to the two photographs/emails, necessarily rendering a warrant authorizing the search of other emails overbroad. Given that framing, our opinion in <em>Rose </em>is most reasonably understood as rejecting the defendant\u2019s overbreadth contention on its own narrow terms: Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the defendant\u2019s \u201ctwo photographs only\u201d premise was false, the argument failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Thus, <em>Rose </em>is not dispositive here \u2014 at least with respect to alleged overbreadth.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That is, defendant\u2019s over-breadth challenge, predicated on the unique functionality and capacity of electronic devices, as recognized in <em>Riley </em>and other contemporaneous decisions, presents a matter of first impression for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We conclude that the warrant in this case was impermissibly overbroad, rendering the warranted search of the contents of defendant\u2019s computers unlawful under Article I, section 9.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We appreciate that relying on \u201cphysical analogs\u201d in characterizing digital media and information \u201cmay hamper rather than enhance our analysis,\u201d because such analogies are necessarily imperfect. <em>D\u00f3relas, </em>473 Mass at 505-06, 43 NE3d at 315.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nevertheless, on balance, we believe that, for purposes of the constitutional particularity requirement, personal electronic devices are more akin to the \u201cplace\u201d to be searched than to the \u201cthing\u201d to be seized and examined. Concomitantly, that requires that the search of that \u201cplace\u201d be limited to the \u201cthing(s)\u201d \u2014 the digital data \u2014 for which there is probable cause to search. <em>See Reid, </em>319 Or at 71 (\u201c[A] warrant may not authorize a search that is broader than the supporting affidavit supplies probable cause to justify.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">As other courts have readily acknowledged, striking a constitutionally principled but workable balance between \u201cprotecting against generality and overbreadth\u201d and not unduly impairing \u201cthe legitimate pursuit of prosecuting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>criminal activity\u201d presents special challenges in this context. <em>Wheeler, </em>135 A3d at 305; <em>accord United States v.

Consequently \u2014 and consistently with the precept that \u201c[t]he objective is that the search be as precise <em>as the circumstances allow\u201d Massey, </em>40 Or App at 214 (emphasis added) \u2014 we are mindful that, when substantiated by competent representations in a warrant submission, potential concealment or manipulation of digital data may justify an encompassing examination of a device\u2019s contents. Still, the touchstone is probable cause, as substantiated by the affidavit(s) submitted with the warrant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The warrant here was overbroad. Certainly, Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit established probable cause with respect to internet searches during the 15-minute period preceding the 9-1-1 call\u2014and, arguably, with respect to all electronic communications and photos during the entire time that B was in defendant\u2019s care on June 12, 2011. However, nothing in Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit established probable cause that a temporally unlimited examination of the contents of defendants\u2019 computers, including of files and functions unrelated to internet searches and emails, would yield other evidence of the events of June 12, 2011, or of any other crime. <em>Accord Wheeler, </em>135 A3d at 305 (\u201cThe Affidavits [authorizing temporally unlimited search of contents of the defendant\u2019s electronic devices] contain [ed] no facts suggesting that any [witness] tampering might have occurred prior to July 2013.

Thus, the warrant in this case was invalid as impermissibly overbroad, rendering the forensic examination of the contents of defendants\u2019 computers unlawful under Article I, section 9. Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.

We note, without implying any view as to the propriety of the admission of the challenged diagnosis during defendant\u2019s trial, that, in the event of a retrial on remand, the record pertaining to the admissibility of such testimony may be materially different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\"> There were two laptops and two desktop computers in that room, which also served as home office space. Defendant did not tell Rookhuyzen which of those computers he had used before calling 9-1-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-6\"> The listed items also included defendant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s cellphones. The probable cause justification for the search of those items was predicated on Rookhuyzen\u2019s \u201ctraining and experience\u201d-based averments that \u201cparents of young children often give one another updates on the condition of their babies when one is absent\u201d and that \u201cparents of injured children often call one another when their child is hurt, and sometimes call one another before requesting emergency assistance.\u201d Defendant does not contend that the seizure and search of the cellphones pursuant to the warrant was unlawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\"> The examiner testified that, for that device, \u201cthere was one unique user, which the user name was \u2018Kaliq\u2019\u201d (defendant\u2019s first name).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\"> Other search terms that detectives provided over time to the examiner included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">\u201cbruise, police, child abuse investigation, rib fracture, broken rib, colic, <em>* </em>* * twin, breath, breathing, rescue, rescue breathing, CPR, care abuse, and physical abuse * * * father, anger, or angry, crying, hurt or hurting, infant, evidence, explaining, and injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\"> The forensic examination also disclosed an internet search for the query, \u201cHow do I stop abusing my baby?\u201d However, testimony at trial did not specify the date of that inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> The search of the content of mother\u2019s computers disclosed no \u201cconcerning\u201d internet search terms or history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b804-5\"> As pertinent here, Article I, section 9, provides: \u201c[N]o warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment is identical except for nonsubstantive variations in capitalization and use of certain plural, not singular, nouns <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cWarrants,\u201d \u201cpersons or places\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> \u201cAttachment\u201d for these purposes appears to be a broadly functional concept under federal law, encompassing not only actual physical connection but also, more broadly, circumstances in which supporting documents are present and available for immediate reference when the warrant is executed. <em>See, e.g., Groh v. Ramirez, </em>540 US 551, 557-58, 124 S Ct 1284, 157 L Ed 2d (2004) (noting that neither the affidavit nor the application accompanied the warrant when it was executed, and, thus, were not \u201cavailable for * <em>* * </em>inspection\u201d by \u201cthe person whose home [was] being searched\u201d); <em>United States v. SDI Future Health, Inc., </em>553 F3d 1246, 1258 (9th Cir 2009) (one condition of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccure by affidavit\u201d principle requires that supporting affidavit must be \u201cattached physically to the warrant or at least accompany[y] the warrant while agents execute the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">As nearly as we can discern, reported Oregon decisions have involved only cases in which an affidavit or other supporting document was physically affixed to the warrant, <em>see, e.g, State v. Trax, </em>335 Or 597, 600, 75 P3d 440 (2003) (affidavit submitted with warrant application was \u201cattached to\u201d the warrant) or those in which the supporting documents were not physically appended, without any indication as to whether they accompanied the warrant when executed and were available for immediate reference and examination, <em>see, e.g., State v. Bush, </em>174 Or App 280, 284, 25 P3d 368 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 491 (2002). In <em>State v. Davis, </em>106 Or App 546, 548 n 1, 552, 809 P2d 125 (1991), an <em>en banc </em>majority concluded that, where the warrant application affidavit was not physically affixed to the warrant, the affiant executing officer\u2019s \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d could not cure a facial ambiguity in the warrant. <em>See also id. </em>at 553 (Warren, J., dissenting). However, in that case, there was no suggestion that the affidavit itself actually accompanied the warrant and was available for immediate reference at the time of execution, and, thus, the court had no occasion to consider the federal construct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> Only one witness testified at the suppression hearing \u2014 a computer expert, called by the defense, who testified as to forensic examination processes and the availability and feasibility of search protocols.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> Defense counsel referred to <em>Groh, </em>parenthetically describing its holding. However, defense counsel did not contend at argument that the affidavit in this case had not been attached or otherwise sufficiently incorporated and that, consequently under <em>Groh, </em>Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit could not supplement the facial content of the warrant itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\"> In that regard, the court concluded that, although Rookhuyzen\u2019s affidavit established probable cause that defendant had caused the \u201cold rib fracture\u201d noted by Dr. Lindsay, the affidavit did not substantiate a \u201cnexus between the older offense and information contained in the defendant\u2019s computers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\"> Defendant argues, for the first time on appeal, that, under the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conjunctive \u201ccure by affidavit\u201d formulation, <em>see, e.g., SDI Future Health, Inc., </em>553 F3d at 1258-59, the state was required to establish not only attachment, but also express incorporation by reference. However, defendant never invoked the Ninth Circuit\u2019s formulation before the trial court; rather \u2014 and to the contrary \u2014 defendant\u2019s motion to suppress stated, \u201cIf the affidavit was not attached <em>or </em>referenced in the warrant, then this Court cannot construe the warrant in light of the affidavit, under the Oregon and federal constitutions <em>* * </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\"> As noted, 279 Or App 786-87, the trial conrt regarded that concession as substantially \u201cnarrow[ing] the scope of the defense\u2019s theory of suppression.\u201d Thus, this is not a case in which a defendant raised a contention in the written suppression motion and then merely failed to reiterate that contention during the suppression hearing. <em>Accord Walker, </em>350 Or at 550 (\u201cThis court has never required that each and every argument that has been asserted in writing must be repeated orally in court in order for the argument to be preserved.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b814-4\"> In <em>Riley, </em>the Court held that the search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement was inapplicable to a warrantless search of digital data stored on the defendant\u2019s cell phone and that \u201cofficers must generally secure a warrant before conducting such a search.\u201d_US at_, 134 S Ct at 2485. In so holding, the Court observed that \u201c[c]ell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee\u2019s person,\u201d including with respect to \u201ctheir immense storage capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at_, 134 S Ct at 2489.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The Court described at some length the functionality of such <em>devices- </em>\u2014 e.g., \u201cThey could just as easily be called cameras, video players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at_, 134 S Ct at 2489. In that regard, the Court highlighted, as among the qualitative differences from \u201cphysical records,\u201d the ability to derive from a personal electronic device \u201can Internet search and browsing history,\u201d which \u201ccould reveal an individual\u2019s private interests or concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at_, 134 S Ct at 2490. The Court concluded that, in contrast to historical observations that a search of a person\u2019s pockets was far less intrusive than a search of a residence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-13\">\u201ca cell phone search would typically expose to the government far <em>more </em>than the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not only contains in digital form many sensitive records previously found in the home; it also contains a broad array of private information never found in a home in any form\u2014 unless the phone is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-14\"><em>Id. </em>at _, 134 S Ct at 2491; <em>see also State v.
