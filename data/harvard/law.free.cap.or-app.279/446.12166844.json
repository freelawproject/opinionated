J.</author>\n<p id=\"b468-3\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for attempted misdemeanor fourth-degree assault, which was based on an incident involving his girlfriend\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, E. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting a recording of E\u2019s 9-1-1 call after she failed to appear as a witness on the morning scheduled for trial. According to defendant, the admission of E\u2019s out-of-court statements violated his rights under the confrontation clause of Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, because the state failed to prove that it made a good-faith effort to secure E\u2019s trial attendance. We agree with defendant that the state\u2019s effort to secure her attendance is insufficient to demonstrate unavailability for purposes of defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under Article I, section 11, and we reverse and remand on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">For purposes of this appeal, the background facts are essentially undisputed. In August 2012, police responded to a 9-1-1 call from E, who reported that she was hiding in the bathroom of her home because her \u201cmom\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d defendant, had hit E, was \u201cwaiting to hit [E] with a belt,\u201d and was outside the door fighting with her mother, N. The responding officers found E, \u201chysterical,\u201d in the street near the house. They then spoke to defendant, who claimed that the incident resulted from an attempt to discipline E, which escalated when E hit him in the eye. Based on his actions toward E, defendant subsequently was charged with felony fourth-degree assault (because of the presence of E\u2019s younger siblings) and harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Trial was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on June 12, 2013. Shortly after 10:00 a.m., on the morning set for trial, the court invited the parties to address the admissibility of a recording of the 9-1-1 call, because it was apparent that E, although subpoenaed by the state as a witness, was not planning to show up. The parties then addressed the two requirements under Article I, section 11, for admitting out-of-court statements from a declarant who will not be testifying at trial: (1) the \u201cunavailability\u201d of the declarant and (2) the reliability of the declarant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The prosecutor argued that both requirements were satisfied. As for the latter requirement, reliability, the prosecutor argued that the statements in the 9-1-1 call were excited utterances. <em>See State v. Camarena, </em>344 Or 28, 36, 176 P3d 380 (2008) (approving this court\u2019s conclusion that the complainant\u2019s statements to the 9-1-1 operator were reliable as \u201cexcited utterances,\u201d a firmly rooted hearsay exception under Oregon law). With regard to unavailability, the prosecutor first described the efforts that the state made to procure E\u2019s testimony. <em>See State v. Nielsen, </em>316 Or 611, 623, 853 P2d 256 (1993) (a declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d when the state makes a good-faith effort to obtain the witness\u2019s testimony but is unable to do so). The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cFirst, the State has subpoenaed [E] who is the named victim in this case. She \u2014 we have a return of service on her. We have been trying to call her to have her appear and reach her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cThis morning I spoke with her mother, [N]. She confirmed that she had been served with a subpoena but was not going to come to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Later in the hearing, the trial court inquired further about the unavailability prong of the test, explaining that <em>Camarena </em>did not address \u201cwhether the mere fact of not showing up for a subpoena satisfied the State\u2019s obligation.\u201d The prosecutor replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201cI know we have to make that showing ***. And I think when the State subpoenaed a witness, that we have attempted to call her, we can\u2019t reach her. I spoke to her mother this morning in order to confirm whether she was coming or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u201cIt is not \u2014 I think where the line comes in is where there is no efforts made, we are just going to not bother to try to get the witness here that that becomes an issue. But that was not the State\u2019s intent. The State\u2019s intent \u2014 it would be easier to have a witness here. We wouldn\u2019t have to be having this argument about what comes in and what doesn\u2019t if she were here. And we made the efforts to get her here. We did serve her. She is * * * refusing to appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Defense counsel, meanwhile, argued that the state had made only \u201cminimal\u201d efforts to secure E\u2019s attendance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Counsel contended, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that they don\u2019t know where she is. She has been under subpoena and I think that the effort has been minimal at this point, basically no effort finding out that she doesn\u2019t want to come in.\u201d Defense counsel further argued that \u201cthe State has the authority to ask you to bring her in as a material witness. Even apart from that, the Sheriff or police officers could be sent out to have her available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The court then went off the record and reviewed relevant case law. When the court went back on the record, it asked the parties to clarify some of the underlying facts\u2014 particularly, the time that the state learned that E was not going to appear. The prosecutor stated that he learned \u201cthis morning\u201d that E was not going to appear; he stated that \u201c[w]e tried all of the numbers that we had that did not operate anymore for her and then \u2014 .\u201d At that point, defense counsel interrupted to point out a factual discrepancy. Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cI just want to interject so you have the full record. According to what I have learned [E] was at the DA\u2019s Office sometime earlier and indicated that she wouldn\u2019t appear and didn\u2019t want to testify. And then this morning before [the prosecutor] had even identified who [E\u2019s mother] was, indicated to me that he might not have [E] available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The court pointed out \u201csome disagreement as to that clarification\u201d and asked the prosecutor whether E \u201cappear [ed] at your office or contact [ed] your office.\u201d The prosecutor answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cThe last time [E] was at our office was at Grand Jury, that I know of which was almost a year ago. There had been subsequent mail or I think phone contact. Then the phone number stopped working and we have not heard from her. Because we haven\u2019t heard from her and because of, you know, the whole nature of this case where it is clear that \u2014 but [E\u2019s mother] \u2014 that [E] are not cooperative with the prosecution of this case. Yeah, there was a thought that she thought she may not show up. So that is what I related to [defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cAnd spoke with \u2014 then I went out and spoke with her mother, [N], and asked if she was coming. She said no, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>is not coming. She had gotten her subpoena. She confirmed that she got her subpoena but she was refusing to come.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The trial court observed that Oregon appellate cases had not squarely addressed whether \u201cmerely serving the subpoena is a reasonable effort on the part of the State.\u201d The court then stated that, \u201c[i]f this person is known to be local, if she is still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I can say presumably, but the circumstances were that she was living with her mother as a family, it is reason to believe that she still lives under those circumstances, whether the state ought to be asking for the Court\u2019s assistance in procuring her attendance or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The prosecutor, in response, again argued that \u201cservice is enough\u201d and suggested that \u201cthe more likely scenario is that they figured if they didn\u2019t show up then we wouldn\u2019t have a case and then it would be dismissed, rather than it is the State not trying to have them here.\u201d The court clarified that it was not suggesting that the state was \u201ctrying not to have them here,\u201d but rather was trying to resolve defense counsel\u2019s contentions regarding whether a material witness order, or sheriff being sent to compel her attendance, or something \u201calong those lines is required\u201d to show unavailability. The court explained that \u201c[t]hose are remedies that are available. I understand *** why that is not necessarily desirable, but certainly in an allegation of domestic violence I can see why the state might choose not to do so.\u201d The court further acknowledged that the state might not want to take measures beyond subpoena in the case of a juvenile but explained that the question was complicated by the constitutional requirement of confrontation. The court then proposed the following approach to protect defendant\u2019s confrontation rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201cOne way of looking at this is that we now have a bench trial. We have two days set for trial. If all that has happened so far is a follow up phone call we could set this to begin tomorrow at the same time or perhaps at 9:00 o\u2019clock and allow the State to do whatever further \u2014 make whatever further efforts it wishes to make at this time whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>through officers that are on the case or otherwise. And then we could take it up tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201cIt feels to me like there is a little bit more \u2014 and I am not official formally ruling on that, but it seems to me that there might be a little more that could be done to ensure that [defendant\u2019s] Constitutional rights are protected that won\u2019t interfere with the operation of this \u2014 completion of this trial under the circumstances. So I would give the State that opportunity to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201cIs there any reason that \u2014 it seems like this would be a fairly brief trial since it is a bench trial. In any event, we could complete it in one day if we started at 9:00 o\u2019clock tomorrow?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The prosecutor responded, \u201cI think we could.\u201d The court then asked whether there was \u201c[a]ny objection from [the] other side to proceeding that way rather than formally ruling on the objection to the 911 tape?\u201d Defendant objected to delaying the ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201cI will have to object to the Court allowing the State to fix what it is obviously a deficient effort to get [E] here. We set this hearing to discuss the current state of the evidence and how the cases apply. And then once it is determined how those cases apply, the Court is giving the State additional time to cure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201cI would object. I think the motion hearing was intended to resolve the issue based on the facts known at the time. And so I object to a continuance, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In light of defendant\u2019s objection to a continuance, the court ruled at that time on whether the state\u2019s efforts were reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">\u201cGiven that, [defense counsel], based upon the information that the State had prior to today\u2019s date, the fact that they had a return of service that [E] had been served with subpoena, without specific reason to know that she would not comply with that such that they need to take additional steps beforehand, the guidance [inaudible] available from the Court of Appeals on this issue is that the State has made a reasonable effort to procure her attendance. She has not attended and so is not available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">The court further ruled that the statements were reliable and that it would admit the 9-1-1 recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>As contemplated by that pretrial ruling, the state offered, and the court admitted, the 9-1-1 recording as evidence during the bench trial. The court found defendant not guilty of the charged felony fourth-degree assault and harassment but found him guilty of the lesser-included offense of attempted misdemeanor fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of the 9-1-1 recording, arguing that the court\u2019s ruling violated his state constitutional right to confront his accuser, E. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 11 (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right *** to meet the witnesses face to face.\u201d). In light of Article I, section 11, \u201cout-of-court statements made by a declarant who does not testify at trial are, as a general rule, admissible only if (1) the declarant is unavailable and (2) the statements have adequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>State v. Supanchick, </em>354 Or 737, 753, 323 P3d 231 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In this case, defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal concern only the first of those two prongs, the question of unavailability. The Oregon Supreme Court has adopted \u201cthe reasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States [stated in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 100 S Ct 2531, 65 L Ed 2d 597 (1980)] to determine \u2018what constitutes unavailability of a hearsay declarant * * * to satisfy our state constitutional confrontation clause.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 140, 806 P2d 92 (1991) (quoting <em>State v. Campbell, </em>299 Or 633, 648, 705 P2d 694 (1985)). Under that test, the prosecution, as the proponent of the out-of-court statement, must show that it \u201cmade a good-faith effort to obtain [the declarant\u2019s] testimony, but was unable to do so.\u201d <em>Nielson, </em>316 Or at 623; <em>State v. Starr, </em>269 Or App 97, 103, 344 P3d 100, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 415 (2015) (\u201cThe state bears the burden of proof, as the proponent of the evidence, that the witness was unavailable.\u201d). \u201cThe degree of effort which constitutes due diligence in attempting to secure an unavailable witness depends upon the particular circumstances presented by each case.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>42 Or App 29, 32, 599 P2d 1225, <em>rev den, </em>288 Or 1 (1979), <em>cert den, </em>446 US 920 (1980). Thus, \u201c[w]e look to all of the circumstances shown in the record regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>state\u2019s efforts to procure the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>269 Or App at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In this case, the parties focus most of their attention on one particular aspect of the state\u2019s efforts: the successful service of a subpoena. Defendant acknowledges that we have previously accepted a concession that a declarant who \u201cfailed to appear pursuant to a subpoena\u201d was unavailable. <em>See State v. Wilcox, </em>180 Or App 557, 564, 43 P3d 1182, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 632 (2002) (summarily stating, \u201cHere, however, the trial court found that the victim was unavailable, because she failed to appear pursuant to a subpoena. On appeal, defendant concedes that the victim was unavailable, and we accept that concession.\u201d). Nonetheless, he argues that \u201c[t]his court should hold that more is required.\u201d According to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cWhen a witness declines to appear despite having been validly subpoenaed, the state has many options to compel that witness to testify, ranging from persuasion to invoking the trial court\u2019s contempt power. If the state declines to pursue any of those options, and the record does not reflect that further efforts would have been futile, then the state has failed to show a good-faith effort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The state responds that <em>Wilcox </em>is consistent with the general rule that this court should adopt: \u201cThis court should hold that subpoenaing a witness will, in all but exceptional cases, constitute a good-faith effort to secure her for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In our view, defendant\u2019s position is more consonant with the protections enshrined in Article I, section 11. Although frequently phrased in terms of whether the state made a good-faith effort to secure the witness\u2019s attendance, the test for unavailability is, ultimately, one of <em>necessity. </em>As the court pointed out in <em>State v. Moore, </em>334 Or 328, 339-40, 49 P3d 785 (2002), the unavailability requirement \u201cflows logically\u201d from those cases in which courts allowed the use of out-of-court statements in \u201c\u2018circumstances of genuine necessity\u2019\u201d \u2014 that is, cases in which \u201cconfrontation, in the classic sense, was impossible.\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Smyth, </em>286 Or 293, 300, 593 P2d 1166 (1979).); <em>State v. Herrera, </em>286 Or 349, 355, 594 P2d 823 (1979) (\u201cBefore a prosecutor can use prior recorded testimony and thus deprive a defendant of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>right at trial to confront his accusers face to face, he must first show the trial court that use of the former testimony is a genuine necessity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Our decision in <em>State v. Jackson, </em>187 Or App 679, 683-84, 69 P3d 722 (2003), provides a helpful summary of the principles animating the unavailability requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cThe meaning of\u2018unavailability\u2019 is clarified by reference to the underlying purpose of confrontation, which is \u2018to augment accuracy in the factfinding process by ensuring the defendant an effective means to test adverse evidence * * <em>Roberts, </em>448 US at 65. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201c*** The unavailability requirement effectuates the preference for face-to-face confrontation by \u2018establish [ing] a rule of necessity.\u2019 <em>Roberts, </em>448 US at 65. To satisfy that rule, \u2018the prosecution must either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>The rule of necessity applies to Article I, section 11; the state must either furnish face-to-face confrontation or show that doing so is impossible. <em>Moore, </em>334 Or at 339.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\"><em>See also id. </em>at 685 (\u201cBecause courts excuse the absence of confrontation only in the face of \u2018genuine necessity,\u2019 when the state can produce the declarant as a witness, it must do so.\u201d (Quoting <em>Moore, </em>334 Or at 340.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Viewed in that light, the mere fact that E was subpoenaed but did not show up on the morning of trial, is legally insufficient to establish the type of \u201cgenuine necessity\u201d that demonstrates unavailability for purposes of Article I, section 11. As defendant points out, this is not a case in which the record showed that the witness was beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction or could not have been located through good-faith efforts by the state; indeed, the state was able to locate her for service of the subpoena, and the trial court noted that there \u201cwas reason to believe\u201d that she was still living with her family. Nor was this a case in which the state\u2019s previous efforts to locate E give rise to any reasonable inference that further efforts to compel her attendance would have been futile. Leading up to trial, the state made only minimal efforts \u2014 trying nonworking phone numbers \u2014 to contact E, one of its most important witnesses, notwithstanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s knowledge that E was a reluctant witness. <em>See Brooks v. United States, </em>39 A3d 873, 886 (DC Ct App 2012) (\u201c[A] witness\u2019s known reluctance to testify adds to the government\u2019s burden to show that it made 'reasonable, good faith efforts\u2019 to secure her appearance because it makes her failure to appear voluntarily all the more foreseeable.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Instead, this is a case in which, <em>after </em>E did not show up pursuant to the subpoena, the state made <em>no </em>further effort to locate her or to compel her attendance at trial, content to rely on the 9-1-1 call. <em>See United States v. Mann, </em>590 F2d 361, 367 (1st Cir 1978) (\u201cThe government did not make as vigorous an attempt to secure the presence of the witness as it would have made if it did not have the prior recorded testimony. The language of [FRE] 804(a)(5) suggests that \u2018other reasonable means\u2019 besides subpoenas must be tried before a witness can be found unavailable. This relatively high good faith standard cannot be satisfied by perfunctory efforts, if the rule is not to sanction the government\u2019s procuring depositions of witnesses, especially shaky witnesses, but then discourage attempts to bring the witness to trial so long as the government is satisfied with what is in the transcript.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)). That is, the state did not attempt to locate E through her mother, who was present at the courthouse, or through other relatives or law enforcement; it did not send or even propose to send law enforcement to get her; nor did the state invoke the court\u2019s contempt power or seek a material witness order to ensure E\u2019s attendance once she failed to show up on the morning of trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and, although the prosecutor was perhaps amenable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to a continuance to make further efforts to procure E\u2019s testimony, he did not request a continuance for that purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See U. S. v. Lynch, </em>499 F2d 1011, 1023 (1974) (holding that the government had failed to establish that its witness was unavailable, notwithstanding successful service of the subpoena; \u201c[a]t least where the evidence indicates that a crucial government witness, who is physically and mentally capable of testifying, is within the jurisdiction of the court, the prosecution must demonstrate that it has been unable to obtain the witness\u2019 presence through a search exercised both in good faith and with reasonable diligence and care\u201d); <em>see also Mann, </em>590 F2d at 367 (the government must make more than \u201cperfunctory efforts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In short, contrary to the state\u2019s suggestion, its obligation to make a good-faith effort did not end with its successful service of the subpoena on a reluctant witness. Rather, on this record, we agree with the trial court\u2019s initial observation that more could have been done to protect defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. The state\u2019s effort, as of the time of the motion <em>in limine, </em>was legally insufficient to establish that E was \u201cunavailable\u201d for purposes of Article I, section 11, and the trial court therefore erred in admitting the 9-1-1 tape recording. Furthermore, because the tape recording was an important part of the state\u2019s case, particularly regarding defendant\u2019s mental state, the error was prejudicial. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> The prosecutor also confirmed that he had received a return of service for the subpoena.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\"> We draw on the reasoning of courts in other jurisdictions under the federal constitution and analogous standard under the federal evidence rules because, as the trial court correctly observed, Oregon appellate courts have provided little guidance on whether the mere service of a subpoena satisfies the state\u2019s obligation to make a good-faith effort for purposes of establishing unavailability. In most Oregon appellate cases, the state has been unable to successfully serve the witness with the subpoena, and the issue has been whether the state\u2019s efforts to serve the witness were sufficient to establish unavailability. <em>E.g., Starr, </em>269 Or App 97; <em>State v. Simmons, </em>241 Or App 439,250 P3d 431 (2011); <em>State v. Lucas, </em>213 Or App 277, 160 P3d 1012 (2007); <em>Anderson, </em>42 Or App 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\"> We need not specifically address whether, to show unavailability, the state would have been required bring a contempt action against E or seek a material witness order in the event that further efforts to contact her and persuade her to testify were unsuccessful; as noted, the state made <em>no </em>further effort to secure E\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>attendance after she failed to appear pursuant to the subpoena, let alone initiate contempt or material witness proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\"> As set out above, the trial court, not the state, proposed a continuance. When defendant objected to giving the state additional time to \u201ccure\u201d its deficient effort, the prosecutor fell back on his argument that the subpoena was sufficient to demonstrate unavailability, and the court decided the question of unavailability based on the record before it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
