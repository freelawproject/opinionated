On February 2, 2007, a jury in the Superior Court convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree of Serret on the theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme cruelty or atrocity, and of armed assault of Carbuccia with intent to murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">Represented by new counsel, the defendant appeals from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>convictions. On appeal, the defendant claims that his constitutional right of confrontation was violated when a senior crimi-nalist at the Boston police department\u2019s crime laboratory testified to the results of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing that she did not conduct. The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of (1) an earlier, uncharged murder, allegedly committed by the defendant; (2) an out-of-court statement by Carbuccia and Serret that they had witnessed the earlier, uncharged murder; (3) the defendant\u2019s unequivocal, post-Miranda denials of guilt; and (4) an autopsy photograph depicting Serret\u2019s injuries. Finally, the defendant claims that the judge did not adequately instruct the jury with respect to (1) the limited permissible use of the uncharged murder evidence, and (2) the failure of the police to tape record its postarrest interrogation of him. While we conclude that there were some errors in the conduct of the trial, they do not justify reversal. After a review of the record, we also conclude that there is no basis to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce his murder conviction to a lesser degree of guilt or to order a new trial. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, showed that, at approximately 7 p.m. on October 6, 2004, Serret and Carbuccia were walking on a street in the Roxbury section of Boston when they encountered the defendant on his bicycle. Carbuccia had seen the defendant only twice before, but he knew that Serret and the defendant were better acquainted. The three walked together to Robey Street, where the defendant left them in an alleyway, and they waited for him to return. After five to ten minutes, the defendant returned, and immediately pulled out a gun. From ten to fifteen feet away, the defendant shot Carbuccia in the shoulder, and he fell to the ground. While on the ground, Carbuccia heard three or four more shots, and then heard Serret say to the defendant, \u201cDammit, you\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">An eyewitness, Luis Sanches, heard three or four shots fired on Robey Street and then saw the defendant and Serret running from Robey Street onto Marshfield Street. They were punching each other as they ran down the sidewalk across the street from Sanches\u2019s house. Sanches heard one more gunshot, and Serret fell to the ground. As Serret lay on the ground, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>continued to punch him before running away and turning the comer at Norfolk Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">After the police were called, a paramedic in a city of Boston ambulance, while en route to Marshfield Street, noticed Carbuc-cia lying near the comer of East Cottage and Robey Streets and stopped his vehicle. Carbuccia was not alert or conscious and appeared to be suffering profound shock from a gunshot to his upper extremity, with significant blood loss. The paramedic quickly put Carbuccia in the back of the vehicle and continued to Marshfield Street, where he saw Serret, who had no signs of life and obvious trauma to his interior chest, neck, and skull region. Serret was moved into another ambulance and pronounced dead, while Carbuccia survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Between 8 and 8:30 p.m. that evening, Officers William Hubbard and Charles MacKinnon were in uniform and patrolling the Uphams Comer area in a marked Boston police cmiser when they received a radio call to respond to the scene at Marshfield Street. Approximately one minute later, when they were on Bur-rell Street, about one or two blocks from Marshfield Street, they observed the defendant walking toward them, moving at a brisk pace in the direction of Clifton Street. He appeared to be short of breath, and his face was glistening with sweat. Officer Hubbard rolled down his window and asked the defendant whether he had heard gunshots. Pointing to the intersection of Burrell and Bach-elder Streets, toward which the officers were headed, and making excited gestures with his hands, the defendant said, \u201cOver there, I heard shots, they are crazy, I had to run.\u201d As he said this, he stepped away from the cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Officer Hubbard opened his door, and the defendant immediately began to run. Officer Hubbard followed him on foot, yelling, \u201cBoston police, stop,\u201d but the defendant did not comply. After the defendant stumbled and lost a boot, Officer Hubbard caught up to the defendant and tackled him in the street. While still on the defendant\u2019s back, Officer Hubbard ordered him to show his hands. Instead, the defendant crawled toward the sidewalk, about five feet away. As they struggled on the ground, Officer Hubbard heard a loud splash and saw the defendant\u2019s hand emerge from a catch basin. The defendant then showed his hands to Officer Hubbard and ceased to straggle. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>was handcuffed, placed in the back of another cruiser that had arrived, and the boot that he had lost was returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In order to retrieve the item that the defendant dropped in the catch basin, the police contacted Daniel O\u2019Brien, a supervisor of operations for the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. O\u2019Brien attempted to retrieve the item by lowering a powerful magnet attached to a nylon rope on his truck down into the basin, \u201calmost like fishing.\u201d He could feel the magnet attracted to something, but could not pull up the object. One of O\u2019Brien\u2019s employees, Kevin McNeil, then brought a \u201cclam truck,\u201d which was used to scoop debris from the basin and dump it onto the sidewalk. A nine millimeter Bryco semiautomatic pistol was recovered in the first scoop; O\u2019Brien testified that \u201cusually, if you find something the first scoop it hasn\u2019t been there that long.\u201d No other items of interest were recovered from the catch basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">At approximately 9:25 p.m. that night, Detective Dennis Harris, with Sergeant Detective Thomas O\u2019Leary also present, interviewed the defendant at Boston police headquarters. Detective Harris read the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant initialed and signed a Miranda warnings sheet. The interview was not tape recorded. The defendant was sober, alert, and calm. He stated that he had just left a bar on Shirley Street and was at the intersection of Shirley and George Streets when he heard gunshots. When the police pulled up next to him in their cruiser and he saw the officers leaving the cruiser, he decided to run because he believed there was a warrant for his arrest based on a motor vehicle infraction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant then changed his previous account, saying that he was going to, not coming from, the bar on Shirley Street. He initially said his route included Marshfield Street, but then denied having been on Marshfield Street that evening. When asked directly, the defendant denied any involvement in the shootings and denied throwing anything into the catch basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Detective Harris left the interview room at 10:05 p.m., called an officer still at the scene, and learned that a firearm had been recovered from the catch basin. Detective Harris returned to the interview room and informed the defendant that a firearm was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>found and that he was being charged with its unlawful possession. When he heard this, the defendant dropped his head to his knees. The interview ended shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">When Detective John Callahan interviewed Carbuccia on October 11 at the hospital, Carbuccia stated that he did not know who had shot him because he \u201cdidn\u2019t get a good look\u201d at the shooter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 16, when Carbuccia was out of the hospital and at his mother\u2019s house, Detective Callahan again spoke with Carbuccia, but Carbuccia provided no new information. Two days later, however, after Carbuccia had contacted Detective Callahan\u2019s partner, Sergeant Detective Richard Daley, Carbuccia gave a tape-recorded statement in which he said that the defendant shot him and selected a photograph of the defendant from an array of eight photographs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">It was not until Carbuccia met with the district attorney on December 21, 2006, in preparation for trial that Carbuccia first said that he had witnessed the defendant shoot another man on September 21, 2004, approximately two weeks before the defendant shot him and Serret.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At trial, Carbuccia testified that on September 21, 2004, he was with Serret when he saw the defendant, with two other persons, walk past them on a sidewalk on Dudley Street in Roxbury. Serret, who knew the defendant, asked him, \u201cWhat up?,\u201d but the defendant replied that he was unable to talk. Serret and Carbuccia then watched as the defendant shot a Hispanic man in the head after the defendant and his two companions had persuaded the man to exit his parked vehicle. The man fell onto the hood of the vehicle and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">That night, Serret and Carbuccia told Serret\u2019s mother that they \u201csaw something.\u201d After Serret died, three pieces of paper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>were recovered from his wallet. On one was written the letter \u201cC,\u201d which was the defendant\u2019s nickname, and a telephone number that was assigned to the cellular telephone that was recovered from the defendant after his arrest. The other two pieces of paper also had the letter \u201cC\u201d written on it, along with a different telephone number, which was assigned to a prepaid cellular telephone with no name assigned to the account. Telephone records for this prepaid telephone revealed thirty-seven telephone calls to and from that number and Serret\u2019s mother\u2019s telephone number between September 23 and September 27, 2004. Serret was living at his mother\u2019s house prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">During the interview of the defendant on the night of the shooting, Detective Harris noticed that the toe area of the defendant\u2019s left boot had a reddish-brown stain on it. The defendant claimed he did not know what it was. Detective Harris took the defendant\u2019s boots from him. After the interview, Detective Harris also took the defendant\u2019s pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Forensic testing of reddish-brown stains on the defendant\u2019s left boot and lower left pant leg tested positive for the presence of human blood. Samples were taken of each stain for DNA testing. Julie Lynch, a senior criminalist in the DNA unit of the Boston police department, testified that Serret was \u201cincluded as being the possible source of the DNA extracted from\u201d both bloodstains, while the defendant was excluded as a possible source of the DNA from both. She later testified to the significance of Serret\u2019s inclusion as a \u201cpossible source of the DNA\u201d found on the defendant\u2019s boot and pant leg \u2014 that DNA profile could be expected to be found in approximately one in thirty-five quadrillion Caucasians, one in fourteen quadrillion African-Americans, and one in 7.1 quadrillion South Eastern Hispanics.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Dr. Richard Evans, a medical examiner and forensic pathologist with the medical examiner\u2019s office in Boston, testified to the autopsy he performed on October 7, 2004. He observed two types of injuries: gunshot wounds and blunt trauma. There were six gunshot wounds, all with entrances on the back of the body. Dr. Evans also noted twelve lacerations on the left side of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>head and four lacerations on the back side of the head. These lacerations involved the tearing, not cutting, of tissues because they were made by blunt, not sharp, force. Underneath the twelve lacerations on the side of the head was a two by three inch depressed skull fracture. Several autopsy photographs were introduced in evidence, and the defendant objected only to the partially redacted image of the fracture in Serret\u2019s skull. Dr. Evans testified that the lacerations and fracture were not associated with internal hemorrhaging, which meant that these injuries were most likely sustained after Serret\u2019s heart had stopped beating. In his medical opinion, the cause of death was the gunshot wounds, not the blunt trauma to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Seven spent nine millimeter shell casings and two nine millimeter bullet fragments were recovered from Marshfield and Robey Streets. The Commonwealth\u2019s ballistics expert, Detective Tyrone Camper, testified to his opinion that the seven cartridge casings found at the scene of the shootings were fired from the nine millimeter Bryco semiautomatic pistol recovered from the catch basin, and that this firearm was in working condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"><em>Discussion. DNA evidence. </em>The defendant argues that he was denied his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution when Lynch testified about the results of the DNA testing performed by another analyst, Cheryl Delatore, who was no longer employed by the Boston police department at the time of trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the defendant challenges the admissibility of portions of Lynch\u2019s testimony, we describe her testimony in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">After testifying to her education and experience in forensic DNA testing, Lynch explained that a DNA profile is a set of DNA characteristics that is \u201cnot necessarily unique but . . . is . . . rarely found in the population.\u201d She testified that the crime laboratory receives two types of biological evidence: (1) evidence from an unknown source, such as evidence taken from a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>scene, and (2) samples from a known source, such as an individual allegedly involved in the case. The laboratory generates DNA profiles from both types of evidence and compares them. If the DNA profile from an unknown source and a known source are the same, Lynch concludes that the individual whose DNA comprised the known source is included as a possible source of the DNA from the unknown source.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the DNA profiles of an unknown source and a known source do not match, then the individual whose DNA comprised the known source cannot be the source of the DNA from the unknown source and is excluded as a possible source.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Lynch testified that there are four steps involved in the DNA testing conducted by the Boston police department crime laboratory. The first is \u201cextraction,\u201d in which the DNA is extracted from the cells. The second is \u201cquantitation,\u201d in which the DNA analyst determines the quantity of DNA that was extracted. The third is \u201ccopying,\u201d in which the crime laboratory uses a polymerase chain reaction-based test to make millions, sometimes billions, of copies of the DNA. This allows the laboratory to be able to test samples that otherwise might be quantitatively too small. The fourth is \u201ctyping,\u201d in which a genetic analyzer, known as the AmpFISTR identifier PCR amplification kit, determines the characteristics of the alleles at sixteen different positions on various DNA chromosomes, which collectively constitute the DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Here, four samples were tested: (1) the reddish-brown stain from the defendant\u2019s left boot, (2) the reddish-brown stain from the defendant\u2019s lower left pant leg, (3) a bloodstain from Serret, and (4) an oral swab from the defendant. Lynch testified that Serret was included as a possible source of the DNA found on the defendant\u2019s boot and pant leg, while the defendant was excluded as a possible source of that DNA. A table prepared by Delatore was introduced in evidence showing the characteristics of the sixteen different positions on each of the four DNA profiles. Lynch also orally conveyed some of the information within the table to the jury during her direct examination. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>explained that, \u201c[f]or a single-source profile like this they have to match exactly for that individual to be included as a possible source.\u201d Because Serret\u2019s DNA profile was precisely the same in all sixteen locations as the DNA profile of the bloodstains on the defendant\u2019s boot and pant leg, Serret was included as a possible source.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">During most of her testimony, particularly on direct examination, Lynch gave the impression that she personally participated in each of the four steps to test these four samples, using the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d in describing the conduct of the testing. The defendant did not object to any of Lynch\u2019s testimony but, on cross-examination, elicited that Lynch did not perform the DNA testing in this case. Rather, she had supervised and trained the analyst who conducted the testing, Delatore. Lynch testified that she reviewed Delatore\u2019s work by looking at the worksheets and reports that Delatore generated during the testing process, and signed Delatore\u2019s final report regarding the testing that had been performed and the results of the testing, noting that accreditation standards require a full technical review on all DNA reports that are issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Defense counsel also elicited from Lynch that the DNA in this case was transferred from one test tube to another at least five times, and that, if Delatore had mislabeled a test tube containing the defendant\u2019s known DNA as Serret\u2019s known DNA, the characteristics of the sixteen different positions on each of the four DNA profiles would remain unchanged, but the defendant, not Serret, would be included as a possible source of the DNA found on the defendant\u2019s boot and pant leg.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>Lynch acknowledged that, because she was not \u201cstanding over [Delatore\u2019s] shoulders,\u201d she had \u201cno idea\u201d whether one of the test tubes was improperly labeled or confused with another. The only way to be certain that a mistake did not occur, she testified, would be to retest the samples, which was not done in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The defendant argues, and the Commonwealth concedes, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Delatore\u2019s table showing the results of the DNA testing was testimonial hearsay admitted in violation of the confrontation clause, as was Lynch\u2019s testimony conveying the information in the table to the jury. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004). The defendant also argues that Lynch\u2019s expert opinion regarding the significance of the DNA test results violated the confrontation clause because her opinion was based on Dela-tore\u2019s work product, which itself was testimonial, and essentially repeated her findings. To address this latter argument, we examine the intersection between our common-law rules of evidence concerning expert testimony and the constitutional right of confrontation to illustrate that our evidentiary rules and the Sixth Amendment are in harmony.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Under our common-law rules of evidence, the Commonwealth must establish five foundational requirements before expert testimony will be admitted in a criminal case: (1) that the expert testimony will assist the trier of fact, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 768 (2009); (2) that the witness is qualified as an expert in the relevant area of inquiry, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frangipane, </em>433 Mass. 527, 533 (2001); (3) that the expert\u2019s opinion is based on facts or data of a type reasonably relied on by experts to form opinions in the relevant field, see <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986); (4) that the process or theory underlying the opinion is reliable, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 26 (1994); and (5) that the process or theory is applied to the particular facts of the case in a reliable manner, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>445 Mass. 626, 648 (2005). See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 702, at 218-224 (2010). If a defendant contends that any of these foundational requirements is missing, the defendant may move in limine to prohibit the admission of the expert testimony and request a hearing. See <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Mer-rell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, supra. </em>Where the motion in limine challenges the reliability of the expert\u2019s opinion, the judge must perform the role of \u201cgatekeeper\u201d to ensure that the expert testimony meets a minimum standard of reliability. See <em>id. </em>If, as here, there is no motion in limine and no invocation of the judge\u2019s gatekeeper role, the expert\u2019s opinion may be admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Where a Commonwealth expert testifies to her own opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the opinion is not hearsay, because the declarant of the opinion is testifying at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 693 (2001) (\u201cHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d). Similarly, because the defendant may confront the declarant of the opinion through cross-examination, the defendant is not deprived of his right of confrontation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 635 (4th Cir. 2009), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 2128 (2010) (expert opinion \u201can original product that can be tested through cross-examination\u201d). However, if a Commonwealth expert on direct examination were to testify to the conclusion or opinion of a second, nontestifying expert, that conclusion or opinion would be inadmissible hearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>438 Mass. 142, 152 (2002), cert, denied, 538 U.S. 966 (2003) (because expert testimony \u201cwent to the fact of the test results obtained by someone else, it was hearsay\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>434 Mass. 839, 857 (2001) (\u201cexpert witness may not, on direct examination, present the specifics of hearsay information on which she has relied in reaching her opinion\u201d). If the conclusion or opinion of the non-testifying expert is testimonial, because a reasonable expert would anticipate that her findings would be available for use at trial, its admission would also violate the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, because the opinion of the second expert would not be subject to cross-examination. See <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527, 2532 (2009) (Melendez-Diaz). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 3 (2005), cert, denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006) (testimonial nature determined by \u201cwhether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting a crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Until our opinion in 1986 in <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra, </em>there was little risk that an expert would testify to inadmissible hearsay evidence in explaining the basis for her opinion, because the expert opinion had to be \u201cbased on either the expert\u2019s direct personal knowledge, on evidence already in the record or which the parties represent will be presented during the course of the trial, or on a combination of these sources.\u201d <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21, 32 (1979). When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>we expanded the permissible basis of an expert opinion to include \u201cfacts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion,\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 531, we prohibited the expert during her direct examination from informing the jury about the facts or data she considered that were not in evidence but that would be admissible with the right witness or proper foundation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 337-338 (2002). \u201cThe thrust of [our] rule is to leave inquiry regarding the basis of expert testimony to cross-examination . . . .\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 532, quoting Advisory Committee\u2019s Note on Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">This balance between the jury\u2019s need to learn the factual basis of an expert\u2019s opinion and the danger that the Commonwealth would use an expert\u2019s opinion to inform the jury of facts not in evidence was fashioned before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), and <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813 (2006), regarding the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, but it is consistent with the right of confrontation articulated in those opinions, even where the expert bases his opinion on testimonial evidence that is admissible but not admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 387-396 (2008). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>454 Mass. 721, 732-733 n.7 (2009) (in forensic science context, expert may rely on work of nontestifying analysts). Where the Commonwealth calls an expert witness, direct examination is limited to the expert\u2019s opinion and matters of which the expert has personal knowledge, such as her training and experience, and the protocols generally accepted in her field of expertise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 390-391. Only the defendant can open the door on cross-examination to testimony regarding the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion, which may invite the expert witness to testify to facts or data that may be admissible in evidence but have not yet been admitted in evidence, and that may be testimonial in nature. See <em>id. A </em>defendant, however, cannot reasonably claim that his right to confront the witnesses against him is violated by the admission of evidence that he elicits on cross-examination. Indeed, a defendant could reasonably claim a violation of that right only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>if he were denied the opportunity to elicit this information on cross-examination. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>Gudge not permitted to exclude questions on cross-examination \u201cdesigned to elicit the underpinnings of the expert\u2019s opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Applying these principles here, the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was not violated by the admission of Lynch\u2019s opinion, because he had a fair opportunity to confront Lynch as to the reasonable basis for that opinion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, supra </em>at 390 (\u201cfact that [testifying medical examiner\u2019s] expert opinion on the cause of [victim\u2019s] death was based, in large part, on findings made during the course of an autopsy that he did not perform does not infringe on [defendant\u2019s] right to confrontation concerning this issue\u201d). The defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, however, was violated by Lynch\u2019s testimony as to what they had found, which informed the jury that Delatore also shared that opinion, when Delatore\u2019s opinion was testimonial hearsay and Delatore was not subject to cross-examination. See <em>id. </em>at 392. The defendant\u2019s right of confrontation was also violated, as the Commonwealth concedes, by the admission in evidence of Lynch\u2019s testimony reciting Delatore\u2019s findings regarding the DNA testing, as well as the admission of the table prepared by Delatore showing the DNA characteristics of the four tested samples. See <em>id. </em>at 392-393.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The defendant, however, contends that the rules we have described, which approve the admission in evidence on direct examination of Lynch\u2019s opinion but not of Delatore\u2019s opinion or her findings or table, do not apply in this case for two reasons. First, he contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra, </em>should be understood to mean that the Commonwealth may not offer <em>any </em>opinion that is based on the results of tests conducted by a forensic analyst or examiner unless the analyst or examiner is available to testify at trial (or unless the analyst or examiner is shown to be unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her). We do not give so expansive an interpretation to the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the Supreme Court addressed whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated by the admission in evidence of certificates of analysis signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>by analysts at the State Laboratory Institute that declared that the substance examined contained cocaine. See <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 2531. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment does not permit the prosecution to prove its case via ex parte out-of-court affidavits,\u201d and concluded that the admission of the certificates against the defendant was error. <em>Id. </em>at 2542. In the context of expert testimony, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>stands simply for the proposition that, under the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, the Commonwealth may not offer an expert opinion in evidence unless the defendant has an opportunity to cross-examine the expert. <em>Id. </em>at 2535 (expert witnesses not exempt from coverage of confrontation clause). It did not address, and therefore did not decide, the quite different question whether under the Sixth Amendment the Commonwealth may proffer an expert on the chemical composition of cocaine to testify to her opinion as to whether the substance contained cocaine where she examined the test results but did not conduct the chemical tests herself. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>686 F. Supp. 2d 382, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (characterizing as \u201cadverted to but left open\u201d question whether, where \u201cexpert witness who takes the stand made the final determination as to the DNA match, and in so doing, relied on the results of tests performed by other members of the lab, does the failure to call the analysts who conducted the preliminary tests infringe the defendant\u2019s right under the Confrontation Clause?\u201d). Because <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>did not purport to alter the evidentiary rules governing expert testimony, we held shortly thereafter that a medical examiner may offer an expert opinion regarding a victim\u2019s cause of death and related matters based on autopsy results without having been present for or conducted the autopsy. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 762-763 (2009).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Second, the defendant contends that our evidentiary rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>should be altered where an expert\u2019s opinion is based on chemical analysis rather than autopsy findings. Implicit in this argument is that, where a forensic science has developed to the point that the analysis of data yields an objective opinion, such as with the forensic use of DNA, rather than a subjective opinion that depends on the experience and judgment of the examiner, the distinction between the opinion and the underlying fact finding evaporates, because the opinion inevitably follows from the underlying facts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We recognize that, where a DNA expert offers an opinion that a defendant (or victim) is included as a possible source of DNA, jurors who learn about the methodology of DNA forensic analysis from that expert may infer that the DNA profile of the defendant (or victim) matched exactly the DNA profile of the sample from the crime scene. The risk that a jury may infer facts not in evidence from an opinion that is admissible in evidence is not a reason to declare the latter inadmissible unless the unfair prejudice arising from the facts inferred substantially outweighs the probative weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>opinion. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>455 Mass. 840, 850 (2010) (expert testimony regarding DNA test results subject to balancing of probative value and unfair prejudice). We conclude that the balance here weighs heavily in favor of admission of the opinion, and that the objective nature of the science underlying DNA analysis strengthens the opinion\u2019s probative weight and diminishes the risk of <em>unfair </em>prejudice. We reject the perverse implication of the defendant\u2019s argument that, the better the science, the less admissible the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We also reject the premise that, in DNA analysis, there is no meaningful distinction between the opinion and the underlying fact finding. \u201cThe human genome sequence is almost exactly the same (99.9%) in all people.\u201d Human Genome Program, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Genomics and Its Impact on Science and Society: A 2008 Primer 3 (2008). Therefore, the mere fact that the characteristics of certain alleles of a defendant\u2019s DNA matches the characteristics of alleles of DNA found at a crime scene says almost nothing about the likelihood that the defendant was present at the crime scene unless the jury learn from an expert about the nature of the DNA profile used.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cEvidence of a match based on currently used testing processes is meaningless without evidence indicating the significance of the match.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 20 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, su</em>pra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosier, </em>425 Mass. 807, 813 (1997). Only an expert can testify to the likelihood that more than one person possesses a particular DNA profile, based on her knowledge of the alleles selected for the DNA profile and the mathematical probabilities that more than one person may possess the same characteristics of those alleles. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattel, supra </em>at 855, quoting <em>Peters </em>v. <em>State, </em>18 P.3d 1224, 1228 (Alaska Ct. App. 2001) (average juror has no knowledge of frequency of particular DNA profile).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The defendant also contends that, where the analyst who con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ducts the DNA tests does not testify, the defendant is disadvantaged because he cannot cross-examine the testing analyst regarding the possibility of mislabeling or mishandling of the DNA, or outright manipulation of data or fraud. This practical limitation on the scope of cross-examination exists whenever any expert relies on the results of tests, experiments, or observations conducted by another. Nevertheless, we have permitted experts to do exactly this since <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 532 (1986). For instance, a medical examiner who offers an opinion at trial as to the cause of death but who did not conduct the autopsy (or see a videotape or photographs of the autopsy) cannot be effectively cross-examined as to whether the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy fabricated or manipulated the data, or erred in labeling the entry wound as an exit wound, or in measuring the length or breadth of tissue damage. These same inherent limitations exist where a DNA analyst who did not conduct the testing offers an opinion as to the significance of the results. The only difference is that, with DNA analysis, the testing techniques are so reliable and the science so sound that fraud and errors in labeling or handling may be the <em>only </em>reasons why an opinion is flawed. See National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward 130 (2009) (because of reliability of forensic DNA analysis, \u201cabsent fraud or an error in labeling or handling, the probabilities of a false positive are quantifiable and often minuscule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Our common-law rules of evidence protect a defendant in various ways from the risk of inaccurate forensic analysis. Where there is reason to believe that evidence has been mislabeled or mishandled or that data have been fabricated or manipulated, a defendant may challenge the admissibility of an expert opinion relying on such evidence or data in a <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>hearing, because an opinion must rest on evidence or data that provide \u201ca permissible basis\u201d for an expert to formulate an opinion. <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 531. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>433 Mass. 654, 659 (2001) (to preserve objections to scientific reliability of laboratory\u2019s DNA testing kits and database for formulating statistical frequencies, defendant must file appropriate pretrial motion and request hearing). A defendant may also challenge the admissibility of an opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>where an expert relies solely on the conclusions of the testing analyst, without knowledge of the procedures employed by the testing analyst or the underlying data and evidence that are generally contained in worksheets, because a conclusory opinion alone may not be a permissible basis on which an expert may rest an opinion. Where an expert opinion survives a <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>challenge or where, as here, the defendant does not challenge the admissibility of the expert\u2019s opinion, the defendant may still, as here, cross-examine the testifying expert as to the risk of evidence being mishandled or mislabeled, or of data being fabricated or manipulated, and as to whether the expert\u2019s opinion is vulnerable to these risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The defendant in this case had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Lynch as to these risks. Lynch had trained Dela-tare, served as her supervisor, conducted a full technical review of her DNA reports regarding the testing that was performed and the results of testing, and signed her reports. While Lynch admitted that she did not observe Delatare perform the DNA testing, and therefore did not have personal knowledge of how Delatare conducted the testing, she was familiar with the protocols Delatare was taught to employ, Delatare\u2019s documentation of her work, and Delatare\u2019s work history.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Furthermore, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Lynch elicited that she had not performed the testing in the present case and that she therefore had \u201cno idea\u201d whether the results were accurate. In this sense, the defendant actually benefited from the absence of Delatare in that he could undermine Lynch\u2019s testimony by showing that she could not be sure there were no flaws in Delatare\u2019s work without establishing that there were any actual flaws. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>512 F.3d 359, 361 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 129 S. Ct. 40 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Having concluded that it was error to admit in evidence Lynch\u2019s testimony regarding Delatore\u2019s opinion and factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>findings, and the table summarizing those factual findings, we turn to the question whether these errors require a new trial where Lynch\u2019s opinion was properly admitted. The defendant did not object to the admission of this testimony or otherwise preserve his claim of error, so the error must be examined under the miscarriage of justice standard.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 763 (2009) (unpreserved error on Sixth Amendment grounds reviewed for substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice). In examining whether an unpreserved error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, we consider the totality of evidence admitted at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 395 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>450 Mass. 736, 750 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The defendant is correct that the DNA evidence was particularly harmful to his defense of misidentification. The most probative aspect of this evidence, however, was Lynch\u2019s opinion that Serret was included as a possible source of the bloodstain on the defendant\u2019s boot and pant leg, and that the likelihood that someone other than Serret was a source was infinitesimal. We allow expert testimony in the realm of DNA evidence specifically because it is the type of \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized\u201d field that \u201clies outside of common experience.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 702 &amp; Note at 217, 220 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 576,581 (1998). Without Lynch\u2019s expert interpretation and analysis, neither the admission of the results table in evidence nor Lynch\u2019s description of the information contained in it was particularly meaningful. Having considered Lynch\u2019s opinion, which defense counsel ably cross-examined, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the other overwhelming evidence against the defendant, we conclude that no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice resulted from the improper admission of Delatore\u2019s results table, or Lynch\u2019s testimony regarding Delatore\u2019s results and opinion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>404 Mass. 256, 260 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>398 Mass. 641, 655 (1986) (where \u201cevidence of guilt . . . was overwhelming,\u201d no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\"><em>Prior bad act evidence. </em>The defendant next challenges the introduction of Carbuccia\u2019s testimony that he and Serret witnessed the defendant kill another man roughly two weeks before the defendant allegedly shot them. Prior to trial, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude this \u201cprior bad act\u201d evidence as unfairly prejudicial. The judge conducted a voir dire of Carbuccia and determined that he could give limited testimony regarding the prior shooting because it was probative of motive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When Carbuccia testified before the jury, defense counsel objected on the same grounds as the motion in limine, and the objection was overruled in light of the judge\u2019s earlier ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">\u201cIt is long established that evidence of uncharged criminal acts or other misbehavior is not admissible to show a defendant\u2019s bad character or propensity to commit the charged crime, but may be admissible if relevant for other purposes such as \u2018common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent or motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 128 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 366 (2001). See Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 404 (b), at 46-47. The rule against prior bad act evidence reflects the \u201cinherent danger\u201d that the jury will assume that, because the defendant has \u201cpreviously misbehaved, indictably or not,\u201d he must have committed the crime charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 529, 530 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>396 Mass. 202, 206 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 356, cert, denied, 519 U.S. 1045 (1996). However, unless the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>may be admissible for a permissible purpose, such as to prove that a defendant had a motive to commit the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>450 Mass. 794, 815-816, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Mooltrey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 399 (2008). We review the decision of the judge to admit evidence of a prior bad act to establish the defendant\u2019s motive under the abuse of discretion standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>454 Mass. 135, 143 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The judge did not abuse her discretion. The record reflects that she appropriately balanced the probative weight of the evidence with the risk of unfair prejudice, and prudently determined that the prior bad act evidence was admissible for a limited purpose only. The evidence that Serret and Carbuccia had witnessed the defendant shoot someone else was not introduced to show the defendant\u2019s bad character, but to explain why the defendant would decide to shoot Serret and Carbuccia two weeks later. Without this evidence of motive, the shootings of Serret and Carbuccia might have appeared to the jury \u201cessentially inexplicable act[s] of violence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>441 Mass. 459, 464 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269 (1982). From Carbuccia\u2019s testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant was aware that Serret and Carbuccia had witnessed the September 21 shooting, that he was so concerned they would reveal his involvement to the police that he telephoned Serret thirty-seven times between September 23 and September 27, and that he ultimately decided that the only way to ensure their silence was to kill them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65,79-80 (1986) (evidence that victim was eyewitness to defendant\u2019s involvement in earlier murder admissible to show defendant\u2019s motive). We conclude that the judge did not err in admitting the prior bad act evidence as probative of motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In response to a request by defense counsel, the judge gave a strong instruction regarding the limited purpose for which the jury could use the prior bad act evidence, both after Carbuccia\u2019s testimony and again in her final instructions to the jury after the closing arguments.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This instruction was taken virtually verbatim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>from defense counsel\u2019s request, and counsel did not object either time it was given.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant now argues that the instruction constituted reversible error because the judge did not explicitly state that the jury must believe that the prior shooting occurred before they could use the evidence for the limited purpose of showing motive.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because the defendant did not object to the instruction at trial, we review the omission to determine whether it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>456 Mass. 198, 205 n.14 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">We are not persuaded that the instruction now claimed to be essential by the defendant would have told the jury anything they did not know. If the jury did not believe that the September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>21 shooting occurred, they would not have relied on the evidence of the September 21 shooting to establish motive.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The defendant claims that, by failing to give this instruction, the judge invaded the province of the jury to determine the weight and credibility of the prior bad act evidence. We disagree. The judge did not suggest to the jury in her limiting instruction that she believed the defendant had committed the prior bad act or that the jury need not assess the weight and credibility of Carbuccia\u2019s testimony regarding the alleged prior shooting. Not only, in the first sentence of her limiting instruction, did she refer to an alleged prior shooting \u201callegedly done by [the defendant],\u201d but she added in the final sentence of the instruction that the jury \u201cmust be satisfied as to the accuracy of the identification of [the defendant] as the perpetrator of that shooting before you may consider this evidence at all.\u201d This final sentence alone sufficed to ensure that the jury would first decide whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>they believed the prior bad act evidence before they inferred motive based on it. Because there was no error, we need not consider whether it created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><em>Serret\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that Serret and Carbuccia said they \u201csaw something.\u201d </em>Serret\u2019s mother testified that, on \u201croughly\u201d the night of September 21, 2004, Serret and Carbuc-cia came to her house. The prosecutor asked her whether she remembered them telling her \u201cthat they saw something that night.\u201d Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, she answered simply, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant argues that this evidence was inadmissible. We conclude that the evidence was admissible as a prior consistent statement by Carbuccia.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Generally, a prior statement by a witness that is consistent with his trial testimony is inadmissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>449 Mass. 84, 93 (2007). However, if a witness is impeached on cross-examination by a claim of recent contrivance or inducement, a statement that he made before he had an incentive to fabricate his testimony may be admitted. See <em>id. </em>See generally Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 613 (b), at 201-202, 205-206. It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to determine whether a claim of recent contrivance exists and whether to admit the witness\u2019s prior consistent statement \u201cwhen he has been <em>or will be impeached </em>with an inconsistent statement\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, </em>376 Mass. 720, 723 (1978), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, </em>370 Mass. 23, 27 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">At trial, Serret\u2019s mother testified before Carbuccia took the stand. Nonetheless, it was clear from defense counsel\u2019s opening statement that he planned to impeach Carbuccia with the prior statement that he made to the police and grand jury shortly after October 6 in which he denied having seen the September 21 shooting.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It was also clear that defense counsel intended to suggest that Carbuccia developed a motive to he on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the financial and housing assistance he received from the district attorney\u2019s office.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In a similar case, we held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the judge to allow two witnesses to testify to their earlier consistent statements where \u201c[djefense counsel made plain in his opening statement that he would attack the credibility of the witnesses, and on cross-examination did impeach them . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 100 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 397 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, supra </em>(witness made number of inconsistent statements in past and subsequently entered plea agreement, making claim of recent contrivance \u201cunavoidable\u201d or \u201cinevitable\u201d). That a prior consistent statement is introduced before defense counsel has an opportunity to impeach the witness is \u201cnot, however, determinative\u201d of whether that statement may be properly admitted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>437 Mass. 487, 497 (2002). Because it was obvious here that defense counsel would impeach Carbuccia on cross-examination regarding the September 21 shooting, the judge had \u201cwide discretion\u201d to admit Carbuccia\u2019s prior consistent statement to Serret\u2019s mother on September 21 that he and Serret \u201csaw something\u201d earlier that evening. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The defendant did not request and the judge did not give a limiting instruction informing the jury that they may consider this testimony only in evaluating whether Carbuccia\u2019s testimony at trial regarding the September 21 shooting was recently contrived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>(defendant entitled, on request, to limiting instruction). The judge\u2019s failure to give such an instruction sua sponte did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>Unequivocal, post-Miranda denials of guilt. </em>Detective Harris interviewed the defendant at the Boston police headquarters on the night of his arrest. He read the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant initialed and signed a form saying that he had been advised of his rights. On direct examination at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>trial, Detective Harris testified that during the interrogation the defendant denied the accusations against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201cI told him that the sewer was currently being searched and I asked him to tell me what happened. I said: \u2018Were you involved in something that occurred up there?\u2019 He told me, he continuously and repeatedly denied throwing anything in the sewer and having anything to do with that. I then went on to tell him that there were two people shot in that particular neighborhood and I essentially was asking him what happened, was he in a fight? That he\u2019ll feel better if he can get it off his chest, tell me what occurred up in that area. Again, he denied any involvement in the shooting and he denied any involvement whatsoever with throwing anything into the sewer.\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Defense counsel did not object to this testimony at trial. On appeal, the defendant argues that his unequivocal, post-Miranda denials of guilt should have been excluded. The Commonwealth concedes the error but asserts that it did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Womack, ante </em>268, 276 (2010), we recognized that, where a defendant\u2019s general denial of an accusation is admitted in evidence in error, \u201c[t]he core of any prejudice is more likely caused by admission of the accusation]] than the denial]],\u201d because a detailed accusation improperly puts in evidence the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the facts, whereas it is \u201cgenerally of great value\u201d to a defendant for a jury \u201cto hear evidence of his prompt, clear, and emphatic denial]] without his having to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Detective Harris\u2019s statements and the defendant\u2019s denials were inadmissible hearsay, but their introduction in evidence did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Detective Harris\u2019s questioning of the defendant was more inquisitive than inquisitory. The facts of the case that his questions conveyed \u2014 two people were shot, and a search of the sewer occurred \u2014 were cumulative of other evidence and were stated only briefly and in general terms. See <em>id. </em>at 275. The defendant\u2019s denials actually supported and were consistent with his defense that he was misidentified as a suspect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>453 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>266, 274 (2009) (\u201cpremise of the defense was misidentification; evidence of the defendant\u2019s denial did not harm the defendant\u2019s case in this regard\u201d). It is perhaps for this reason that defense counsel did not object, did not move to strike the testimony, and did not seek a curative instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kir-wan, </em>448 Mass. 304, 315 (2007) (where \u201cerror was, in a sense, invited . . . rather than creating a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, it benefited the defendant\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">DiGiambattista <em>instruction. </em>Detective Harris\u2019s interrogation of the defendant was not tape recorded. Prior to the final charge conference, defense counsel requested that a jury instruction based on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423 (2004) (DiGiambattista), be given. In <em>DiGiambattista, </em>we held pursuant to our supervisory powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">\u201c[W]hen the prosecution introduces evidence of a defendant\u2019s confession or statement that is the product of a custodial interrogation or an interrogation conducted at a place of detention (e.g., a police station), and there is not at least an audiotape recording of the complete interrogation, the defendant is entitled (on request) to a jury instruction advising that the State\u2019s highest court has expressed a preference that such interrogations be recorded whenever practicable, and cautioning the jury that, because of the absence of any recording of the interrogation in the case before them, they should weigh evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged statement with great caution and care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 447-448.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s request, the judge said she would instruct the jury to exercise \u201cgreat caution and care\u201d in weighing the interrogation evidence, but would not say that \u201cthe State\u2019s highest court has expressed a preference\u201d for tape-recorded interviews. In her charge to the jury, the judge instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u201c[I]n this case, you have heard some evidence that the police allegedly interrogated the defendant at police department headquarters on October 6, 2004, and that that alleged interrogation was not tape recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">\u201cLet me inform you, ladies and gentlemen, that because of the absence of any recording of the interrogation in this case, you should weigh that evidence with great caution and care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">At the conclusion of the charge, defense counsel objected and once more requested the full <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction. The judge declined to give it. On appeal, the defendant claims that the failure to give the complete instruction was prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 453 (2008), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994) (\u201cBecause the issue was properly preserved, we review to determine whether we can be certain that the improper instruction \u2018did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">We agree that the judge erred in giving only the second part of the requested instruction. <em>DiGiambattista </em>is clear that, where the defendant requests the instruction, the judge must tell the jury both that (1) the State\u2019s highest court prefers that custodial interrogations be tape recorded, whenever practicable, and (2) where there is not at least an audiotape recording of the complete interrogation, the jury should weigh the defendant\u2019s statements with great caution and care. We do not consider the first part of this instruction to be extraneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">While the instruction is mandatory, see <em>id. </em>at 448, we have not required that the precise language of the instruction be used, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyarsky, </em>452 Mass. 700, 710 (2008); nor do we do so now. The judge here, however, did not simply use different words to convey the same meaning. Her giving only one-half of the instruction denied the defendant his entitlement to the full instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">In the context of this case, however, the error was not prejudicial. The defendant\u2019s unrecorded statements were some of the weakest evidence against him. Most of what the defendant said was self-serving. The only statements he made that strengthened the prosecution\u2019s case were his shifting versions of whether he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>been coming from or going to the bar on Shirley Street, and whether he had been on Marshfield Street that night, as well as his claim that he ran from police because he believed he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest based on a motor vehicle violation, when he had no such warrants. We can be certain that the improper instruction did not influence the jury because, even if the jury had disregarded the defendant\u2019s statements entirely, we are convinced they would still have convicted the defendant based on other overwhelming evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\"><em>Autopsy photograph. </em>Finally, the defendant claims that the judge abused her discretion in admitting a redacted autopsy photograph of a portion of Serret\u2019s skull. The defendant argues that, because the medical examiner testified that the injuries to Serret\u2019s skull were sustained after the cessation of life, the extent of those injuries was irrelevant to whether the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty. The defendant asserts that, because it was not probative of a material issue in dispute, it was unfairly prejudicial to admit the photograph in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The photograph was relevant to the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty, because it indicated the amount of force applied and the extent of the injuries inflicted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 507 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>406 Mass. 397, 406-407 (1990). Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227 (1983), the jury may consider various factors in deciding whether a murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, including the \u201cextent of physical injuries, number of blows, manner and force with which delivered, instrument employed, and disproportion between the means needed to cause death and those employed.\u201d The photograph depicting a depressed skull fracture was highly probative of the extent of Serret\u2019s injuries, the number of blows he sustained, and the manner and force with which these blows were delivered, as well as the gross disproportion between the means needed to cause death and those employed. The fact that Serret\u2019s heart stopped beating before the blows were inflicted does not negate the relevance of these blows in determining whether the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty because the defendant may not have known that Serret was dead when he repeatedly struck him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>511-512 (evidence that defendant strangled and kicked baby boy after throwing him to floor relevant to theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty even if hitting floor alone caused death); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>438 Mass. 343, 354-355 (2003) (multiple stab wounds, including some inflicted after victim was already dead, gave jury \u201cample basis on which to conclude that the killing was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Where photographic evidence is relevant and properly authenticated, its admissibility is left to the discretion of the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Obershaw, </em>435 Mass. 794, 803 (2002). \u201cThis court has almost never ruled that it was error to admit photographs of crime scenes and homicide victims.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeSouza, </em>428 Mass. 667, 670 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>371 Mass. 563, 566 (1976) (reversing murder conviction because of prejudice arising from photographs showing postmortem mutilation of victim\u2019s body by dog, but declaring that \u201cwe have never, so far as we know, upset a verdict on this type of error, and this opinion is not to be taken to indicate that we are likely to do so again\u201d). There was no error here. The judge acted well within her discretion in deciding that the probative value of the photograph after it was substantially redacted to narrow the scope of the injuries it depicted outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\"><em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Having reviewed the entire record pursuant to our duty under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we address one final issue. During the individual voir dire to empanel the jury, the judge appeared to use a procedure by which the Commonwealth and the defendant alternated who went first in exercising a peremptory challenge. However, only a few times did the judge verbally indicate which party was first, and generally one of the parties would either offer that it was content or exercise a challenge without prompting by the judge. The defendant did not object to this procedure at trial or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>456 Mass. 490, 493-496 (2010), where a judge used essentially the same procedure in individual voir dire as here, we declared that \u201cnovel procedures, such as the one followed in this case, raise the possibility of prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-495 n.6. Yet, we concluded that, the use of the procedure in that case did not violate Rule 6 of the Rules of the Superior Court (LexisNexis 2008-2009), the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, or the United States Constitution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, supra </em>at 494-496. Likewise, here, the defendant was not denied the peremptory challenges to which he was procedurally entitled and thus \u201ccannot complain that he was prejudiced by the voir dire procedure or that it raises a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 496.
