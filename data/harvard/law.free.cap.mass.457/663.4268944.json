L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J (\u00a7 69J), approved the petition of Cape Wind Associates, LLC (Cape Wind), to build and operate two 115 kilovolt underground and undersea electric transmission cables or lines (transmission project, or transmission Unes) that would connect Cape Wind\u2019s proposed offshore wind-powered energy generating facility (wind farm) to the regional electric power grid. This court affirmed the siting board\u2019s decision. <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>Siting Bd., </em>448 Mass. 45, 56 (2006) <em>(Alliance I). </em>Actual construction of the transmission lines, however, requires additional permits, licenses, and approvals from a number of different State and local authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In 2007, the Cape Cod Commission (commission) denied Cape Wind\u2019s proposed development of regional impact (DRI); approval of the DRI by the commission was one of the required \u201capprovals\u201d for the transmission project. Soon thereafter, Cape Wind applied to the siting board pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69K (\u00a7 69K), for a \u201ccertificate of environmental impact and public interest\u201d (certificate, or \u00a7 69K certificate) that would constitute a \u201ccomposite\u201d of the \u201cindividual permits, approvals or authorizations which would otherwise be necessary for the construction and operation\u201d of the transmission project. <em>Id. </em>After conducting an adjudicatory proceeding, the siting board granted the requested certificate in May, 2009. Three of the interveners in the certificate proceeding appeal from the siting board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, and G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5: the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound (Alliance), the commission, and the town of Barnstable (Barnstable) (collectively, petitioners). They seek reversal of the decision, and also request that we declare invalid a regulation of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). We affirm the decision of the siting board and conclude that the challenged regulation is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Background.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cape Wind plans to construct a wind farm consisting of 130 wind turbine generators, each 440 feet tall, on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound, a location that is more than three miles from any Commonwealth coast and entirely in Federal waters. As a result, the wind farm itself requires only Federal permits. However, the transmission lines at issue in this case, which Cape Wind proposes to build to connect the wind farm to the regional power grid, will pass under Massachusetts territorial waters in Lewis Bay and Nantucket Sound for approximately six miles and therefore require State and local permits, licenses, and approvals for their construction and operation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>transmission lines \u2014 two cables, each comprised of three copper conductors and one fiber optic cable bundled together \u2014 will carry electricity across an approximately 18.4 mile route, running under the seabed through Nantucket Sound and Lewis Bay for 12.5 miles, coming ashore in the town of Yarmouth (Yarmouth), and continuing underground for 5.9 miles through Yarmouth and Barnstable to an existing switching station in Barnstable.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Cape Wind\u2019s efforts to secure the necessary Federal and, of greater significance here, State and local regulatory approvals for its wind farm and transmission project have a lengthy history. In November, 2001, Cape Wind began to seek the permits required for the transmission project by fifing an expanded environmental notification form (ENF) with the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA). The filing set in motion a joint review by the EOEEA under the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Act (MEPA),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by the commission under \u00a7 12 (i) of St. 1989, c. 716, \u201cAn Act establishing the Cape Cod commission\u201d (Cape Cod Act). Cape Wind stated in the ENF that it sought a DRI approval from the commission. After holding a public hearing, the Secretary of the EOEEA determined that the transmission project would require Cape Wind to file an environmental impact report (EIR) in order to comply with MEPA, and outlined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the scope of the joint DRI-EER review. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the EOEEA, the commission held public hearings and submitted comment letters to provide input for the MEPA review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u201cBecause MEPA (like the Cape Cod Commission Act) is the product of state law, not federal law, MEPA review (and by extension Cape Cod Commission review) applies only to those portions of the project that are located within Massachusetts, including its territorial waters (generally within three nautical miles of the low water mark of the shore). The proposed [wind farm] is located outside of Massachusetts and, therefore, is not subject to state regulatory requirements. There is one notable exception . . . federal law (pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act) specifically delegates review authority over projects in federal waters to the Coastal Zone Management Office of the adjacent coastal state . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>In 2002, Cape Wind sought permission from the siting board pursuant to \u00a7 69J, to construct the transmission lines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cThe approval of the [siting] board is required prior to the commencement of construction of any \u2018facility\u2019[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] ... in the Commonwealth, and no State agency may issue a construction permit for any such facility unless the petition to construct the facility has already received approval from the [siting] board.\u201d <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 46-47, citing \u00a7 69J. Following a three-year review, the siting board approved construction of the transmission line facility under \u00a7 69J in 2005,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a decision this court affirmed in 2006. See <em>id. </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>In March, 2007, the Secretary of the EOEEA issued a final environmental impact report, finding the transmission project in compliance with MEPA. Cape Wind then renewed its efforts to obtain DRI approval from the commission. In deciding whether to grant such approval under the Cape Cod Act, St. 1989, c. 716, the commission assesses whether a project complies with minimum performance standards (MPS) set forth in its regional policy plan (RPP), a county ordinance enacted under the Barn-stable County Home Rule Charter. St. 1988, c. 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">In its review of Cape Wind\u2019s DRI application, the commission first deemed it incomplete for failure to include certain engineering plans and proof of control of the property along the transmission line route. Nevertheless, the commission held three days of public hearings in May, 2007, and after receiving additional information from Cape Wind, found the application complete as of August 3, 2007. The commission closed public hearings on August 8, 2007, triggering, under \u00a7 13 (a) of the Cape Cod Act, a sixty-day period for the commission to make a decision, in the absence of which Cape Wind\u2019s DRI application would receive constructive approval. The commission held additional public hearings in September, 2007, and sought still more information. At the commission\u2019s request, on September 11, 2007, Cape Wind agreed to extend the decision deadline to October 21, 2007, and provided responses to the specific information requests. On October 18, 2007, the commission denied the DRI application \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d on grounds that Cape Wind had not submitted the full body of information that it had sought and that Cape Wind would not agree to another extension of the decision deadline.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Cape Wind did not appeal from the DRI decision, but in November, 2007, filed an initial petition with the siting board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>to obtain a \u00a7 69K certificate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.00 (1993). As previously indicated, such a certificate, if issued, serves as \u201ca composite of all individual permits, approvals or authorizations which would otherwise be necessary for the construction and operation of the facility.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69K. Cape Wind requested that the certificate include the equivalent of the necessary DRI approval by the commission, and eight additional State and local permits. Among the eight was a tidelands license under G. L. c. 91 (c. 91); tidelands licenses are generally within the regulatory jurisdiction of DER See c. 91, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In December, 2007, Cape Wind filed a formal certificate application, which the siting board consolidated with Cape Wind\u2019s initial petition. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69L; 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 6.02, 6.03. The siting board granted intervener status to the five government entities with permits at issue \u2014 Barnstable, Yarmouth, DEP, the Executive Office of Transportation and Public Works, and the commission; and to three nonprofit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>organizations \u2014 Conservation Law Foundation, Clean Power Now, Inc., and the Alliance. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69N.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> From August through October, 2008, the parties conducted written discovery. Cape Wind, the commission, and DEP each submitted prefiled testimony of witnesses. Also before the siting board were 330 exhibits, consisting mainly of responses to information requests.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The siting board\u2019s presiding officer held two days of hearings, during which witnesses whose direct testimony had been prefiled were subject to cross-examination. The siting board issued a tentative decision on May 11, 2009, and then a final decision granting the certificate on May 21, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Each of the petitioners filed an appeal from the siting board\u2019s decision in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P, and G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. A single justice consolidated the petitioners\u2019 appeals, consolidated with them Barnstable\u2019s and the commission\u2019s appeal in an action Barnstable and the commission had brought against the siting board in the Superior Court,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and reserved and reported these appeals to this court, along with stipulations concerning claims for declaratory relief brought by the Alliance and Barnstable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We refer to additional facts from the siting board\u2019s administrative record where pertinent to the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>Each of the petitioners challenges the siting board\u2019s decision on several grounds, and the Alliance and Barn-stable separately challenge the validity of a DEP regulation relevant to that decision, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.12(2)(b)(10) (2008). We discuss first the challenges that may be described loosely as claims concerning aspects of the siting board\u2019s jurisdictional authority in this case; we then review the challenges that go to the validity of the siting board\u2019s decision. Finally, we consider the challenge to the DEP regulation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">A. <em>Jurisdictional authority claims. </em>1. <em>Authority to override a DRI decision by the commission. </em>The petitioners assert that the siting board had no jurisdiction under \u00a7 69K to grant the equivalent of an approval of Cape Wind\u2019s DRI, and thereby to override the commission\u2019s denial. We consider each of their arguments, and conclude that none has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">a. <em>Cape Cod Act. </em>Section 17 (b) of the Cape Cod Act states that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by a commission decision on a [DRI] may appeal the commission\u2019s decision to the Barnstable county superior court or the land court\u201d; \u00a7 17 <em>(d), </em>in turn, provides that \u201c[t]he foregoing remedy shall be exclusive.\u201d The petitioners take the position that the Cape Cod Act, enacted in 1989, controls as more specific and more recent legislation than the siting board\u2019s enabling statute, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G-69Q (siting board statute), originally enacted in 1973. Accordingly, in their view, \u00a7 17 <em>(d) </em>of the Cape Cod Act provides Cape Wind\u2019s exclusive avenue to challenge the commission\u2019s DRI denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>We presume that the Legislature acts with full knowledge of existing laws. <em>Suliveres </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>449 Mass. 112, 116 (2007). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 440-441 (2003). Thus, \u201c[w]hen construing two or more statutes together, \u2018[w]e are loath to find that a prior statute has been superseded in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or of clear implication.\u2019 <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>[382 Mass. 580, 585 (1981)]. \u2018The longstanding test for the principle of implied repeal is whether the prior statute is so repugnant to, and inconsistent with, the later enactment that both cannot stand. Only then is the former statute repealed.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 125 (1983).\u201d <em>Dedham Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dedham, </em>395 Mass. 510, 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Applying these principles here, we find no disabling inconsistency between the siting board statute and the Cape Cod Act. Rather, as the facts of these cases illustrate, the two statutes can be read together, giving meaning and purpose to both.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 725 (2005) (\u201cRather than mechanically applying the concept that the more \u2018recent\u2019 or more \u2018specific\u2019 statute . . . trumps the other, we should endeavor to harmonize the two statutes so that the policies underlying both may be honored\u201d). Under \u00a7 69L (A) (4) of the siting board statute, an applicant for a certificate must first try to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals from the relevant permitting agencies. Cape Wind followed this course with respect to its DRI, seeking the commission\u2019s approval in the first instance. Accordingly, the commission had the opportunity to review the transmission project under the relevant provisions of the Cape Cod Act and the commission\u2019s implementing regulations. When the commission exercised its authority to deny the DRI, the petitioners are correct that Cape Wind could have appealed under \u00a7 17 of the Cape Cod Act. However, the denial also triggered Cape Wind\u2019s independent right to seek a certificate from the siting board under \u00a7 69K,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a course that Cape Wind pursued. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>And \u00a7 69K directs that when the siting board issues a certificate, \u2018 \u2018 [n] otwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary . . <em>.no </em>state agency or local government shall impose or enforce any law, ordinance, by-law, rule or regulation nor take any action . . . which would delay or prevent the construction, operation or maintenance of such facility\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">As this review indicates, the two statutes can operate harmoniously together. The fact that \u00a7 69K authorizes the siting board to issue a certificate for a particular project that supersedes a commission decision under the Cape Cod Act does not thereby make the statutes inconsistent.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The commission\u2019s construction of the two statutes would have \u00a7 69K, and the siting board statute generally, apply everywhere in the Commonwealth except Barnstable County, a reading inconsistent with the siting board\u2019s responsibility \u201cto provide a reliable energy supply <em>for the commonwealth'\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H. See <em>City Council of Agawam </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>437 Mass. 821, 828 (2002) <em>(City Council of Agawam) </em>(\u201cthe intent and purpose of the [siting board] statute ... is in part to ensure that local boards do not use their power over licenses and permits to thwart the needs of the broader community for a reliable, affordable, and environmentally sound energy supply\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">b. <em>The commission as local agency or body. </em>The first paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>of \u00a7 69K authorizes an electric company to seek a certificate from the siting board if its proposed \u201cfacility cannot be constructed due to any disapprovals, conditions or denials by a state or <em>local agency or body </em>(emphasis added); the phrase \u201clocal agency or body\u201d is not defined. The section also uses the term \u201clocal government,\u201d which is defined in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69G, to mean, \u201cany political subdivision of the commonwealth, including any county, city, town, district agency or regional agency.\u201d The Cape Cod Act, in turn, states that the commission \u201cshall be the regional planning agency for Cape Cod\u201d and that it \u201cshall be an agency within the structure of [the] Barnstable county government.\u201d St. 1989, c. 716, \u00a7 3 (a). The petitioners contend that as defined or described in the Cape Cod Act, the commission qualifies as a \u201clocal government,\u201d but not as a \u201clocal agency or body\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 69K. Accordingly, they claim, the commission\u2019s denial of a DRI cannot properly serve as the basis for a petition to the siting board for a certificate. The argument fails. We agree with the siting board that when one reads \u00a7 69K as a whole, it is clear that the Legislature has used the term \u201clocal government,\u201d \u201clocal agency,\u201d and \u201clocal agency or body\u201d interchangeably.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And as we discuss later in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>another provision in \u00a7 69K, the siting board\u2019s interpretation is entitled to respect and deference. See <em>City Council of Agawam, </em>437 Mass, at 828. Moreover, the commission is defined in \u00a7 3 <em>(a) </em>of the Cape Cod Act as a \u201cregional\u201d agency within the structure of \u201ccounty government.\u201d As such, the commission is clearly a local (as opposed to State) agency, and therefore it qualifies as a \u201clocal agency or body\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 69K in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">2. <em>Authority to include the equivalent of a c. 91 tidelands license in a \u00a7 69K certificate. </em>The Alliance, joined by Barn-stable, claims that \u00a7 69K does not authorize the siting board to include in a certificate granted under that section any type of license relating to the Commonwealth\u2019s tidelands.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The argument is that these tidelands are both owned and held in trust by the Commonwealth to protect the public\u2019s rights in them, and that no one \u2014 including a State agency such as the siting board \u2014 may claim authority to act in connection with the tidelands unless granted express legislative authority to do so. The Alliance contends that \u00a7 69K contains no language of delegation or even mention of the tidelands or the public trust with which they are imbued, and therefore, the siting board cannot grant a certificate that incorporates, in effect, a c. 91 tidelands license.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The public trust doctrine expresses the government\u2019s longstanding and firmly established obligation to protect the public\u2019s interest in the tidelands and, in particular, to protect the public\u2019s right to use the tidelands \u201cfor, traditionally, fishing, fowling, and navigation.\u201d <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>448 Mass. 340, 342 (2007) <em>(Moot </em>I). See <em>Trio Algarvio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>440 Mass. 94, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>97 (2003); <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass. 194, 198 (2000) <em>(Fafard); Boston Waterfront Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 629, 632 (1979). There is no question that the Commonwealth tidelands through which Cape Wind\u2019s transmission lines will pass are held in the public trust to which the Alliance refers. We also agree with the Alliance that under the public trust doctrine, \u201conly the Commonwealth, or an entity to which the Legislature properly has delegated authority, may administer public trust rights.\u201d <em>Fafard, supra </em>at 199. See <em>id. </em>at 196. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>1 Pick. 180, 184-185 (1822). The question, then, is whether the Legislature in \u00a7 69K \u201cproperly has delegated authority,\u201d <em>Fafard, supra </em>at 199, to the siting board to exercise public trust rights. The answer requires examination of c. 91, the waterways statute administered by DEP, \u00a7 69K, and the statutory scheme of which \u00a7 69K is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Legislature has delegated to DEP the authority to license \u201cstructures\u201d in the Commonwealth\u2019s tidelands, provided that they \u201cserve a proper public purpose and that said purpose shall provide a greater public benefit than public detriment to the rights of the public in said lands.\u201d G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 14. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 18. In doing so, DEP is to \u201cprotect the interests of the Commonwealth\u201d in the tidelands. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2. Section 69K, in turn, grants authority to the siting board to issue a certificate in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 69K-690, which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201cshall be in the form of a composite of <em>all </em>individual permits, approvals or authorizations which would otherwise be necessary for the construction and operation of the facility[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>] and that portion of the certificate which relates to subject matters within the jurisdiction of a state or local agency shall be enforced by said agency under the applicable laws of the commonwealth as if it had been directly granted by the said agency\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>We read the quoted provision in \u00a7 69K as an express legislative directive to the siting board to stand in the shoes of any and all State and local agencies with permitting authority over a proposed \u201cfacility\u201d \u2014 that is, a directive to assume all the powers and obligations of such an agency with respect to the decision whether to grant the authorization that is within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction, with regulatory enforcement thereafter returned to that agency. DEP, as a State agency, is by definition included within the broad coverage of \u00a7 69K. There is no mention of public trust rights or obligations in \u00a7 69K, but there does not need to be. The Legislature has designated DEP as the agency charged with responsibility for protecting public trust rights in tidelands through the c. 91 licensing program, and where a tidelands license is necessary for a proposed facility, the Legislature has, in \u00a7 69K, expressly vested authority in the siting board to act in DEP\u2019s stead with respect to the initial permitting decision. Accordingly, an evaluation of \u00a7 69K\u2019s relationship to the public trust doctrine must take into account the fact that in a case such as this, \u00a7 69K operates as an overlay of c. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Other sections of the siting board statute support our reading of \u00a7 69K, most significantly, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 690 (\u00a7 690). That section specifies the issues on which the siting board must make findings in its decision whether or not to grant a \u00a7 69K certificate, and provides that the siting board must take into account whether the facility seeking the certificate will conform to the various laws, ordinances, and regulations that would otherwise govern it in the absence of a \u00a7 69K certificate. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 690 (3). See note 36, <em>infra, </em>where \u00a7 690 is quoted in full. One set of such laws is c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 14 and 18, with their requirement that DEP protect the public\u2019s interest in tidelands in issuing any license or permit pursuant to c. 91. Because \u00a7 69K delegates to the siting board both the power <em>and the obligation </em>to stand in the shoes of DEP, if DEP had not made the findings that the siting board adopted here,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the siting board would have had to undertake the same reviewing process that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>DEP did in evaluating Cape Wind\u2019s c. 91 tidelands license application.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In sum, we find in \u00a7 69K a sufficiently articulated legislative delegation of authority to the siting board to act in the place of DEP, and to administer the public trust rights within DEP\u2019s jurisdiction in the limited context of deciding whether to approve the equivalent of a c. 91 tidelands license.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>Fafard, </em>432 Mass, at 198-199, 207 (where there was <em>no </em>grant of authority by Legislature, local conservation commission could not exercise public trust rights, and bylaw purporting to do so was invalid). Contrast also <em>Moot I, </em>448 Mass, at 347-353.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, the siting board in this case did not exceed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>authority by including the equivalent of a c. 91 tidelands license in the certificate it granted Cape Wind.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we also reject the alternative argument advanced by the Alliance that focuses on the following language in the final clause of \u00a7 69K\u2019s first paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cThe [siting] board shall consider [a] petition providing: . . . the facility cannot be constructed due to any disapprovals, conditions or denials by a state or local agency or body, <em>except with respect to any lands or interests therein, excluding public ways, owned or managed by any state agency or local </em>government\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">According to the Alliance, the quoted \u201cexcept\u201d clause means that the siting board has no power whatsoever to take action with respect to a license or permit that an agency has disapproved, conditioned or denied if that license or permit pertains to \u201cpublic\u201d lands \u2014 that is, lands owned or managed by any State or local agency \u2014 including tidelands managed by DEP under c. 91. The siting board considered but disagreed with the Alliance\u2019s argument, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201cRead in context, the [\u2018except\u2019 clause] in [the first paragraph of \u00a7 ] 69K means that a petitioner may not rely upon a state agency or local government refusal with respect to public lands as a basis to file an <em>initial petition. </em>However, this language does not govern the <em>scope </em>of the Certificate, which is addressed in the [fifth] paragraph of [\u00a7 ] 69K, and which states that a Certificate takes the place of \u2018all\u2019 state or local permits\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">We accord substantial discretion to an agency to interpret the statute it is charged with enforcing, especially where, as here, see \u00a7 69H (1), the Legislature has authorized the agency to promulgate regulations. <em>City Council of Agawam, </em>437 Mass. at 828. See <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>514, 523 (2007) (Middleborough). The siting board\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause treats it as limiting only the types of permit denials that can serve as a basis for a company to petition for a \u00a7 69K certificate, but not as a limitation on the siting board\u2019s authority to review and potentially override that permit denial, if the company has an independent basis on which to file a certificate petition. As the siting board stated, the structure of \u00a7 69K supports this interpretation. The first paragraph of the section in which the \u201cexcept\u201d clause appears is devoted to listing the specific alternative bases that would justify the filing of a certificate petition, but does not discuss the scope or contents of the certificate itself. The fifth paragraph, however, does focus on contents, and describes the certificate as a \u201ccomposite of all individual permits\u201d otherwise required. While the meaning of the \u201cexcept\u201d clause is not entirely clear, the siting board\u2019s construction is reasonable, and we defer to it. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 50-51 n.6 (\u201cthe substantial deference owed to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is charged to enforce includes approving an interpretation of statutory language that may be read in two ways\u201d). See also <em>Middleborough, </em>449 Mass, at 523, and cases cited (\u201cWhere the statutory language is not without ambiguity . . . , our deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the governing statute is highest\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the except clause did not prohibit the siting board from considering and acting on Cape Wind\u2019s request for the equivalent of a c. 91 tideland license.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">3. <em>Jurisdiction to consider \u201cin-State impacts\u201d of the wind farm. </em>In its decision, the siting board adopted the presiding officer\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the \u201cin-State impacts\u201d of the wind farm itself due to the location of the wind farm in Federal waters, and therefore that the scope of the certificate proceeding would be limited to the transmission lines only and evidence concerning the wind farms\u2019s impacts would be excluded. See note 14, <em>supra. </em>The petitioners assert that no such jurisdictional limitation exists, and the siting board was obliged to assess the in-State impacts of the entire wind farm project in making its \u00a7 69K certificate decision.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">There is no dispute that the wind farm, located entirely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Federal waters, will lie outside the jurisdiction of the siting board as well as the State and local permitting agencies with permits at issue in the siting board\u2019s \u00a7 69K proceeding. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 48 (\u201cThe area in which the wind farm itself is proposed to be built is located in Federal waters and, thus, falls beyond the scope of the [siting] board\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d). The petitioners assert, however, that whether as a matter of making the findings required by \u00a7 690 or of complying with public trust doctrine obligations, the siting board had the power and the duty to consider the potential effects of the wind farm on the Commonwealth. The thrust of their claim appears to be that as a general tenet of environmental and perhaps all regulation of private development projects, regulatory agencies consider \u2014 and must consider \u2014 all direct and indirect impacts of the entire project; and because Cape Wind\u2019s transmission lines will connect directly to and service the wind farm, evaluation of the impacts of the wind farm itself was a mandatory part of the siting board\u2019s review of the transmission project. The claim fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">First, the siting board statute generally, and \u00a7\u00a7 69J, 69K, and 690 in particular, state with unmistakable clarity that the siting board\u2019s regulatory point of focus at all times is to be on the proposed \u201cfacility.\u201d The petitioners do not, and could not, dispute that Cape Wind\u2019s two new 115 kilovolt electric transmission lines constitute the only \u201cfacility\u201d subject to the siting board\u2019s review in this case. Accordingly, insofar as \u00a7 690 (2) directs the siting board to make findings relating to \u201cconsiderations of environmental protection, public health and public safety,\u201d those findings are solely to concern \u201cthe compatibility of <em>the facility\u201d </em>with such considerations (emphasis added).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Envtl. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 100, 112-115 &amp; n.13 (1991) (where Secretary of [then] EOEA had jurisdiction under MEPA to review private development project based on one necessary State \u201cpermit\u201d [grant of easement over bicycle path to construct bridge], MEPA review statutorily restricted to direct and indirect environmental impacts related to easement itself, not impacts of entire development project, even if bridge necessary for entire project to go forward).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The second reason the petitioners\u2019 bid for review of the wind farm\u2019s impacts fails is the one the siting board cites: the wind farm itself will be within Federal jurisdiction, and Federal jurisdiction in this area is paramount. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>420 U.S. 515, 522, 524 (1975) (\u201ccontrol and disposition [of all lands underlying sea] in the first instance are the business of the Federal Government rather than the States\u201d; \u201cparamount rights to the offshore seabed inhere in the Federal Government as an incident of national sovereignty\u201d); <em>Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group </em>v. <em>Cape Wind Assocs., LLC, </em>373 F.3d 183, 196-197 (1st Cir. 2004), cert, denied, 543 U.S. 1121 (2005) <em>(Ten Taxpayer Citizens) </em>(by enacting Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 [OCSLA], 43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 et seq., \u201cCongress retained for the federal government the exclusive power to authorize or prohibit specific uses of the seabed beyond three miles from shore\u201d); <em>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of the Army, </em>398 F.3d 105, 107-108 (1st Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Contrary to the Alliance\u2019s claim, the express assertion of exclusive Federal power and control over the outer continental shelf (defined in OCSLA as all submerged lands lying in navigable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>waters beyond three miles from shore, see 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331[a]), serves to preempt any attempt by the Commonwealth or its agencies to regulate structures or facilities placed in that area. See <em>Ten Taxpayer Citizens, supra </em>at 197 (\u201cIf adopted and enforced on the outer Continental Shelf, statutes like [c.] 91 . . . which require[s] the approval of state agencies prior to construction, would effectively grant state governments a veto power over the disposition of the national seabed,\u201d a result \u201cfundamentally inconsistent with the OSCLA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">If the siting board were to assert authority to consider the impacts of the wind farm itself, as the petitioners argue that it should, presumably that authority would encompass the power to deny or condition Cape Wind\u2019s requested certificate on account of such impacts. But a denial of the certificate on that ground, or even conditioning, would be tantamount to a denial of the wind farm project itself, because, as the siting board found in its \u00a7 69J decision approving construction of the transmission project in 2005, the transmission lines are necessary for the wind farm\u2019s operation. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 49-50, 55-56. The siting board does not have authority to do indirectly what it cannot do directly. See <em>Ten Taxpayer Citizens, supra. </em>Cf. <em>New England Legal Found, </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>883 F.2d 157, 174 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding defendant authority\u2019s landing fee regulations invalid under Federal law; fee regulations \u201cappear to be an attempt to modify conduct [e.g., control air traffic] rather than to recover operational cost, and are thus an incursion into an area of regulation preempted by [Federal law], [The authority] cannot do indirectly what it is forbidden to do directly\u201d). Contrast <em>Leisure Time Cruise Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnstable, </em>62 F. Supp. 2d 202, 208-209 (D. Mass. 1999) (where local and regional authorities sought to regulate aspects of actual docking of plaintiff\u2019s boat in Hyannis Harbor, this regulation was \u201cancillary to Leisure Time\u2019s operation of its gambling cruise\u201d in Federal waters, and not preempted under applicable Federal law). Contrast also <em>North Landers Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Falmouth, </em>382 Mass. 432, 436-438 (1981) (language of subdivision control statute, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, was clear in authorizing planning board to evaluate adequacy of public way outside proposed subdivision in ruling on subdivision plan); <em>Dupont </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 295 (1996) (under established principles of zoning law, defendant town of Dracut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>could prohibit plaintiff from using portion of single lot located partly in Dracut and partly in Lowell for use not permitted in Dracut zoning district but permitted in Lowell: \u201cWhether in the same or two different municipalities, if a lot is located in two different zoning districts, a town may prohibit the portion in one district from being used for an accessory use to serve a principal use not allowed in that district\u201d).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We emphasize that the siting board properly could, and did, consider the in-State impacts of the entire length of Cape Wind\u2019s transmission lines even though the lines will lie in part in Federal waters because those impacts relate <em>directly </em>to the \u201cfacility\u201d over which the siting board has jurisdiction. See <em>Leisure Time Cruise Corp. </em>v. <em>Barnstable, supra. </em>In doing so, the siting board met its public trust obligations arising from the fact that the facility under review is located in Commonwealth tidelands. Here, the siting board, through the presiding officer, allowed the testimony of the petitioners\u2019 witnesses so far as it pertained to the transmission project; the testimony deemed inadmissible related solely to the claimed impacts of the wind farm\u2019s turbines. See note 16, <em>supra. </em>The siting board\u2019s presiding officer did not abuse her discretion or commit other error of law by ruling that evidence related to general in-State impacts of the wind turbines, unconnected to the transmission project, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The wind farm, including its in-State impacts, has undergone extensive scrutiny by Federal and State agencies. In addition to the National Environmental Policy Act review by the Minerals Management Service, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>the Coastal Zone Management Office (CZM) has certified to Federal permitting authorities that Cape Wind\u2019s entire project, including the wind farm, will be consistent with CZM policies.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Moreover, the siting board has conditioned the certificate it granted Cape Wind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>for the transmission project on Cape Wind\u2019s receipt of all necessary Federal and State permits for the wind farm. In reviewing the siting board\u2019s decision under \u00a7 69J to authorize Cape Wind\u2019s construction of the transmission lines, this court approved of the siting board\u2019s determination that it was required to defer to Federal review. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 53-54. We do so again here.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">4. <em>Cape Wind\u2019s organizational status. </em>Section 69K provides that \u201c[a]ny electric . . . company which proposes to construct or operate facilities in the commonwealth may petition the siting board for a certificate.\u201d The term \u201celectric company\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1, as \u201ca corporation organized under the laws of the commonwealth for the purpose of making . . . selling, transmitting, distributing, transmitting and selling, or distributing and selling, electricity within the commonwealth.\u201d The commission argues that because a limited liability company is not a corporation, see G. L. c. 156C, \u00a7 2 (5); <em>CFM Buckley7 North, LLC </em>v. <em>Assessors of Greenfield, </em>453 Mass. 404, 407 (2009), Cape Wind does not qualify as an electric company as defined by \u00a7 1, and, thus, the siting board had no jurisdiction to entertain its certificate petition under \u00a7 69K. While questions of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>440 Mass. 147, 151 (2003); <em>Litton Business Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981), the commission has waived the issue by failing to raise it before the siting board. \u201cThe question at the heart of subject matter jurisdiction is, \u2018Has the Legislature empowered the [agency] to hear cases of a certain genre?\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3974 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., ante </em>53, 56-57 (2010) <em>(Doe No. 3974), </em>quoting <em>Wachovia Bank, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. 303, 316 (2006). See <em>Middleborough, </em>449 Mass, at 520, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed. 2004) (\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is \u2018jurisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought\u2019 \u201d). The Legislature has designated the siting board as the administrative authority empowered to hear and grant petitions for certificates or composite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>permits sought by entities who claim that actions by other permitting agencies are preventing or delaying their ability to move forward with energy projects. Whether a petitioning entity has a permissible organizational form is not a question of siting board subject matter jurisdiction but one that concerns a substantive element of the entity\u2019s prima facie case for relief. See <em>Middle-borough, supra </em>at 520-521. See also <em>Doe No. 3974, supra </em>at 57. Cf. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 516 (2006) (employer discrimination case under Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964; after judgment entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor, employer moved to dismiss for want of Federal subject matter jurisdiction, asserting for first time insufficient number of employees to be subject to Act; court rejected argument: \u201cthe threshold number of employees for application of Title VII is an element of a plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief, not a jurisdictional issue\u201d). Because the commission failed to raise the claim before the siting board \u2014 or indeed, at any point before its reply brief on appeal to this court, see <em>Assessors of Boston </em>v. <em>Ogden Suffolk Downs, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 604, 608 n.3 (1986) \u2014 it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">B. <em>Certificate decision. </em>We turn from issues regarding the scope of the siting board\u2019s \u00a7 69K certificate authority to the substance of its certificate decision. In that decision, the siting board found that Cape Wind satisfied the requirements set forth in \u00a7 690<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> by showing that the transmission project was (1) needed; (2) compatible with considerations of environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>protection, public health, and safety; (3) in conformance with State and local laws, except for limited aspects of the Cape Cod Act and the RPP, exemption from which was reasonable and consistent with the siting board\u2019s statutory mandate to provide a reliable energy supply with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost; and (4) required to serve the public interest and convenience. The siting board also found that Cape Wind had complied with G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69L (A) (4),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> by making a good faith effort to obtain the authorizations included in the certificate: the DRI approval, four local permits Cape Wind could not obtain without DRI approval,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and four State authorizations, three of which Cape Wind had already received.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">\u201c[A]n applicant for a certificate shall file with the [siting] board a petition . . . containing . . . : (4) A statement setting forth the need of the applicant for the certificate, which . . . shall include ... a representation as to the good faith effort made by the applicant to obtain from state agencies and local governments the licenses, permits and other regulatory approvals required by law for construction or operation of the facility . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The petitioners attack the substance of the certificate decision on multiple grounds.

L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">2. <em>Good faith effort. </em>First, the commission claims that Cape Wind did not make a good faith effort to obtain DRI approval and, thus, the siting board did not make its certificate decision in accordance with G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69L (A) (4) (quoted in note 37, <em>supra). </em>The commission contends that Cape Wind did not establish good faith because it delayed the production of any evidence concerning site control until shortly before the commission\u2019 s statutory deadline to close the public hearing, and then it agreed only to a two-week extension of the commission\u2019s deadline to make a DRI decision. The siting board rejected this argument, finding that Cape Wind did provide \u201csufficient information to the Commission ... to constitute a good faith effort.\u201d The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>reflects that Cape Wind participated in commission meetings and hearings, responded to specific requests for information, and provided the commission with the \u201cproof of ownership, proprietary interest or right to occupy (lease/easement) all landside locations along the proposed cable route\u201d that it requested, or explanations as to why it could not obtain such authorizations prior to receiving DRI approval. Additionally, Cape Wind agreed to extend the DRI decision deadline by two weeks even though the Cape Cod Act did not require it to give the commission additional time. See St. 1989, c. 716, \u00a7 13 (a) (\u201ctime limit may be extended <em>by mutual agreement </em>with the applicant\u201d [emphasis added]). We conclude that substantial evidence supports the siting board\u2019s finding that Cape Wind made a good faith effort to obtain DRI approval, and we defer to that finding.

Regs. \u00a7 6.03(1) (1993), by denying the commission\u2019s motion to limit the record before the siting board to the record before the commission during the DRI review process. The cited regulation states in relevant part that \u201c[w]hen adjudicatory findings of fact in the context of a final decision made by an agency . . . are challenged . . . review by the [siting board] of said findings shall be limited to the record presented before the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The siting board determined that this regulation did not apply because the commission did not conduct an adjudicatory hearing to review Cape Wind\u2019s DRI application. Although the commission held public hearings and heard public comments, it did not take formal testimony, permit cross-examination, or make credibility determinations. Cf. <em>School Comm. of Hudson </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>448 Mass. 565, 577 (2007) (\u201c[T]hat a public hearing was required . . . does not render the process . . . adjudicatory .... Under the statutory and regulatory scheme, the [siting] board is not required to take formal testimony, hear or cross-examine witnesses, or assess the credibility of witnesses or information submitted\u201d). We defer to the siting board\u2019s reasonable reading of 980 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.03(1). See <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Comm\u2019n, </em>428 Mass. 116, 120 (1998) (\u201cagency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to \u2018substantial deference\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>4. <em>Section 690 findings, </em>a. <em>Need and cost. </em>The petitioners all claim that the siting board failed to make certain findings required by \u00a7 690, rendering its decision in violation of statutory requirements and unsupported by substantial evidence. First, with respect to need and cost, as noted previously, \u00a7 690 (1) requires a finding of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cthe <em>need for the facility </em>to meet the energy requirements of the applicant\u2019s market area taking into account wholesale bulk power or gas sales or purchases or other co-operative arrangements with other utilities and energy policies as adopted by the commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">and \u00a7 690 (3) requires a finding with respect to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201c[t]he extent to which construction and operation of the facility will fail to conform with existing state and local laws, ordinances, by-laws, rules and regulations and reasonableness of exemption thereunder, if any, consistent with the implementation of the energy policies contained in this chapter to provide a <em>necessary energy supply </em>for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the <em>lowest possible </em>cost\u201d (emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">As to \u00a7 690 (1), the commission argues that the siting board heard no evidence of need for the project to meet the energy requirements of Cape Wind\u2019s market area; and that, rather than making findings of need and cost, the siting board \u201ctook the unprecedented position that construction of the [wind farm] conclusively establishes the \u2018need\u2019 for the [p]roject under \u00a7\u00a7 69J and 690.\u201d As to \u00a7 690 (3), the Alliance adds that the cost of energy supply encompasses more than just the cost of the transmission lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The siting board rejected the petitioners\u2019 argument that \u00a7 690 requires it to assess the need for and cost of the wind farm, as opposed to the transmission lines. The siting board reasoned that it could not include the wind farm in a need or cost assessment due to the wind farm\u2019s location in Federal waters and, even setting the preemption problem aside, because the 1997 Electric Restructuring Act amended G. L. c. 164 to eliminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>considerations of need with respect to generating facilities. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69JV4, inserted by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 210 (\u201cNothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the [siting] board to make findings regarding the need for, the cost of, or alternative sites for a generating facility . . .\u201d). See also G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 690V2, inserted by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 223 (setting forth findings required to support siting board decision on petition pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69KV2, for certificate of environmental impact and public interest for generating facility and including same requirements as \u00a7 690, but not requiring finding of need for the facility).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The siting board explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201cIt is not reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended to prohibit the [siting board] from directly assessing the need for generation facilities ... yet intended for the [siting board] to perform a \u2018backdoor,\u2019 indirect assessment of need for the generating facility when the [siting board] considers a [certificate for a transmission line. At the very least, the statute is ambiguous as to this issue, and the [s]iting [b]oard therefore exercises its discretion to interpret the statute in a manner that achieves the underlying purpose of the 1997 Electric Restructuring Act, which was to allow the marketplace, rather than a state regulatory body, to determine the need for generation facilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">This court has agreed with the siting board that the 1997 Electric Restructuring Act \u201cchanged the rules with respect to the manner in which the [siting] board evaluates the need for proposed energy facilities.\u201d <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 51. Given the 1997 amendments, we agreed that \u201cthe [siting] board could no longer consider ... the need for the generating facility that the proposed transmission lines would serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. We held that the siting board had discretion to announce a new approach, under which it considers \u201c(1) whether the \u2018existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>transmission system is inadequate to interconnect the new or expanded generator\u2019 and (2) whether the \u2018new or expanded generator is likely to be available to contribute to the regional energy supply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>If a generating facility lies outside the siting board\u2019s jurisdiction, a showing for purposes of the second consideration \u201c \u2018may be made on a case-by-case basis based on indicators of project progress (e.g., progress in permitting . . .).\u2019 This approach is particularly appropriate if the generating facility . . . is within the jurisdiction of the United States government, and Federal agencies will be making critical decisions about its permitting.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Applying this approach here, the siting board looked to findings it had made in its earlier decisions on the Cape Wind transmission project under \u00a7 69J and G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 72 (\u00a7 72), to the effect that Cape Wind had established that the existing transmission system was inadequate to support the wind farm and, thus, the transmission project was needed to contribute to the regional energy supply. Because these findings were based on the availability of the wind farm, the siting board conditioned its approval of the transmission project in its \u00a7 69J decision on Cape Wind\u2019s submission to the siting board of copies of all permits required to build the wind farm. See <em>Alliance I, </em>448 Mass, at 50, 54. As the record in the subsequent \u00a7 69K proceeding indicated no material changes with respect to the need for the transmission project, the siting board found that the project satisfied \u00a7 690 (1) and (3). We see no reason why this approach, upheld in the \u00a7 69J context, see <em>id., </em>should not apply as well in the \u00a7\u00a7 69K and 690 context. In sum, we defer to the siting board\u2019s reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 690.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">b. <em>Environmental impact. </em>The petitioners next argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>siting board made insufficient findings under \u00a7 690 (2) and (3) with respect to the environmental impact of the transmission project. Specifically, they claim that the siting board (a) failed to find that the project will have a <em>minimum </em>impact on the environment; (b) improperly relied on findings made in its \u00a7 69J decision; (c) erred in failing to require Cape Wind to conduct diver surveys of eelgrass locations along the entire transmission line route and provide additional core samples to demonstrate impacts of dredging; and (d) improperly excluded evidence of the wind farm\u2019s in-State impacts, separate from the transmission project. The claims must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">First, the commission\u2019s premise that the siting board must find the project will have a minimum impact on the environment is not correct. Section 690 (2) requires a finding with respect to the \u201ccompatibility of the facility with <em>considerations of environmental </em>protection,\u201d and \u00a7 690 (3) requires a finding that any exemption from conformance with State or local law be \u201cconsistent with the implementation of the energy policies contained in this chapter to provide <em>a necessary energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible </em>cost\u201d (emphases added). The siting board made both of these findings. Second, as stated (see note 42, <em>supra), </em>the siting board properly looked to findings it had made in its \u00a7\u00a7 69J and 72 decisions, including findings (in the \u00a7 69J decision) that \u201cthe proposed transmission lines were preferable to all alternatives with respect to environmental impacts\u201d and that conditions to which Cape Wind agreed relating to eelgrass, protected coastal shorebirds, navigation, traffic, and historic preservation would minimize the environmental impacts of the transmission project. Like \u00a7 690, \u00a7 69J requires the siting board to consider whether a proposed facility is \u201cconsistent with the policies stated in [\u00a7 69H],\u201d that is, \u201cto provide a reliable energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H. \u201c[Wjords used in one part of a statute to connote a particular meaning should be given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>same meaning in another part of the same statute,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>451 Mass. 517, 521 (2008), and we reject the contention that findings made in the \u00a7 69J context may have no bearing on \u00a7 690 findings. In any case, the siting board did not rely solely on its earlier decisions. It reexamined the environmental impacts of the transmission project in light of additional evidence that the parties presented during the certificate proceedings, which included the testimony of two Cape Wind experts, testimony of Alliance and commission witnesses, testimony from a DEP environmental analyst, and extensive documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The siting board focused its inquiry on three environmental concerns that the commission had cited in its .denial of Cape Wind\u2019s application for DRI approval: (1) general impacts of jet-plowing for transmission cable installation; (2) impacts of cable installation on eelgrass beds<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>; and (3) the proposed location of a transition vault connecting the submarine and upland transmission lines in a Federal Emergency Management Agency \u201cVelocity Zone\u201d (FEMA V-zone) and within one hundred feet of a coastal bank. The siting board found that it had given each issue extensive consideration in its prior decisions; each issue had also received a favorable review by DEP and by EOEEA in the MEPA process; and no information presented during the \u00a7 69K certificate proceedings called the siting board\u2019s earlier determinations into question. We defer to these findings, which are supported by substantial evidence in the record.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> See <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass, at 386, 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">As to jet-plowing, the commission had determined that this method of installation implicated minimum performance standard (MPS) 2.2.3.6, a standard set forth in the commission\u2019s RPP that prohibits new dredging unless needed to provide substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>public benefit and no feasible alternative exists. The commission had concluded that more core samples were necessary to determine the impact of jet-plowing on eelgrass and shellfish resources. Cape Wind had argued to the commission, and offered expert testimony to the siting board, that jet-plowing is necessary to install the transmission lines and has fewer environmental impacts than other installation methods. Witnesses further stated that Cape Wind had taken nineteen core samples in State waters to measure the impact of jet-plowing, a sample size deemed adequate by DEP and other permitting agencies. Cape Wind also pointed the siting board to monitoring and mitigation measures it has proposed to undertake. After assessing this issue in light of its earlier proceedings and the evidence adduced in the \u00a7 69K certificate proceedings, the siting board found jet-plowing consistent with considerations of environmental protection, a finding supported by substantial evidence. There was no error in the siting board\u2019s decision not to require Cape Wind to conduct additional core sampling.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As for eelgrass, in the DRI proceeding the commission had cited MPS <em>2.23.1, </em>which requires that development have \u201cno significant adverse direct or indirect effect on eelgrass beds, unless there is no feasible alternative and the project is necessary to accomplish a public benefit,\u201d and had asked Cape Wind to perform diver surveys of the entire transmission line route within State waters, in addition to the diver surveys Cape Wind had already conducted in Lewis Bay. The siting board did not find that eel-grass concerns made construction and operation of the transmission lines inconsistent with environmental protection. The siting board reasoned that Cape Wind had conducted side-scan sonar surveys of the entire transmission fine route, which according to Cape Wind experts reduced the potential for mapping errors, and had also conducted site-specific visual inspection by divers. The siting board also noted that Cape Wind has agreed to extensive monitoring and mitigation efforts to protect eelgrass, including additional diver surveys if additional eelgrass beds are identified. The findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Finally, with respect to the transmission vault, the commission had pointed to MPS 2.2.2.1, which prohibits development in a FEMA V-zone, an area subject to hundred year storms. While the commission permits construction of water-dependent structures in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>a FEMA V-zone absent a feasible alternative, it had determined in its decision that the vault did not meet the RPP definition of a \u201cwater-dependent use.\u201d The commission had also cited MPS 2.2. 2.4, which prohibits nonwater-dependent development within one hundred feet of a coastal bank. The commission had recommended that Cape Wind relocate the vault 225 feet landward to comply with both MPSs. The siting board, however, found that the costs of moving the vault \u2014 including increased noise, traffic, and reduced reliability \u2014 outweighed any benefits associated with avoiding the FEMA V-zone and coastal bank buffer. This finding also is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">c. <em>Conformance with existing law. </em>The petitioners make a related claim that the siting board made inadequate findings to satisfy the \u201creasonableness of exemption\u201d standard in \u00a7 690 (3). The Alliance and Barnstable argue that \u201creasonableness\u201d should be construed broadly to authorize and require review of the in-State impacts of Cape Wind\u2019s entire enterprise and to preclude the siting board from relying on earlier decisions in determining whether the standard was met. However, the term \u201creasonableness\u201d does not trump the exclusivity of Federal review over the wind farm itself, as earlier discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Additionally, the siting board properly relied on its findings in the \u00a7\u00a7 69J and 72 proceedings where \u00a7 690 (3) directs it to review reasonableness \u201cconsistent with the implementation of the energy policies contained in this chapter.\u201d See note 36, <em>supra. </em>The siting board fully addressed the reasonableness standard and articulated support for its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">C. <em>Water-dependent use regulation. </em>Finally, the Alliance challenges the validity of a regulation promulgated by DEP on October 3, 2008, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.12(2)(b)(10) (water-dependent use regulation, or regulation),<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> as contrary to DEP\u2019s relevant governing statutes, c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 14, and 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>violative of DEP\u2019s responsibilities under the public trust doctrine, and arbitrary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201c(2) [DEP] shall determine a use to be water-dependent upon a finding that said use requires direct access to or location in tidal or inland waters, and therefore cannot be located away from said waters. ...(b) [DEP] shall find to be water-dependent-industrial the following uses: ... 10. infrastructure facilities used to deliver electricity .. . services to the public from an offshore facility located outside the Commonwealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>We review briefly certain statutory and regulatory provisions pertinent to the Alliance\u2019s challenge. General Laws c. 91, \u00a7 2, directs DEP, in issuing licenses pursuant to that chapter, to \u201cprotect the interests of the commonwealth\u201d in the tidelands. Section 14 of c. 91 thereafter states that \u201c[ejxcept as provided in [c. 91, \u00a7 18, relating to nonwater-dependent uses], no structures or fill may be licensed on . . . commonwealth tidelands unless such structures or fill are necessary to accommodate a water dependent use; provided that for commonwealth tidelands said structures . . . shall also serve a proper public purpose and that said purpose shall provide a greater public benefit than public detriment to the rights of the public in said lands.\u201d To help implement this section, DEP promulgated 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.31(2)(a) (1996), a regulation that creates a rebuttable presumption that a \u201cwater-dependent use\u201d serves a proper public purpose that provides a greater benefit than detriment to the rights of the public.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In this case, based on the water-dependent use regulation, DEP deemed Cape Wind\u2019s proposed transmission lines water dependent and found nothing to rebut the proper public purpose presumption established by \u00a7 9.31(2)(a). The siting board incorporated this finding into its certificate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cA highly deferential standard of review governs a facial challenge to regulations promulgated by a government agency.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002).

It claims that the water-dependent use regulation violates the governing statute, c. 91, because c. 91, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cwater-dependent uses\u201d as \u201cthose uses and facilities which <em>require </em>direct access to, or location in, marine or tidal waters and which therefore cannot be located inland\u201d (emphasis added), and wind farms can be located inland. But the water-dependent use regulation applies solely to \u201cinfrastructure facilities used <em>to deliver </em>electricity . . . from an offshore facility\u201d (emphasis added), not to the offshore facility itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The premise underlying all the Alliance\u2019s challenges to the water-dependent use regulation is that c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 14, and 18, do not permit DEP to define as \u201cwater-dependent\u201d \u2014\u25a0 and thus presumptively serving a proper public purpose \u2014 any use of an infrastructure facility associated with a generating facility unless DEP also evaluates the impacts of the generating facility itself. Because the premise is flawed, the Alliance\u2019s claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">As we have discussed in relation to the siting board, if a generating facility is located offshore in Federal waters, a State agency such as DEP has no jurisdiction over the facility under c. 91 or otherwise, and is not in a position to assess its allegedly adverse impacts on the Commonwealth. But it is also obvious that if such a generating facility receives the necessary Federal permits and is constructed, an \u201cinfrastructure facility\u201d such as the transmission lines must have a \u201cdirect . . . location in . . . tidal waters,\u201d c. 91, \u00a7 1, in order to perform its function of delivering electricity.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Accordingly, it was rational for DEP to adopt a regulation that focuses solely on the infrastructure facility used to transmit electricity from the offshore and out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>jurisdiction generating facility, and it was rational for DEP to define such an infrastructure facility as \u201cwater-dependent.\u201d See <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Service Comm\u2019n, </em>447 Mass. 233, 254 (2006). The Alliance has not shown that the water-dependent use regulation is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to c. 91. The regulation\u2019s validity must be upheld.

DEP did not act on Cape Wind\u2019s 2004 application because the MEPA process had not yet been completed. On December 22, 2008, after public hearing, DEP issued a draft license and written determination that the proposed transmission project satisfied the requirements of G. L. c. 91 (c. 91). DEP found that the project, as infrastructure to be used to deliver electricity from an offshore facility outside the Commonwealth, qualified as a water-dependent industrial use of tidelands under 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.12(2)(b)(10). DEP further found that the \u201cproject serves a proper public purpose which provides greater public benefit than detriment to the public\u2019s rights in said tidelands\u201d and \u201cpreserves public rights of access to [the] tidelands for fishing, fowling, navigation and the natural derivatives thereof.\u201d DEP conditioned the draft license on receipt of all Federal, State, and local approvals, including State and local permits obtained in the form of a \u00a7 69K certificate. On January 9, 2009, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc.

Our understanding is supported by the fact that throughout \u00a7 69K in its original form, see St. 1973, c. 1232, \u00a7 1, and currently, the Legislature has consistently referred to permits of State and local agencies or local governments as a group (see \u00a7 69K, first, second, and fourth pars.), suggesting that the 1976 amendment was an attempt to correct this one nonconforming reference to \u201clocal governments\u201d only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Tidelands are a \u201cbroad but single category of the estuarine complex comprising the shore and submerged lands lying between mean high water and the seaward boundary of the Commonwealth.\u201d Final Report: A Study of the Law Pertaining to the Tidelands of Massachusetts, 1971 House Doc.

See <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl.

We do not read \u00a7 690 (3) as a delegation of authority to the siting board effectively to exempt a facility from otherwise applicable requirements of the public trust doctrine. Rather, in any case where public trust obligations are in play because a c. 91 tidelands license is at issue, those obligations must be fully met by the applicant seeking a certificate in the absence of further legislative action. Cf. <em>Moot I, supra </em>at 350, 352-353 (under public trust doctrine, DEP could not, without specific legislative authorization, adopt regulation exempting filled landlocked tidelands from c. 91\u2019s licensing requirements). Cf. also <em>Arno </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>434, 453 n.21 (2010) (land registration proceedings concerning plaintiff\u2019s parcel of filled tidelands could not have effect of relinquishing public trust rights in that parcel absent specific legislative authorization).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">While not directly bearing on the delegation question discussed in the text, additional sections of the siting board statute reflect the Legislature\u2019s interest in having DEP, the agency to which the Legislature generally has granted authority to issue such licenses, play a role in the siting board\u2019s decision where a c. 91 tidelands license is in issue. Thus, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69L and 69N, read together, define the \u201cparties in interest\u201d in any certificate proceeding to include, among others, any person or entity that the siting board permits to intervene. In the present case, DEP was an intervener in the \u00a7 69K proceeding concerning Cape Wind, and fully participated in that proceeding. Moreover, in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H, as amended through St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 37, the Legislature has designated the Secretary of EOEEA, the Executive Office in which DEP resides, as the chair of the siting board itself, and the commissioner of DEP as one of the siting board\u2019s nine members. We view these provisions as steps taken by the Legislature to facilitate the siting board\u2019s obligation to address DEP\u2019s statutory and regulatory mandate \u2014 including the protection of public trust rights \u2014 when, as in this case, they are implicated by a \u00a7 69K certificate application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In <em>Moot I, </em>448 Mass, at 347, 352-353, we held that DEP exceeded its authority under G.

See <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>456 Mass. 309, 310 (2010) <em>(Moot II). </em>Here, there has been no relinquishment or extinguishment of the public\u2019s rights in the tidelands at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We agree with the Chief Justice, see <em>post </em>at 703, that an express statement from the Legislature is necessary both to relinquish public rights in tidelands and to delegate authority to administer public trust rights and duties. See, e.g., <em>Arno </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 438 n.7, 453 n.21. The decisions of this court, however, have recognized a difference between a legislative delegation of authority to administer public trust rights and duties through regulation or use of tidelands subject to conditions, and a permanent relinquishment of the public\u2019s rights in tidelands. The latter can only happen where the Legislature has undertaken specific steps and made explicit findings to signal its intent to relinquish. Compare <em>Fafard, </em>432 Mass, at 199 n.10 (\u201cThe Commonwealth may delegate, and has delegated, its authority to preserve and regulate Commonwealth tidelands to State agencies or municipalities\u201d), and <em>Boston Waterfront Dev.

Cf. <em>Moot II, supra </em>at 313-315 (legislation enacted after <em>Moot I </em>did not relinquish public rights in landlocked tidelands but permissibly exempted them from c. 91 licensing scheme; court therefore rejected plaintiffs\u2019 claim that legislation exceeded Legislature\u2019s authority by effectively extinguishing public trust rights without explicit findings required by <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra). </em>While it is clear from our case law what steps the Legislature must take to relinquish the public\u2019s rights in tidelands, see <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra, </em>our cases addressing delegation of authority to regulate tidelands, and in doing so to administer public trust rights and duties, have said only that such delegation must be express. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>1 Pick. 180, 184-185 (1822). And the statutory provisions effecting this type of delegation have generally been broadly phrased, offering few specific directives to the designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>agency or official on how to exercise the authority given them. See <em>Fafard, supra, </em>and statutes cited. As we have discussed, our view is that in \u00a7 69K, the Legislature has expressly delegated to the siting board the authority to grant a revocable c. 91 license to use the tidelands at issue, and encompassed in that delegation is the authority, and obligation, to administer public trust rights and duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The petitioners mention, in particular, impacts of the wind farm\u2019s turbine generators on \u201cstate waters, air space, lands, and public safety,\u201d alleging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the wind farm will cause harm to navigation, aviation, fisheries, birds, and water quality, as well as create an increased set of risks relating to public safety and environmental damage that a town such as Barnstable will be forced to confront.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">This point is reinforced by the fact that since the passage of the 1997 Restructuring Act, St. 1997, c. 164, which amended the siting board statute in several respects, the Legislature has mandated that a proposed \u201cgenerating facility\u201d (a term that describes the wind farm) be reviewed by the siting board separately from a \u201cfacility\u201d (the term that describes the transmission lines).

The development of clean energy resources is an important national and State policy. The offshore wind-powered energy generating facility (wind farm) that Cape Wind, LLC (Cape Wind), proposes to construct in Nantucket Sound may further that policy by providing clean energy for the Commonwealth. It is not our role, however, to evaluate whether as a matter of sound policy the project should be constructed. Rather, we must determine whether the approval process of the Cape Wind project comports with the laws of the Commonwealth. It does not. Today\u2019s decision that the \u201ccertificate of environmental impact and public interest\u201d (certificate), G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69K (\u00a7 69K), issued by the Energy Facilities Siting Board (siting board) was proper is contrary to existing law and seriously undermines the public trust doctrine, which for centuries has protected the rights of the people of Massachusetts in Commonwealth tidelands.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The court concludes that the <em>Commonwealth </em>has fulfilled its fiduciary obligation to the people of Massachusetts because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>siting board </em>has issued a certificate to Cape Wind under \u00a7 69K authorizing transmission cables to traverse Commonwealth tidelands. See <em>ante </em>at 679-681. The siting board, however, does not have, and was not intended by the Legislature to have, the right to act as fiduciary on behalf of the people with regard to Commonwealth tidelands or to approve energy projects up and down the coastline of Massachusetts in Commonwealth tidelands. It may be that the Legislature or the Legislature\u2019s expressly authorized designee, exercising its responsibility as fiduciary, would conclude that transmission cables stretching across Commonwealth tidelands from the shore to the Commonwealth\u2019s seaward boundary should be approved. But that authorization has not occurred. The court\u2019s ruling to the contrary establishes a dangerous and unwise precedent, which has far-reaching consequences. A wind farm today may be a drilling rig or nuclear power plant tomorrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The court also concludes that the siting board acted appropriately by granting the certificate without considering <em>any </em>of the in-State impacts of the wind farm. See <em>ante </em>at 686-687. Centuries of legislation and jurisprudence concerning the paramount rights of the people of the Commonwealth to the use of the sea and shore lead me to disagree. The stakes are high. As we have recently seen in the Gulf of Mexico, the failure to take into account in-State consequences of federally authorized energy projects in Federal waters can have catastrophic effects on State tidelands and coastal areas, and on all who depend on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The public trust doctrine stands as a covenant between the people of the Commonwealth and their government, a covenant to safeguard our tidelands for all generations for the use of the people, traditionally for fishing, fowling, and navigation. See <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>448 Mass. 340, 342 (2007) <em>(Moot 1); Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass. 194, 198 (2000) <em>(Fafard), </em>and cases cited. The doctrine, and with it the public\u2019s trust in government, once undermined is not easily restored. The court\u2019s judgment, I fear, is a step in the wrong direction. I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The court acknowledges, as it must, that only the Commonwealth, or an entity to which the Legislature \u201cproperly has delegated authority,\u201d may administer public trust rights. <em>Ante </em>at 677, quoting <em>Fafard, supra </em>at 199. I cannot agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature has delegated such authority to the siting board. In <em>Fafard, supra </em>at 197, we once again made clear that only the Commonwealth or an \u201centity to which the Commonwealth has delegated authority <em>expressly\u201d </em>may administer public trust rights (emphasis added). Accord <em>Moot I, supra </em>at 347 (same). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>1 Pick. 180, 185 (1822) (Legislature may \u201cdelegate\u201d power under public trust doctrine to authorize construction of bridge over navigable waterway, \u201cbut, until they have made such delegation in <em>express </em>terms, it is a branch of sovereign power to be exercised by the [L]egislature alone\u201d [emphasis added]). The siting board\u2019s enabling legislation provides for no such express delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The requirement that any delegation by the Legislature of authority to administer public trust rights be \u201cexpress\u201d is rooted in the \u201chistory of the origins of the Commonwealth\u2019s public trust obligations and authority, as well as jurisprudence and legislation spanning two centuries.\u201d <em>Fafard, supra </em>at 199. That history, jurisprudence, and legislation has been recounted frequently and at length elsewhere. See, e.g., <em>Arno </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>434, 449-453 (2010) <em>(Amo)\\ Boston Waterfront Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 629, 631-649 (1979). Briefly, as protector of the public trust, the Commonwealth sits \u201cin a fiduciary relation\u201d to the people. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rox-bury, 9 </em>Gray 451, 492 (1857). Commonwealth tidelands are \u201cimpressed with a public trust, which gives the public\u2019s representatives an interest and responsibility\u201d in their development. <em>Boston Waterfront Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 649. See <em>Trio Algarvio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>440 Mass. 94, 97 (2003) (Legislature has \u201cobligation to protect the public\u2019s interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The Commonwealth may delegate, and of course has delegated, the responsibility, or some of it, to administer its tidelands to a State agency. See <em>Moot I, supra, </em>and cases cited. As noted, that delegation, when it occurs, must be explicit. Thus, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>G. L. c. 91, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) may issue licenses for the construction of structures \u201cin or over tide water\u201d or cables \u201cunder tide water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 18 (such licenses are \u201crevocable\u201d). The Legislature has been unmistakably clear that in granting such licenses DEP \u201cshall protect the interests of the commonwealth\u201d and its inhabitants in \u201clands, rights in lands, flats, shores,\u201d \u201crights in tide waters,\u201d and \u201ctidelands\u201d within the Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2. See <em>Moot </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 342-343 (\u201cobligation to preserve the public trust\u201d has been expressly delegated by Legislature to DEP).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The court reasons that because the Legislature has expressly delegated authority to administer public trust rights to DEP, and because \u00a7 69K, in the court\u2019s view, directs the siting board to \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of DEP, <em>ante </em>at 678, \u00a7 69K provides a \u201csufficiently articulated legislative delegation of authority\u201d to the siting board to administer public trust rights. <em>Ante </em>at 679. I cannot agree. The siting board cannot \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of DEP with respect to the administration of public trust rights unless the Legislature has expressly authorized it to do so. Such an express authorization is the only \u201carticulation\u201d that is \u201csufficient\u201d to delegate fiduciary responsibilities. See Fafard, <em>supra </em>at 198-199 (town may not administer public trust rights in DEP\u2019s place without express delegation of authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The court supports its conclusion by pointing to language in \u00a7 69K authorizing the siting board, in certain circumstances, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>issue a certificate with respect to a proposed energy facility that \u201cshall be in the form of a composite of all individual permits, approvals or authorizations which would otherwise be necessary for the construction or operation of the facility.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 677. That language, as does the rest of \u00a7 69K, makes no reference to tidelands and lacks any recognition of public trust rights, and, contrary to the court\u2019s conclusion, the Legislature has <em>not </em>\u201cexpressly vested authority\u201d in the siting board to act with respect to public trust rights. <em>Ante </em>at 678. The court cites no precedent supporting its \u201creading\u201d of the statute, and there is none. See <em>ante </em>at 678-681.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, the court\u2019s \u201creading\u201d of the statute is at odds with our prior public trust jurisprudence, both ancient and contemporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We recently held that broad language in G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 45 (registration act), authorizing the Land Court to issue a judgment after a land registration proceeding that \u201cshall be conclusive upon and against <em>all </em>persons, <em>including the commonwealth\u201d </em>(emphasis added), was <em>not </em>sufficient to constitute \u201can express delegation\u201d to relinquish the rights of the public held in trust by the Commonwealth. <em>Arno, supra </em>at 451. The registration act in <em>Arno, </em>like the siting board statute, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G-69Q, makes no reference to tidelands or to the public\u2019s rights therein. It is inconsistent with <em>Amo </em>to reason that an express delegation of authority by the Legislature to DEP to administer public trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>rights can constitute \u201cexpress\u201d delegation to the siting board because of broad language in \u00a7 69K, which is even less specific than the language at issue in <em>Arno. </em>In <em>Arno, </em>as in <em>Moot I, supra </em>at 351-353, there was a relinquishment or extinguishment of the public\u2019s rights in Commonwealth tidelands, while here there is not. The court correctly notes that the decisions of this court have \u201crecognized a difference\u201d between a legislative delegation of authority to <em>administer </em>public trust rights and duties and a permanent <em>relinquishment </em>of the public\u2019s rights in tidelands. <em>Ante </em>at n.30. But that difference is inconsequential in the context of this case. In either circumstance (delegation of authority to administer the rights or relinquishment of the rights) our jurisprudence has made abundantly clear that the Legislature <em>must </em>act <em>expressly. </em>It has not done so here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Were the siting board statute itself and the case law not sufficiently clear to require a different outcome of this case, and they are, the legislative history of the creation of the siting board confirms that the Legislature did <em>not </em>in fact delegate authority to the siting board to administer public trust rights. In 1971, in the face of a looming energy crisis of proportion equal to any today, the Legislature created an Electric Power Plant Siting Commission (commission) to make \u201can investigation and study of the <em>regulatory procedures </em>employed by the commonwealth and by its political subdivisions relative to the location and operation of electric utility generation and transmission facilities\u201d (emphasis added). Res. 1971, c. 78. The Legislature directed the commission to consider \u201cthe adequacy of existing state and municipal <em>regulatory procedures </em>to permit the furnishing of a sufficient supply of electric energy while, at the same time, preserving and protecting land, air and water resources\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>In particular, the commission was directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>to consider the \u201cfeasibility of a comprehensive state <em>regulatory </em>jurisdiction over the siting of electric generating plants and routing of major transmission facilities\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>Nowhere in the commission\u2019s charge did the Legislature address expressly, or by implication, public trust rights in the Commonwealth\u2019s tidelands.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">The commission filed three reports \u2014 1973 House Doc. No. 5891 (First Report), 1973 House Doc. No. 5892 (Second Report), and 1973 House Doc. No. 6190 (Third Report) \u2014 the third of which proposed statutory language that would eventually create the siting board. See Appendix A to Third Report, <em>supra </em>at 31-43. That language, along with other related proposals,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was considered by the House Committee on Government Regulations (committee). See 1973 House Doc. No. 7634. The committee then drafted a new bill, based in substantial part on the commission\u2019s proposed language, that, after various amendments, was passed by the House. See <em>id.', </em>1973 House Doc. No. 7768; 1973 House J. 3239, 3259, 4688. The Senate enacted the bill after making additional minor amendments, and the House adopted those amendments. See 1973 House J., <em>supra </em>at 3477, 3492, 4688-4689.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The Governor received memoranda from the Department of Public Utilities, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs offering advice about the final bill. While the Department of Public Utilities offered no objection, the latter two agencies opposed the passage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>bill exclusively on environmental grounds. Nevertheless, the Governor signed the final bill into law as G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G-69R. See St. 1973, c. 1232, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The commission\u2019s reports make clear that, in creating the siting board, the Legislature\u2019s intent was to ensure that \u201cstate and municipal <em>regulatory </em>procedures\u201d (emphasis added), Res. 1971, c. 78, balance the need for sufficient electric energy with \u201cenvironmental protection, public health and public safety.\u201d Third Report, <em>supra </em>at 24, 41. See First Report, <em>supra </em>at 8 (discussing need for one agency to have power \u201cto resolve the conflicts, such as between the utilities and environmentalists\u201d and stating \u201c[p]ower plant siting is primarily a question of land-use\u201d). The extensive legislative history, including three commission reports, multiple drafts of the legislation, amendments in both houses, and memoranda to the Governor from various executive agencies, contains <em>no </em>reference to tidelands, tidewaters, tidal flats, land under coastal waters, the public trust, or the traditional rights of navigation, fishing, and fowling. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>The silence is deafening.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The only reference in the legislative history of the siting board that might potentially relate to public trust rights cuts against the court\u2019s conclusion that DEP\u2019s expressly delegated authority to administer public trust rights in Commonwealth tidelands can be exercised by the siting board. In its Second Report, issued in December, 1972, the commission suggested that the Legislature pass a resolution that would, among other things, expand the commission\u2019s scope of study to include \u201cthe total energy picture in regards to the long-range planning needs of the commonwealth.\u201d Second Report, <em>supra </em>at 9. In July, 1973, four months after the commission issued its Third Report containing the language that in large part became G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G-69R, the Senate added language to amend the resolution proposed by the commission expanding its scope of investigation to include \u201cthe total energy picture in Massachusetts <em>except as it relates to offshore energy resources activities and offshore facilities.'\u2019'\u2019 </em>(language added by Senate italicized). Res. 1973, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>c. 110. See 1973 Senate J. 1977; 1973 House J. 2501.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The resolution was adopted in August, 1973. Res. 1973, c. 110. Various new drafts of the bill that eventually created G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69G-69R, were circulated in the following months. See 1973 House Doc. No. 7634 (filed in Oct. 1973); 1973 House Doc. No. 7768 (filed in Nov. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The Legislature\u2019s decision expressly to exempt issues concerning \u201coffshore energy resources activities and offshore facilities\u201d from its expansion of the commission\u2019s scope of study reflects an understanding within the Legislature that concerns relating to offshore facilities were <em>not </em>part of the commission\u2019s scope of inquiry. This singular indication of the Legislature\u2019s consideration of issues potentially relevant to public trust rights in relation to the creation of the siting board suggests that the Legislature understood that the creation of the siting board would not implicate those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The siting board\u2019s authority to grant a composite certificate is broad, but nothing in the statutory language, or its legislative history, indicates that such authority encompasses the power to act with respect to public tmst rights. I would reverse on this ground alone.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The siting board\u2019s lack of any authority to act with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>public trust rights is sufficient to overrule its decision to grant the certificate to proceed with the transmission cables in the absence of final approval from DEP. I also dissent for a second, and independent, reason. Even if the siting board had the authority to act with respect to public trust rights, which I do not accept, the siting board\u2019s position that it was under no obligation to consider \u2014 and indeed could not consider \u2014 any in-State impacts of the operation of the wind farm is untenable. What is the role of a State agency if not to safeguard in-State interests?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The court acknowledges the petitioners\u2019 argument that if the siting board had the authority to administer public trust rights, as a matter of \u201ccomplying with public trust doctrine obligations,\u201d the siting board had the \u201cduty\u201d to consider the potential effects of the wind farm on the Commonwealth. <em>Ante </em>at 682-683. It then rejects that claim by recharacterizing it as one based on a \u201cgeneral tenet of environmental and perhaps all regulation of private development projects.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 683. The court makes but a passing reference to the obligations imposed by the public trust doctrine, see <em>ante </em>at 686, and its rationales for approving the siting board\u2019s refusal to consider the impact of the wind farm on Commonwealth tidelands are unpersuasive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">First, the court reasons that the siting board\u2019s enabling statute states \u201cwith unmistakable clarity\u201d that the siting board\u2019s \u201cregulatory point of focus at all times is to be on the proposed \u2018facility,\u2019 \u201d and the proposed transmission lines constitute the only \u201cfacility\u201d subject to the siting board\u2019s review in this case. <em>Ante </em>at 683. That may be so, but it says nothing about the responsibilities the siting board must exercise if it is (as the court concludes) wearing DEP\u2019s fiduciary hat. Rather, the court\u2019s reasoning on this point undermines its own rationale for concluding that the siting board has the authority to act with respect to public trust rights in the first place. The court concludes that the siting board may administer public trust rights because it is authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>to \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of DEP. <em>Ante </em>at 678. The Legislature, of course, has charged DEP with the fiduciary responsibility to \u201cprotect the interests of the commonwealth\u201d and its inhabitants, in the \u201ctidelands.\u201d G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 2. If, as the court would have it, the siting board may act to affect public trust rights because it may stand in DEP\u2019s shoes, then, as the court explicitly acknowledges, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>the siting board has the obligation to act as fiduciary on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth when reviewing the proposal to construct and operate the transmission cables. No fiduciary \u2014 whether DEP or the siting board \u2022 \u2014 \u2022 can (or would) fulfil that fiduciary responsibility while turning a blind eye to the in-State impacts of the wind farm.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To the contrary, consideration of in-State impacts is integral to a determination whether the public trust has been violated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Second, moving beyond the siting board\u2019s enabling statute, the court concludes that neither the siting board, nor DEP, nor any other State entity,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> may consider the in-State impacts of the federally located wind farm because to do so would involve the assertion of authority that \u201cpresumably\u201d would encompass the \u201cpower to deny or condition\u201d a certificate or license \u201con account of such impacts.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 685. Such a denial or conditioning, the court reasons, would be \u201ctantamount to the denial of the wind farm project itself,\u201d which the court says no State entity may do. <em>Ante </em>at 685. The reasoning is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Procedure does not determine outcome. As noted, no fiduciary acting on behalf of the people could or would <em>ignore </em>the potential impact on the public\u2019s rights that might flow from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the construction and operation of the wind farm. The court condones the disregard of those fiduciary obligations by concluding that consideration of the in-State impacts would <em>necessarily </em>result in a denial or contingent approval for the transmission cables (and thereby the wind farm). I cannot accept that reasoning. Our role is not to assume the outcome but to ensure that the proper process has been followed. The cases on which the court relies for its statement that the siting board \u201cdoes not have authority to do indirectly what it cannot do directly\u201d are inapposite. <em>Ante </em>at 685, citing <em>Ten Taxpayer Citizens Group </em>v. <em>Cape Wind Assoc., LLC, </em>373 F.3d 183, 197 (1st Cir. 2004), cert, denied, 543 U.S. 1121 (2005) <em>(Ten Taxpayer Citizens), </em>and <em>New England Legal Found, </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>883 F.2d 157, 174 (1st Cir. 1989) <em>(New England Legal Found.). </em>Each involved Federal and State efforts to regulate the same activity (construction of a data tower in Federal water in the <em>Ten Taxpayer Citizens </em>case; control of air traffic in the <em>New England Legal Found, </em>case). Such an overlap is not at issue here: the Federal government has exclusive jurisdiction to provide approvals necessary for the wind farm to be constructed in Federal waters,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> while the State has exclusive jurisdiction to approve the construction of transmission cables through Commonwealth tidelands. See 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(a) (2006) (States have \u201cthe right and power to manage, administer, lease, develop, and use\u201d \u201clands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States ... in accordance with applicable State law\u201d). No one would suggest \u2014 or reasonably could suggest \u2014 that a private landowner would be \u201cpreempted\u201d from denying permission to run transmission cables across its land to serve a facility built by a second private party on adjacent Federal land merely because the second party\u2019s project had won Federal approval.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The question here is whether the Commonwealth is required to <em>consider </em>the potential impacts on the Commonwealth and its people were it to allow use of its tidelands for the transmission cables. How the siting board or DEP ultimately would respond after considering such impacts is not before us. I am not willing to assume, as the court does, that <em>any </em>action that could possibly result from such consideration would necessarily be preempted by Federal law. Nor am I willing to assume that the results of any evaluation of the in-State impact of the wind farm would never be taken into consideration by Federal authorities. Comity within our Federal system has more meaning than the court\u2019s crabbed approach.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The public trust doctrine and government energy policy are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>not at odds. Indeed, they are complementary. Both express the people\u2019s paramount interest in the wise and fruitful use of natural resources. Today\u2019s opinion, however, casts these two allies in opposition, and exalts regulatory expediency at the cost of fiduciary obligation. By issuing a certificate pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69K, which purports to include the \u201cequivalent\u201d of a G. L. c. 91 tidelands license, the siting board has purported to act as the protector of the public\u2019s long-standing rights under the public trust doctrine without the necessary express legislative authority to do so. Its usurpation of the Commonwealth\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to the people, and DEP\u2019s complicit agreement with that usurpation, should not be condoned. Moreover, even if the siting board had the authority to act, it has failed to exercise its role of fiduciary on behalf of the public because it failed to consider the in-State impacts of the wind farm. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\">For a description of the terms \u201ctidelands\u201d and \u201cCommonwealth tidelands,\u201d see <em>ante </em>at n.25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">I agree with the court\u2019s resolution of the other issues raised by the petitioners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The Legislature has also expressly delegated certain aspects of its authority and obligations under the public trust doctrine to the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) (see definition of \u201cDepartment\u201d in G.

The court makes essentially the same point, <em>ante </em>at 678, but the point proves nothing. Each statute referenced in the <em>Fafard </em>case, unlike the siting board\u2019s enabling statute, expressly authorizes the issuance of licenses for or regulation of certain uses in or on tidewater, tidelands, or tidal flats, thereby making clear the invocation of the public trust doctrine.

The court\u2019s attempt to mitigate the dangerous implications of the precedent it is setting is laudable. But the utter lack of textual support for the court\u2019s conclusion concerning the siting board\u2019s public trust <em>obligations </em>under \u00a7 69K only reinforces the error of the court\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature has expressly delegated to the siting board the <em>power </em>to administer public trust rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\">On creating the Electric Power Plant Siting Commission (commission), the Legislature directed the commission to \u201cstudy the subject matter\u201d of various bills then pending in the House of Representatives.
