App. Ct. 1113 (1996). Reviewing Fox-worth\u2019s subsequent petition for habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (First Circuit)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has certified the following question to this court, pursuant to S.J.C.

See <em>Foxworth, supra </em>at 420-424. We summarize those procedural facts that bear on the certified question. In March of 1992, Foxworth and two codefendants were tried in the Superior Court on indictments charging each of them with murder in the first degree. Foxworth had moved unsuccessfully before trial to sever his case from his codefendants on the ground that he would be prejudiced by the introduction of a statement one of his codefendants, Troy Logan, had given to the police. At trial, Logan\u2019s statement was introduced in evidence (over Foxworth\u2019s timely objection) through a police detective, but the statement was redacted or altered in several places to substitute the term \u201cMr. X\u201d for Foxworth\u2019s name. See <em>id. </em>at 421-422. On March 31, 1992, a jury convicted Foxworth of murder in the second degree, and acquitted Logan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Foxworth filed a timely appeal from his conviction. On March 16, 1994, he filed a motion for new trial in the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. R 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979) (first new trial motion). In his first new trial motion, Foxworth asserted, among other claims, that the admission of his codefendant\u2019s statement in evidence at trial contravened <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968) <em>(Bruton). </em>A judge in the Superior Court (not the trial judge) denied Foxworth\u2019s first new trial motion in August, 1994. Thereafter, the Appeals Court consolidated Foxworth\u2019s appeal from that denial with his direct appeal from his conviction, and affirmed both the conviction and the denial of the new trial mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion in a decision issued pursuant to that court\u2019s rule 1:28 on October 21, 1996. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foxworth, supra. </em>One of the grounds of appeal raised by Foxworth, and considered by the Appeals Court, was his claim of a <em>Bruton </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 27.1 (a), as amended, 369 Mass. 920 (1975), Foxworth had twenty days from October 21, 1996, in which to file an application for further appellate review. No such application was filed within the prescribed period. In accordance with Mass. R. A. P. 23, as appearing in 367 Mass. 921 (1975), therefore, the Appeals Court\u2019s rescript issued to the trial court on November 18,1996. On November 22,1996, the rescript, indicating \u201cJudgment affirmed,\u201d was entered on the docket in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Almost four years later, on October 25, 2000, Foxworth filed in this court a pro se application for leave to obtain further appellate review (FAR application), accompanied by a motion to file the FAR application late. One of the grounds asserted for obtaining further appellate review was the alleged <em>Bruton </em>violation. In November, 2000, before the court acted on his application and motion to file the application late, Foxworth filed, and this court allowed, a motion to stay action on his requests in order to allow Foxworth to pursue a second motion for a new trial. Foxworth filed pro se his second new trial motion in the Superior Court in December, 2000; the motion did not raise the <em>Bruton </em>violation claim. <em>Foxworth, </em>570 F.3d at 423. Another Superior Court judge denied the second motion, and the Appeals Court affirmed its denial in a brief memorandum and order dated April 17, 2002. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foxworth, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Thereafter, on July 22, 2002, Foxworth, now represented by counsel, filed in this court an amended FAR application that represented a consolidation of his original 2000 FAR application with another FAR application concerning the Appeals Court\u2019s 2002 decision. He also filed a motion to file the application late; the court allowed that motion on July 22.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>2002, we denied Foxworth\u2019s amended FAR application without opinion or comment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AhH\">On September 10, 2003, Foxworth filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Lengthy proceedings in the Federal courts ensued. In summary, on August 17, 2006, a District Court judge initially granted Foxworth\u2019s petition on the basis of the claimed <em>Bruton </em>violation, vacated his conviction, and ordered the Commonwealth to retry Foxworth within sixty days or release him; on appeal by the Commonwealth, the First Circuit remanded the case to the District Court judge to address Foxworth\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence; on remand, in May of 2008, that judge concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support Foxworth\u2019s conviction and ordered his release; and on the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, the First Circuit certified to this court the question now before us. See <em>Foxworth, </em>570 F.3d at 423-424, 437.</p>\n<p id=\"ao-dedup-0\">The certified question is relevant to the First Circuit\u2019s review of the habeas petition because that court has concluded, in contrast to the District Court judge, that the evidence presented at Foxworth\u2019s trial was sufficient to sustain his conviction, see <em>id. </em>at 428-429, and that the remaining pertinent question is whether Foxworth\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>violation claim entitles him to relief. In the view of the First Circuit, the answer to that question turns on the date on which Foxworth\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction was final, because for Federal habeas relief to be granted, the State court\u2019s decision is to be \u201cmeasured against \u2018clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019 In most cases (and, specifically, in this case), the date of finality of the state court conviction determines the time line to be used for determining what Supreme Court decisions comprise the corpus of this \u2018clearly established Federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 322-323 (1987) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>(newly declared constitutional rule must be applied to all criminal cases then pending on direct review), with <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310 (1989) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (with limited exceptions, new constitutional rules do not apply to cases on collateral review that have become final before new rules announced).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The First Circuit considered that there were two possible dates of finality in the present case: (1) November 18, 1996, the date the Massachusetts Appeals Court\u2019s rescript issued, concluding that court\u2019s consideration of Foxworth\u2019s direct appeal; or (2) September 6, 2002, the date that this court denied Fox-worth\u2019s amended FAR application. <em>Foxworth, </em>570 F.3d at 430. The difference in these dates is critical to the First Circuit\u2019s resolution of Foxworth\u2019s habeas corpus petition. That court has concluded that if the 1996 date were to represent the end of direct review in Foxworth\u2019s case, he would not be entitled to habeas corpus relief, because, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200 (1987), the Appeals Court\u2019s rejection of Foxworth\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>claim \u201cwas not an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.\u201d <em>Foxworth, supra </em>at 433. See <em>id. </em>at 436. If, on the other hand, the 2002 date defined finality for the direct review process, Foxworth\u2019s habeas petition should be granted because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185 (1998), would then apply, and the Appeals Court\u2019s decision on the claimed <em>Bruton </em>violation represented an unreasonable application of <em>Gray. Foxworth, supra </em>at 434-435, 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\"><em>Discussion. </em>We accept the premise of the First Circuit, that the \u201cdate of finality\u201d of a State court judgment (see note 6, <em>supra) </em>is a matter to be determined with reference <em>to </em>State law. See <em>Foxworth, </em>570 F.3d at 429, 437. See also <em>Losh </em>v. <em>Fabian, </em>592 F.3d 820, 824-825 (8th Cir. 2010) (State Supreme Court could determine whether particular type of appeal permitted under State law qualified as part of direct review of criminal conviction and sentence, or form of collateral review). Cf. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 223 (2002) (\u201cfor purposes of applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>a federal statute that interacts with state procedural rules, we look to how a state procedure functions\u201d). But see <em>Teas </em>v. <em>Endi-cott, </em>494 F.3d 580, 582 (7th Cir. 2007) (definition of \u201cdirect review\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244[d] [2006] is matter of Federal law). In the Commonwealth, the determination of the finality date is derived primarily from the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure and associated statutes. Every defendant in a criminal case has the right to bring an appeal from, and obtain direct review of, a conviction. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28. With one exception not relevant here, the Appeals Court and this court share concurrent jurisdiction over criminal appeals. The direct appeal is entered in the Appeals Court in the first instance, and in most cases (as in this case), the appeal is heard and decided by the Appeals Court. See G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10. In such an appeal, when the Appeals Court issues its opinion, the clerk of that court mails a copy of the opinion and the \u201crescript\u201d \u2014 in effect, the Appeals Court\u2019s judgment in that case<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 to the parties, and then issues the re-script to the lower court twenty-eight days after the date of the rescript. Mass. R. A. P. 23.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As rule 23 indicates, the reason for the twenty-eight day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>delay in issuance of the rescript to the lower court is to accommodate a party\u2019s twenty-day right to seek further appellate review of the case by this court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> pursuant to G. L. c. 211 A, \u00a7 11, and rule 27.1.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the FAR application is timely filed (i.e., within twenty days), the Appeals Court\u2019s rescript is stayed until this court rules on the application. If we deny the FAR application, the Appeals Court\u2019s rescript then issues forthwith to the lower court; if the application is allowed, the Appeals Court\u2019s rescript does not so issue, but instead, a rescript from this court will issue pursuant to rule 23 at the time we issue our decision in the case. The gist of these rules, taken together, is that when a rescript does issue to the lower court \u2014 whether the rescript is issued by the Appeals Court or this court \u2014 that signals the end of the direct review process for the case. As the First Circuit suggested, <em>Foxworth, </em>570 F.3d at 436-437, the date the re-script issues thus represents \u201cthe date of finality\u201d for the case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and it is a date that expressly includes within its scope the opportunity to file a timely FAR application and the resolution of any such application that is timely filed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The certified question asks whether the finality of Foxworth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>judgment of conviction was reopened when this court in 2002 allowed him to file a FAR application late and then denied the application. The key to our answer is the rescript. As discussed, when a rescript of the Appeals Court issues to the lower court, that signifies the end of the direct appeal process, because as rule 23 makes plain, it means either that the defendant did not file a timely FAR application or that the application he did file was denied, and therefore all available avenues for direct review under our State law are exhausted. See <em>Caspari </em>v. <em>Bohlen, </em>510 U.S. 383, 390-391 (1994). If a defendant in the first category (no FAR application timely filed) subsequently files a motion to file a FAR application late, the allowance of such a motion<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by itself has no effect on the previously issued rescript: no rule or statute, including, most importantly, rule 23, provides for any change in the status of an issued rescript solely as a result of this court\u2019s discretionary allowance of a motion to file late. Accordingly, the final judgment reflected in the entry of the re-script on the trial court\u2019s docket remains the final judgment. Cf. <em>Beard </em>v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406, 412 (2004) (fact that State court might choose to waive its procedural rule barring consideration in postconviction proceedings of claims not previously raised did not render underlying judgment of conviction non-final).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Foxworth argues to the contrary, claiming that when a court decides to allow a motion to file a FAR application late, it \u201craise[s] the question whether the court will modify the judgment and alter the parties\u2019 rights,\u201d <em>Hibbs </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 98 (2004), and therefore suspends the finality of the judgment. We disagree. The <em>Hibbs </em>case, as well as <em>Young </em>v. Harper, 520 U.S. 143, 147 n.l (1997), on which Foxworth also relies, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>distinguishable. Neither case involved a situation where the appellate rescript (or \u201cmandate\u201d in Federal parlance) had issued and thereby remained intact at all relevant times.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But that is the issue here, and as we have indicated, as a matter of State law, under our statutes and court rules, the allowance of a motion to file an FAR application late, by itself, does not operate to change the status of a rescript that has previously issued. Nor does a subsequent denial of the late-filed application. Such a denial is nothing more than an indication that we have determined, in our discretion, not to grant further review. It is not an indorsement, acceptance, or ratification by us of the Appeals Court\u2019s decision. See <em>Ford </em>v. Flaherty, 364 Mass. 382, 387-388 (1973) (\u201cAn order by this court denying further review should not be considered in any case as an affirmation of the decision or reasoning of the Appeals Court. Such an order merely shows that, after consideration of the applicable statutory standards as set forth in G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 11, we have determined not to grant further review. Only a rescript or rescript and opinion from this court, after further review, should be considered as a statement of our position on the legal issues concerned\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Foxworth\u2019s reliance on the recent decision of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>States Supreme Court in <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, </em>129 S. Ct. 681 (2009), is also misplaced. In that case, the Court concluded that for purposes of measuring the one-year limitations period imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), for filing a writ of habeas corpus in Federal court, a State court judgment of conviction is no longer \u201cfinal\u201d if the State court grants a defendant the right to file a late or \u201cout-of-time\u201d direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 685-686. Rather, the Court stated, \u201c \u2018the order granting an out-of-time appeal restore[d] the pendency of the direct appeal,\u2019 . . . and petitioner\u2019s conviction was again capable of modification through direct appeal to the state courts and to this Court on certiorari review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, quoting <em>Ex parte Torres, </em>943 S.W.2d 469, 472 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). Had we granted the late-filed FAR application, thereby effectively reinstating the direct appeal, then <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Quarterman, supra, </em>might be applicable. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>Here, however, we denied rather than granted Foxworth\u2019s late-filed FAR application. We did not reinstate the direct appeal or reopen the conviction in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We respond to the certified question as follows: This court did not reopen the finality of the petitioner Robert Foxworth\u2019s 1992 conviction in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The Reporter of Decisions is to furnish attested copies of this opinion to the clerk of this court.

See also <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Bressler, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 796 (1977). Neither of these cases, however, considers the difference between timely and late-filed FAR applications, let alone a FAR application filed after the issuance of the Appeals Court\u2019s rescript as we have here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\">We frequently, but not always, allow motions to file FAR applications late. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>436 Mass. 1007, 1008 n.l (2002), with <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>424 Mass. 1008, 1009 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In <em>Hibbs </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88 (2004), the ninety-day period for seeking certiorari had not yet passed when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Court recalled its mandate and directed the parties to brief the question whether the case should be reheard en banc. Given the recall of the mandate by the court itself, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court held that \u201c[b]ecause [the] 90-day limit had not yet expired, the clock could still be reset by an order that left unresolved whether the [Ninth Circuit] would modify its judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. Here, by contrast, we did not recall (or make any other order with respect to) the Appeals Court\u2019s 1996 rescript when we authorized the late filing of the FAR application and denied the application in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>520 U.S. 143, 147 n.l (1997), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit granted the petitioners leave to file their petition two days late, but before the mandate had issued, and the Supreme Court treated both the petition for rehearing and the subsequent petition for certiorari as timely in the circumstances. In the present case, again by contrast, the application for further review was filed nearly four years after the rescript had already issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Finally, we note that both the <em>Hibbs </em>and <em>Young </em>cases involved points of Federal law; the limited question that has been certified to us is whether the Foxworth\u2019s conviction, which became final in 1996, was reopened by us in 2002 as a matter of State law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">In the brief filed on behalf of St. Amand, the Attorney General takes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>position that if the court <em>grants </em>a late-filed FAR application after a rescript has issued, that allowance effectively reopens the final judgment. We do not need to resolve the issue in order to answer the First Circuit\u2019s question, but the Commonwealth\u2019s position finds support in the fact that if this court does grant a late-filed application, it is treated procedurally in the same manner as a timely FAR application. At the time we issue our decision in the case, under rule 23, a new rescript will issue to the lower court, and the new rescript will be entered on the lower court\u2019s docket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
