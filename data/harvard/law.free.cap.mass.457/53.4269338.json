The next decade of his life yielded a marred, albeit nonsexual, criminal record that culminated, for purposes of this case, in a guilty plea in Federal court on one count of distributing a controlled substance. While in Federal custody pending sentencing on the latter charge, the plaintiff was incarcerated in several locations. He began his incarceration in a Federal detention facility in Rhode Island but was soon transferred to Massachusetts facilities. In 2004 and 2005, the plaintiff was being held in the Barnstable County house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">During his stay there, but before he was sentenced on his Federal conviction, the Sex Offender Registry Board (board) classified him as a level two sex offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On de novo review, a hearing examiner affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s classification, as did the Superior Court judge who heard the plaintiff\u2019s appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M, and G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Before the board and in the Superior Court, the plaintiff argued only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>his record and circumstances supported classification as a level one offender, as opposed to a level two offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s classification. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3974 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (2009). It also rejected his newly raised claims that the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction to classify him and that the board lacked the authority to classify him until his release was imminent. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The plaintiff raises three arguments on appeal, all of which, on review, have been waived. First, as a threshold matter, he challenges what he terms as the board\u2019s \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d over his case. Simply put, the plaintiff asserts that the board\u2019s jurisdiction extends only to those sex offenders who \u201cresideQ\u201d in the Commonwealth, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, as amended through St. 2003, c. 77, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, and that residence requires more than happenstance presence in a Massachusetts correctional facility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appeals Court held that this argument could not be waived and concluded that the board had subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s case. Second, the plaintiff argues that an incarcerated sex offender poses no risk of reoffense or threat to the public, and therefore that such individuals cannot be classified as level two sex offenders. Third, he claims that his right to due process was infringed when the board acted without waiting to learn what sentence he would receive on his Federal drug charge, essentially depriving him of the opportunity to show how specific conditions of his release might mitigate his risk of reoffense and threat to the public. The Appeals Court held that these latter two arguments had been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">We take up each of the plaintiff\u2019s arguments in turn and affirm the plaintiff\u2019s classification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>1. <em>Claimed, lack of subject matter jurisdiction. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s primary challenge to his classification is that the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case. At the time of his classification, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, defined a \u201c[s]ex offender\u201d as \u201ca person who resides ... in the commonwealth and who has been convicted of a sex offense or who has been adjudicated as a youthful offender or as a delinquent juvenile by reason of a sex offense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In essence, the plaintiff argues that he was not a \u201csex offender\u201d because, having been transferred to the Barn-stable County house of correction involuntarily, he did not \u201creside\u201d in Massachusetts. Therefore, he contends that the board acted beyond its authority when it classified him, and that an incarcerated person only \u201cresides\u201d in Massachusetts when there is evidence that the person intends to live in the State after release.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Given the fact that the plaintiff neglected to raise this issue until his case reached the Appeals Court, there is a strategic explanation for why he has couched his argument in terms of subject matter jurisdiction. As we have said, \u201cquestions of subject matter jurisdiction \u2018may be raised at any time\u2019 . . . and are not waived even when not argued below.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>440 Mass. 147, 151 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cantres, 405 Mass. 238, 240 (1989). Thus, provided that questions concerning a person\u2019s residence implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of the board, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise the issue before the board is excusable. However, if the plaintiff\u2019s argument does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction, then it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction is \u2018jurisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 520 (2007), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 870 (8th ed. 2004). It is divided \u201camong the various trial courts and administrative agencies [and] \u2018is both conferred and limited by statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra, </em>quoting <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>403 Mass. 616, 619 (1988). The question at the heart of subject matter jurisdiction is, \u201cHas the Legislature empowered the [agency] to hear cases of a certain genre?\u201d <em>Wachovia Bank, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. 303, 316 (2006). See <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 127 (1981) (\u201cdespite breadth of this jurisdictional grant [of general equity jurisdiction], the Probate Courts remain courts of limited jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Legislature has empowered the board to hear one particular \u201cgenre\u201d of cases, the classification process. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 92-93 (1998), quoting G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (\u201cgeneral charge of the board is to: \u2018promulgate guidelines for determining the level of risk of reoffense of sex offenders [and] apply the guidelines to assess the risk level of particular offenders\u201d). There is no other \u201cavenue\u201d of classification; classification of sex offenders is exclusively the province of the board. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The \u201cnature of the case\u201d assigned to the board is distinguishable from the elements of a prima facie case before the board. See <em>Sperounes </em>v. <em>Farese, </em>449 Mass. 800, 806 (2007) ($25,000 limit for cases filed in District Court is \u201cprocedural,\u201d not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and must be raised in answer or will be waived); <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 520-521 (prerequisite that project be \u201cfundable\u201d in order to challenge comprehensive permit decision was \u201csubstantive,\u201d not \u201cjurisdictional\u201d). Thus, the plaintiff is correct that a \u201csex offender\u201d is a person who \u201cresides\u201d in Massachusetts, but he is incorrect that this predicate fact constitutes a subject matter jurisdiction threshold. The board was required to establish that the statutory definition of \u201csex offender\u201d applied to the plaintiff, but that was a question of substance, not subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Once stripped of its subject matter jurisdiction label, it is clear that the plaintiff has waived his argument by failing to raise it until he reached the Appeals Court. In general, \u201c[o]ur court has long followed the rule that \u2018[i]n the absence of a statutory directive to the contrary, the administrative remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>should be exhausted before resort to the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 448 (1973), quoting <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co., </em>361 Mass. 582, 587 (1972). Even when arguments relate to predicate facts that are \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in nature (because they are predicate to agency action), the rule of exhaustion applies. See <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 451. This is reflected in the terms of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), which permits the Superior Court to overturn an agency action made \u201c[i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency,\u201d but only \u201cupon consideration of the entire record.\u201d Thus, when a party neglects to raise an issue during agency proceedings, the reviewing court lacks a record on which to evaluate questions of statutory authority or jurisdiction. Where the Legislature has selected an agency as the primary finder of facts, courts \u201cmust give effect to the orderly administrative process set up by the Legislature and permit the [agency] to make the decisions entrusted to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. This is one of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s argument concerning his residence is based entirely on what the board <em>did not know </em>when it classified him. He asserts that the board had no information about where he intended to reside after his release from prison, and he then proceeds to argue that this thus deprived the board of its authority to classify him. The notion that the board might claim the power to classify incarcerated individuals who have been transferred into Massachusetts on a temporary and involuntary basis does, indeed, raise concerns. However, because the plaintiff never raised this point to the board, we have no indication that the board tried to assert such sweeping authority. Instead, the record includes sufficient evidence to satisfy a prima facie showing of the plaintiff\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Appeals Court held, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 88 (2008), that the plaintiff\u2019s incarceration in Massachusetts was enough to qualify him as a resident for purposes of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. However, much more was present than temporary incarceration, thus obviating the need to rely on such a narrow ground. The record indicates that the plaintiff was born in Massachusetts and that he spent his youth here. Indeed, the underlying sex offense that triggered his classifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tion occurred and was adjudicated in Massachusetts. The record also shows that he was married and living with his wife in Massachusetts when he was arrested on his Federal drug charge. There was no evidence, aside from his temporary incarceration in Rhode Island, that the plaintiff ever lived or intended to live anywhere but Massachusetts. Coupled with his presence in the Barnstable County house of correction, these facts are enough to deem the plaintiff a resident of Massachusetts. See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>183 Mass. 314, 315 (1903) (\u201cOrdinarily, the word \u2018resides\u2019 may be construed as having a residence in a place and to be there settled as a home . . .\u201d). The plaintiff was entitled to rebut these facts, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a), </em>but he opted to offer no evidence of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Therefore, even had he not waived his argument concerning his residence, the plaintiff would have lost on the merits. Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), a reviewing court would have examined the record to determine if the plaintiff was a resident of Massachusetts within the meaning of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. That record, as we have shown, was of the plaintiff\u2019s own making, and would have been fatal to his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">2. <em>Other claims. </em>The Appeals Court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s other claims, both of which concern the timing of the board\u2019s action, were waived. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s first argument is that because an incarcerated sex offender is behind bars, he does not pose a current risk of reoffense or a threat to the public, and therefore cannot be required to register as a sex offender. The plaintiff did not make this argument before the hearing examiner. Instead, he argued that a level one classification was more appropriate because he was facing a potentially long (but, at that time, indeterminate) sentence for his Federal drug conviction. The claim he raises now, that the classification of an incarcerated person is beyond the authority of the board, is very different.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">In its most compelling form, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the board\u2019s authority to classify incarcerated sex offenders is limited to making <em>initial </em>rather than <em>final </em>classifications. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 768, 771-772 (2006) (discussing two-step classification process, beginning with initial classification followed by final classification based either on de novo hearing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sex offender\u2019s failure to object to initial classification). This argument is founded on a strict interpretation of G. L. c. 6, and proceeds as follows. The Legislature has indicated that it knows how to differentiate between \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cinitial\u201d classifications. Thus, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 1781 and 178J (c), both make use of the word \u201cfinally\u201d when discussing public access to offender classification information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In contrast, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (a), the section that concerns the classification of incarcerated sex offenders, does not use the word \u201cfinal\u201d when describing the classification of such offenders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, one construction of the statute might be that the board must wait until an incarcerated sex offender\u2019s release is imminent before making a final classification. The argument is an interesting one, although not without its flaws. For example, the board is <em>required </em>to classify incarcerated sex offenders before they are released: The board must begin classification proceedings at least sixty days prior to the offender\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>release, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a), </em>and must classify the offender at least ten days before the offender\u2019s earliest possible release date, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(a). </em>Moreover, the argument does not account for the fact that an initial classification becomes \u201cfinal\u201d if a sex offender fails to object to it, regardless of whether the offender continues to be incarcerated. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E <em>(a), </em>references the procedures of G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L, suggests that it also incorporates the latter\u2019s reference to \u201cfinal\u201d classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In another form, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that classifications of incarcerated sex offenders are not based on \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10216 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 779, 787 (2006) (substantial evidence standard), because such individuals pose no current risk of reoffense or threat to the public. Again, there are several problems with this argument. Foremost among them is that the Legislature clearly intended that the board classify incarcerated sex offenders. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178E (a), 178L (1) (a). Second, in his case, the plaintiff was afforded an opportunity to argue and present evidence that he posed no current threat, <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass. 780, 791-792 (2008), and his duty to register was delayed until his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">However, the fundamental problem at the heart of both the plaintiffs arguments, in this case at least, is that they have been waived. \u201cIn ordinary circumstances, \u2018[wjhere the contention is that... [a] board is acting beyond its jurisdiction [or authority], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the board should have an opportunity to ascertain the facts and decide the question for itself . . . \u201d <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 452 (1973), quoting <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>320 Mass. 467, 470 (1946). Here, the plaintiff did not object to being subjected to final classification, choosing instead to argue that a level one classification was more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The plaintiff confronts the same problem with his third and final argument. He asserts that his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights precluded the board from classifying him as a sex offender before he received his sentence for his Federal drug charge. Included in the statutory factors that the board should consider when making a classification are a sex offender\u2019s \u201cconditions of release that minimize the risk of reoffense.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) (c). These include \u201cwhether the sex offender is under probation or parole supervision, whether such sex offender is receiving counseling, therapy or treatment, and whether such sex offender is residing in a home situation that provides guidance and supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, by classifying him before his sentence was announced and imposed, the plaintiff argues that the board denied him the opportunity to present mitigating evidence. However, there is nothing to suggest that the board\u2019s classification would have been different had it been presented with the plaintiff\u2019s release conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">As it stands, the plaintiff\u2019s classification is based on the presence of several aggravating factors, including the age of his victim, his failure to accept responsibility for his sex offense, and his criminal history. The plaintiff does not dispute that the evidence actually presented to the board was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that his classification be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10216 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., supra. </em>Rather, his argument is that the mix of evidence would have been materially different had classification occurred at a later time. However, there is nothing in the statute or regulations that requires the board to treat mitigating conditions of release as superseding other aggravating factors. To the contrary, the Legislature has established a flexible classification scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 787-788.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Regardless of the merits of his claim, however, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the board constitutes waiver. <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra. </em>His decision resulted in a record devoid of facts that could help a reviewing court in evaluating whether the board acted too soon in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s classification was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\">At the time of his classification in 2005, the plaintiff was still awaiting sentencing for his 2001 Federal drug conviction. There is nothing conclusive in the record to explain this delay, although it appears related to the uncertainty surrounding the Federal sentencing guidelines at the time. See <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 305 (2004); <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 496-497 (2000). Although still in effect at the time of the classification, the Federal sentencing guidelines were under challenge. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>375 F.3d 508 (7th Cir.), cert, granted, 542 U.S. 956 (2004), affd, 543 U.S. 220, 226-227 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Prior cases have set out the classification scheme at length. See, e.g., <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750, 755-757 (2006), quoting <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>434 Mass. 418, 423-426 (2001). Classification is a two-step process. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 768, 771-772 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In the first step, once it learns that a correctional facility is housing a sex offender, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (a), the Sex Offender Registry Board (board) makes a recommended classification. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) (a); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.06(5)-(6) (2004). The second step of the process is the finalization of the recommended classification, which can occur in one of two ways. The offender may request a de novo hearing to determine what final classification, if any, is appropriate, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a), </em>(2); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.07, 1.10 (2002), after which judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, is available. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M. Alternatively, the offender may waive the right to a hearing by failing to request one, which results in the board\u2019s recommended classification becoming final and precludes judicial review of the final classification. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a), </em>(2); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The definition of \u201c[s]ex offender\u201d in G.

Because art. 3 of the United States Constitution confers on Federal courts jurisdiction only where a Federal question of law is present, or where a controversy exists between citizens of different States, the citizenship of parties rightly is classified as a question of subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Caterpillar Inc. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>519 U.S. 61, 67-68 (1996). Diversity of citizenship defines the \u201ccategory\u201d of the case in Federal court.
