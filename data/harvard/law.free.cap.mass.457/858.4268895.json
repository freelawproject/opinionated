L. c. 265A, \u00a7 13A (a); assault by means of a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B; and home invasion, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant and the victim had not been engaged to marry at the time of the assault, but they were married on January 5, 2008, at the North Attleborough town hall. On January 15, the defendant voluntarily surrendered himself to the court and was arraigned. At that time, the Commonwealth moved for a dangerousness hearing under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A. At the dangerousness hearing on January 23, the victim testified that she was married to the defendant and invoked her spousal privilege. She continued to invoke her spousal privilege and refused to testify at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Before trial, the Commonwealth moved in limine to admit hearsay statements made by the victim before she married the defendant to a close friend, to her sister, and to a police detective. The Commonwealth claimed that, by marrying the victim so that she could claim her spousal privilege, the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>forfeited Ms right to object on confrontation and hearsay grounds to the admission of her out-of-court statements under the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine without making findings of fact or law. On May 6, 2008, a jury in the District Court convicted the defendant of one count of assault and battery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We must decide whether the scope of our forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine, as announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>444 Mass. 526 (2005) <em>(Edwards), </em>is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s more recent articulation of the forfeiture doctrine in <em>Giles </em>v. <em>California, </em>554 U.S. 353 (2008) <em>(Giles). </em>We conclude that it is. We also conclude that the hearsay evidence was properly admitted where the defendant forfeited Ms confrontation and hearsay objections to the admission of the victim\u2019s statements because he intended, by marrying the victim, to enable her to exercise her spousal privilege and thereby make her unavailable to testify at trial. We further conclude that the defendant\u2019s right to due process was not violated because the hearsay evidence bore substantial indicia of reliability, and that the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Forfeiture by wrongdoing. </em>In 1878 the Supreme Court established the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 158 (1878) <em>(Reynolds); </em>\u201cThe Constitution gives the accused the right to a trial at which he should be confronted with the witnesses against him; but if a witness is absent by his own wrongful procurement, he cannot complain if competent evidence is admitted to supply the place of that wMch he has kept away.\u201d See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 62 (2004) (doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing \u201cextinguishes\u201d criminal defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution). The Court explained that the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>\u201chas its foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong.\u201d <em>Reynolds, supra </em>at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In 2005, we concluded that, under the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing, a defendant may also forfeit his right to object to the admission of hearsay evidence under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and our common-law rules of evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 536. We held that three factual findings are required for forfeiture by wrongdoing to apply: \u201c(1) the witness is unavailable; (2) the defendant was involved in, or responsible for, procuring the unavailability of the witness; and (3) the defendant acted with the intent to procure the witness\u2019s unavailability.\u201d <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 540. \u201cA defendant\u2019s involvement in procuring a witness\u2019s unavailability need not consist of a criminal act\u201d; the \u201cwrongdoing\u201d in forfeiture by wrongdoing is simply the intentional act of making the witness unavailable to testify or helping the witness become unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 540-542. Forfeiture by wrongdoing \u201cmay include a defendant\u2019s collusion with a witness to ensure that the witness will not be heard at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540. The Commonwealth need not show that the defendant threatened, coerced, persuaded, or pressured a witness to avoid testifying, or physically prevented the witness from testifying. <em>Id. </em>at 541. Where a defendant actively assists a witness\u2019s efforts to avoid testifying, with the intent to keep the witness from testifying, forfeiture by wrongdoing may be established \u201cregardless of whether the witness already decided \u2018on [her] own\u2019 not to testify.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Three years after our decision in <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Giles </em>held that, under the Sixth Amendment, the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine applies only where the defendant acts with the intent to prevent the witness from testifying.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Giles, supra </em>at 360 (right to confrontation not forfeited without showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>defendant \u201cintended to prevent a witness from testifying\u201d). It is not enough for the defendant to know that his wrongdoing will cause the witness\u2019s unavailability to testify at trial; he must intend that result.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 360, 368-369, 377. The Court observed that it previously had approved Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(6), which \u201ccodifies the forfeiture doctrine,\u201d <em>Giles, supra </em>at 367, quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 833 (2006), and includes an intent requirement. Rule 804(b)(6) provides that a hearsay statement is admissible in evidence where the declarant is unavailable and the statement is offered against a party that has \u201cengaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(6) (2010). See generally 5 C.B. Mueller &amp; L.C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 8:134, at 232 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The defendant argues that the intent requirement of <em>Giles </em>requires us to narrow our holding in <em>Edwards </em>that forfeiture by wrongdoing may be established by collusion between the defendant and the unavailable witness. We conclude that our decision in <em>Edwards </em>is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Giles. </em>We declared in <em>Edwards </em>that a defendant\u2019s collusion is sufficient to establish forfeiture only where \u201cthe defendant acted with the intent to procure the witness\u2019s unavailability.\u201d <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 540. See <em>id. </em>at 541-542 (\u201cdefendant\u2019s <em>intentional </em>procurement of a witness\u2019s unavailability through collusion . . . sufficient to trigger the doctrine\u201d [emphasis added]). And, to establish collusion, we require that a defendant \u201cactively facilitate^ the carrying out of the witness\u2019s independent intent not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541. By requiring that the defendant actively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>assist the witness in becoming unavailable with the intent to make her unavailable, our doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing is at least as demanding as Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(6), which permits a finding of forfeiture where the defendant \u201cacquiesced\u201d in conduct that was intended to, and did, make the witness unavailable to testify.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Nor does <em>Giles </em>require us to revisit our conclusion in <em>Edwards </em>that the wrongdoing that may justify forfeiture need not be criminal. See <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 540, 542. The Supreme Court in <em>Giles, supra </em>at 368, declared that the wrongdoing that may warrant forfeiture of a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights was \u201cconduct designed to prevent a witness from testifying.\u201d Indeed, in <em>Reynolds, supra </em>at 159-160, forfeiture by wrongdoing was found where the witness, who was the defendant\u2019s second wife, lived with the defendant but had left home for three weeks to avoid being served with a subpoena, and where the defendant told the process server that she was not at home but would not say where she was. There was no allegation that the defendant had made the witness unavailable through a criminal act. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>684 F.2d 1193, 1203 (6th Cir. 1982), cert, denied, 460 U.S. 1053 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>512 F.2d 637, 650-651 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 422 U.S. 1008 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Having concluded that <em>Giles </em>does not affect the three factual findings required in <em>Edwards </em>for the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing to apply, we turn to the evidence at the motion in limine hearing to determine whether it supports the judge\u2019s finding of forfeiture. Tracy Jordan had been a close friend of the victim for twenty years and took care of the victim\u2019s baby daughter. She testified that, at the time of the assault, the victim and the defendant did not have plans to marry. Later, the victim telephoned Jordan and said she had something to tell her but was afraid that Jordan would become angry and \u201close respect\u201d for her. The victim eventually admitted to Jordan that she had married the defendant. When Jordan became upset and questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the victim\u2019s judgment in marrying the defendant, the victim explained that marriage was the only way that she would not have to testify against the defendant in this case. The victim said that she had discussed the matter with the defendant and they had decided to marry because they knew that, if they were married, she would not have to testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The only other witness to testify at the motion hearing was the victim\u2019s sister, Ann Marie Johnson, who had reported the alleged assault to the police against the victim\u2019s wishes. Johnson stated that, when she reported the incident to the police approximately one week after it occurred, she knew of no plans for the victim and the defendant to marry. Although the wedding occurred on January 5, 2008, Johnson did not learn the victim was married until March 10, 2008, three days before Johnson was to respond to a summons to appear in court. The victim said she told Johnson of the marriage so that she would not be \u201cblindsided\u201d by the information in court. The victim told Johnson that she married the defendant because it was the only way she could avoid having to testify in court against the defendant, and she did not want to be the one to put the defendant in jail. Neither Johnson nor any other family member was present at the wedding; Johnson believed that, at the time of the eviden-tiary hearing, four months after the wedding, their parents still did not know of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Though he made no findings of fact, the judge implicitly found that the defendant married the victim with the intent to enable her to claim her spousal privilege and thereby avoid testifying against the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that this implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>finding is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant and the victim were not engaged to be married when the incident occurred on December 13, 2007, but they were wed in town hall on January 5, 2008, after Johnson reported the incident to the police but before the arraignment, while the defendant remained a fugitive. The defendant knew that, as a result of the marriage, the victim would be entitled to the spousal privilege, and that the victim intended to exercise the privilege because she did not want her testimony to cause his conviction. Even if the idea to marry originated with the victim, the defendant agreed to marry, and the victim\u2019s spousal privilege existed only because of his agreement. In these circumstances, the judge was entitled to infer that the defendant intended to make her unavailable to testify by agreeing to marry her. The judge did not need to find that making her unavailable as a witness was the defendant\u2019s sole or primary purpose in marrying her; it is sufficient that it was a purpose in marrying her. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Montague, </em>421 F.3d 1099, 1103-1104 (10th Cir. 2005) (to establish forfeiture by wrongdoing, sufficient for prosecution to prove that \u201cwrongdoing was at least partially intended to procure the declarant, his wife\u2019s, unavailability\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>405 F.3d 227, 242 (4th Cir.), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 912 (2005) (\u201cdefendant need only intend \u2018in part\u2019 to procure the declarant\u2019s unavailability\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d 635, 654 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 534 U.S. 897 (2001), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir. 1996), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 1118 (1997) (to establish forfeiture by wrongdoing, prosecution \u201cneed only show that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>\u2018was motivated <em>in part </em>by a desire to silence the witness\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">2. <em>Due process. </em>Even though the defendant forfeited his right to object on both confrontation and hearsay grounds to the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements, he is still entitled to due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>446 Mass. 61, 67-70 (2006) (defendant in probation revocation hearing has no right of confrontation but entitled to due process). Where we have found forfeiture by wrongdoing, and in other instances in which we have found good cause to dispense with the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, we have concluded that due process requires that any hearsay admitted against the defendant be reliable. See <em>Edwards, supra </em>at 540 n.21 (\u201cThere may be some statements so lacking in reliability that their admission would raise due process concerns\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108 (1990) (probation revocation hearing). While due process does not bar the Commonwealth from proceeding solely on the basis of hearsay, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>414 Mass. 193, 196 (1993), where \u201chearsay is offered as the only evidence\u201d against the defendant, \u201cthe indicia of reliability must be substantial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We look now to the evidence at trial to determine whether the hearsay statements admitted were sufficiently reliable to satisfy due process. Jordan, a friend of the victim for twenty years, testified that she cared for the victim\u2019s baby while the victim was at work. On December 13, 2007, when the victim arrived with the baby, Jordan noticed and commented to the victim that the baby seemed uncharacteristically sad. The victim began to cry and, when she regained her composure after several minutes, stated that the night before, at 2 a.m., the defendant had broken into her house, entered her bedroom, attempted to strangle her, held a knife to her throat, and threatened to kill her. She awoke to find him with his hands around her neck. The victim told Jordan that the defendant then held a large knife up to her neck and said that \u201cif he wasn\u2019t going to kill her, he was going to kill himself.\u201d After some time, the victim was able to calm down the defendant, who slept in the living room that night with the baby. In addition to repeating these statements by the victim, Jordan testified that she observed that the entire side of the victim\u2019s neck was \u201cred\u201d with \u201cstrangle marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Johnson, the victim\u2019s sister, testified that the victim telephoned her on December 16 to tell her that three days earlier, around 3 a.m., the defendant had broken down two doors to enter her home, tried to strangle her, held a knife to her throat, and threatened to kill her. The victim told Johnson that she had been screaming and \u201csomehow\u201d managed to escape the defendant\u2019s grip. The victim stated that she ran into the baby\u2019s room, the baby having awoken crying, and that the defendant then left. Johnson testified that she urged the victim to seek help, but the victim \u201csaid she did not want to be the one to put [the defendant] in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The Commonwealth also offered the testimony of two police officers, Officer Scott Weiner and Detective John Reilly, both of the North Attleborough police department. Officer Weiner testified that he received a telephone call from Johnson on December 19 about the December 13 incident but that he was not able to reach the victim by telephone, despite numerous attempts. Detective Reilly testified that, approximately three hours after he was assigned to investigate Johnson\u2019s complaint regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged domestic abuse of the victim, he spoke to the victim by telephone.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The victim stated that she would not cooperate with the investigation and \u201cthat she was not going to be the one responsible for putting [the defendant] in jail.\u201d However, when Detective Reilly conveyed to the victim the allegations against the defendant \u2014 that he broke into her home by forcing the door open, entered her bedroom, climbed on top of her, held one hand over her throat while holding a knife in the other hand, indicated that he was under the influence of drugs, and threatened to kill her \u2014 the victim acknowledged that \u201c[ejverything that [Detective Reilly] said was true,\u201d except that the defendant had intended to harm himself, not her. The victim agreed to visit the police station to meet with Detective Reilly, but she did not arrive as scheduled, and the detective never met with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We conclude that the hearsay evidence had substantial indicia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>of reliability to satisfy due process, recognizing that the hearsay statements comprised nearly all of the evidence against the defendant, with the exception of Jordan\u2019s physical observation of \u201cstrangle marks\u201d on the victim\u2019s neck and Detective Reilly\u2019s observation of the broken casing of the door to the victim\u2019s house. Jordan and Johnson recounted similar detailed versions of what the victim told them occurred, and the victim confirmed these details in speaking briefly with Detective Reilly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, supra </em>at 121 (similarity of reports and factual detail indicative of reliability). The victim had no motive to deceive her old friend, her sister, or Detective Reilly as to what had occurred, because she did not intend to press charges against the defendant. The circumstances of her revelation to Jordan reflect its spontaneity and, consequently, the unlikelihood of fabrication. Cf. Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(2), at 257 (2010) (excited utterance exception to hearsay rule). Cross-examination did not reveal any motive that Jordan or Johnson may have had to fabricate the victim\u2019s account of the incident. Jordan\u2019s observation of red marks on the victim\u2019s \u201cwhole neck\u201d and Detective Reilly\u2019s observation of the broken door frame at the victim\u2019s house corroborated the victim\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">3. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant argues that it was improper for the prosecutor to make the following statement in her closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">\u201cYou\u2019ve heard some other testimony in this trial about the defendant and the victim getting \u2014 and the alleged victim getting married sometime after the incident. You\u2019ve heard counsel\u2019s argument about whether or not \u2014 how the victim is present in this court room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">\u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to instruct you on the law or any instructions that you\u2019re going to get from the judge; but you, as the jury, can make your own inferences about witnesses and about whether or not they testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the victim\u2019s presence in the court room and her failure to testify. We agree that the prosecutor improperly invited such an inference where no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>inference was warranted, but conclude that the impropriety did not result in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">\u201cNo comment may be made and no adverse inference may be drawn\u201d in a criminal case based on the invocation of a privilege by a witness. Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 525(b)(1), at 161. Because the spousal privilege belongs to the witness spouse, not the defendant spouse, and because the defendant cannot compel the spouse\u2019s testimony, no inference is appropriate from the failure of a spouse to testify. See generally Annot., Propriety and Prejudicial Effect of Prosecutor\u2019s Argument Commenting on Failure of Defendant\u2019s Spouse to Testify, 26 A.L.R.4th 9, 13 (1983) (\u201cIf the privilege of testifying either for or against a defendant spouse is said to belong to the witness spouse, then the courts usually consider it improper for the prosecutor to make adverse comments when the defendant could not have compelled the testimony\u201d). The purpose of the spousal privilege is to protect the relationship of marriage from the potential harm of one spouse giving adverse testimony against the other. See <em>Trammel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 44 (1980) (\u201cmodern justification for this privilege against adverse spousal testimony is its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of the marriage relationship\u201d). If the jury were permitted to draw an inference against the defendant from the spouse\u2019s exercise of her privilege, then the purpose of the privilege would be defeated because the spouse\u2019s silence would be the practical equivalent of adverse testimony. Therefore, it is not proper for an attorney in closing argument in a criminal case to invite the jury to draw an inference from the failure of a spouse to testify.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Here, the defendant testified that he married the victim on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>January 5, 2008, and identified the victim as present in the court room. Defense counsel, in his closing argument, twice reminded the jury that the victim married the defendant after the incident and, immediately before he concluded his argument by asking the jury to find the defendant not guilty, told them that the victim \u201cwas in court yesterday, and she\u2019s present today.\u201d While defense counsel did not argue that the jury should infer from the marriage or the victim\u2019s presence in the court room that the alleged assault had not occurred, his reference to these facts makes no sense except to invite that inference. We understand the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to be in reply to that implicit invitation, which mitigates, but does not justify, the error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 519-520 &amp; n.9 (1987) (prosecutor may object to defense counsel\u2019s argument if improper, and may request appropriate curative instructions, but may not \u201csimply \u2018fight fire with fire\u2019 and exceed the normally proper limits of argument because defense counsel made an improper, excessive argument\u201d). Cf. Annot., <em>supra </em>at 45 (\u201ccourts [have] held that a defendant\u2019s right to complain of an asserted error consisting of a prosecutor\u2019s comments on the failure of the defendant\u2019s spouse to testify was precluded because such error, if it occurred, was invited or provoked by the defendant himself or by the defendant\u2019s attorney\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The defendant did not object to these remarks during or immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Rather, the defendant waited until after the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury to proffer his objection. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s objection . . . made after the jury instructions was too late.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Allison, 434 Mass. 670, 687 (2001). Because the objection was untimely, we review the impropriety to determine whether it posed a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. \u201cRemarks made during closing arguments are considered in the context of</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>the whole argument, the evidence admitted at trial, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caillot, </em>454 Mass. 245, 258 (2009), cert, denied, 130 S. Ct. 1527 (2010).

G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Second. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 504(a), at 104 (2010). The privilege applies even if the spouse and the defendant were not married at the time of the alleged acts that form the basis of the criminal charge against the defendant spouse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>373 Mass. 369, 382-388 (1977). The privilege may be claimed only by the witness spouse, not by the defendant spouse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 595 (1978). The spousal privilege is different from the rule of spousal disqualification, which prohibits each spouse from testifying as to private conversations with the other, but does not apply to a criminal proceeding, as here, where one spouse is charged with a crime against the other. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, First. See Mass. G.

A spouse may be compelled to testify outside the presence of the jury only to determine whether she intends to invoke the spousal privilege. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Fisher, 433 Mass. 340, 350 (2001) (with advance warning that witness might refuse to testify, voir dire may be held to \u201cascertain whether the witness will assert some privilege or otherwise refuse to answer questions\u201d). The spouse cannot be forced to testify regarding her reasons for doing so. See <em>United States </em>v. Montague, 421 F.3d 1099, 1103 (10th Cir. 2005). Nor may she be forced to testify to matters relevant to determining whether the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing should apply, because such testimony could be harmful if it were to result in a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>forfeiture and the consequent admission of her prior hearsay statements against the spouse defendant. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20, Second (spouse shall not be compelled to testify in any \u201ccriminal proceeding against the other\u201d).

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Happnie, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 193, 196-198 (1975), quoting <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Collins Transp. Co., </em>341 Mass. 502, 504 (1960) (prosecution allowed to comment on defendant\u2019s failure to call spouse where spouse \u201cis in the control of the [defendant] and available\u201d). We do not believe that the holdings in these cases continue to reflect our common law. While we permit an inference to be drawn from a defendant\u2019s failure to produce a witness in limited scenarios, this inference requires that the witness be available to the defendant to testify. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 292-294 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ries, </em>337 Mass. 565, 585-586 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>(1958). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryer, </em>398 Mass. 9, 12 (1986) (\u201cWe are sensitive to references to a defendant\u2019s failure to adduce evidence on his behalf because of the necessity to avoid shifting the burden of proof to the defendant\u201d). Here, the victim claimed her spousal privilege at the dangerousness hearing, and the Commonwealth does not contend that she was available to testify. She should not be required to invoke her privilege in the jury\u2019s presence because of the negative inference they may draw from its invocation.
