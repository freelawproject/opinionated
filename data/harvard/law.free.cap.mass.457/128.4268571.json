L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, before offering his admission, and that no record exists indicating that such warnings were given.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While we agree that the statute creates a presumption that the defendant did not receive the warnings, we conclude that he is not entitled to withdraw his admission because, on the record before us, he has not met his burden of demonstrating more than a hypothetical possibility that he faces immigration consequences as a result of the conviction he challenges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">1. <em>Facts and procedural background. </em>In 1986, the defendant was charged in the District Court with receiving stolen property worth one hundred dollars or less, see G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 60; operating a motor vehicle negligently so as to endanger, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24; operating an uninsured motor vehicle, see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34J; and operating an unregistered motor vehicle, see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 9. In 1987, the defendant either pleaded guilty or admitted to sufficient facts with respect to each of the charges. Findings of guilty were entered as to each charge and fines were imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Twelve years later, in 1999, the defendant moved, pro se, for a new trial on the 1986 charges, alleging that the judge failed to warn him of the possible immigration consequences of his admission as required under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. In that motion, the defendant contended also that Federal immigration authorities<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had issued an order to show cause<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> stating that he was subject to deportation based on the 1987 conviction. The defendant filed with the motion his own affidavit claiming that the immigration warnings were not given, together with his own letter stating that he was being detained in Louisiana and was \u201cin deportation proceedings because of this matter.\u201d The District Court scheduled two hearing dates on the motion, but there is no record of any action taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In 2006, the defendant filed another pro se motion to withdraw his 1987 admission to sufficient facts, based on the alleged failure to provide immigration warnings. This motion was denied, and the defendant timely filed a notice of appeal. In 2007, the defendant, now represented by counsel, moved in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Court for reconsideration of the denial of the second motion. He argued that, in both the 1999 and 2006 motions, he had established that he was eligible for relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The defendant attached to his motion for reconsideration a letter to his attorney from a second attorney stating that the 1987 conviction of receiving stolen property, in combination with a later conviction of malicious destruction of property,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> made him eligible for deportation. The motion was denied, and the defendant appealed. The already pending appeal of the denial of the 2006 motion to withdraw the admission to sufficient facts and the appeal of the denial of the 2007 motion to reconsider were consolidated in the Appeals Court. The Appeals Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s rulings in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Grannum, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 1110 (2009). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant argues that, because there are no records demonstrating that he received immigration warnings when he admitted to sufficient facts, he is entitled to a presumption that the warnings were not provided. In addition, he contends that he has met his burden of showing that \u201chis plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated [immigration] consequences\u201d by establishing that his 1987 conviction of receiving stolen property provides a statutory basis for his deportation. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Commonwealth contends that where records are unavailable because of the passage of time, a presumption of regularity should apply to the plea proceedings and the defendant should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>bear the burden of establishing that the warnings were not given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 661-662, 663 (1998). The Commonwealth claims in addition that the defendant is not entitled to relief because he has demonstrated on the record here only a hypothetical possibility that he may face deportation as a result of the 1987 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">a. <em>Presumption that warnings were not given. </em>The statute in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s admission provided that \u201c[ajbsent a record that the [c]ourt provided the [immigration] advisement . . . the defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required advisement.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, inserted by St. 1978, c. 383.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661, 664 (1994), we held that, regardless of how much time has passed since the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, this portion of the statute places the burden on the Commonwealth to rebut the presumption that the defendant was not properly advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The Commonwealth argues that we should modify this holding based on our subsequent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657 (1998). In that case, we considered how the burden of proof should be allocated when a defendant challenges the voluntariness of a guilty plea pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), many years after it was entered. Ordinarily, the Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that a challenged plea was \u201cintelligently and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 107 (2009). However, when a defendant challenges a guilty plea after waiting many years, the tape recording, transcript, and other records of the plea are often unavailable through no fault of the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 661. Records may be unavailable because they have been disposed of pursuant to court rules authorizing the destruction of old records, see S.J.C. Rule 1:12, as appearing in 382 Mass. 717 (1981), and reconstruction may be impossible because of the death, retirement, unavailability, or lack of recollection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the participants in the plea hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra. </em>Accordingly, we concluded that, to avoid unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth, when a defendant challenges a guilty plea after court records have been destroyed lawfully pursuant to court rules, the defendant bears the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 661-662, 664-665. In such cases, the defendant must present evidence sufficient to rebut a presumption that the plea proceeding was conducted correctly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">To date, we have reserved judgment whether this presumption of regularity that applies to collateral challenges to guilty pleas under rule 30 (b) applies also to challenges brought pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, based on the failure to provide immigration warnings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 52 n.7 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, </em>429 Mass. 556, 559 (1999). We conclude today that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 661-662, 664-665, applied a presumption of regularity only to motions to vacate guilty pleas brought under rule 30 (b). Motions to withdraw a guilty plea for failure to provide immigration warnings are \u201cdifferent in kind\u201d and are governed by different standards. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahadeo, </em>397 Mass. 314, 318 n.5 (1986). The presumption of regularity applicable to motions under rule 30 (b) is inconsistent with the language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. That statute provides that, if the court fails to give immigration warnings and the defendant <em>\u201cat any time </em>shows that his plea and conviction may have one of the enumerated consequences, the [cjourt . . . <em>shall </em>vacate the judgment, and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The statute is equally explicit that, absent a record that the warnings were provided, \u201cthe defendant shall be presumed not to have received the required advisement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Thus, the \u201cexplicit language of the statute unambiguously manifests a legislative intent to place on the Commonwealth the burden of proving that the requirements of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, have been satisfied, irrespective of the amount of time that may have passed between a conviction and a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea or his admission to sufficient facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 664. Even though, given this statutory language, there is the possibility of prejudice to the Commonwealth similar to that which led us to adopt the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sumption of regularity for claims brought pursuant to rule 30 (b), \u201c[w]e are not free to ignore or to tamper with [a] clear expression of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra. </em>Thus, the presumption of regularity that warnings were given cannot apply in the face of the specific language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In this case, there is nothing in the record indicating that the defendant received immigration warnings at the time of his admission. Nor has the Commonwealth \u201creconstructed the record\u201d with, for example, evidence from the judge who took the admission or other individuals present when the admission was accepted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, supra </em>at 53-54. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 351-352 (2009) (guidance for reconstructing record of plea proceedings to establish that immigration warnings were given). Therefore, the defendant is entitled to a presumption that he did not receive the immigration warnings, and the Commonwealth has not satisfied its burden to establish that the presumption has been overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">b. <em>Enumerated immigration consequences. </em>In order to be entitled to withdraw his admission due to the absence of immigration warnings, the defendant must show that \u201chis plea and conviction may have or has had one of the enumerated consequences\u201d set forth in the immigration warnings: deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that he may face or is facing one of the enumerated consequences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, </em>441 Mass. 183, 185 (2004). To meet this burden, the defendant must show \u201cmore than a hypothetical risk of such a consequence, but that he actually faces the prospect of its occurring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must demonstrate also that the immigration consequences he may face or is facing were caused by the admission he seeks to nullify. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pryce, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barreiro, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 26 (2006) (defendant must show \u201cnexus . . . between the judge\u2019s defective \u00a7 29D warning and an immigration consequence set out in the statute that materializes as a result of the conviction for which he lacked proper warning\u201d). In this case, the defendant has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The signed affidavit that the defendant submitted in 2006 in support of his motion to withdraw his admission to sufficient facts did not state that he actually faced the prospect of suffering any of the enumerated consequences. It did not attest that he faced an immediate risk of deportation, or that he intended to travel outside the United States and faced a substantial risk of exclusion if he attempted to re-enter, or that he intended to apply to become a naturalized United States citizen if the conviction at issue would not doom his application. In connection with his 2007 motion for reconsideration, the defendant did not present a supplemental affidavit of his own or anyone else; rather, he submitted an unsworn letter from an attorney (who did not represent the defendant) which discussed the potential deportation consequences under Federal immigration law of the defendant\u2019s 1987 conviction of receiving stolen property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The attorney concluded that the 1987 conviction and a 1997 conviction of malicious destruction of property constituted convictions of crimes of moral turpitude that would result in the defendant being classified as deportable. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(ii) (2006 &amp; Supp. II 2008).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this letter, combined with the fact that these two convictions are the only ones that subject him to deportation,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> establishes that he may face an enumerated immigration consequence as a result of the 1987 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Where, as here, deportation is the only enumerated consequence that the defendant attests he may suffer, the defendant must show</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>more than that the challenged conviction forms a statutory basis for that consequence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 50 n.6 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casimir, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 259 (2007). The unsworn attorney\u2019s letter on which defendant relies does not establish that the defendant has been taken into custody by Federal immigration authorities, or that he is currently in deportation proceedings, or has been notified by Federal immigration authorities that he is now subject to deportation, or that, as a result of the challenged conviction (alone or in conjunction with other convictions), the express written policy of the Federal immigration authorities calls for the initiation of deportation proceedings against him.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, supra. </em>Mere eligibility for deportation is not a sufficient basis for relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. Nor is it sufficient to show that, if the Federal government were to initiate deportation proceedings, the defendant almost inevitably would be deported. See <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>130 S. Ct. 1473, 1480 (2010) (\u201cUnder contemporary law, if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of [the amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, 110 Stat. 3009-596], his removal is practically inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses\u201d). Where the defendant claims that he faces a risk of deportation, we construe the statute to require that relief be available only where the defendant shows either that the Federal government has taken some step toward deporting him or that its express written policy calls for the initiation of deportation proceedings against him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, supra </em>at 185. When he filed his 2006 motion to with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>draw his admission to sufficient facts and his 2007 motion to reconsider, the defendant failed to meet his burden of showing more than a hypothetical risk of an enumerated consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his admission to sufficient facts was properly denied. The denial of the motion to withdraw the admission to sufficient facts and the denial of the motion for reconsideration are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Effectively, the defendant\u2019s motion is one for a new trial.

Had the Legislature intended such a result, it could have easily accomplished it by simply providing that an alien, not advised of each of the three enumerated possible immigration consequences, has a right to withdraw his plea at any time.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The court concludes that a showing that an express written policy of Federal immigration authorities calls for the initiation of deportation proceedings based on the challenged offense is sufficient to demonstrate more than a hypothetical risk that the defendant will in fact suffer deportation. See <em>ante </em>at 136. However, until Federal immigration authorities take steps toward deporting an alien, the risk of deportation, in my view, remains hypothetical. Federal authorities possess \u201clong-established discretion to decide whether and when to prosecute or adjudicate removal proceedings or to execute removal orders.\u201d See <em>Cardoso </em>v. <em>Reno, </em>216 F.3d 512,517 (5th Cir. 2000), quoting <em>Alvidres-Reyes </em>v. <em>Reno, </em>180 F.3d 199, 201 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Additionally, \u201c[t]he Attorney General may, in his discretion, waive\u201d in individual cases several of the statutory provisions that render an alien ineligible for admission to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (2006). Furthermore, the Attorney General may cancel removal for aliens who are otherwise inadmissible or deportable if the alien meets certain statutory criteria. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b (2006). The decision to exercise this authority with respect to an alien who meets the statutory criteria is discretionary. See <em>Nadal-Ginard </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>558 F.3d 61, 64 n.4 (1st Cir. 2009); <em>Reyes-Vasquez </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 903, 906 (8th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">In addition, today\u2019s holding will be difficult to administer. Although the court claims that there is little possibility of uncertainty because of the requirement that a Federal immigra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>tion policy be express and written in order to form a basis for relief, see <em>ante </em>at 136 n.14, the court neither defines nor provides examples of the types of policies that would be sufficient. For example, the court recognizes that statutory eligibility for deportation is not sufficient on its own to form a basis for relief. See <em>ante </em>at 135. However, the Federal law defining when an alien is subject to deportation represents a written Federal policy. The court provides no guidance on how to differentiate written policies that are sufficient to form a basis for relief under the statute from those that are not. This will result in much future litigation to decide whether an express written policy is of the type that qualifies a defendant for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Requiring a defendant to establish that the Federal government has taken affirmative steps to bring about deportation provides a \u201cbright line\u201d rule that is consistent with our case law requiring that a defendant face more than a hypothetical risk of deportation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berthold, supra. </em>I believe that such a showing is necessary before permitting relief under the immigration warnings statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\">I agree with the portion of the court\u2019s opinion concluding that the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657 (1998), does not apply to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. See <em>ante </em>at 132-134.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
