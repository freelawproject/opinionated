L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (act): what is the scope of a local zoning board\u2019s authority under c. 40B, \u00a7 21 (\u00a7 21), to impose conditions on the issuance of a comprehensive permit to construct low or moderate income housing; and what is the extent of authority vested in the Housing Appeals Committee (HAC) of the Department of Housing and Community Development (department) under c. 40B, \u00a7 23 (\u00a7 23), to review any conditions that have been imposed? The questions arise in the context of the present appeal by the zoning board of appeals of Amesbury (board) from a judgment of the Superior Court affirming a decision of the HAC. For the reasons that follow, we conclude, in agreement with the Superior Court judge, that under \u00a7 21, the local zoning board\u2019s power to impose conditions is not all encompassing, but is limited to the types of conditions that the various local boards in whose stead the local zoning board acts might impose, such as those concerning matters of building construction and design, siting, zoning, health, safety, environment, and the like. We further conclude that in reviewing a developer\u2019s appeal from a comprehensive permit approved with conditions under \u00a7 23, the HAC is authorized in the first instance to review and strike conditions that were not within the board\u2019s power to impose, even though such conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>may not render the project \u201c[ujneconomic\u201d as that term is defined in c. 40B, \u00a7 20 (\u00a7 20).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The relevant facts are not in dispute. On June 2, 2005, pursuant to \u00a7 21, the developer, Attitash Views, LLC (Attitash), submitted an application to the board for a comprehensive permit. Attitash sought to construct a forty-unit condominium development, containing ten affordable units, at 131A Haverhill Road in Amesbury. The board held its first public hearing regarding the permit application on June 28, 2005, and subsequent hearings were held on various dates between June 28 and July 13, 2005. It was not until September 27, 2006, that the board issued its decision. At that time, it granted the permit application, but attached ninety-four conditions, some of which contained additional subconditions, to its approval. The subject matter of the conditions imposed on Attitash ranged from typical zoning issues, such as construction, density, and bedroom limitations, to nonzoning restrictions, such as land acquisition values and allowable profit, regulatory documents, and marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On October 16, 2006, Attitash appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the HAC pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in January, 2007, it filed a motion for summary decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Attitash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>included with its motion an affidavit of its counsel explaining that he had received a letter from the manager of the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency\u2019s (MassHousing\u2019s) comprehensive permits programs (MassHousing letter), and that Mass-Housing had concerns with certain conditions imposed by the board. A copy of the MassHousing letter, dated January 16, 2007, was attached as an exhibit. In Attitash\u2019s memorandum of law in support of its motion, Attitash argued that several of the conditions (or subsections of conditions)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> imposed by the board were legally beyond the authority of the board to impose; improperly infringed on the role of the State or Federal subsidizing agency in the comprehensive permit process; or rendered the project uneconomic or otherwise incapable of obtaining funding. Attitash included three additional exhibits with its memorandum of law: (1) a copy of MassHousing\u2019s Form B-114, entitled \u201cAffordable Housing Restriction,\u201d and applicable to projects in which affordability restrictions survived foreclosure; (2) a memorandum addressed to \u201cLocal Officials and Housing Colleagues\u201d from the former director of the department, describing the limited role zoning boards of appeals may have in monitoring of comprehensive permit projects; and (3) \u201cProposed Revisions to Decision Pursuant to Memorandum of Law in Support of Appellant/Applicant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d a document described by the HAC as a \u201cred-lined\u201d version of the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board filed an opposition to the developer\u2019s motion for summary decision, and included with it certain supporting documentation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>By letter dated May 24, 2007, the presiding officer indicated that Attitash\u2019s appeal raised \u201cemerging policy considerations\u201d and sought the participation of both the department and Mass-Housing. In response to the invitation, the department filed a motion to participate as an interested person accompanied by a memorandum of law, and MassHousing drew the HAC\u2019s attention to a brief it had filed as amicus curiae in another appeal pending before the HAC that, in MassHousing\u2019s view, raised similar issues. After these submissions were filed with the HAC, the board requested an oral hearing, but the presiding officer determined that \u201cthe record [was] sufficiently clear,\u201d to decide the matter by summary decision without a hearing, and denied the request.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The summary decision record before the HAC showed that Attitash was proceeding under two alternative funding programs. In particular, Attitash proposed to finance the condominium development under either the Housing Starts program, pursuant to which MassHousing would provide the subsidized funding, or the New England Fund, subsidized by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. Under either funding program, Attitash would be unable to commence construction until it received final approval from MassHousing, and if the New England Fund subsidized the project, MassHousing would also serve as the project administrator. In this regard, the MassHousing letter submitted by Attitash stated that MassHousing would be unable to provide funding or allow the project to proceed if certain MassHousing requirements were made subject to local permit requirements, and specifically identified ten of the conditions imposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>board that would prevent funding or the necessary final approval of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">On October 15, 2007, the HAC issued a summary decision, granting Attitash\u2019s motion and removing or modifying most of the conditions to which it objected. The HAC noted the board\u2019s argument that Attitash must prove that the conditions rendered the development uneconomic, but determined that the normal requirement of showing a condition to be uneconomic was inapplicable, as Attitash\u2019s challenge was to the legality of the conditions. In concluding that the board lacked the authority to impose the conditions, the HAC stated that the board went \u201cbeyond its traditional role of reviewing the siting and design of the housing development\u201d and attempted to: \u201climit how the housing may be subsidized!/] involve itself in the drafting of the documents that ensure long-term affordability!/] shape the group of people who will be eligible to rent the housing!/] influence how the housing will be marketed!/] dictate how parts of the calculation of the profit limitation will be conducted!/] restrict the choice of the agent that will monitor the development!/] and otherwise insert itself into programmatic aspects of the development.\u201d The HAC further stated that while many of the conditions imposed by the board and objected to by Attitash were important to effective administrative and oversight of such a project, under the statutory scheme embodied in the act, these requirements were best reserved for State government rather than local zoning boards of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">In November, 2007, the board timely filed an appeal from the HAC\u2019s decision in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, and in July, 2008, it filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, together with oppositions from Attitash and the HAC. A judge in the Superior Court heard the motion on January 7, 2009.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge provided an oral decision from the bench, denying the board\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ruling in favor of the HAC and Attitash.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judgment affirming the HAC\u2019s decision entered two days later, and the board filed a timely appeal. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>All parties agree that the focus of the HAC\u2019s review in this case was the board\u2019s \u201capproval of [Attitash\u2019s] application with conditions.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the conditions it imposed, the board makes two general arguments. We consider them separately.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\u201cThe hearing by the [HAC] shall be limited to the issue of whether, in the case of the denial of an application, the decision of the board of appeals was reasonable and consistent with local needs and, in the case of an approval of an application with conditions and requirements imposed, whether such conditions and requirements make the construction or operation of such housing uneconomic and whether they are consistent with local needs. If the [HAC] finds, in the case of a denial, that the decision of the board of appeals was unreasonable and not consistent with local needs, it shall vacate such decision and shall direct the board to issue a comprehensive permit or approval to the applicant. If the [HAC] finds, in the case of an approval with conditions and requirements imposed, that the decision of the board makes the building or operation of such housing uneconomic and is not consistent with local needs, it shall order such board to modify or remove any such condition or requirement so as to make the proposal no longer uneconomic and to issue any necessary permit or approval; provided, however, that the [HAC] shall not issue any order that would permit the building or operation of such housing in accordance with standards less safe than the applicable building and site plan requirements of the federal Housing Administration or [MassHous-ing], whichever agency is financially assisting such housing. Decisions or conditions and requirements imposed by a board of appeals that are consistent with local needs shall not be vacated, modified or removed by the [HAC] notwithstanding that such decisions or conditions and requirements have the effect of making the applicant\u2019s proposal uneconomic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>a. <em>The board\u2019s authority under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. </em>First, the board argues that under \u00a7 21, it has the authority to impose \u201cappropriate conditions\u201d dealing with the full panoply of issues that might pertain to a low or moderate income housing development, including those that are of concern to MassHousing as the State subsidizing and program supervising agency \u2014 for example, allowable profit margins, the contents of regulatory documents between Attitash and its funding agency, and marketing. Accordingly, the board states, \u201cit is <em>the [bjoard\u2019s authority </em>to impose conditions pursuant to G. L. c. 40B that may not be usurped by the subsidizing agency\u201d (emphasis in original). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Section 21 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cAny public agency or limited dividend or nonprofit organization proposing to build low or moderate income housing may submit to the board of appeals ... a single application to build such housing in lieu of separate applications to the applicable local boards. . . . The board of appeals . . . shall have the same power to issue permits or approvals as any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application, including but not limited to the power to attach to said permit or approval conditions and requirements with respect to height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials as are consistent with the terms of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The clear import of this provision, defining as it does the board\u2019s power in terms of that belonging to a \u201clocal board,\u201d is that the board, when acting on an application for a comprehensive permit under the act, has the same scope of authority as \u201cany town or city board of survey, board of health, board of subdivision control appeals, planning board, building inspector or the officer or board having supervision of the construction of buildings or the power of enforcing municipal building laws, or city council or board of selectmen.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20 (definition of \u201c[ljocal [b]oard\u201d). See <em>Dennis Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 78-79 (2003). In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>as defined in \u00a7 21, the power of the board derives from, and is generally no greater than, that collectively possessed by these other bodies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Because the board\u2019s authority is tied to that of \u201clocal boards,\u201d the scope of issues that it permissibly may address through conditions is necessarily limited to the types of concerns and powers of these boards. We have interpreted the listing of agencies and officials in the act\u2019s definition of \u201clocal board\u201d in \u00a7 20 as representative rather than exact, and have looked at the functions they perform rather than their title. See <em>Dennis Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass, at 78-79. These functions relate to matters of clear local concern, such as building construction, zoning and subdivision control, land use planning, as well as health and safety of local residents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>This point is underscored by the provision in \u00a7 21 describing the board\u2019s power to attach to an approval \u201cconditions and requirements with respect to height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials as are consistent with the terms of this section.\u201d See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Groton </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm.., </em>451 Mass. 35, 40 (2008).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The board points to the phrase in \u00a7 21 stating that its authority to \u201cissue permits or approvals\u201d in connection with a comprehensive permit application is the same as a local board, <em>\u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d </em>the power just described, namely, to impose conditions concerning \u201cheight, site plan, size or shape, or building materials\u201d (emphasis added). In the board\u2019s view, this phrase operates as a springboard to a world of limitless opportunity and authority insofar as setting permit conditions are concerned. The board is mistaken. Established principles of statutory construction teach that the general phrase \u201cconditions and requirements\u201d in \u00a7 21 is cabined by the specific examples that follow it to conditions of the same or similar kind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zubiel, </em>456 Mass. 27, 31 (2010) (\u201cWhen elements are listed in a series, the rules of statutory construction require the general phrase to be construed as restricted to elements similar to the specific elements listed\u201d). See also <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Freetown-Lakeville Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em>392 Mass. 656, 660 &amp; n.8 (1984), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 91 (1975) (principle of ejusdem generis is a \u201crule of construction . . . employed to ascertain the correct meaning of words by limiting \u2018general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar to those specified\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Following these principles, we conclude that although the board\u2019s condition-setting power under \u00a7 21 is not expressly confined to the four or five examples specifically mentioned in the section, that power is circumscribed in substance by those examples, and conditions imposed by the board must fit within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>the same kind or class of local concern or issue that the examples address. Accordingly, insofar as the board\u2019s ninety-four conditions included requirements that went to matters such as, inter alia, project funding, regulatory documents, financial documents, and the timing of sale of affordable units in relation to market rate units, they were subject to challenge as ultra vires of the board\u2019s authority under \u00a7 21.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cThe phrase \u2018permits or approvals,\u2019 read in the context of the entire Act, refers to building permits and other approvals typically given on application to, and evaluation by, separate local agencies, boards, or commissions whose approval would otherwise be required for a housing development to go forward. This interpretation is virtually compelled by the language, \u2018who would otherwise act with respect to such application,\u2019 appearing in \u00a7 21. The interpretation is further supported by the examples expressly cited in \u00a7 21, namely, action typically required by local permitting authorities with respect to \u2018height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>b. <em>The HAC\u2019s authority to review local zoning board conditions under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. </em>We turn to the board\u2019s second argument. Relying on our recent decision in <em>Board of Appeals of Woburn </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 581 (2008) <em>(Woburn), </em>and \u00a7 23 of the act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the board contends that, in cases concerning an approval rather than a denial of a comprehensive permit application, the HAC\u2019s authority is restricted to the \u201cnarrow\u201d and sequential considerations whether (a) At-titash, as the developer, proved that the board\u2019s conditions rendered its project \u201cuneconomic,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (b), if Attitash met that burden, the board proved the conditions were nonetheless \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d See note 13, <em>supra. </em>The board\u2019s argument follows that because Attitash did not make the necessary \u201cuneconomic\u201d showing, the HAC could not entertain an assessment of local needs, and in particular, was without power to review, much less strike or modify, any of the board\u2019s conditions for any reason. The HAC takes a different view of \u00a7 23. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>It suggests that the section\u2019s provisions concerning the HAC\u2019s authority to review a local zoning board\u2019s approval of a permit application with conditions implicitly concern conditions within that board\u2019s power to impose; and that the section does not prohibit the HAC from undertaking to review a local zoning board\u2019s conditions to determine whether the conditions fit within the ambit of a local zoning board\u2019s authority under \u00a7 21. The HAC characterizes this type of review as one that is \u201cantecedent\u201d to its consideration whether the conditions render the project uneconomic, and, if so, they are \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d It argues that the exercise of this preliminary review is an appropriate way to further a core purpose of the act, that is, to streamline the process for obtaining the necessary authorization to build much needed low and moderate income housing. See, e.g., <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 29 (2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\u201cany condition brought about by any single factor or combination of factors to the extent that it makes it impossible for a public agency or nonprofit organization to proceed in building or operating low or moderate income housing without financial loss, or for a limited dividend organization to proceed and still realize a reasonable return in building or operating such housing within the limitations set by the subsidizing agency of government on the size or character of the development or on the amount or nature of the subsidy or on the tenants, rentals and income permissible, and without substantially changing the rent levels and units sizes proposed by the public, nonprofit or limited dividend organizations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>In seeking to determine the meaning of a statute, we give \u201cparamount importance to the language of the act in order to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 523 (2007) (Middleborough), citing <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). However, where, as here, there may be ambiguity or a gap in the statute, \u201cthe details of legislative policy are to be spelled out \u2018in the first instance by [the] agency charged with administration of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middleborough, supra, </em>quoting <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 654 (1982). See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 149,153-154 (2008); <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 523-524. Cf. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). We give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), and \u201capply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra, </em>quoting <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). [This] stage of our analysis requires \u2018substantial deference\u2019 to the expertise and statutory \u2018interpretation of [the] agency charged with primary responsibility\u2019 for administering a statute. ... [A] \u2018[S]tate administrative agency in Massachusetts has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing,\u2019 unless a statute unambiguously bars the agency\u2019s approach.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass, at 633, quoting <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 241, 253 (1999), and <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">\u201cThe Legislature\u2019s intent in [enacting G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23,] was to provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevented the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 353-354 (1973). See, e.g., <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass, at 28-29; <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 820-821 (2002). \u201cThe statute reflects the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment that a crisis in housing for low and moderate income people demands a legislative scheme that requires the local interests of a town to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>yield to the regional need for the construction of low and moderate income housing, particularly in suburban areas.\u201d <em>Stander-wick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra </em>at 29. As we have noted in many other cases, to effectuate this purpose, the act establishes a streamlined comprehensive permitting procedure, which allows a developer to file a single application with the local zoning board of appeals for construction of low or moderate income housing. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21.

In addition to streamlining the permitting process, the Legislature sought to \u201cpromote affordable housing by minimizing lengthy and expensive delays occasioned by court battles commenced by those seeking to exclude affordable housing from their own neighborhoods.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The board\u2019s restrictive interpretation of the HAC\u2019s authority under \u00a7 23 would frustrate the purposes of the act. Cf. <em>id. </em>at 30 (abutting landowners claiming diminished real estate values did not have standing to challenge issuance of comprehensive permit, in part because purpose of act would be frustrated). As the HAC argues, if, on challenge by a developer, the HAC was without the authority to decide whether a condition was or was not permissible under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21, the developer would be forced to file separate appeals: one with the HAC to challenge conditions on the ground that adherence to them would render the project uneconomic, and another in the Superior Court in the form of a declaratory action to determine whether the board had the authority to set the conditions in the first instance. The consequences of this dual system of review could be devastating in terms of costs and delays, and the creation of new affordable housing would be impeded or even prevented by such a tedious process. Such inefficiency is not consistent with the purpose of the statute, and an interpretation that embraces it should be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Where the focus of the statutory enactment is one of reform, as is indisputably true of the act, see <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass, at 347, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>administrative agency charged with its implementation should construe it broadly so as to further the goals of such reform.\u201d <em>Middleborough, </em>449 Mass, at 524, quoting <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 774 (2002). In light of this principle, as well as the tenets we have discussed that generally govern our review of administrative action and the objectives of the act, we accept the HAC\u2019s reading of \u00a7 23 as reasonable, consistent with the statutory language and purposes, and appropriate. Thus, we conclude that under \u00a7 23, the HAC may, in the context of reviewing a developer\u2019s challenge to a local zoning board\u2019s approval with conditions, consider whether some or all of the challenged conditions are within the power of a local zoning board to impose or whether they otherwise intrude impermissibly into areas of direct programmatic concern to State or Federal funding and regulatory authorities. Authorizing the HAC to strike or modify conditions that fall outside the range of issues set out in \u00a7 21 \u2014 in addition to conditions that come within the scope of \u00a7 21 but are shown by the developer to render the project uneconomic \u2014 disposes of all related issues between the same parties in a single forum while providing an aggrieved party with the opportunity for review through an appeal to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The interpretation of \u00a7 23 that we adopt here is not precluded by our recent decision in the <em>Woburn </em>case, where we reviewed the HAC\u2019s action of revising conditions imposed by Woburn\u2019s board of appeal, most significantly increasing the approved project size from 300 units to 540 units, after finding that the board\u2019s conditions did not make the project uneconomic. <em>Woburn, </em>451 Mass, at 590. We emphasized that in the case of an approval with conditions, the provisions of \u00a7 23 require the HAC to subject conditions imposed by the board to an \u201cuneconomic\u201d analysis before balancing the conditions against local needs. <em>Id. </em>at 594. There is a critical distinction between <em>Woburn </em>and the present case. In <em>Woburn, </em>there was no claim by the developer, and no determination by the HAC, that the conditions set by the local board of appeals were beyond its statutory authority to impose under \u00a7 21 of the act. Rather, our discussion of \u00a7 23 in <em>Woburn </em>reflects an analysis of its clear requirements as applied to a set of conditions that the local zoning board was authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>to impose, however onerous they might be. This case, unlike <em>Woburn, </em>involves consideration whether the HAC has the authority under \u00a7 23 to review conditions separate from any \u201cuneconomic\u201d analysis. We have determined that the HAC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 23, permitting this form of review, is appropriate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">c. <em>The conditions struck or modified by the HAC in its summary decision. </em>The board asserts that the HAC erred in deciding this case by summary decision, which is the administrative equivalent of a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The HAC concluded that summary decision was proper because the parties had no dispute about what the conditions attached to the board\u2019s grant of the comprehensive permit to Attitash were, and it was the conditions themselves that were at issue. The board now argues that this conclusion is incorrect, principally if not solely on the ground that issues of material fact exist as to whether the conditions rendered the project uneconomic. We have determined in this opinion that the HAC properly could focus on the nature of the board\u2019s conditions themselves before undertaking a review of whether they rendered Attitash\u2019s project uneconomic. We agree with the HAC that as to the terms of the conditions themselves, the record does not reveal any disputed issues of material fact, and the HAC was within its power to resolve the appeal before it by summary decision. We turn briefly to the conditions that Attitash challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Generally speaking, the HAC\u2019s decision to modify or eliminate most of these conditions was based on a determination that they concerned matters that were properly within the regulatory responsibility of State housing agencies, such as MassHousing and the department, and not of local concern. The structure of the act itself reflects a \u201ccareful balance between leaving to local authorities their well-recognized autonomy generally to establish <em>local zoning requirements . . . </em>while foreclosing municipalities from obstructing the building of a minimum level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>of housing affordable to persons of low income\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Woburn, </em>451 Mass, at 584, quoting <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass, at 822-823. We have discussed in Part 2 (a) the fact that the legitimate concerns of a \u201clocal board\u201d generally pertain to building construction and design, zoning, health, and safety. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21; 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 31.06(6) (2004). In contrast, the question, for example, of who should determine whether a developer had met the requirements of a limited dividend organization eligible to receive State or Federal subsidy \u201cis properly left to the appropriate State or Federal funding agency.\u201d <em>Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass, at 379.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Some of the challenged conditions \u2014 in particular, conditions 23, 26, 28, 29, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43F, 43G, and 43H \u2014 relate to regulatory documents (deed rider, monitoring services, and regulatory agreement); \u201cFannie Mae\u201d affordable housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>restrictions (ownership nature of the project, number of affordable units and means of calculating income eligibility, and the manner of ensuring unit affordability in perpetuity); profit limitation; and marketing. We have earlier rejected the board\u2019s claim that these conditions were within its authority to impose simply because nothing in \u00a7 21 expressly bars it from doing so. These conditions do not relate to the class of local concerns contemplated by \u00a7 21, but as the HAC concluded, they fit within the responsibility of State or Federal funding and supervising agencies. There was no legal error in the HAC\u2019s treatment of the conditions. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">A review of the remaining conditions reveals that the HAC struck two of them in their entirety \u2014 viewing conditions 42 (requiring board approval of the project monitoring agent) and 54 (requiring that affordable units be constructed and sold coincident with the development of market rate units), as appropriately left to the subsidizing agency \u2014 but also appeared to acknowledge that other conditions may not have been beyond the board\u2019s authority to impose. The latter were either modified slightly or left unaltered.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Again, we discern no legal error in these determinations by the HAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The only decision or order of the HAC in the record of this case is its summary decision. For all the reasons discussed, we agree with the Superior Court judge that the substance of the HAC\u2019s summary decision in this case was correct. However, at the decision\u2019s conclusion, the HAC allowed Attitash\u2019s motion for summary decision in its entirety, even though the HAC, in the body of its ruling, had rejected some of Attitash\u2019s challenges to the board\u2019s conditions in whole or in part. In the circumstances, we remand this matter to the Superior Court with the direction in turn to remand it to the HAC for modification of its disposition of Attitash\u2019s motion for summary decision in a manner that will reflect precisely which of the conditions challenged by Attitash have been struck, which have been modified, and which have been retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The following are the conditions imposed by the Board of Appeals of Ames-bury that were challenged in whole or in part by Attitash Views, LLC, the developer, in its appeal to the Housing Appeals Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">\u201cIn accordance with the powers conferred to the Board by 760 [Code Mass.

Should the Applicant after diligent efforts be unable to obtain any reasonable financing due to the aforementioned requirement that the affordable housing restriction is senior to any liens, the Applicant may then request the Board waive or modify the affordable housing restriction. Upon a showing that the Applicant has been unable to obtain any reasonable financing despite diligent efforts because of the affordable housing restriction, then the Board may waive or modify the same to the extent necessary to permit the Applicant to obtain reasonable financing. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\"><em>\u201cProfitability </em>&lt;6</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">&lt;6</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">\u201c38.

Almost sixteen months elapsed between the time Attitash filed its application for the permit on June 2, 2005, and the board issued its decision on September 27, 2006; the HAC\u2019s decision was issued one year after Attitash filed its appeal from the board\u2019s decision, and nine months after Attitash filed its motion for summary decision; and the Superior Court hearing on the board\u2019s appeal, held January 7, 2009, took place fourteen months after the appeal was filed. (Fortunately, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>judge issued his decision from the bench, there was no time lapse between the Superior Court hearing date and the date of the decision.) This extremely relaxed schedule of hearing and at least administrative decision flies in the face of the purpose of the comprehensive permit act, G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (act), which is to streamline the permitting process. See discussion in Part 2(b), <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Although the judge concluded that the HAC had the authority under the act to determine whether the local board had exceeded its jurisdiction in imposing certain conditions on a developer, he concluded in the alternative that the contested conditions could be grouped into two categories. The ten conditions identified in the MassHousing letter properly could be struck by the HAC on the ground that they rendered the project uneconomic, but the remaining fourteen conditions would need to be the subject of a remand to the HAC, where Attitash would have the burden of proving that those conditions were uneconomic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The first paragraph of G.

Rather, the process for such routine inspection was already clearly established. Thus, the HAC determined that the conditions were unnecessary or superfluous, and imposed minor modifications to them. Similarly, conditions 18, 19, and 20, together, required the developer to comply with local zoning, subdivision, wetlands, and public health requirements. Again, the HAC recognized that the developer need comply with local requirements, but modified the provisions only to ensure that compliance was measured by local requirements in effect on the date of the application to the board, rather than at the time of the board\u2019s decision or when a building permit is sought.
