(Callahan), a general contractor with whom the town has entered into a contract for the construction of a new high school. The injunction ordered the town and Callahan to cease further work on the school pending a trial on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the contract had been entered into in violation of the public bidding statutes, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, because Callahan had made intentional misrepresentations to the town\u2019s prequalification committee regarding its experience in school building projects. We affirm the order of the single justice, though on different grounds from those expressed in his order. Although a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tractor\u2019s intentional misrepresentation in seeking prequalification may allow an awarding authority to terminate a previously awarded contract, we conclude that where, as here, there is no allegation that any member of the town\u2019s prequalification committee acted corruptly in deciding to prequalify Callahan, there is unrefuted evidence that the committee did not act in reliance on any of the alleged misrepresentations, and the town wishes to proceed with the contract, the motion judge committed an error of law in issuing a preliminary injunction requiring the town to cease further work on the school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2) (D), contracts for the construction of public buildings that are estimated to cost more than $100,000 may only be awarded to \u201cthe lowest responsible and eligible general bidder\u201d on the basis of competitive bids and in conformity with procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. Where, as here, a public construction project has an estimated cost in excess of $10 million, a general contracting firm must satisfy two requirements to be deemed a \u201c[Responsible\u201d and \u201c[ejligible\u201d bidder. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (1). First, the contractor must hold a certificate of eligibility, issued by the commissioner of the division of capital asset management and maintenance (DCAM), showing that the firm has the expertise and financial capacity to perform the work required. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A (2) (D), 44D (1) <em>(a). </em>Second, the contractor must be pre-qualified to bid on the project by a four-member committee of the awarding authority, that is, the agency, municipality, or other governmental authority awarding the contract,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> based on the contractor\u2019s responses to questions contained in a written request for qualifications (RFQ) issued by the committee. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(a) </em>&amp; (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">While the questions that must be asked in the RFQ and the potential points to be awarded in each category of questions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>specified by statute, the relative value assigned to each individual question and the scoring of contractor responses is committed to the discretion of the prequalifying committee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This allows a prequalification committee to evaluate a general contractor\u2019s experience and qualifications in light of the specific needs of the particular project for which the awarding authority will be soliciting bids. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(a)-(h). </em>Only general contractors whose responses to the RFQ receive a score of seventy points or more may be prequalified by the committee, and only prequalified contractors may be invited to submit bids on the project. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h). </em>\u201cThe prequalification committee shall select a minimum of [three] qualified general contractors to submit bids . . . <em>Id. </em>Section 44D V2 <em>(h) </em>protects the considerable discretion vested in the prequalification committee by providing that all decisions of the committee \u201cshall be final and shall not be subject to appeal except on grounds of arbitrariness, capriciousness, <em>fraud </em>or collusion\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In conformity with these statutory requirements, in May, 2009, the town issued a RFQ inviting interested general contractors to submit statements of qualification (SOQs) to prequalify to bid on the construction of a new high school. Eleven general contractors submitted SOQs by the June 5 deadline, and on July 6, the town reported the results of the committee\u2019s evaluation in a public register. Callahan was one of nine applicants prequali-fied by the committee to submit formal bids on the project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>General bids were opened by the town on September 11. Callahan was the low bidder, with a base price of $37,099,999. The next low bidder was almost one million dollars higher.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">On September 17, 2009, N.B. Kenney Company, Inc., a heating and air conditioning subcontractor whose subbid had not been adopted in Callahan\u2019s winning general bid, filed a bid protest with the Attorney General, who is charged with enforcement of the competitive bidding statutes. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H. The Attorney General also received bid protests from J &amp; J Contractors, Inc., the second lowest bidder among the general contractors, and from the Laborers\u2019 New England Region Organizing Fund. The protesters alleged that the committee\u2019s decision to prequalify Callahan was obtained through fraud because Callahan\u2019s SOQ contained misrepresentations of the firm\u2019s prior construction experience that were intended to mislead the committee. Consequently, they argued, Callahan should have been disqualified as an eligible bidder, and the town should be prohibited from entering into a contract with Callahan. Following the filing of the protests, the town requested and received additional information from Callahan about the representations made in its SOQ concerning the company\u2019s prior construction experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In response to the bid protests, the Attorney General undertook an investigation and asked the town to refrain from awarding the contract or commencing work on the project while her investigation was ongoing. On September 24, however, the town issued Callahan a notice to proceed. At the bid protest hearing later that month, the Attorney General requested that the town suspend further work on the project pending her determination of the bid protests on the merits. Notwithstanding these requests, the town entered into a general contract with Callahan on or about October 15 and proceeded with construction. Two weeks later, on October 30, the Attorney General issued a decision which essentially confirmed the allegations of the bid protestors.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The Attorney General concluded that Callahan had committed \u201cfraud\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>by knowingly misrepresenting material facts in its SOQ with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the intention of misleading the prequalifying committee. The Attorney General found that Callahan had misleadingly identified itself in its SOQ as the \u201csuccessor corporation\u201d to another general contracting company, J.T. Callahan &amp; Sons, Inc. (JTC). In fact, although many of the senior managers of Callahan were former employees of JTC, Callahan had been incorporated independently, JTC continued to survive as a corporation, and the two companies shared no corporate officers. According to the Attorney General, the effect of this misrepresentation was to permit Callahan in its SOQ to claim JTC\u2019s experience in building seventy-five schools in Massachusetts over the preceding twenty years, when Callahan itself lacked this kind of project experience. More specifically, where the SOQ required a listing of \u201cSimilar Project Experience\u201d undertaken by the firm in the last five years, defined by the prequalification committee to mean construction of \u201cphased educational facilities,\u201d the only educational facility Callahan included was North Andover High School, a $42 million project completed in 2005.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, JTC had been the general contractor on this project and had completed nearly all of the work before running into financial difficulties. In order to finish the project, the insurance company serving as JTC\u2019s surety recommended the formation of a new corporate entity, Callahan, which employed former JTC personnel and in effect acted as a subcontractor for JTC. Under this arrangement, Callahan completed the final $1.2 million of work on the $42 million project, comprising three per cent of the school\u2019s total construction cost. The Attorney General also found that Callahan had made selective use of JTC\u2019s prior history in its SOQ: while Callahan took credit for JTC\u2019s work on the North Andover High School project and its almost twenty years of public construction experience, Callahan did not list the North Andover High School project where the SOQ required disclosure of projects the applicant had failed to complete, and Callahan similarly failed to disclose pending or adversely concluded legal proceedings against JTC, although the SOQ also called for this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Based on these findings, the Attorney General concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Callahan should not have been prequalified by the committee, and as a consequence, that Callahan should not have been awarded the contract. When the town made no move to halt construction or terminate its contract with Callahan following the Attorney General\u2019s announcement of her bid protest decision, the plaintiffs, ten taxable inhabitants of the town, brought suit in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53, seeking temporary and permanent injunctive relief to restrain the town from making payments to Callahan under the contract and to require the town to rescind the contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>'<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiffs alleged that Callahan had committed fraud during the mandatory bidder prequalification procedure, that its fraud effectively voided the decision of the prequalification committee under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>and that, because Callahan could no longer be considered a \u201cresponsible and eligible bidder,\u201d the town\u2019s award of the contract to Callahan was unlawful under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">After a nonevidentiary hearing on November 16, 2009, the motion judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the town and Callahan to cease further construction of the school pending a trial on the merits. In reaching his decision, the judge held that, in contrast to common-law fraud, there is no requirement of detrimental reliance to prove fraud under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h). </em>Relying principally on the reasoning of earlier bid protest decisions issued by the Attorney General, the judge concluded that, to succeed on the merits in their effort to overturn the decision of the prequalifying committee under \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>the plaintiffs need only establish that \u201c(1) Callahan made statements or omissions relating to a material fact, (2) that had the tendency to be relied upon by or to influence the average person, (3) that were knowingly false or misleading, and (4) were intended to mislead the prequalification committee or awarding authority.\u201d After setting forth this standard for fraud under the statute, the judge found that the plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits at trial because Callahan\u2019s misrepresentation of its prior construction experience on the North Andover High School project, together with its failure to mention in the SOQ that JTC had failed to complete that project, were \u201chighly suggestive\u201d of Callahan\u2019s intent to deceive the prequalification committee. The judge also concluded that the public interest favored the issuance of a preliminary injunction, because \u201c[t]he inconvenience and expense caused by the delay in the construction of the school is of significantly less importance than ignoring this type of disregard for the competitive bidding statute.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Presumably because he deemed it irrelevant under his interpretation of the meaning of fraud under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>the judge did not address unrefuted evidence in the record that the prequalification committee had not been misled by the misrepresentations in Callahan\u2019s SOQ and had not relied on them to its detriment. Affidavits submitted by two members of the four-person committee stated that, before the committee prequali-fied Callahan to bid, the committee members knew and had discussed the true nature of the relationship between Callahan and JTC, and were aware that JTC, not Callahan, had done the great majority of the work on North Andover High School. The committee\u2019s consideration of this information is reflected in the fact that it awarded Callahan two out of a possible ten points for similar project experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The defendants sought relief from a single justice of the Appeals Court under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. In reviewing the motion judge\u2019s grant of the preliminary injunction, the single justice adopted the judge\u2019s factual findings as well as his interpretation of the meaning of fraud under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h). </em>The single justice agreed that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, but he determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>motion judge had \u201cinsufficiently considered the fact that enjoining performance on the contract will shut down the project for several months (or longer) as the town sorts through the bid protests and conducts the re-bidding process. . . . [Sjhutting down this project will result in substantial cost for the town.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthe judge\u2019s failure to place these factors on the scale governing preliminary injunctive relief resulted in an abuse of discretion,\u201d and he vacated the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the single justice\u2019s order to the full Appeals Court, Mass. R. A. R 3 (a), as amended, 378 Mass. 927 (1979),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and we transferred the case here on our own motion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>In reviewing the allowance of a preliminary injunction, whether that review is conducted by a single justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., or by an appellate court reviewing a decision of the single justice, the standard is whether the <em>motion </em>judge abused his discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction. See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 709 &amp; n.7, <em>717 </em>(1990) (vacating suspension of preliminary injunction ordered by single justice); <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 615 (1980) (standard of review framed in terms of abuse of discretion). In conducting our review, we decide \u201cwhether the judge applied proper legal standards and whether there was reasonable support for his evaluation of factual questions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, </em>452 Mass. 733, 741 (2008). See <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra. </em>On review, the motion judge\u2019s \u201cconclusions of law are subject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, quoting <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>United States Postal Serv., </em>508 F.2d 259, 267 n.24 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>The motion judge did not abuse his discretion in finding from the circumstantial evidence that Callahan knowingly made false or misleading statements of material fact in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>SOQ with the intention of misleading the prequalification committee. Therefore, in determining whether the judge abused his discretion in finding that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail at trial, the key issue is whether the judge was correct as a matter of law in concluding that Callahan\u2019s intentional misrepresentations constituted fraud within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>even in the absence of evidence of detrimental reliance by the prequalification committee. We conclude that he erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Fraud is not a defined term under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>and no appellate court of the Commonwealth has previously decided any claim involving this statute. Under the common law, fraud is a knowing false representation of a material fact intended to induce a plaintiff to act in reliance, where the plaintiff did, in fact, rely on the misrepresentation to his detriment. See <em>Masingill </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>449 Mass. 532, 540 (2007); <em>Barrett Assocs. </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>346 Mass. 150, 152 (1963). As earlier noted, in bid protest decisions issued pursuant to her authority under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44H, to enforce compliance with the competitive bidding statutes, the Attorney General has asserted that proof of fraud under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>does not require the element of detrimental reliance. See, e.g., Matter of Everett High Sch. Elec. Subcontract, Att\u2019y Gen. Bid Protest Decision (Nov. 2, 2006); Matter of Police Headquarters and East Fire Station, Att\u2019y Gen. Bid Protest Decision (Aug. 10, 2006). However, these bid protest decisions, because they arise from the Attorney General\u2019s prosecutorial, rather than her adjudicative, function, carry no precedential weight. See <em>Brasi Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>456 Mass. 684, 694 (2010); <em>Annese Elec. Servs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>431 Mass. 763, 771 (2000). See also <em>E. Amanti &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>R.C. Griffin, Inc., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 253 (2001); <em>Department of Labor &amp; Indus, </em>v. <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019n, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 621, 623-624 n.7 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">To determine the meaning of \u201cfraud\u201d as used in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>we look to the intent of the Legislature \u201cascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). We do not read statutory language in isolation. <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Norwell, </em>430 Mass. 328, 333 (1999). \u201cWhere possible, we construe the various provisions of a statute in harmony with one another, recognizing that the Legislature did not intend internal contradiction.\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 491 (2009). In a case such as this, where the meaning of a single word in a statute is at issue, we generally infer that the Legislature intended the word be interpreted in accordance with its \u201cordinary and approved usage.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 454 (2007). Where a statute employs a word with an established meaning in the common law, we consider the statute in light of that meaning, and we do not construe the statute as \u201ceffecting a material change in or repeal of the common law unless the intent to do so is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 438 (1980). See <em>Busalacchi </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 493, 497 (2008) (\u201cWithout a clear expression from the Legislature breaking with the common law, the common law will apply\u201d). Nowhere in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H, does the Legislature direct us to disregard the well-settled common-law meaning of fraud in interpreting and applying \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(K) </em>which, in the context of an intentional misrepresentation, requires detrimental reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Notwithstanding these familiar principles of statutory construction, the plaintiffs, the Attorney General, and the two judges who ruled on the injunction concluded that the Legislature intended that a contractor\u2019s intentional misrepresentation would constitute the fraud necessary to vacate a decision of a prequali-fying committee under \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>even where the contractor\u2019s deception falls short of common-law fraud. The plaintiffs contend that this conclusion is compelled by the objectives of the competitive bidding statutes, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44H. A careful examination of the evolution of these statutes, however, reveals that, in the context of a claim of intentional misrepresentation, defining fraud under \u00a7 44DV2 to mean common-law fraud, as the defendants contend, respects the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 44DV2 and is consistent with the over-all objectives of the competitive bidding statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The basic framework of the Commonwealth\u2019s contemporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>competitive bidding statutes was created thirty years ago when the Legislature repealed the previously enacted public construction statute and adopted a series of amendments that extensively revised the Commonwealth\u2019s system of public construction. See St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55. See also St. 1984, c. 484, \u00a7 46. These revisions were undertaken in response to a report issued by the Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings chaired by Amherst College President John William Ward (Ward Commission), which documented extensive corruption in the awarding of public construction contracts and proposed comprehensive remedial legislation. See <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Norwell, supra </em>at 332; <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. Lowell, 391 Mass. 829, 832 n.5 (1984). Accordingly, the statute enacted in 1980 states as its purpose the creation of a system of public construction which will provide fair costs, professionalism, and accountability, and which will \u201creduce [] opportunities for corruption, favoritism, and political influence in the award and administration of public contracts.\u201d St. 1980, c. 579, Preamble. The statute is intended \u201cnot only to ensure that the awarding authority obtain the lowest price among responsible contractors, but also to establish an open and honest procedure for competition for public contracts.\u201d <em>Modern Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The competitive bidding statutes in effect before 1980, as they do today, required that public construction contracts be awarded to the \u201clowest responsible and eligible bidder,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but prior to the reform undertaken following the Ward Commission report, there were no useful statutory or regulatory criteria for what constituted a responsible and eligible bidder and no centralized system to monitor and document the competency and integrity of contractors undertaking public construction projects.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See 8 Ward Commission Report at 343-346 (Final Report 1980); Note, Prescribing Preventive Remedies for an Ailing Public Construction Industry: Reforms Under the New Massachusetts Competitive Bidding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Statute, 23 B.C. L. Rev. 1357, 1359-1364 (1982) (Note). It was instead left to each awarding authority, at its option and without the benefit of guidelines issued by an expert authority, to solicit information from prospective contractors that might allow it to determine whether a bidder firm was competent to perform the work under consideration in an honest and professional manner. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44A, as appearing in St. 1956, c. 679, \u00a7 1 (\u201cEssential information in regard to such qualifications shall be submitted in such form as the awarding authority may require\u201d); 8 Ward Commission Report, supra; Note, <em>supra. </em>Because the law required that contracts be awarded to the lowest bid received from a \u201cresponsible and eligible bidder,\u201d but provided minimal guidance for determining whether a bidder was \u201cresponsible and eligible,\u201d the result too often was that all bidders were deemed \u201cresponsible and eligible,\u201d regardless of their competency or experience, and the selection of a contractor was based solely on price. This resulted in a widespread problem of defective construction work requiring extensive repair. See Note, <em>supra </em>at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Beginning with the Ward Commission legislation enacted in 1980, the Legislature required bidders to provide specified information regarding their competence and experience to the awarding authority, which the awarding authority was required to evaluate \u201caccording to procedures and criteria which the deputy commissioner [of DCAM<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] shall prescribe by regulations or guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (3), as appearing in St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55. In 1984, the Legislature transferred responsibility for determining whether a bidder was \u201cresponsible and eligible\u201d to DCAM. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (3), as appearing in St. 1984, c. 484, \u00a7 46. Any bidder for a public construction contract now must submit as part of the bid process a certificate of eligibility from the commissioner of DCAM showing that the bidder has the classification and capacity rating to complete the project on which it is bidding. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (1) <em>(a). </em>Certificates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>eligibility, which must be renewed annually, are issued only after DCAM\u2019s review of the contractor\u2019s prior construction experience, professional references, financial condition, and organizational capacity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (l)-(3). DCAM may \u201cdecertify a contractor or reduce the classes of work and amount of work on which the contractor is eligible to bid,\u201d if DCAM learns of a contractor\u2019s incompetence, poor performance, or misconduct. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (5). A contractor who is debarred or whose certification is suspended, revoked, or not renewed by DCAM, loses the ability to contract for construction work from any public authority in the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 29F; G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44E.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">It was not until 2004, with the enactment of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2, inserted by St. 2004, c. 193, \u00a7 19, that awarding authorities were required to prequalify general contractors for individual projects; the statutory requirement, however, applies only to projects estimated to cost at least $10 million.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 (a). Section 44DV2 was one of several amendments proposed by a special commission, see St. 2003, c. 46, \u00a7 138, charged with recommending legislation to improve the \u201cadequacy and efficiency\u201d of the public construction laws. While the 1980 and 1984 legislation had standardized the review and monitoring of contractors under the centralized administration of DCAM, many of the 2004 amendments enhanced the flexibility and discretion of municipalities, State agencies, and other governmental authorities in managing their own construction projects.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See St. 2004, c. 193, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 19, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">As a result of the 2004 legislation, a general contractor who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>submits a bid for a project costing at least $10 million has been twice qualified for the work, initially through the DCAM certification procedure, and then again by the prequalification committee\u2019s approval of the applicants\u2019 specific responses to its RFQ.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The prequalification process serves to ensure that parties who may be \u201cresponsible and eligible bidders\u201d in a general sense also have the particular skills and experience most relevant to the project at issue. It also requires the awarding authority to invest substantial time and effort, and exercise its sound discretion, in determining the considerations critical to the project and assigning points within the statutory categories accordingly, and then, after submission of the SOQs, in scoring the responses of potential bidders according to the weighted criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The 2004 legislation narrowly limited the grounds for appealing from the committee\u2019s prequalification decision: \u201cA general contractor\u2019s score shall be made available to the general contractor upon request. The decision of the prequalification committee shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal except on grounds of fraud or collusion.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h).</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In determining the meaning of \u201cfraud\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>we note that the logical implication of the sequence of these two sentences \u2014 with the sentence governing an appeal from a decision of the prequalification committee following immediately after the sentence declaring that a general contractor is entitled to learn the score given to its SOQ by the prequalification committee \u2014 is that the Legislature anticipated that a general contractor denied prequalification might seek to challenge the committee\u2019s scoring of the contractor\u2019s SOQ. In such an appeal, \u201cfraud\u201d could not mean an intentional misrepresentation in the SOQ itself, because a general contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>challenging an unfavorable decision of the committee would not allege that it was entitled to relief because it had intentionally misrepresented material information in its own SOQ. Rather, in the context of a general contractor challenging the denial of its <em>own </em>prequalification, \u201cfraud\u201d must mean corrupt conduct <em>by one or more members of the committee </em>designed unfairly to prevent the general contractor from being prequalified to bid. Pragmatically, in this context, \u201cfraud\u201d would surely involve \u201ccollusion,\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>a corrupt agreement between at least one member of the committee and another person, most likely a competing general contractor seeking to fix its competitor\u2019s score below the minimum threshold for prequalification to prevent that competitor from bidding. See <em>Dickerman </em>v. <em>Northern Trust Co., </em>176 U.S. 181, 190 (1900); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 300 (9th ed. 2009) (collusion is \u201c[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain something forbidden by law\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The Legislature, however, did not foreclose an appeal from a decision of a prequalification committee from third parties. Because G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 (g), provides that the \u201cregister of responders shall be open for public inspection,\u201d and, on completion of the evaluations by the prequalification committee, the \u201ccontents of the [SOQs] shall be open to the public,\u201d we infer that the Legislature also recognized the possibility of an appeal from an allowance of prequalification by a fellow bidder or a member of the general public based, at least in part, on the contents of the SOQ. In this context, \u201cfraud\u201d could still mean corrupt conduct by one or more members of the committee, alone or in collusion with another, but we do not so limit its meaning. We conclude that, consistent with its common-law meaning, \u201cfraud\u201d in this context means a fraudulent misrepresentation by a general contractor applying for prequalification that the committee relied on to its detriment in qualifying the general contractor to bid. In the absence of detrimental reliance by the committee, a general contractor\u2019s intentional misrepresentation, even if intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>deceive the committee, does not constitute \u201cfraud\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>and therefore does not require that the committee\u2019s prequalification of the contractor be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We believe that this conclusion is consistent with the comprehensive legislative scheme embodied in the public construction statute for two reasons. First, we do not believe the Legislature, by allowing a prequalification decision to be appealed from on grounds of \u201cfraud,\u201d intended to require an awarding authority to disqualify a general contractor or terminate a construction contract because of an intentional misrepresentation in a SOQ where the committee did not act corruptly or in reliance on the misrepresentation and where, in its discretion, the awarding authority does not wish to disqualify the contractor or terminate the contract. Under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D (2), \u201c[a]ny materially false statement\u201d made by a general contractor in its application for DCAM certification or its update statement \u201cmay, in the discretion of the awarding authority, result in termination of any contract awarded the applicant by the awarding authority.\u201d As a result, where an awarding authority learns that a general contractor with whom it has contracted has made an intentional misrepresentation in either of these two filings, the awarding authority may terminate the contract, but is not required to do so. The awarding authority retains this discretion even though a certificate of eligibility from DCAM and an update statement are both mandatory elements of a general contractor\u2019s SOQ. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(e) </em>(4).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under the interpretation of \u201cfraud\u201d proffered by the plaintiffs and the Attorney General, if an intentional misrepresentation were made in a SOQ or an incorporated update statement rather than an application for DCAM certification, an awarding authority would lose this discretion because a court, as the motion judge did here, could enjoin the awarding authority from continuing with the contract. We see nothing in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>to suggest that the Legislature intended to deny an awarding authority the discretion it has under G. L. c. 149, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00a7 44D(2), simply because the materially false statement appears in a committee-scored portion of a SOQ rather than in an application for DCAM certification or update statement. In addition, we note that, even where a general contractor\u2019s misconduct results in debarment or suspension by DCAM, the Legislature did not require termination of the contractor\u2019s existing public construction contracts. Rather, pursuant to G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 29F <em>(h), </em>a public agency may not \u201cexecute, renew, or extend any contract with, a debarred or suspended contractor,\u201d but it need not rescind or terminate a contract.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Second, giving the word \u201cfraud\u201d its common-law meaning under \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h) </em>does not conflict with the \u201ctransparent\u201d legislative intent that the competitive bidding statutes \u201cestablish an open and honest procedure for competition for public contracts.\u201d <em>John T. Callahan &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>430 Mass. 124, 128 (1999), quoting <em>Modem Cont. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 840 (1984). In formulating the provisions of \u00a7 44DV2 in 2004, the Legislature had no need to, and did not, concern itself with remedying intentional misrepresentations that do not infect a prequalification committee\u2019s decision-making process because sufficient means to remedy this kind of misconduct \u2014 and thereby to ensure the integrity of the public bidding process \u2014 were already provided by statute. A general contractor who makes an intentional misrepresentation in a SOQ with the intention of deceiving the prequalification committee risks grave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>sanctions, regardless of whether the committee acted in reliance on the misrepresentation. The commissioner of DCAM has broad statutory authority to debar a contractor from public contracting based on \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the contractor has \u201cwillfully supplied] materially false information incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain or performing any public contract or subcontract.\u201d G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 29F (c) (2) (i). See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44C. Under regulations promulgated by the commissioner, wilfully supplying false material information in obtaining or attempting to obtain any public contract or subcontract within the last five years \u201cshall constitute cause for de-certification or denial of certification.\u201d 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(8)(e) (2005). The \u201c[f]ailure to provide accurate information\u201d to any party with whom a contractor does business may also be grounds for denial of certification or debarment. 810 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.04(6) (2005). Finally, a contractor making an intentionally false statement in a SOQ risks criminal conviction and its consequent penalties. An applicant must sign the SOQ \u201cunder pains and penalties of perjury,\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44D1/2 <em>(e) </em>(ii), so a wilful false statement in the SOQ may subject the applicant to a perjury charge. G. L. c. 268, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 1A. Moreover, any person who intentionally makes a material false statement, or omits or conceals a material fact in a written statement, in attempting to procure a construction contract from any department, agency, or municipality of the Commonwealth, may be charged criminally under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 67A.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>In view of our interpretation of the meaning of fraud under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44DV2 <em>(h), </em>we conclude that the motion judge committed an error of law in determining that the plaintiffs would not need to prove detrimental reliance by the prequalification committee to prevail on their claim for injunc-tive relief. As a result of this error, because there is no allegation that any member of the prequalification committee acted corruptly in deciding to prequalify Callahan, and because there is unrefuted evidence that the committee did not act in reliance on any of the alleged misrepresentations, the motion judge abused his discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits at trial. Having so found, we need not reach the issue whether a preliminary injunction would promote or adversely affect the public interest, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>preliminary injunction cannot survive if the plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We affirm the single justice\u2019s order vacating the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">We acknowledge amicus briefs filed by the Attorney General; Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc.; the Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts; the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association; Construction Industries of Massachusetts, Inc., and Utility Contractors Association of New England, Inc.; Foundation for Fair Contracting of Massachusetts and Brockton &amp; Vicinity Building Trades Council; and TFT Construction Corp.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201cThe prequalification committee shall be comprised of 1 representative of the designer and 3 representatives of the awarding authority.\u201d G.
