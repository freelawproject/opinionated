Following a disciplinary hearing resulting in his conviction and a three-month suspension without pay, plaintiff filed a <em>de novo </em>appeal in the Law Division pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-22. The Law Division judge found that plaintiff had been disciplined for offenses beyond the scope of the charges and specifications. We conclude that the charges and specifications provided adequate and appropriate notice of the charges; accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">We briefly review the essential facts adduced at the hearing. The genesis of the underlying disciplinary proceeding arises from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>a false fire alarm perpetrated by members of the Department. On November 9, 1998, plaintiff and others went to Scotty\u2019s Bar in Springfield. During the course of the evening, one of plaintiffs colleagues, Chris Lalevee, was instrumental in instigating a third party to call in a false alarm. The record supports the finding that plaintiff participated in a preliminary discussion about the call and then joined the other perpetrators at or near the area of the telephone. Although plaintiff denied that he was in the bar at the time of the call, the hearing officer made a factual determination that plaintiff \u201cwas most likely present in the bar when the call was made.\u201d The incident resulted in criminal charges against Lalevee and another firefighter, and ultimately, in disciplinary charges against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The issue on appeal focuses upon the nature and quality of those charges and specifications. Plaintiff was served with a Notice of Disciplinary Action. It includes detailed specifications as to the incident and sets forth as Charges violations of Articles I and VI(A), (B), (C) and (J) of the Rules and Regulations of the Springfield Fire Department (a copy of the charges and specifications is attached as Appendix A). After considering the witness testimony and exhibits presented, the hearing officer concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5H\">Based on. the above as well as the preponderance of the evidence and testimony as presented I find that Joseph Pepe did have knowledge of the false alarm call which was initiated and carried through by Firefighters Lalevee and Voorhees. I further find that Joseph Pepe did not attempt to restrain or report the incident. However, I find that Joseph Pepe did not instigate the incident and was more an accomplice by knowledge and association but because of his relationship to the other firefighters involved did not report the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Therefore I find that Firefighter Joseph Pepe violated Article 1.5 of the Rules and Regulations of the Springfield Fire Dept., and Article VI.A for his failure to put the needs of the Department ahead of his personal relationships, Article VI.B.l for his failure to notify the appropriate supervisors of his knowledge with respect to the false alarm call and Article VI.C.l., 2., 7., 11., 12. because of his failures to properly notify the appropriate authorities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">As such Joseph Pepe\u2019s conduct was not consistent with that required by the Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The hearing officer recommended a penalty of three months suspension rather than dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>On appeal to the Law Division and motion for summary judgment, plaintiff asserted that he was disciplined for offenses for which he was not charged. He claimed that he was never advised of being charged with failure to restrain or report a violation. The Law Division judge agreed, and concluded that plaintiff was found guilty of charges not included in the specifications and \u201cnot given a chance to defend against those particular charges.\u201d The judge then set aside the suspension, ordered back pay, and stayed the decision pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cPlain notice\u201d is the standard to be applied when considering the adequacy of disciplinary charges filed against public employees. \u201cIt is elementary that an employee cannot legally be tried or found guilty on charges of which he has not been given plain notice by the appointing authority.\u201d <em>Town of West New York v. Bock, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>500, 522, 186 A.2d 97 (1962). <em>See also Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus v. Menduno, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 485, 221 A.2d 228 (App.Div.1966) (noting that a public employer can only find an employee guilty of offenses specifically mentioned in the charges). These principles emanate from the concept of affording due process and fairness to proceedings which impact so significantly on an employee. <em>See, e.g., Hammond v. Monmouth County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 206, 721 A.2d 743 (App.Div. 1999) (noting that an appointing authority\u2019s broadening of local-level charges on subsequent appeal would \u201csurcharge the right to appeal with a cost which violates any decent sense of due process or fair play\u201d); <em>In re Caldwell v. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 615-17, 595 A.2d 1118 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>555, 606 A.2d 367 (1991) (noting the \u201c \u2018essential requirements of due process ... are notice and an opportunity to respond\u2019 \u201d before any significant deprivation of an employee\u2019s constitutionally protected property interest in his employment) (quoting <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>532, 545-46, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1487, 1495, 84 <em>L.Ed.M </em>494, 506 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that plaintiff had full notice of the charges and specifications, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ultimate conclusion reached by the hearing officer fell well within the four corners of those charges and specifications. We observe that plaintiffs specific involvement in the incident was the crux not only of the disciplinary prosecution, but of plaintiffs defense as well. In agreeing with plaintiff that he was not a principal participant in the false alarm scheme, the hearing officer nevertheless concluded that plaintiffs actions were akin to an accomplice, as he knew of the incident and took no action in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We agree with the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff was in violation of the charges, and we reject plaintiffs view that the disciplinary determination was beyond their scope. The hearing officer found that plaintiff was present at the scene, overheard the conversation about the false alarm, and took no action. Plaintiffs defense was that he knew nothing about the false alarm and was not present when the call was made. To suggest that the failure to establish that he actively participated in the call precludes a finding that he knew of the call and took no action is too myopic a view of the charges and specifications and the underlying requirement of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Plaintiffs knowledge of the event was necessarily the underpinning of any charge against him. It was the seminal fact that had to be established, whether plaintiff was an active participant or simply an accomplice. That is the fact which plaintiff challenged in defense to the charges and which the hearing officer decided against him. Once plaintiffs knowledge was established, the duties incumbent upon any firefighter as clearly set forth in the Code of Ethics and the Notice charges applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">We need not dwell upon whether the ultimate charges were \u201clesser included.\u201d In our view, the obligation of reporting such a clear violation of the law is so basic and primary to a firefighter\u2019s duties that plaintiffs argument of lack of notice rings hollow. Any citizen using common sense, let alone a firefighter, would recognize that false alarms place citizens and firefighters at significant personal risk by deploying scarce public resources to respond to charades when those resources may be needed elsewhere for real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>emergencies. The obligation of fair notice to plaintiff was unquestionably met in this case, and the judge erred by dismissing the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The charges against plaintiff must now be tested on the merits at a <em>de novo </em>hearing. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:14-22. Accordingly, we remand the matter to the Law Division for such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Township of Springfield Fire Department</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">By: Chief William Gras Springfield Fire Department Township of Springfield County of Union State of New Jersey</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">* NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION *</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\n<em>DISCIPLINARY CHARGES AGAINST FIREFIGHTER JOSEPH PEPE III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-19 and the Township of Springfield Fire Department Rules and Regulations, I hereby make the following charges against Firefighter Joseph Pepe III of the Springfield Fire Department, Township of Springfield, County of Union, State of New Jersey, and request that a hearing be held by the Township Committee of the municipality or its designee, and the proper action be taken therein, in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">I. SPECIFICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">On November 9, 1998, Firefighter Pepe while off duty went to Scotty\u2019s Restaurant with numerous other members of the Department. Sometime between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m., Pepe, together with Firefighter Christopher La[l]evee and Firefighter Donald Voo-rhees attempted to have a citizen call in a false alarm to the Fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Department. The citizen refused. Having failed in their first attempt, the three (3) firefighters requested that an employee of Scotty\u2019s Restaurant transmit the false alarm call. In order to induce the person to make the false alarm call, payment was offered. The three (3) firefighters along with the woman proceeded to place a telephone call to the Fire Department using a public telephone at Scotty\u2019s and then had the woman state that there was a leaf fire at 9 Kipling Avenue in Springfield. Witnesses reported that the firefighters were laughing and acting like the entire matter was a big joke. Immediately after placing the telephone call, the three (3) firefighters left Scotty\u2019s stating that they knew that their beepers would be activated and that they should not be in the restaurant when the call was traced to Seott[y\u2019]s. In addition to the false alarm, there also was a leaf fire started in the Township that same evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">As a result of the call, the Fire Department responded to Kipling Avenue. There was no 9 Kipling Avenue nor was there any fire. It was clear that the call was a false alarm. As part of the investigation, Captain Rau requested that an officer review the Department\u2019s caller ID to determine from where the false alarm call was made. It was determined that the call was placed from a public telephone at Scotty\u2019s Restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">After the incident was reported to the Department, an investigation was conducted by the Union County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Arson Unit. The Department was notified that Firefighters Voo-rhees and Lalevee were to be criminally charged. Firefighter Lalevee was placed on unpaid suspension as a result of the criminal charges. Firefighter Voorhees was discharged without a hearing because he was a probationary employee. At that time, the Department was unaware that there was a third firefighter involved in the matter. It was only after the two (2) firefighters cut their deal with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office was Pepe\u2019s involvement in the matter disclosed to the Department. Once his identity was provided, an investigation was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The investigation included a meeting with Pepe, who denied any wrong-doing, involvement or knowledge that a false alarm was called in by Firefighters Lalevee and Voorhees. However, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office provided the Department with copies of interview memoranda of the witnesses to the events. One witness positively identified Pepe as being involved in the matter. Although the Prosecutor\u2019s Office did not indict Pepe, the matter was turned over to the Department for internal consideration relative to Firefighter Pepe. On or about April 25, 1999, the witness provided by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office was questioned about the incident. During the course of the interview, the witness corroborated her statements contained in the interview memorandum and clearly implicated Firefighter Pepe not only in knowing that a false alarm was going to be made, but that he accompanied Lalevee and Voorhees to the public telephone to have the woman make the call to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">II. CHARGES</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">By engaging in the conduct set forth in the specifications above, Firefighter Joseph Pepe III violated his oath of office and Articles I, VI(A), (B), (C) and (J), of the Rules and Regulations of the Springfield Fire Department.
