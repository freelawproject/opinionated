Thus, we deem the Bank's opposition to the motion for the turnover of funds to be a motion to intervene as of right pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:33-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b344-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b344-14\">RODRIGUEZ, A.A., J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">Generally, when a check is deposited into an account at a depository bank, it may take one or more days for the check to be processed through the banking system. When it reaches the payor bank, funds are remitted to the depository bank. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>meantime, a depository bank may provide an interim or provisional credit to its customer for the amount of the deposited check. If the payor bank refuses to honor the deposited check for any reason, the depository bank charges back or withdraws the provisional credit from its customer. The issue presented in this appeal is whether a depository bank can charge back a provisional credit, after a levy has been placed on the account. We hold that a provisional credit is not property that can be levied upon. Therefore, the depository bank can charge back against the provisional credit, despite the existence of a levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Intervenor, Skylands Community Bank (Skylands), appeals from an order that requires it to turn over to the Sheriff of Morris County (Sheriff) $14,236 by virtue of a levy on Medi-Peth Medical Lab, Inc. (MPM) accounts. The levy was issued by the Sheriff pursuant to a judgment obtained by DNI Nevada, Inc. (DNI) against MPM. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The facts can be summarized as follows. DNI sued MPM and obtained a judgment by default. As part of the effort to satisfy the judgment, the Sheriff levied on MPM\u2019s accounts at Skylands. The day before the levy, MPM deposited three checks in its three Skylands accounts. These checks were issued by MPM and were drawn on accounts that MPM had at different institutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The next business day, MPM was given a provisional credit in its Skylands accounts to reflect these deposits. Around 10:30 A.M. that same day, the Sheriff levied upon MPM\u2019s accounts at Sky-lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">After the levy and pursuant to its policy, Skylands notified MPM of the levy via fax. MPM immediately stopped payment on the checks it had deposited with Skylands. Two business days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>later, Skylands received the cheeks returned with \u201cstop payment\u201d notices from the payor banks. Skylands charged back the three MPM accounts. The charge back caused two of MPM\u2019s accounts at Skylands to be overdrawn, and the third to have a $591.55 balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">A representative of Skylands notified the Sheriffs office about this situation. At the direction of the Sheriffs office, DNI\u2019s attorney called Skylands to discuss the issue. Thereafter, DNI filed a motion for turnover of the levied funds. Skylands objected. Following oral argument, the judge ordered Skylands to turn over $14,236 to DNI to discharge the levy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge stayed the order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On appeal, Skylands contends that the judgment should be reversed because: (a) MPM\u2019s provisional credit for the checks was subject to Skylands\u2019 right to charge back; (b) the judge erred in finding that DNI\u2019s rights under the levy were greater than those of Skylands; and (c) the judge erred in ruling that Skylands must look to MPM for collection of the $14,236. We agree with these contentions and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The issue presented is purely a question of law. Therefore, we are not required to show deference to a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Tp. Committee of the Tp. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 <em>A.2d </em>1230 (1995); <em>see also Pearl Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Watts, </em>69 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 205, 174 A.2d 90 (App.Div.1961) (holding that appellate courts should utilize a plenary standard when its decision rests solely upon legal consequences of undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-201a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that a depository bank is only required to give a provisional credit for checks deposited that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>have not yet been paid. A provisional credit can be revoked at any time prior to the deposit becoming final. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-214a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that when a depository bank gives a provisional credit on an item that is later dishonored or suspended, \u201cthe [depository] bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer\u2019s account, or obtain refund from its customer.\u201d It does not matter whether or not funds are immediately withdrawn after a provisional credit is given by the depository bank; the depository bank will not be precluded from charging back the provisional credit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-214d(l). If, as a result, the account is overdrawn, the depository bank can seek a refund from its customer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-214a.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In conjunction with these state statutes, banks are required to abide by federal banking laws. The Expedited Funds Availability Act, 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 4001 to \u00a7 4010, sets forth requirements regarding the availability of certain check deposits. Except in certain circumstances, a depository bank must make most deposited checks available on the next business day. 12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 4002. Specifically, the statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">[N]ot more than 1 business day shall intervene between the business day on which funds are deposited in an account at a depository institution by a check drawn on a local originating depository institution and the business day on which the funds involved are available for withdrawal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">[12 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 4002(b)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">However, to address issues regarding uncollectible deposits, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System promulgated Regulation CC found at 12 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 229. Pursuant to this regulation, the immediate availability of funds does not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">(c)(2) [ajffect a depository bank\u2019s right</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">(ii) [t]o revoke any settlement made by the depository bank with respect to a check accepted by the bank for deposit, to charge back the customer\u2019s account for the amount of a cheek ..., or to claim a refund of such credit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>[12 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 229.19(c)(2)(ii).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Therefore, as with the provisional credits discussed under state law, federal guidelines provide a depository bank with a mode of recourse when funds made available by deposited checks are subsequently dishonored or otherwise deemed uncollectible. The depository bank can charge back the account. If the account becomes overdrawn, the depositor bank can seek a refund from its customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">That is precisely what Skylands has done here. It charged back MPM\u2019s three accounts. As a result, two of the accounts have become overdrawn and contain no funds that can be levied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">It is clear, and DNI does not dispute, that Skylands can seek a refund from MPM for the amount of these overdrafts. However, DNI argues that the levied funds cannot be charged back because the levy would have the same effect as a check presented for payment. DNI argues that Skylands\u2019 only recourse is to look to its customer for a refund. DNI asserts that if a check had been drawn on the MPM\u2019s Skylands accounts, Skylands would have been forced to pay it. This would have exhausted the provisional credit and Skylands would be forced to seek the overdraft funds from its customer. DNI asserts that the levy should be treated the same as a check drawn on MPM\u2019s accounts at Skylands. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Federal and state regulations governing the availability of funds in the context of banking transactions do not convert a provisional credit, which is a fictitious fund, an asset that can be levied upon. In this context, the levy is not the same as payment of the funds to a third party. Skylands can charge back against those funds even if they are levied upon. A depository bank may do so because its right to charge back is superior to the rights of a levying judgment creditor of the depositor. This conclusion is supported by the official comments to the pertinent section of the statute. <em>UCC </em>comment 5 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-201 indicates that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>If a collecting bank has made an advance on an item which is still outstanding, its right to obtain reimbursement for this advance should be superior to the rights of the owner to the proceeds or to the rights of a creditor of the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Therefore, Skylands\u2019 right to charge back would take precedence over DNI\u2019s status as a levying creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We find support for our conclusion in the caselaw. In <em>All American Auto Salvage v. Camp\u2019s Auto Wreckers, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>15, 679 A.2d 627 (1996), the Supreme Court held that a depository bank has a right to setoff reasonable processing fees against its customer\u2019s account, even after a creditor levies on that same account. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 679 A.2d 627 (quoting Barkley Clark <em>&amp; </em>Barbara Clark, <em>The Law of Bank Deposits, Collections and Credit Cards </em>121.04, at 21-4 (Revised ed.1995 &amp; Supp.1996)). Although the Supreme Court only addressed a depository bank\u2019s processing fees, the case demonstrates that certain setoffs can be allowed even though a creditor has \u201cfrozen\u201d a judgment debtor\u2019s account via a levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Reversed and remanded to the Law Division for the entry of an order to vacate the turnover order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> The particulars of these transactions are as follows: a $2,000 check drawn on a Lakeland Bank account was deposited into Skylands' Business Account 205000290; a $5,000 check drawn on a Lakeland Bank account was deposited into Skylands' Business Account 205000053; and a $3,000 check drawn on a Summit Bank account was deposited into Skylands' Business Account 205000355.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Both parties agree that this amount is in error. Although the amount of the judgment was $14,000 plus $236 taxed costs, the collective balances on MPM\u2019s accounts at Skylands, prior to the stop payments, totaled $9,378.68. Thus, at the most the levy affected only $9,378.68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Article 4-201 of the <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>(UCC).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\"> <em>UCC </em>Article 4-214.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
