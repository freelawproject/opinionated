The insurance coverage dispute arises out of an accident that occurred on November 15,1993 at Ball-In-Con Glass Packaging Corp. in Carteret, New Jersey, in which Ramon Perez (\u201cPerez\u201d), an employee of Ball-In-Con, sustained a paralyzing injury while driving a forklift in the process of unloading pallets from a tractor trailer. The tractor trailer was owned and operated by Blue Diamond Company (\u201cBlue Diamond\u201d). Sonoco Products Company, Inc. (\u201cSonoco\u201d) loaded the pallets onto the tractor trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">At the time of the accident, Blue Diamond was insured by two policies: a primary motor vehicle liability policy with limits of $1,000,000 per accident issued by the Fire and Casualty Insurance Company of Connecticut (\u201cFCICC\u201d), and an excess policy with limits of $4,000,000 per occurrence issued by U.S. Fire. The absolute minimum annual premium for the FCICC primary policy was $708,599; the minimum annual premium for the U.S. Fire excess policy was $160,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">At this time, Sonoco was also insured by two policies: a primary commercial automobile insurance policy with limits of $2,000,000 per occurrence issued by Home Insurance Company (\u201cHome\u201d), and an umbrella liability coverage policy issued by Lexington with applicable limits of $25,000,000 per occurrence. The minimum annual premium for the Home primary policy was indecipherable; the minimum annual premium for the Lexington excess policy was $198,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Sonoco instituted this declaratory judgment action during the pendency of the underlying Perez suit, seeking a declaration that it was an additional insured under the FCICC and U.S. Fire policies issued to Blue Diamond, and that the FCICC policy was required to provide primary coverage to Sonoco and defend it in the Perez suit, since Sonoco\u2019s liability arose out of the use of the Blue Diamond vehicle. Both FCICC and U.S. Fire denied any obligation to defend or indemnify Sonoco regarding the Perez suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Perez suit ultimately settled for $4.25 million. FCICC paid its limit of $1,000,000; Home paid its limit of $2,000,000; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Lexington contributed $1.25 million. U.S. Fire did not contribute to the settlement. Following the settlement, Lexington intervened as a co-plaintiff in the declaratory judgment action against FCICC and U.S. Fire, seeking recovery of its $1.25 million contribution to the settlement. U.S. Fire then filed a third-party complaint to join Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In granting summary judgment to U.S. Fire, the trial judge declared that U.S. Fire need not contribute to the Perez settlement until the FCICC, Home, and Lexington polices were first exhausted. In so ruling, the court found that U.S. Fire\u2019s \u201cother insurance provision\u201d did not violate public policy, and that it was a valid excess clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">On appeal, Lexington argues that U.S. Fire is obligated to contribute to the Perez settlement. U.S. Fire responds that its \u201cAutomobile Limitation,\u201d which confined excess coverage \u201cto the coverage provided ... in the \u2018Underlying Insurance,\u2019 \u201d relieved it of any obligation to provide coverage for the Perez settlement, since the underlying FCICC insurance policy contained a provision that purported to bar coverage for \u201c \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 resulting from the movement of property by a mechanical device.\u201d U.S. Fire contends that this exclusion in the FCICC underlying policy \u201csquarely precludes coverage for the Perez claim which beyond question involved the movement of property (pallets) by a mechanical device (a forklift).\u201d Therefore, argues U.S. Fire, \u201csince the FCICC policy by its terms excludes coverage for claims such as the Perez claim, the U.S. Fire policy likewise excludes coverage for such claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Judge Stroumtsos held that the FCICC policy was required by statute to provide coverage for the Perez claim, thereby invalidating the aforementioned exclusionary language contained in the FCICC policy. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1. However, U.S. Fire points out that Judge Stroumtsos made no ruling as to whether this invalidation would also affect the scope of coverage contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>in the U.S. Fire umbrella policy. Thus, argues U.S. Fire, the exclusion contained in the FCICC policy, although invalidated by Judge Stroumtsos, \u201cmust be given effect and enforced as written, as respects U.S. Fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">It is well established in this state that \u201c[w]henever an insurance policy and a governing statute are in conflict, the statute controls, and the policy is automatically amended by operation of law to conform to the statutory standard.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 514 A.2d 832 (1986); <em>see Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Zullo, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>362, 373, 225 A.2d 570 (1966) (amending the insurance policies at issue to contain coverage \u201cno less broad than that of the statute\u201d); <em>Fiscor v. Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 30, 679 A.2d 678 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>263, 686 A.2d 764 (1996) (explaining that \u201ceven if the County had obtained an insurance policy at odds with the statutory standards, the court would, by operation of law, amend the policy to conform to the statutory requirements\u201d); <em>Kattoura v. Patel, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 42, n. 4, 619 A.2d 1031 (App.Div.1993) (explaining that \u201ceven if the AMI policy failed to include the coverage required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:21-1 <em>et seq., </em>we would deem the policy amended to provide the minimum coverage required by the statute and to conform to the parties\u2019 agreement that the coverage provided by Excelsior would be primary\u201d); <em>American Home Assurance Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 485-86, 464 A.2d 1128 (App.Div.1983); <em>accord </em>Appleman, 12 <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 7041, at 166 (1981) (\u201cThe statutory law in force and effect at the time of the issuance of a policy becomes a part of the contract as though expressly written therein, and a policy must be considered to contain those requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The underlying FCICC policy was \u201cautomatically amended by operation of law to conform to the statutory standard,\u201d which obligated it to provide coverage for the precise type of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 it purported to exclude. <em>Allstate, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 6, 514 A.2d 832. The \u201cAutomobile Limitation\u201d contained in the U.S. Fire excess policy clearly stated that the scope of excess coverage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201climited to the coverage provided ... in the \u2018Underlying Insurance,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[i]f coverage is not provided by such [underlying insurance] policies, coverage is excluded from this policy.\u201d By tying its coverage to that provided by the underlying FCICC policy, IJ.S. Fire became obligated to provide coverage. Because coverage was in fact provided by the underlying FCICC policy, which was automatically amended to conform to New Jersey law, U.S. Fire became bound by its own policy language to provide excess coverage for the Perez settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The result here is not at odds with our decision in <em>Weitz v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 642 A.2d 1040 (App. Div.1994). There, the umbrella insurance policy issued by defendant to plaintiff\u2019s husband (Mr. Weitz) clearly stated that coverage would not extend to a claim for personal injury by \u201can insured,\u201d which the policy defined to include members of Mr. Weitz\u2019s household. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 642 A.2d 1040. Plaintiff was a member of Mr. Weitz\u2019s household. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, \u201cperceiving] nothing ambiguous about the policy\u2019s exclusion provision,\u201d we enforced the exclusion as written in the policy. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In discussing the umbrella policy in <em>Weitz, </em>we explained that \u201c[a]s its coverages depart from auto and homeowners\u2019 policies, it should not be a surprise that its exclusions are also different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551, 642 A.2d 1040. This is readily distinguishable from the language contained in the U.S. Fire policy, which purported to exclude coverage \u201cif coverage is not provided by such [underlying insurance] policies.\u201d Therefore, the fact that U.S. Fire\u2019s policy contemplated providing coverage to the same extent as provided in the underlying policy, rather than departing from the underlying coverage as in <em>Weitz, </em>distinguishes the present situation from <em>Weitz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In <em>Electric Ins. Co. v. Rubin, </em>32 F.3d 814, 816 (3d Cir.1994), the Third Circuit, applying Pennsylvania law, affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Electric Insurance Company (\u201cElectric\u201d), declaring that Electric was not obligated to provide coverage under a personal excess h ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>insurance policy issued by Electric to defendant Nathan Rubin for claims made by Patricia Rubin, defendant\u2019s wife, arising from an automobile accident. Mrs. Rubin\u2019s medical bills totaled $746,489.78, but the primary automobile insurance policy on the Rubin\u2019s vehicle contained a limit of only $100,000. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The excess policy at issue contained the following provision: \u201cwe do not provide Liability Coverage for any insured ... for personal injury to you or your relative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815. The District Court found that \u201cit was undisputed that the excess policy excluded coverage for Patricia Rubin\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The District Court, while acknowledging that Pennsylvania law invalidates family exclusions in primary automobile insurance policies, held that this \u201cinterdiction was immaterial because excess liability insurance is not governed by the [Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law] MVFRL.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 816. The Third Circuit found no instance in which a Pennsylvania court held that an excess policy was subject to the MVFRL, and opined that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would not subject an excess policy to the requirements of the MVFRL. <em>Id. </em>at 818. Therefore, the Court enforced the exclusion contained in the excess policy as written. <em>Id. </em>at 820. Again, this case involved a clear exclusion provision in the excess policy that did not purport to coordinate coverage with the underlying insurance policy, as U.S. Fire\u2019s policy does.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In this regard, <em>Doto v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544, 659 A.2d 1371 (1995), is instructive. <em>Doto </em>involved the issue of whether an umbrella insurance policy should provide uninsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage to the same extent as the primary liability insurance policy. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 659 A.2d 1371. The Court reasoned that \u201c[i]n the absence of a requirement pursuant to a UM statute that UM/UIM coverage be equal to liability coverage, the general rule appears to be that umbrella policies should not be understood to provide UM/UIM coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 659 A.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The Court noted that \u201c[a]n insurance policy is a contract,\u201d which is \u201coften unilaterally \u2018prepared by the company\u2019s experts, (persons) learned in the law of insurance who serve its interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>exercising their draftsmanship art.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7-8,170 A.2d 800 (1961)). The Court considered whether \u201cmore precise language by the insurer, if chosen, \u201cwould have put the matter beyond reasonable question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 659 A.2d 1371 (quoting <em>Mazzilli, supra, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>at 7,170 A.2d 800). Ultimately, the Court concluded that both the insured and insurer \u201cacted on the assumption and expectation that the umbrella policy provided UM/UIM coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 659 A.2d 1371. The Court therefore found that the insurer was estopped from denying coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 659 A.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In the final analysis, \u201cmore precise language by [U.S. Fire], if chosen, \u2018would have put the matter beyond reasonable question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 659 A.2d 1371 (quoting <em>Mazzilli, supra, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 170 A.2d 800). The language contained in U.S. Fire\u2019s \u201cAutomobile Limitation\u201d was simply insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We wish to make it indelibly clear that we are not extending the statutory requirements of primary automobile insurance to excess or umbrella policies, an argument rejected by both the <em>Weitz </em>and <em>Rubin </em>Courts. Rather, we are simply requiring that U.S. Fire be held to the terms of its policy purporting to limit coverage to the coverage provided through the underlying policy, which was amended by operation of law in this particular case. <em>Doto, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 556, 659 A.2d 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Lexington argues that the \u201cother insurance\u201d provision in the U.S. Fire excess policy constitutes an illegal \u201cescape clause,\u201d whereas its \u201cother insurance\u201d provision contained a legitimate \u201cexcess clause.\u201d Therefore, argues Lexington, because U.S. Fire\u2019s escape clause, which attempts to avoid all liability, is void as against public policy, it should be given no effect, and U.S. Fire should bear liability for the entire $1.25 million remaining after the two primary carriers contributed to the Perez settlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause contained in the U.S. Fire policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">If there is any other collectible insurance available to the \u201cInsured\u201d (whether such insurance is stated to be primary, contributing, excess or contingent) that covers a loss that is also covered by this policy, the insurance provided by this policy will apply in excess of, and shall not contribute with, such insurance. This Condition ... does not apply to any insurance policy purchased specifically (and which is so specified in such insurance policy) to apply in excess of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Lexington policy\u2019s \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">If other valid and collectible insurance with any other insurer is available to the Insured covering a loss also covered hereunder, this insurance shall be excess of, and shall not contribute with such other insurance. Excess insurance over the limits of liability expressed in this policy is permitted without prejudice to this insurance, and the existence of such insurance shall not reduce any liability under this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The only apparent difference between these two policies is that the U.S. Fire policy contained a parenthetical, in which \u201cother collectible insurance\u201d was defined to encompass \u201cprimary, contributing, excess or contingent [insurance,]\u201d whereas no similar parenthetical or definition attempting to enlarge the scope of the phrase \u201cother valid and collectible insurance\u201d was contained in the Lexington policy. For all intents and purposes, the policies are identical in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Lexington is therefore relegated to the tenuous position of arguing that the parenthetical phrase defining the scope of \u201cother collectible insurance\u201d transformed U.S. Fire\u2019s excess clause into an escape clause, since to take issue with any other aspect of U.S. Fire\u2019s provision would be to argue that its own clause was invalid as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">This court has previously dealt with situations in which two insurance contracts covered the same loss, \u201cbut each rejected] primary responsibility because of the existence of the other contract.\u201d <em>Starks v. Hospital Serv. Plan of N.J., Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 352, 440 A.2d 1353 (App.Div.1981), <em>affd, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>433, 453 A.2d 159 (1982). In <em>Starks, </em>we explained that our Supreme Court has rejected the approach taken by many courts of reconciling conflicting \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provisions so \u201cthat one, but not both, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>such provisions must yield in order to establish one policy as the \u2018primary\u2019 insurance upon which the \u2018other insurance\u2019 provision of the \u2018secondary\u2019 policy might operate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352-58, 440 A.2d 1353 (quoting <em>Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>554, 559,147 A.2d 529 (1959)). Such \u201cmutually repugnant\u201d provisions become inoperative, and the general coverage of each policy applies, such that \u201ceach company is obligated to share in the cost of the settlement and expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 440 A.2d 1353 (quoting <em>Cosmopolitan, supra, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 147 A.2d 529).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In <em>Starks, </em>we reasoned that the \u201cexistence in each of the clauses of language which establishes precisely the same order of payment for each coverage\u201d is the \u201cpredicate of mutual repugnancy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, if either policy \u201cclearly expressed\u201d an intention to provide coverage \u201cprior to or subsequent to the other, that intention will ordinarily be enforced by the courts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, U.S. Fire would, therefore, have this court adopt, as the trial court evidently did, that this \u201cclearly expressed\u201d requirement was satisfied by the parenthetical included in its policy but absent from the Lexington policy. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Because the two \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provisions are virtually identical in every respect (aside from the parenthetical), they should be deemed mutually repugnant, such that each insurer \u201cis obligated to share in the cost of the settlement and expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 440 A.2d 1353 (quoting <em>Cosmopolitan, supra, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 147 A.2d 529). Such was the result in <em>American Nurses Ass\u2019n v. Passaic Gen. Hosp. ., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>83, 91, 484 A.2d 670 (1984), where the Court reiterated that \u201cthe loss should be equally apportioned\u201d in cases involving competing \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provisions contained in excess insurance policies. <em>See Ambrosio v. Affordable Auto Rental, Inc., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>114, 127, 704 A.2d 572 (App.Div.1998) (apportioning coverage among the four insurers involved, each of which purported to provide excess coverage over all other collectible insurance).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Cosmopolitan, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Both policies evidence the same intent with respect to insuring the risk and also with respect to avoiding liability in the event of adequate coverage by another carrier. Where the intent is clear, the fact that one of the insurers stated its intent more specifically than the other is not significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">[I'd at 561,147 A.2d 529.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">This applies with equal force to the competing \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provisions here. Therefore, U.S. Fire will receive no benefit from including the parenthetical phrase in its provision, and its policy will not be elevated to a position of a super-excess insurer as a result of that parenthetical. Equal apportionment of the loss between U.S. Fire and Lexington is appropriate. As the <em>Cosmopolitan </em>Court stated, \u2018We think that such a conclusion affords the only rational solution of the present dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562,147 A.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The judgment is reversed and Lexington and U.S. Fire are ordered to contribute $625,000 each toward the Perez settlement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
