Littman, appeals from an order entered on August 6, 1999, compelling him \u201cto arbitrate his claims against Defendants in the National Association of Security Dealers, Inc. [\u201cNASD\u201d] in accordance with the terms of the executed Form U-4\u201d and dismissing his complaint, and from an order of September 14, 1999, denying his motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs complaint alleged violations of the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (\u201cCEPA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>84:19-1 <em>et seq. </em>He asserts that \u201cthe reason for plaintiffs termination ... was the result of plaintiffs refusal to participate in the \u2018Monopoly Game\u2019 \u201d which is \u201cnothing more than an unsophisticated company-wide policy of institutional tax fraud,\u201d resulting from a fabrication of expense receipts in exchange for cash.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in dismissing the CEPA count because he \u201cis only required to submit to arbitration those claims for which the NASD requires arbitration,\u201d that the NASD rules do not require arbitration of statutory discrimination claims including CEPA claims, and that \u201ceven if [a] CEPA claim is not a \u2018statutory employment discrimination claim[,]\u2019 [it] is still not subject to arbitration.\u201d Hence, the principal issue before us, in plaintiffs words, \u201cis whether a claim under [CEPA] is a \u2018statutory employment discrimination claim\u2019 as that phrase is defined by the [NASD].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">For purposes of the defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to compel arbitration,\u201d we must accept the following facts as asserted by plaintiff. Plaintiff was hired by defendant Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (\u201cMSDW\u201d) as a financial advisor in 1997. He received \u201cpositive performance reviews\u201d in 1997 and 1998, and was ranked \u201cseventh (7th) nationally in his graduating class of one hundred forty seven.\u201d In fact, \u201c[h]e was even recruited [by MSDW] to give a speech ... at the firm\u2019s next training class\u201d for new broker dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Plaintiff claims that in or about December 1998, he expressed concern to defendant Richard Less, MSDW\u2019s Fairfield branch manager, regarding \u201cthe legality of an employee bonus program called the \u2018Monopoly Game.\u2019\u201d Specifically, plaintiff questioned the fact \u201cthat the fabrication of expense receipts in exchange for cash was in violation of the federal tax code as he understood it.\u201d Less had allegedly been previously notified of the concern by Colleen McLaughlin, a sales assistant in the Fairfield office, \u201cas early as September 1998.\u201d Plaintiff further contends that on or about December 7, 1998, he informed Less of his intention to marry McLaughlin and that Less responded by saying that plaintiff \u201ccould no longer work with McLaughlin.\u201d Plaintiff was terminated shortly thereafter, he says \u201cin or about December of 1998,\u201d for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, plaintiff was informed that he would have to \u201cturn over\u201d his \u201cbook of clients\u201d to MSDW. He claims that when he refused to do so, Less contacted the Fairfield Police who escorted plaintiff out of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201cThe NASD is a self-regulatory organization of securities brokers and dealers, as defined by 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 78c(a)(26), subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>[See 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 780-3 <em>et seq.] See generally </em>[ ]15 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 78[a] <em>et seq.\u201d Young v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., Inc., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 609, 688 A.2d 1069 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 193 (1997). The NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure has been promulgated by the NASD of which defendant MSDW is a member. Plaintiff was required to register with the NASD as a condition of employment. In so doing, he was required to sign the \u201cUniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer\u201d Form (\u201cForm U4\u201d) which reads, \u201cTHE APPLICANT MUST READ THE FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY.\u201d Immediately following this instruction, the Form U-4 provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">I swear or affirm that I have read and understand the items and instructions on this form and that my answers (including attachments) are true and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that I am subject to administrative, civil . or criminal penalties if I give false or misleading answers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The Form U-4 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">I agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm, or a customer, or any other person, that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of the organizations indicated in Item 10 as may be amended from time to time....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">In Item 10 of the Form U-4, plaintiff registered with the NASD and agreed to be bound by the NASD Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Rule 10201(a) of the NASD Code identifies the controversies that are subject to mandatory arbitration, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">Except as provided in paragraph (b), a dispute, claim, or controversy <em>eligible for </em>submission under the Rule 10100 Series between or among members and/or associated persons, and/or certain others, arising in connection with the business of such member(s) or in connection with the activities of such associated person(s), or <em>arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated person(s) with such member, shall be arbitrated under this Code at the instance of:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">(1) a member against another member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">(2) a member against a person associated with a member or <em>a person associated with a m,ember against a member; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-15\">(3) <em>a person associated with a member against a person associated with a member.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">On October 17, 1997, the NASD filed a proposed amendment to Rule 10201 with the SEC which created an exception to mandatory arbitration of statutory employee discrimination claims. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The proposed amendment was published in the Federal Register for comment. 62 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>66164 (December 17,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">On April 15, 1998, in response to the original comments, the NASD filed an amendment to the proposed rule change with the SEC. The proposed amendment to Rule 10201(b), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">A claim alleging employment discrimination, including a sexual harassment claim, in violation of a statute is not required to be arbitrated. Such claim may be arbitrated only if the parties have agreed to arbitrate it, either before or after the dispute arose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The NASD, in its written interpretive statement to the SEC, under a section entitled \u201cType of Claims Covered,\u201d provided the scope of the amended rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">One commenter contends that the exception to the arbitration requirement should apply to all statutory employment claims, such as those under the Family and Medical Leave Act or ERISA, and not just statutory claims of employment discrimination. Some commenters express the view that the exception should be extended to all common law claims. They believe that common law claims such as wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, negligent supervision, invasion of privacy, and tortious interference with economic opportunity often join statutory claims of employment discrimination____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">Alternatively, the commenters fear that the court proceedings could be stayed pending resolution of the other claims in arbitration, and that the award could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>res judicata or collateral estoppel effect on the court proceeding, thus denying the employee a complete hearing in court. An Industry commenter also expresses concern that parties may file pretextual claims in court to gain the advantage of more liberal discovery that can then be used in arbitration. This commenter also urges that investigative files of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and similar state agencies not be subject to discovery or use in arbitration. The NASD drafted the proposed rule carefully to specify that the exception for claims of statutory employment discrimination claims was in fact just that: an exception to the long-standing rule that requires arbitration of disputes between members and associated persons. The interest groups that gave their views to the NASD during the consideration of this rule change focused their concerns on employment discrimination claims made under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal anti-discrimination legislation, not on other federal laws or common law claims such as those listed above. <em>It was generally understood that such other claims would remain subject to the arbitration requirement. </em>Parties are, of course, free to make other agreements; some firms may agree to have all claims consolidated in court, while some employees may decide to proceed with all claims in arbitration. The NASD will observe developments in this area, and may consider amendments to the rule in the future if bifurcation proves to be a serious problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">(Internal footnotes omitted; emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">On June 28, 1998, the SEC, pursuant to <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 78s(b)-(c), approved the NASD\u2019s proposed amendment to Rule 10201, \u201c[e]f-fective on January 1, 1999.\u201d <em>See </em>63 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>35299 (June 29, 1998). In its statement promulgating the amended rule, the SEC provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Paragraph (b) does not apply to causes of action created solely by judicial precedents or to other causes of action under state or federal law, which remain subject to mandatory arbitration under paragraph (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">Such judicially created causes of action might include, for example, claims alleging \u201cwrongful discharge\u201d without any accompanying <em>claim of discrimination cm account of age, sex, race, or other status protected by a specific </em>law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">[68 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>35299 (\u201corder granting approval to proposed rule change\u201d dated June 29,1998) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Thereafter, the NASD published a document entitled \u201cNASD Regulation Publishes Frequently Asked Questions Relating To Arbitration of Employment Discrimination Claims,\u201d dated December 7, 1998. The relevant portion of this document is as follows: Q: What exactly does the amendment do?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">A: It creates an exception to the requirement in NASD Rule 10201 for associated persons to arbitrate all disputes arising out of their employment or termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>employment with a member. The exception says that claims alleging employment discrimination, including sexual harassment claims, in violation of a statute are not required to be arbitrated. Such claims remain eligible but may be arbitrated only if the parties have agreed to arbitrate them, either before or after the dispute arose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Q: When will the rule change be effective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">A: It will be effective on January 1, 1999, <em>for claims filed on or after that date.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">Q: What is considered to be a \u201cstatutory claim\u201d of employment discrimination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">A: The term includes claims of employment discrimination in violation of a \u201cstatute,\u201d which is defined broadly to include a federal, state, county, or municipal law or ordinance, as well as regulations or interpretations under such law or ordinance issued by a governmental body. <em>This would include, fin-example, a claim of sexual harassment or pregnancy discrimination in violation of EEOC Guidelines issued pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1961, even though such fin-ms of discrimination are not mentioned in the statute itself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Neither party claims that the former rule applies to this termination which occurred before the effective date of the amended regulation. In fact, plaintiff pursues this litigation premised upon the amendment which was effective after'his termination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the absence of any dispute by defendants with respect to this fact, we proceed on the assumption the new rules apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">Plaintiff contends that he \u201cis only required to submit to arbitration those claims for which the NASD requires arbitration.\u201d While acknowledging the mandatory arbitration of claims specified by the NASD, he asserts that a claim under the CEPA is exempt from arbitration in accordance with the amended rule. Hence the critical issue before us is whether a CEPA claim is \u201ca claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>alleging employment discrimination\u201d within the meaning of the amended rule 10201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In asserting that he alleges an \u201cemployment discrimination claim,\u201d plaintiff relies upon the United States District Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bowles v. City of Camden, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>255, 261 (D.N.J.1998), in which the court held that because the elements of a CEPA claim \u201care similar to those necessary to prove a violation of Title VII\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII principles would be utilized as the \u201clandscape for analyzing [ ] CEPA claims.\u201d However, the court in <em>Bowles </em>did not hold that CEPA was an employment discrimination statute, nor addressed whether CEPA would qualify as such under the NASD Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">As noted above, the NASD commentary interpreting the proposed amendment to <em>Rule </em>10201(b), as presented to the SEC, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Some commenters express the view that the exception should be extended to . . common law claims <em>such as wrongful termination, </em>intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, negligent supervision, invasion of privacy, and tortious interference with economic opportunity....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">... The interest groups that gave their views to the NASD during the consideration of this rule change focused their concerns on employment discrimination claims made under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal anti-discrimination legislation, not on other federal laws or common law claims such as those lisied above. It was generally understood that such other claims would remain subject to the arbitration agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">(internal footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Although not binding, the commentary is entitled to \u201cdeference,\u201d particularly because the SEC adopted the rule change after its promulgation. <em>First Heritage Corp. v. NASD, </em>785 <em>F.Supp. </em>1250, 1251 (E.D.Mich.1992) (citing <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>220, 234, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2332, 2341, 96 L.Ed.2d 185, 199 (1987), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>1056, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>31, 97 L.Ed.2d 819 (1987)). Here, the commentary indicates that the NASD intended to exempt from mandatory arbitration only statutory claims similar to those derived from Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>CEPA was not a derivative of Title VII but rather a codification of a common law cause of action. In <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 72, 417 A.2d 505 (1980), the Supreme Court held that even \u201can employee [at will] has a cause of action for wrongful discharge when the discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d Consistent with the <em>Pierce </em>decision, in <em>Potter v. Village Bank, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 560-61, 543 A.2d 80 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>352, 550 A.2d 462 (1988), we determined a \u201cwhistle blower\u201d has a cause of action based upon \u201cretaliatory discharge from employment in violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d Speaking through Judge (now Justice) Coleman, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">It is now apparent that <em>Pierce </em>does not require an at will employee\u2019s claim of retaliatory discharge to be based on a specific statute which proscribes a particular type of discharge. Rather, an employer\u2019s obligation to refrain from discharging an employee who reports suspected criminal activities to law enforcement officials reflects a duty imposed upon all employers ... in order to implement the fundamental public policies embodied in the State and federal penal statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Additionally, after plaintiffs employment was terminated, the Legislature enacted the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-1 <em>et seg. See L. </em>1986, c. 105, \u00a7 1, effective September 5, 1986. Under the act, an employee who has been terminated because of reporting suspected criminal violations, has the right to file a retaliatory toil; claim in addition to other remedies. <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-3. <em>We read this legislative enactment as a codification of public policy established through judicial decisions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 558, 560, 543 A.2d 80 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As <em>Potter </em>indicates, CEPA was not a derivative of Title VII or other federal discriminatory statutes, but rather a codification of the public policy provided in <em>Pierce </em>and subsequent eases which had established common law claims. <em>Ibid.; see Barratt v. Cushman &amp; Wakefield, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>120, 126, 675 A.2d 1094 (1996) (noting that CEPA is a codification of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Pierce); <em>see also Falco v. Community Med. Ctr., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 310, 686 A.2d 1212 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>405, 709 A.2d 798 (1998). In fact, a plaintiff must elect between his common law and CEPA statutory claims. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 (providing that \u201cthe institution of an action in accordance with this act shall be deemed a waiver of the rights and remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>available under any other contract, collective bargaining agreement, State law, rule or regulation or under the common law\u201d);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>see also Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>163, 196-97, 707 A.2d 1000 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">While we have \u201crecognize[d'J that CEPA, similar to the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42, is a civil rights statute,\u201d <em>Zappasodi v. State, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 89, 761 A.2d 96 (App.Div.2000),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> CEPA embodies a remedy based on unlawful retaliation against any employee, as opposed to one designed to protect against a discriminated class. As the trial judge stated in granting the motion to compel arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">Generally speaking, what CIPA [sic] did was to put in statutory form the common law cause of action for wrongful discharge first recognized in <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Company [Corp.]. </em>CIPA [sic] established a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>exception to the general rule that an employer can terminate an at will employee with or without cause. Given the history of CIPA [sic], its general purposes, and the history of the rule amendment, in the Court\u2019s view the exception in N.AS.D.\u2019s rules for employment discrimination claims is just that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">It is an exception to claims made based on adverse treatment being given to an employee by virtue of their status, by virtue of them age, their gender, their religion or their race, not based on their activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">New Jersey courts have enforced employees\u2019 Form U-4 agreements to arbitrate claims under the CEPA. <em>See generally, Young v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 688 A.2d 1069 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 193 (1997); <em>see also Singer v. Commodities Corp., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 678 A.2d 1165 (App.Div.1996); <em>see also Bleumer v. Parkway Ins. Co., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 649 A.2d 913 (Law Div.1994). We fail to believe that the NASD or SEC intended to affect these precedents without a clearer statement of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In 1994, the Law Division in <em>Bleumer </em>held that required mandatory arbitration was applicable to claims under the CEPA pursuant to an arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 402-06, 649 A.2d 913. Judge Schwartz found that plaintiff was bound by the arbitration agreement and that his CEPA claim was subject to arbitration in accordance with the agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 397-98, 649 A.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Subsequently, in <em>Singer, </em>we enforced an arbitration agreement included in the standard NASD Form U-4 against an employee who asserted a defamation and CEPA claim. 292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 405-08, 678 A.2d 1165. Judge Michels cited the \u201cwell-accepted principle that New Jersey supports the settlement of disputes by arbitration,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 400, 678 A.2d 1165, and concluded that \u201ccompelling arbitration under these circumstances is neither unfair nor inequitable and does not deprive plaintiff of any fundamental or substantive rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 678 A.2d 1165.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Most recently in <em>Young, </em>we held that the Form U-4 requiring plaintiff to arbitrate any claims against his firm, in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>with the NASD Code was enforceable. 297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 617-21, 688 A.2d 1069. Plaintiff, as here, was required to sign the U-4 form as a condition of employment. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 688 A.2d 1069. After his discharge, he filed a CEPA and LAD claim and \u201cchallenge[d] the enforceability of the arbitration provision [in the U-4 form] on several grounds. He contended] that he ha[d] a statutory right to a jury trial of his CEPA and LAD claims and that he did not knowingly waive the right to jury trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614-15, 688 A.2d 1069. We rejected the contention. Pointing to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Carp., </em>500 <em>U.S. </em>20, 29, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1647, 1653-54, 114 L.Ed.2d 26, 39 (1991), Judge Weeker stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">10]nly if the statute or legislative history evidence an intention to preclude alternate forms of dispute resolution will arbitration agreements be unenforceable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">The FAA preempts any state law purporting to invalidate an arbitration agreement involving interstate commerce ... In any event, there is no evidence in the text or legislative history of CEPA or LAD that members of the classes protected by those statutes cannot waive the right to jury trial by agreeing to arbitrate disputes with their employers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\"><em>\\Id. </em>at 616, 688 A.2d 1069 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Judge Weeker further noted that the U-4 arbitration provision was enforceable \u201ceven if it is literally a contract of adhesion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620, 688 A.2d 1069. She added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">[T]he overall subject matter \u2014 registration and regulation of persons selling securities to the public \u2014 is already subject to review and oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). <em>See </em>15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 78o-3(g), (h). The widespread use of the U-4 makes its uniform interpretation and enforcement a matter of substantial public interest. Accordingly, Young is bound by his agreement to arbitrate in accordance with NASD rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\"><em>Ud. </em>at 621, 688 A.2d 1069.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">Young was permitted to litigate his CEPA claim only because of the NASD rule which excepted \u201cdisputes involving the insurance business of any member which is also an insurance company,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and reversed the dismissal of the CEPA claim on that basis only. <em>Id. </em>at 621-28, 688 A.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">Plaintiff contends that in 1990, the CEPA was revised to provide for a jury trial for any aggrieved party under the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>34:19-5. Plaintiff further contends that this legislative action \u201cevidences a strong legislative intent which would preclude an alternate form of dispute resolution, particularly one which did not provide for the benefit of a jury trial.\u201d However, <em>Young </em>and <em>Singer </em>were decided after the 1990 revision, 297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 605, 688 A.2d 1069; <em>see also Bleumer, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 399, 649 A.2d 913 (rejecting this argument). Moreover, the right to jury trial, even under an anti-discrimination statute, does not alone control the issue of enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate. <em>See, e.g., Garfinkel v. Morristown Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>291, 299-300, 755 A.2d 626 (App.Div.2000); <em>Quigley v. KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 269, 749 A.2d 405 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>527, 760 A.2d 781 (2000);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Alamo Rent A Car, Inc. v. Galarza, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 389, 703 A.2d 961 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Plaintiff contends that even if the CEPA is not an employment discrimination statute within the meaning of the NASD Code, all claims under the CEPA should be exempt from mandatory arbitration with the NASD as a \u201cgeneral trend away from requiring mandatory arbitration of employment disputes\u201d has been established. We recognize that the NASD Code was not written exclusively for New Jersey securities dealers and brokers or with the law of this State exclusively in mind. But as <em>Singer </em>and <em>Young </em>evidence, questions of arbitrability relating to the NASD Code have been decided under State law in cases like this, <em>see Young, supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 616-17, 688 A.2d 1069; <em>Singer, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404-05, 678 A.2d 1165, and we cannot subscribe to the view that the amendment which would outdate our precedent favoring Code enforcement had the impact plaintiff suggests without a greater expression of that endeavor by the NASD. Nor does the Code amendment impact longstanding state and federal policy favoring arbitration. The public policy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>favor of arbitration is set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2, as well as State law. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A </em>2A:24-1. Our State\u2019s policy in favor of arbitration is well settled. <em>See, e.g., Garfinkel, supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 297-300, 755 A.2d 626; <em>Quigley, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 262, 749 A.2d 405; <em>Galarza, supra, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 389, 703 A.2d 961; <em>Young, supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 616, 688 A.2d 1069; <em>Singer, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 407, 678 A.2d 1165. Any change in that policy must come from the Supreme Court or the Legislature unless preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> Other counts of the complaint were also dismissed resulting in a final judgment, but plaintiff only addresses the CEPA claim on this appeal.

The proposal is contained in defendants\u2019 appendix and the rule is contained in the NASD <em>Code of Arbitration </em>included in plaintiff\u2019s appendix. <em>See </em>63 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>35299 (June 29, 1998), which details that the April 1998 proposal changed the first sentence of the amendment to employ the phrase \"including a sexual harassment claim\u201d in place of \"or sexual harassment.\u201d The change, in essence, was designed to make clear that \"sexual harassment\u201d was a contemplated form of employment discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b172-13\"> Plaintiff states that his \"claim is governed by the Rule change which became effective on January 1, 1999____Plaintiff's [cjomplaint was filed on April 23, 1999. It is the date the claim is filed, not the date of termination which is relevant for determining whether the amended rule applies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> Defendants do not argue that State court jurisdiction is preempted by the agreement adopted pursuant to the NASD Code or regulation approved by the SEC. <em>See Maher v.

Burns, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 477, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">CEPA, like the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>NJ.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42, is a civil rights statute. <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp. Board of Educ., </em>138 <em>NJ. </em>405, 431, 650 A.2d 958 (1994). It is \"remedial\u201d legislation and therefore \u201cshould be construed liberally to effectuate its important social goal.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because both CEPA and the LAD seek to eliminate \u201cvindictive employment practices\u201d <em>id. </em>at 418, 650 A.2d 958, the Court in <em>Abbamont </em>held that standards for imposing liability against private employers, <em>see Lehmann v. Toys 'R' Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>NJ. </em>587, 626, 626 A.2d 445 (1993), should also be applied under CEPA as providing the \u201cmost effective intervention and prevention\u2019 of retaliatory actions against employees.\u201d <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>138 <em>NJ. </em>at 418, 650 A.2d 958 (quoting <em>Lehmann, supra, </em>132 <em>NJ. </em>at 626, 626 A.2d 445). Consistent with <em>Abbamont\u2019s </em>approach, the United States District Court, applying New Jersey law, has held that the analytical framework applied in a retaliatory discharge case under CEPA is similar to that applied in a violation of anti-discrimination statutes, such as Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act. <em>Bowles v. City of Camden, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>255, 261 (D.NJ.1998). Thus, because CEPA is anti-discrimination legislation, the elements of a cause of action under the Act are derived from the Civil Rights landscape. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\"><em>[Kolb, supra, </em>320 <em>N.I.Super. </em>at 477, 727 A.2d 525 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> The NASD rales were not involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\"> Unlike here, a cause of action was upheld in <em>Quigley </em>because the U-4 was executed before the statutory amendment. <em>See </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 267-68, 749 A.2d 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
