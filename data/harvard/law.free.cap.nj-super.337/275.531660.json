In addition to a number of claims which we find lack merit, defendant argues that the trial court erred in permitting the State to present evidence of his drug addiction and argue to the jury that the addiction constituted a motive for the offenses charged. We agree that reference to defendant\u2019s drug use violated the prohibition of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) against using evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d to demonstrate a propensity to commit further crime, and that the evidence was not admissible as \u201cproof of motive.\u201d Thus, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">The burglary and theft in question occurred at the home of Denise and Warren Brandenberger in Mays Landing, where two stereo components, a pair of sunglasses and $700 in cash, were taken from the house. By checking local pawn shops, police were able to track the stolen articles, and they ultimately concluded it was defendant who had pawned them. Defendant was thereupon arrested and questioned. He was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and, according to the police, ultimately admitted to burglarizing the Brandenberger house. He was subsequently indicted and pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">At trial, the prosecutor offered testimony that, during questioning, defendant had spoken of his \u201cdrug and alcohol problem\u201d and said he had committed the burglaries \u201cbecause he needed money.\u201d The prosecutor said that comment went to \u201cmotive,\u201d and thus was admissible under Evidence Rule 404(b). Defense counsel objected, claiming that any relevance from such evidence was out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>weighed by the prejudice which would redound to defendant. The court ruled, however, that \u201cthis shows his motive and it may be prejudicial, but I\u2019m not convinced that it outweighs any other value that the statement may make.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Detective Paul Hoffman of the State Police was then asked whether there came a time \u201cwhen you spoke to the defendant about drug and alcohol issues\u201d? Detective Hoffman answered, \u2018Tes.\u201d He said it was defendant who \u201cbrought it up\u201d and he then said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">Well, the reason our conversation ran for hours, the reason \u2014 he said things were, you know, occurring. That he had a drag problem and he used cocaine and heroin, and at time he wouldn\u2019t sleep for days, then would start drinking alcohol and vodka would totally make his hands and fingers and arms cut and bleed. He just didn\u2019t believe he did everything that was being said by him and everything and it was a situation where he just said, I have a drug problem. I need help.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial, which was denied. The court said it would give the jury a limiting instruction, which it did as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">All right, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am going to permit this testimony concerning drug and alcohol problems that the defendant alleges that he had, not to show this defendant is a bad person. I am permitting it for your consideration for a very limited purpose. That is with respect to the motive, the statement alleged by the police witness, that the defendant, Michael Mazowski, suffered from both alcohol and drug abuse and I\u2019m going to instruct you, that you are not to consider that for any other purpose other than, it was said by the defendant, and as to the issue of motive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">Now motive is not required to be proved by the State, however, if the State proves a motive and proves all of the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, then you may look to the defendant\u2019s motive. However, to consider this motive, you are only to consider it as it gives meaning to the surrounding circumstances. You are not to consider the motive that the defendant committed this offense. That\u2019s something you should not do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">They are not being introduced because \u2014 to show that he has a predisposition to <em>commit the </em>offense, only \u2014 but only as to the issue of motive. Motive again, don\u2019t consider the issue of drugs and alcohol, that this defendant committed this offense. It is only being introduced for the very limited purpose, to the issue of whether or not there <em>was </em>a motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Later, during the testimony of Police Officer Tappeiner, who had also participated in defendant\u2019s questioning, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Q. Speaking to the defendant, did he ever make any statement as to his motivation for committing the burglary and the theft at the Brandenberger\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">A. He stated that he had a drug problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The court then repeated, in a shortened form, the essence of the limiting instruction set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. He denied the charges against him, and claimed that the pawn shop slip which had implicated him in the sale of the stolen articles had actually been signed in connection with the legitimate sale of a different article and had thereafter been altered to include the articles taken from the Brandenberger house. He also said he had never waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that he had been manipulated and coerced by the police, and that he had finally \u201cconfessed\u201d only in order to gain some respite from police harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor again raised the subject of defendant\u2019s drug problem. He asked what defendant had said to Detective Hoffman about his drug problem, whether the detective had offered him help, whether and when he had been involved in any drug treatment program, whether his was a \u201cbad drug problem\u201d and whether he had \u201ca serious problem with drugs.\u201d Again, defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial, but the objection and motion were overruled. The court did reject the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to ask defendant \u201cwhat the cost of that problem was,\u201d but rejected defense counsel\u2019s argument that there was no indication defendant had been \u201con drugs\u201d at the time of the Brandenberg burglary or that he had a current drug problem. The court also rejected counsel\u2019s argument that the State was \u201creally trying to paint Mr. Mazowski as a bad person rather than trying to get whether he is guilty or innocent of charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Finally, in summation, the State further emphasized defendant\u2019s drug condition. At one point, the prosecutor said, \u201cthe defendant needed money.\u201d Later she said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>What happened in this case, is entirely understandable, when you think of it as the actions of someone who is addicted to drugs. Addicts don\u2019t hold onto money, drugs or property for very long, if they\u2019re looking for money for it. The defendant in this ease sold the stolen property, <em>as any </em>addict would, the day after.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In his objection to those statements, defense counsel characterized the State\u2019s argument as a claim that \u201call addicts need money, if he has an addiction therefore he\u2019s guilty. I think that\u2019s obviously not permissible____\u201d The prosecutor, however, replied that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">X didn\u2019t say anything about his propensity to commit crime. He admitted to a drug problem, and that\u2019s his motive, motive for getting rid ... of the property quickly, for money is his motive. And I never said a word about propensity for \u2014 that he\u2019s a drug addict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The court again overruled the objection and permitted the State\u2019s argument. In its final charge, the court repeated, in substance, the limiting instruction quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The jury apparently had some difficulty reaching its verdict. After deliberating for approximately two and one-half hours, it returned with a question concerning the disputed pawn slip. It then deliberated for another half hour before advising that, \u201cwe can\u2019t agree.\u201d After delivering a further charge requesting the jurors to continue its efforts, the court adjourned deliberations until the next day. When it resumed, the jury did reach a verdict, finding defendant guilty of both burglary and theft. Thereafter, the court <em>sentenced </em>defendant to concurrent extended terms of ten years, with five years parole ineligibility, on each of the two charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">As a general rule, evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior crimes or wrongdoing is inadmissible. The rule, now embodied in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), is premised on the virtually self-evident proposition that such evidence is likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right to have a jury decide his guilt or innocence based solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>relevant evidence presented at trial, free of the prejudice that such proof would likely inject into the proceeding. <em>See State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 302, 558 A.2d 833 (1989); <em>State v. Reldan, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 501-02, 449 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>543, 453 A.2d 862 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">As an exception to that general rule, however, evidence of prior crimes or wrongdoing may be admitted to establish some point at issue in the prosecution other than the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit crimes. The general rule and its exceptions are set out as follows in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the disposition of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. Sueh evidence may be admitted for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident when such matters are relevant to a material issue in dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The \u201cother purpose\u201d for which the State claims it may show defendant\u2019s drug addiction here is \u201cproof of motive.\u201d Because defendant is a drug addict, the State argues, he is constantly in need of money, he cannot hold onto money, and thus he has a \u201cmotive\u201d to commit crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The difficulty posed by that extremely broad definition of \u201cmotive,\u201d is that it does not relate to the particular crime with which defendant is charged, or to any other particular crime. Rather, it is submitted as a reason why defendant commits crime in general. It is an undifferentiated \u201cmotive\u201d to steal. As such, except for its label, it is indistinguishable from a claim that defendant has a \u201cdisposition,\u201d or general propensity to commit crimes, which is precisely what <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Further, even were we to accept the State\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cmotive,\u201d the broad brush of admissibility which it seeks to apply would read out of the rule the final clause of subsection (b), which says evidence of past crimes or bad acts may be admitted to prove specific matters \u201cwhen sueh matters are relevant to a material issue in dispute.\u201d <em>See, </em>in that connection, the comment of the Supreme Court Committee which drafted the current <em>Rules of Evidence, </em>noting that the final phrase of <em>N.J.R.E. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>404(b) was included \u201cto emphasize\u201d that \u201cordinarily other crimes evidence is admissible only to prove \u2018some other fact in issue\u2019 and not a general disposition to commit crimes or other wrongs.\u201d Quoted in <em>Biunno, Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>1991 Supreme Court Committee Comment to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404 (2000). Unless we postulate that in every prosecution for theft, the question of whether the defendant needed money \u2014 whether he was rich or poor, employed or unemployed, a drug addict or not \u2014 is a material fact, there is simply no basis to find that defendant\u2019s alleged need for money was a \u201cmaterial issue in dispute\u201d here. <em>See State v. Mathis, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>455, 471-72, 221 A.2d 529 (1966), as to the general inadmissibility of evidence designed to show that a defendant lacked money and thus was likely to have committed the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Generally, in \u201cmotive\u201d cases under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) or its predecessor, <em>N.J. Evid. R. </em>55, the evidence in question is designed to show why a defendant engaged in a particular, specific criminal act. For example, the State may want to show that the defendant was seeking revenge against a victim who had cheated him while the two were engaged in a prior criminal act. Or it may claim the defendant was attempting to prevent testimony by a victim concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt of a prior crime. Thus, in <em>State v. Collier, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>181, 193, 719 A.2d 1276 (App.Div.1998) <em>affd o.b., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>27, 738 A.2d 369 (1999), the State claimed defendant shot his victim in retaliation for the victim\u2019s implicating defendant in the mutilation killing of a dog. The court emphasized that the motive evidence was important to the State\u2019s case: \u201cThe evidence was relevant to prove defendant\u2019s motive for robbing and shooting the victim whom he had known for a number of years and with whom his relations had always been friendly. The State needed to show why defendant would rob and shoot his friend intending to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In <em>State v. Baldwin, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>379, 391, 221 A.2d 199, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 <em>U.S. </em>980, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>527,17 <em>L.Ed.2A 442 </em>(1966), the State claimed defendant killed his victim because the victim intended to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>against defendant concerning a prior robbery. The court held that evidence of the prior robbery was admissible to show a motive for defendant\u2019s committing the specific act with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><em>State v. Slocum, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>358, 362-63, 327 A.2d 244 (App.Div.1974), involved a defendant accused of robbery and atrocious assault and battery. Evidence that the defendant had robbed the victim on an earlier occasion, that she had testified against defendant concerning that incident, and that he later attacked her in revenge for her earlier action was admissible. Again, the \u201cmotive\u201d evidence was related to the specific crime at issue and did not seek to demonstrate a general propensity to commit crime. To the same effect, <em>see State v. Schubert, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>212, 224, 561 A.2d 1186 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>597, 583 A.2d 302 (1990) (defendant\u2019s prior threat against his landlord because of a rent increase was admissible to show animosity toward the landlord and motive to commit the arson with which defendant was charged); <em>State v. Homer, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 362-64,206 A.2d 905 (App.Div.1965) (when defendant was charged with wrongfully removing the body of his brother who had died from a drug overdose, defendant\u2019s own use of drugs was admissible to show that his motive for moving the body was to avoid being charged with a narcotics offense); <em>State v. Smith, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>476, 487-88, 262 A.2d 868, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>949, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>232, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1970) (in trial for assaulting a police officer, evidence that defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been revoked was admissible to show motive for resistance when officer stopped defendant and asked to see his license).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Those cases and others like them<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not suggest that the State may show prior bad acts or criminal behavior in order to demonstrate a characteristic or condition (drug addiction) which makes defendant likely to commit crimes. As noted, such evidence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>constitute nothing less than a prohibited attempt (albeit employing different language) to demonstrate \u201cthe [criminal] disposition\u201d of a defendant, \u201cin order to show that he acted in conformity\u201d with that disposition in committing the crimes charged against him. <em>See </em>comment of 1991 Supreme Court Committee, <em>supra. </em>And <em>see State v. Hernandez, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 272-73, 758 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.2000) (dealing with a claim of admissibility under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) to show \u201cplan, preparation, intent or constructive possession\u201d of narcotics, with the court concluding, however, that the \u201cevidence was\u201d \u201cprimarily predisposition evidence, namely that since defendant had used [an alleged accomplice who testified against him] ... to sell drugs in the past, it was likely that he had done so again on the day in question. And that is precisely the kind of evidence <em>N.J.R.E. </em>[404(b) ] is intended to exclude).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Even were we to conclude that proof of defendant\u2019s addiction constituted evidence of \u201cmotive\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), we are satisfied that the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any probative value it might have and thus it should be barred on that basis. <em>See State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 605 A.2d 230 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In <em>Cofield, </em>the Court stressed the need for a careful weighing and balancing of the probative value of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence against its prejudicial effect. To be admissible, the Court held, such evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">must be offered for a proper purpose, must be relevant, must have probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, and must be coupled with a limiting instruction. A proper application of those rules balances the State\u2019s interest in presenting the evidence of \u201cother crimes or wrongs\u201d against the possibility of unfair prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 334, 605 A.2d 230.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The Court also acknowledged the difficulty of that weighing and balancing process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">The admissibility of uncharged misconduct has been described as \u201cthe single most important issue in contemporary criminal evidence law\u201d----The analogous Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) has \u201cgenerated more published opinions than any other subsection of the Federal Rules * \u201c * [and] errors in the introduction of uncharged misconduct are the most frequent basis for reversal in criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 335, 605 A.2d 230 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><em>Cofield </em>involved a trial for drug dealing in which the State used evidence of a subsequent conviction for a like offense to buttress its claim of \u201cconstructive possession\u201d of narcotics. While the Court held the evidence could have been admitted on that basis, or as tending to prove \u201cdefendant\u2019s possession with intent to distribute,\u201d it reversed defendant\u2019s conviction for failure of the trial court to deliver a proper limiting instruction. In the course of its opinion, it laid down four principles to be applied in determining the admissibility of \u201cextrinsic evidence of other crimes or wrongs\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">1. The evidence of the other crime must be admissible as relevant to a material issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">2. It must be similar in kind and reasonably close in time to the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">3. The evidence of the other crime must be clear and convincing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">4. The probative value of the evidence must not be outweighed by its apparent prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\"><em>[Id </em>at 338, 605 A.2d 230.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Further, to \u201creemphasize\u201d what it had said in <em>State v. Stevens, swpra, </em>the Court noted \u201cthat the material issue must be genuinely disputed. For example, if identity is not really in issue, ... it would be improper to justify the use of other-crime evidence on' that basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838-39, 605 A.2d 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">We are satisfied that the evidence in question here does not qualify under the <em>Cofield </em>four-part test. It fails largely because it satisfies neither the first nor the fourth elements of the test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the first prong, it cannot realistically be claimed that defendant\u2019s prior drug offenses, or his addiction, is \u201crelevant\u201d to any \u201cmaterial issue\u201d in the present ease. The material issues are whether defendant unlawfully entered the Brandenberger house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>and took the stereo components in question. Whether defendant had a motive or did not have a motive for doing so was neither material nor \u201cgenuinely disputed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Even more significant, however, is the fourth prong of the test: that \u201cthe probative value of the evidence must not be outweighed by its apparent prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Virtually any evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d will probably entail some risk of prejudice to a defendant. <em>See State v. Hernandez, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 269-70, 758 A.2d 1139, referring to \u201cthe inordinate prejudice to the defendant inherent in other-crimes evidence,\u201d the \u201c Svidespread agreement that other-crimes evidence has a unique tendency to turn a jury against the defendant\u2019\u201d (quoting from <em>State v. Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 558 A.2d 833), and the \u201cinflammatory characteristics of other-crimes evidence.\u201d Here, however, the prejudicial nature of the evidence is particularly self-evident and overwhelming. It is difficult to conceive of anything more prejudicial to a defendant than presenting him to the jury as a drug <em>addict </em>\u2014 a description which one court termed \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d <em>See People v. Cardenas, </em>31 Cal.3d 897,184 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>165, 647 P.2d 569, 574 (1982). On the other hand, the argument for admissibility is scant and problematic, premised on the State\u2019s <em>a priori </em>assumption that all drug addicts need money, that defendant therefore needed money, that, accordingly, defendant had a propensity to commit crime, and thus the jury should conclude that he committed this crime. The weighing process here comes down heavily against admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Case law on the prosecution\u2019s right to show a defendant\u2019s drug addiction in order to demonstrate a motive to steal is virtually non-existent in this State and is mixed elsewhere. Although the State cites two decisions of this court which it claims permits such evidence, <em>State v. Candelaria, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 450-51, 710 A.2d 545 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>587, 715 A.2d 990 (1998) and <em>State v. Jones, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 140-41, 227 A.2d 145 (App.Div.1967), neither case clearly supports the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>In <em>Candelaria, </em>a robbery victim testified to a statement by the defendant (whom the victim identified as the robber) that he did not want to shoot anybody, \u201cI just want money.\u201d The victim said he had also asked the robber why he wanted the money, and the latter responded, \u201cI need drugs.\u201d This court refused to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cbecause the jury learned he [the defendant] had previously used illegal drugs and perpetrated drug offenses.\u201d 311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 450, 710 A.2d 545. The court said the evidence was admissible as part of the <em>res gestae, </em>describing what the defendant said to the victim during the robbery. However, the court then seemed to suggest its uncertainty as to the propriety of the entire exchange by noting that, \u201c[i]n any event\u201d there was no objection and there was no \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 710 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Jones </em>also involved what the court referred to as the \u201cres <em>gestae,\u201d </em>with the victim testifying that the person who robbed him said he needed a \u201cfix.\u201d The court neither expressed its approval nor condemnation of that testimony, but in any event, the facts there fell far short of what the State did here. Here, we do not have simply a description of what a thief or burglar said while committing a crime. Rather, we have a deliberately presented argument by the State, emphasized and repeated, intended to show that defendant was a lawbreaking drug addict, presumably down and out and in need of money to feed his addiction, and thus was likely to have' committed the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As noted, courts from other jurisdictions \u201chave split over the admissibility of evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug addiction.\u201d <em>State v. LeFever, </em>102 <em>Wash.2d </em>777, 690 P.2d 574, 577 (1984). <em>See also </em>Debra T. Landis, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Accused\u2019s Drug Addiction or Use to Show Motive for Theft of Property Other Than Drugs, </em>2 AL.P.4th, 1298 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\"><em>People v. Cardenas, supra, </em>is a leading case rejecting such evidence as unduly prejudicial. In <em>Cardenas, </em>the court distinguished between the kind of case in which such evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>offered. Where the crime charged involves theft of narcotics or some other drug offense, proof of defendant\u2019s addiction is often admissible. But \u201cwhere the object of the charged offense was to obtain money or an item other than narcotics,\u201d California courts have \u201cunanimously found\u201d such evidence not admissible. In such a case, the \u201cevidence\u2019s \u2018probative value to show motive [is] far outweighed by its tendency to incite a jury to resolve the issue of guilt or innocence on [an accused\u2019s] character rather than on proof of the essential elements of the crime.\u2019 \u201d 184 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>165, 647 P.2d at 573. And, the court added, \u201cit cannot be doubted that the public generally is influenced with the seriousness of the narcotics problem ... and has been taught to loathe those who have anything to do with illegal narcotics in any form or to any extent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>184 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>165, 647 P.2d at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Gould v. State, </em>579 P.2d 535 (Alaska 1978), is another leading case rejecting the use of narcotics addiction evidence as showing a generalized \u201cmotive\u201d to steal. There the court focused primarily on what it described as the \u201cabsence of any \u2018affirmative link\u2019 between the robbery and Gould\u2019s alleged heroin addiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539. It concluded that the argument premised on \u201creasoning that because Gould was unemployed and had a $300 a day heroin habit, he had to commit the robbery to support his habit ..., [was] too attenuated and possessing \u2018too many gaps\u2019 to show motive and thus the identity of the robber.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In <em>State v. LeFever, supra, </em>the Washington Supreme Court discussed both the <em>Cardenas </em>and <em>Gould </em>decisions. It said it concurred in the \u201cviews expressed\u201d in those cases, and thus it concluded that where the primary issue at trial was identification of a robber, evidence that defendant \u201cwas a heroin user had limited probative value to show that he committed the robberies,\u201d and the \u201cresultant prejudice ... completely overwhelmed] any possible relevance or probativeness.\u201d <em>LeFever, supra, </em>690 P.2d at 578. <em>See also, </em>to the same general effect, <em>Christian v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>53 <em>Ala.App. </em>81, 297 So.2d 405, 408-09 (Crim.App. 1974) (holding that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior drug use \u201cwas too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>indefinite, tenuous and speculative for the purpose of showing motive or intent ... when juxtaposed to its great potency to \u2018over persuade\u2019 to the unjust prejudice of defendant,\u201d and concluding that, \u201cthe evidence of defendant\u2019s addiction to or use of drugs amounted, in effect, to an attack on his character by proof of a specific course of improper conduct, which, of course, is not permissible\u201d); <em>Powell v. State, </em>478 S.W.2d 95, 98 (Texas Crim. App.1972) (noting that evidence of defendant\u2019s narcotics addiction, purportedly to show motive but without relating that evidence to the specific crime with which defendant was charged, amounted to an argument that defendant had a criminal character, and concluding that, \u201c[t]o admit such testimony without showing some affirmative link between the theft and narcotics would show only that the accused is \u2018a criminal generally.\u2019 This, the general rule ... prohibits\u201d); <em>United States v. Mullings, </em>364 F.2d 173, 175-76 (2d. Cir.1966) (rejecting evidence of defendant\u2019s drug addiction offered to show that defendant \u201cmight have lacked money and therefore might have had a motive to commit the crime,\u201d the court concluding that, \u201cthis is too remote; the need for money being speculative the motivation can be no better. Whatever probative value this evidence had, it was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. It would place far too much stress on the mere fact of his [defendant\u2019s] addiction alone\u201d); <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>41 F.3d 1257,1259 (8th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1072, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1712, 131 L.Ed.2d 572 (1995) (holding proof of drug addiction not admissible when motive was not a material issue in the case, and noting that even if it \u201cwere a material issue in this robbery case and drug use were probative of it,\u201d it would still be barred because its \u201cprejudicial impact\u201d would \u201csubstantially outweigh its probative value\u201d); <em>State v. King, </em>334 <em>S.C. </em>504, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582-83 (1999) (distinguishing between evidence of defendant\u2019s prior thefts from the same victim, which were admissible to show motive or plan, and the State\u2019s suggestion that the defendant had a drug habit, which was \u201cinadmissible\u201d because of its \u201cprejudicial effect\u201d); <em>People v. Williams, </em>63 <em>Mich.App. </em>389, 234 N.W.2d 537, 539 (1975) (rejecting claim that defendant\u2019s alleged drug use was admissible to show motive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>stealing \u201cin order to support a drug habit,\u201d and concluding that there is \u201csimply no logical connection between the two phenomena\u201d and any \u201cprobative value of this evidence, if indeed there was any, is far outweighed by\u201d the prejudice to defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As noted, there are cases which permit evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug use or drug addiction in order to show an alleged motive for a crime with which he is charged. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, </em>159 <em>F.</em>3d 1117, 1128-29 (8th Cir.1998) <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>825, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>75, 145 L.Ed.2d 64 (1999); <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>125 F.3d 484 (7th Cir.1997); <em>Adams v. State, </em>272 <em>Ga. </em>115, 527 <em>S.E.2&amp; </em>200, 202 (2000); <em>People v. Johnson, </em>155 <em>A.D.2d </em>924, 547 <em>N.Y.S.2d 747, </em>749 (1989), <em>app. den., </em>75 <em>N.Y.2d </em>920, <em>555 N.Y.S.2d 39, 554 </em>N.E.2d 76 (1990). There seems little point to a lengthy analysis of such cases here. Many do not distinguish between \u201cmotive,\u201d as referring to the reason for committing a particular crime, as opposed to a general \u201cneed\u201d or propensity to commit crimes, which we believe amounts to demonstrating a defendant\u2019s criminal \u201cdisposition\u201d or character, in order to show that he acted in conformity with that propensity. Other cases give less weight to the probable \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effect of such evidence on a criminal defendant. None, we believe, offers a persuasive rationale for admitting such tangentially relevant but overwhelmingly prejudicial evidence. Thus, we are satisfied that a proper interpretation and application of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) requires rejection of any evidence of defendant\u2019s drug addiction in this case. Particularly where, as here, that addiction was not merely noted, but father was emphasized and re-emphasized, and then argued to the jury as a basis for concluding that defendant had committed the crimes with which he was charged, there is no basis to conclude that the improper use of that evidence was harmless. Its admission requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Not much need be said concerning defendant\u2019s other claims of error. The trial court\u2019s finding that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and its conclusion that the pawnshop receipts were admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6), were clearly correct. Defendant\u2019s claim that the pawnshop slip had been altered was a matter to be resolved by the jury, to whom the court properly consigned the issue. Defendant\u2019s arguments on these points are without merit and do not warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). The prosecutor\u2019s comment respecting defendant\u2019s failure to raise before trial his claim of police harassment was improper and should not have been made. However, defense counsel did not object to the remark, the comment represented a minuscule part of the overall summations of both counsel, and the trial court directed the jury to ignore the statement. We are satisfied that the reference to defendant\u2019s silence was not prejudicial, did not constitute plain error, and thus does not provide a separate basis for reversal. <em>State v. Whitehead, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>343, 348, 403 A.2d 884 (1979); <em>see also R. </em>2:10-2. Except as noted below, all of defendant\u2019s other arguments, whether submitted in counsel\u2019s brief or in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief are either covered in the discussion above or are without merit and do not warrant further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">With one exception, defendant\u2019s argument that his sentence was excessive has no merit. The exception pertains to the trial court\u2019s imposing two extended ten year terms, one for each of the offenses of which defendant was found guilty. The State acknowledges that no more than one extended term should have been imposed, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5a, and that the sentence was, to that extent, improper. Accordingly, if defendant is again convicted following the remand which will follow this opinion, any sentence must be limited to the permissible single extended term.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-12\"> As noted further in Point III below, the State acknowledges that the court erred in imposing more than one extended sentence. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> <em>See, e.g., </em>the extensive list of such cases in <em>Biunno, Current Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 9 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b)(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-13\"> We agree with the comment in <em>State v. Collier, supra, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194, 719 A.2d 1276, that \"[w]hen motive, rather than pattern, is sought to be shown through other-crime evidence, ... similarity between the alleged other act and the one for which defendant is currently on trial [that is, the second prong of the <em>Cofield </em>test] is not a requirement for admissibility.\u201d The \"similarity\u201d requirement makes good sense when applied to a claim of admissibility based on showing a pattern on the part of the defendant; it makes no sense when applied where \"motive\u201d is the proffered basis for admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
