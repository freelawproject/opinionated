(Tops), who was discharged for selling a big screen television set to his brother-in-law for a price below cost. Plaintiff subsequently brought this action against Tops and three of its executives, defendants Phillip M. Schmidt, Phillip J. Schoon-over and Peter Huber, claiming that defendants violated the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42, and breached his employment contract by discharging him. Plaintiff also asserted a claim for defamation based on statements the individual defendants made to other Tops employees concerning the reason for plaintiffs discharge. In addition, plaintiff asserted a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiffs wife, Mary Griffin, joined as a plaintiff, asserting a claim for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Plaintiff, who is an African American, was originally hired by Tops in 1984. During the course of his employment, plaintiff developed a close personal relationship with Tops\u2019 owner, Les Turchin.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In February of 1993, plaintiff was discharged for alleged sexual harassment of a female employee. Tops eventually paid nearly $100,000 to settle a sexual harassment action brought by this employee, and also incurred substantial legal fees in defending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">After plaintiffs first discharge from Tops, Turchin assisted him in obtaining new employment. Several months later, over the objections of Tops\u2019 managers, Turchin insisted that plaintiff be rehired. As a condition of his re-hiring, plaintiff was required to see a psychologist and sign an undated letter of resignation, and Tops\u2019 managers considered him to be on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Less than six months after his rehiring, plaintiff participated in the sale of a television set to his brother-in-law which resulted in his second discharge. On November 23, 1994, the brother-in-law came to the Tops store in Secaucus to buy a big-screen television. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Plaintiff, who was manager of the TV and Video Department, referred his brother-in-law to a salesman who worked under him. This salesman sold plaintiff\u2019s brother-in-law a floor model of a big-screen television set. Plaintiff established a $1,900 sales price for the television, which was more than $500 below cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">A few days after this sale, the Director of the Shipping and Receiving Department informed plaintiff that Tops could not ship the floor model to his brother-in-law because he lived out-of-state and Tops could not insure a product which had been removed from its original packaging for out-of-state shipment. Plaintiff then instructed the Director of Shipping and Receiving to substitute a new television set for the floor model and to ship it to his brother-in-law, without any increase in price.' When Tops\u2019 managers found out about this sale, they discharged plaintiff for a second time. According to plaintiff, Schoonover said that to obtain Tur-chin\u2019s approval for the discharge, he told him that plaintiff had \u201cstole[n] from the company.\u201d The defendants also filed criminal charges against plaintiff, which were still pending when this ease was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">At trial, plaintiff testified that he did not extend any \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to his brother-in-law, and that under similar circumstances he would have substituted a brand new television for the floor model at no additional price for any other customer. Plaintiff also testified that Tops frequently sold items below cost. However, plaintiff admitted that at the time of the sale to his brother-in-law, he was aware of another employee who had been discharged for selling below cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">In addition, the store manager under whom plaintiff worked testified on plaintiffs behalf that because plaintiffs brother-in-law purchased a service warranty contract in addition to the television, Tops actually made a small profit on the overall transaction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>However, the store manager acknowledged that plaintiff violated store policy by establishing the price at which the television was sold to his brother-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Mrs. Griffin\u2019s loss of consortium claim and plaintiffs breach of contract claim. The court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs LAD and defamation claims. The court did not make any explicit ruling concerning plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the court instructed the jury regarding plaintiffs\u2019 LAD and defamation claims. Although the court gave the jury no instructions regarding intentional infliction of emotional distress, it submitted a verdict sheet which set forth questions regarding not only plaintiffs LAD and defamation claims, but also his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The jury returned a verdict for defendants on plaintiffs LAD claim, finding that plaintiff failed to prove he was discharged because of his race. The jury also returned a verdict in defendants\u2019 favor on plaintiffs defamation claim, finding that even though defendants\u2019 statements were defamatory, they were made for a \u201clegitimate business purpose\u201d and plaintiff failed to show that \u201c1) the employer knew the statements were false or acted in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity; 2) the statements were made for a purpose that was contrary to the interests of the qualified privilege; or 3) the statements were published excessively .\u201d However, the jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs favor on his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury awarded plaintiff $185,000 in compensatory damages, apparently representing lost income as a result of his discharge, and an additional $250,000 for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On defendants\u2019 post-trial motion, the court reduced the award for emotional distress to $125,000. However, the court denied defendants\u2019 motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>On appeal, defendants argue that plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress could not survive independent of his LAD and defamation claims and that plaintiff did not present any evidence which could support a jury verdict in his favor on that claim. In the alternative, defendants seek a new trial because the jury returned a verdict for intentional infliction of emotional distress without receiving any instructions regarding the elements of this tort. Defendants also argue that even as reduced by the trial court, plaintiffs damages award was excessive. Plaintiff cross-appeals from the reduction of the damages award, but does not challenge the jury verdict in defendants\u2019 favor on the LAD and defamation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">If plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a new trial would be required because the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff without receiving any instructions from the court regarding this claim. However, we conclude that plaintiff presented insufficient evidence to support a verdict for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, the judgment for plaintiff must be reversed and his complaint dismissed. This disposition makes it unnecessary to consider the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the amount of the damages award to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This State recognizes the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>See Taylor v. Metzger, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>490, 508-21, 706 A.2d 685 (1998); <em>Buckley v. Trenton Sav. Fund Soc\u2019y, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>355, 365-66, 544 A.2d 857 (1988). To prevail on such a claim,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">the plaintiff must establish intentional and outrageous conduct by the defendant, proximate cause, and distress that is severe. Initially, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly. For an intentional act to result in liability, the defendant must intend both to do the act and to produce emotional distress. Liability will also attach when the defendant acts recklessly in deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that emotional distress will follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">Second, the defendant\u2019s conduct must be extreme and outrageous. The conduct must be \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d Third, the defendant\u2019s actions must have been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>proximate cause of the plaintiffs emotional distress. Fourth, the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff must be \u201cso severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.\u201d By circumscribing the cause of action with an elevated threshold for liability and damages, courts have authorized legitimate claims while eliminating those that should not be compensable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\"><em>[Buckley, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 366-67, 541 A.2d 857 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Our courts have found this \u201celevated threshold\u201d to be satisfied only in extreme cases. Conduct has been found sufficiently outrageous to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress when a landlord failed to provide central heating, running water and reasonable security in a rent controlled building in an effort to induce the tenants to vacate, <em>49 Prospect St. Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Sheva Gardens, Inc., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 455-57, 466, 471-75, 547 A.2d 1134 (App.Div.1988); when a doctor allegedly told a child\u2019s parents that he was \u201csuffering from a rare disease which may be cancerous knowing that the child has nothing more than a mildly infected appendix,\u201d <em>Hume v. Bayer, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 319, 428 A.2d 966 (Law Div.1981); and when an employer referred to an African American employee as a \u201cjungle bunny\u201d <em>Taylor, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 508-21, 706 A.2d 685. On the other hand, our courts have rejected intentional infliction of emotional distress claims based on an employer\u2019s alleged denial of promotions and ultimate termination of an employee based on his age, <em>McDonnell v. Illinois, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 332, 342, 725 A.2d 126 (App.Div.1999), <em>affd on unrelated grounds, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>298, 748 A2d 1105, <em>cert. denied, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>-, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>59, 148 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 26 (2000); a police department\u2019s demand that an officer undergo a \u201cfitness for duty\u201d examination, which included drug testing and psychological evaluation, as a condition of returning to work after a domestic violence incident, <em>Hart v. City of Jersey City, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 491-92, 706 A.2d 256 (App.Div.1998); and a wife\u2019s eleven year adulterous affair with her boss, <em>Ruprecht v. Ruprecht, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 236-38, 599 A.2d 604 (Ch.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Except for the kind of aggravated discriminatory conduct involved in <em>Taylor, </em>\u201cit is extremely rare to find conduct in the employment context that will rise to the level of outrageousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>necessary to provide a basis for recovery for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Cox v. Keystone Carbon Co., </em>861 A.2d 390, 395 (3d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>811, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>47, 112 L.Ed.2d 23 (1990); <em>see also GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce, </em>998 5.W.2d 605, 612-13 (Tex.1999); \u201c \u2018[W]hile loss of employment is unfortunate and unquestionably causes hardship, often severe, it is a common event\u2019 and cannot provide a basis for recovery for infliction of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Cox, supra, </em>861 A.2d at 395 (quoting <em>Brieck v. Harbison-Walker Refractories, </em>624 <em>F.Supp. </em>363, 367 (W.D.Pa.1985), <em>affd in relevant part, </em>822 A.2d 52 (3d Cir.1987)). Consequently, an ulterior motive for discharging an employee, such as personal dislike, does not by itself provide a sufficient foundation for finding the level of outrageousness required to support this cause of action. <em>See id. </em>at 396; <em>see also Johnson v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>965 A.2d 31, 33-34 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Furthermore, a plaintiff may not pursue a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress to circumvent the required elements of or defenses applicable to another cause of action that directly governs a particular form of conduct. <em>See Decker v. Princeton Packet, Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>418, 432, 561 A.2d 1122 (1989). The jury in this case rejected plaintiffs defamation claim because defendants established a legitimate business purpose for the alleged defamatory statements made to other Tops\u2019 employees. Plaintiff cannot avoid the qualified privilege extended to such statements by relying upon them as a basis for an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. <em>See ibid.; LoBiondo v. Schwartz, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 416-17, 733 A.2d 516 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>488, 744 A.2d 1211 (1999); <em>Salek v. Passaic Collegiate Sch., </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 361, 605 A.2d 276 (App.Div. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Similarly, plaintiff could not rely upon the fact that the defendants had filed a criminal complaint against him as a basis for a finding of intentional infliction of emotional distress, because such conduct is the specific subject of the tort of malicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>prosecution. To establish a malicious prosecution claim, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that the criminal complaint \u201cterminated favorably\u201d to him. <em>Lind v. Schmid, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>255, 262, 837 A.2d 365 (1975). Since the criminal complaint against plaintiff was still pending when this case was tried, plaintiff could not show that it had been \u201cterminated favorably\u201d to him and thus he did not yet have a viable cause of action for malicious prosecution. Consequently, plaintiff could not rely upon the criminal prosecution to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Apart from defendants\u2019 alleged defamatory statements and initiation of criminal proceedings against plaintiff, there is no basis for a finding that defendants\u2019 conduct in discharging plaintiff was \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d <em>Buckley, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 366, 544 A.2d 857 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 46 comment d (1965)). At most, plaintiffs evidence could support a finding that Tops\u2019 managers incorrectly characterized plaintiffs role in the sale of the television set to his brother-in-law as \u201cstealing\u201d or \u201cembezzlement\u201d to dissuade the owner of the company from interfering with their decision to discharge him. However, the jury rejected plaintiffs defamation claim. Plaintiffs evidence also could support a finding that the managers\u2019 personal dislike of plaintiff was a motivating factor in their decision to discharge him. However, plaintiff was an at-will employee who could be discharged with or without cause, so long as Tops\u2019 actions did not violate the LAD or other similar legislation, <em>see Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 560, 569 A.2d 793 (1990), and the jury expressly found that plaintiffs discharge was not based on his race. Moreover, it is undisputed that plaintiffs role in establishing the price at which the television set would be sold to his brother-in-law violated Tops\u2019 policy relating to sales to employees\u2019 relatives. Therefore, plaintiffs proofs fell far short of showing the degree of outrageous required to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Plaintiff also failed to present evidence which could support a finding that the emotional distress he suffered as a result of defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cso severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>Buckley, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 366, 544 A.2d 857 (quoting <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 46 comment j). To establish this element of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, a plaintiff must show a \u201csevere and disabling emotional or mental condition which may be generally recognized and diagnosed by professionals trained to do so____\u201d <em>Taylor, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J: </em>at 515, 706 A.2d 685 (quoting <em>Poole v. Copland, Inc., </em>125 <em>N.C.App. </em>235, 481 S.E.2d 88, 93 (1997)). Thus, the plaintiffs testimony in <em>Buckley </em>that he \u201cwas aggravated[,] ... embarrassed[,] ... developed headaches\u201d and \u201clost sleep\u201d was found insufficient to satisfy this requirement. 111 <em>N.J. </em>at 368, 544 A.2d 857. Similarly, in <em>Morgan v. Union County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 354, 633 A.2d 985 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>468, 640 A2d 850 (1994), we concluded that plaintiffs \u201callegations relating to aggravation, embarrassment, minor headaches and loss of sleep\u201d were not \u201csufficiently severe\u201d to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. <em>See also Schillaci v. First Fidelity Bank, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396, 406-07, 709 A.2d 1375 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Plaintiffs proofs concerning his emotional distress were similar to the evidence found insufficient in <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Morgan. </em>Plaintiff testified that after he was discharged, he felt \u201cterrible.\u201d He further testified that he \u201cfelt bad\u201d because he \u201ccould not provide the Christmas and the holiday that was planned.\u201d His wife testified that plaintiff was \u201cdevastated\u201d by his second discharge and that \u201c[h]is whole personality changed.\u201d However, plaintiff did not show even through his own testimony that he had headaches, difficulty in sleeping or an incapacity to perform his normal daily routine, or that his emotional upset continued for any substantial period of time following the discharge. Most significantly, plaintiff did not seek any medical assistance for his alleged emotional distress or present any expert medical opinion to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>he suffered severe psychological effects as a result of his discharge. Therefore, plaintiff failed to show that he suffered any greater emotional distress than a person ordinarily would experience as a result of the loss of a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Accordingly, the judgment in plaintiffs favor is reversed and the complaint is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> This assertion was disputed by Tops\u2019 Vice President of Stores, who testified that the transaction resulted in a net loss of $208.15, even after taking into account the profit from the sale of the service warranty contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
