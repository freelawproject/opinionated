Vilas against the Plattsburgh and Montreal Railroad \u2022Company, and other corporations succeeding to its rights and property, and John B. Page, Peter Butler and George B. Chase, to foreclose a lien upon certain railroad property and to charge the individual defendants with liability for the amount thereof. At the request of defendant Page on behalf of defendant Chase, John N. Whiting appeared for Chase. The special term rendered judgment against the individual defendants, which was affirmed on appeal by the general term. Whiting having been informed that Page \u2022had no authority to retain him to appear for Chase, took no further appeal on his behalf, but upon an appeal by the other individual defendants the court of appeals reversed the personal judgment against them. An attempt having been made, as stated in detail below, to enforce the judgment against Chase, which thus remained \u2022unreversed, Chase moved to vacate the judgments of the special and general terms upon the ground that Whiting\u2019s appearance was unauthorized'; and Whiting having since died, his sole executrix, devisee and legatee, also moved to permit his appearance to be withdrawn, and to set aside the judgment on the ground that his appearance was made upon the representation of Page that he was authorized by Chase to employ an attorney to appear for him, and that the appearance was made in good faith though without actual authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-7\">This action was commenced June 24, 1875. The defendant Chase, was at the time and has ever since been a non-resident of this state, and he was never served with process in the action nor was any juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>diction ever acquired over him therein, unless by-virtue of the appearance of Whiting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">The facts upon which the action was based are very complicated. They are set forth in the report of the case, on appeal to this court, in Vilas <em>v. </em>Page (106-<em>N. Y. </em>439). In general terms, it may be stated that the action was brought to enforce an alleged lien in favor of Samuel F. Vilas upon the railroad, rolling stock and property, formerly of the Pittsburgh &amp; Montreal Railroad Company, but which had become vested in. the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company as lessee-under a perpetual lease. ' The several corporations, which from time to time had succeeded to the rights,, property and franchises of the Plattsburgh &amp; Montreal Railroad Company were made defendants in the action, as were three individuals above named. The individual defendants -were joined as parties upon the theory that in certain dealings between themselves and parties interested in the property upon which the lien was claimed, they had bound themselves to pay the-lien debt, in case the lien should be established, which, obligation inured, as was claimed by Vilas, to his benefit, and was enforcible \u2022 in his favor, although he was. not a party to the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">Briefly stated, the transaction relied upon to establish the personal liability of the individual defendants, was this:\u2014Page, Butler and Chase, on the 13th of Sept., 1867, after the foreclosure and sale of the Plattsburgh &amp; Montreal Railroad and the purchase thereof by the first mortgage bondholders, but before a conveyance had been made pursuant thereto, entered into-an agreement with the holders of the bonds by which they became the owners thereof, and substituted to the. rights of the original bondholders, and which agreement provided for the organization of a new corporation, to which the property should be conveyed. The judgment in the foreclosure suit left open the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>as to the title of Vilas to certain rolling stock of the Plattsburgh &amp; Montreal Railroad Company, which he claimed under an execution sale, and that' question, although in litigation in the foreclosure action, was undecided when the agreement of September 13, 1867, was made. If Vilas should establish his title in the foreclosure action, then by an arrangement made as early as 1858, between the parties to the foreclosure and the receiver, Vilas was to have a lien on the property for an amount fixed, with interest, representing the value of rolling stock purchased by him, which was in the possession of the receiver. In' view of this contingency the agreement of September 13, 1867, provided : \u201c The purchasers (Page, Butler and Chase), are to assume the prosecution of that suit (the Vilas litigation in the foreclosure action) and to abide its result and judgment, and if there should be any recovery in said Vilas\u2019 favor, the purchasers agree to indemnify the said parties of the first part and said Platt as Receiver, against the same.\u201d The Vilas branch of the foreclosure suit was finally determined in his favor in 1873, and his. title was sustained, Hogle <em>v. </em>Plattsburgh, etc. R. R\u201e Co. (54 <em>N. V. </em>314), but no personal liability was adjudged against the receiver or the vendors of the bonds. It was mainly upon this clause in the agreement that Vilas relied in the present action .0 sustain the contention that the individual defendants were personally liable for his debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">The plaintiff on the trial of the present action at, special term had judgment in his favor rendered June 4th, 1880, establishing his debt at the amount of $52,-803.73, and adjudging that the individual defendants were, as between themselves and the corporate defendants, primarily liable therefor, and judgment was rendered against them for that amount, with a subsidiary judgment subjecting the railroad and property of the Plattsburgh &amp; Montreal Railroad Company in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the possession of the defendant, the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, to a lien for the same debt. The general term having affirmed this judgment, July 2r, 1883, an appeal was taken therefrom by all the defendants, except Chase, to this court, and here the judgment was reversed as to the defendants Page and Butler, and affirmed as to the corporation defendants. The substance of the decision was that the individual -defendants had incurred no personal liability, but that the property was chargeable with a lien for the debt -due to Vilas. Chase not having appealed to this court, the judgments of the special and general terms as against him, stood in form unreversed, charging him with a very large indebtedness, from which the other individual defendants, standing under the same liability and no other, had been relieved. But the \u25a0remittitur of this court provided that the judgments rendered by it in this action should not prejudice \u25a0Chase upon an application for any relief in the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">The moving papers show, <em>first, </em>that when the action \u25a0was commenced Chase resided in Massachusetts, and was and ever since has been a non-resident of this \u25a0 State;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">Second, that he was never served with process in the action, and had no knowledge or information whatever as to the existence of the action or of any judgment against him until Febuary, 1881, when an action \u2022 on the judgment of the special term rendered June 4, 1880, was brought by Vilas against him in the courts of ^Massachusetts ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\"><em>Third. </em>That he never directly or indirectly authorized Whiting to appear for him in the action; he \u00a1neither knew Whiting, nor had ever seen or heard of him prior to the commencement of the suit in Massa-chusetts, nor did he give any authority to Page to -employ an attorney to appear for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The explanation of the conduct of Whiting is furnished in the affidavits. He was employed by Page to defend the action, and entered his appearance for Chase by his direction, believing him to have authority to act for his co-defendants. The affidavits show that the relations between Page and Chase were at that time very hostile, and so continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">Relief was denied by the special and general terms, merely on the ground of laches on the part of Chase in making the application. The following is a brief statement of the facts presented bearing upon the point of laches. As has been stated, the first notice or knowledge Chase had of the suit was in Febuary, 1881, when the action on the judgment was commenced in Massachusetts. He immediately employed an attorney, who went to New York and saw Whiting, who informed him of the circumstances under which he had appeared for Chase. At this time the case had been appealed by Whiting to the general term in the name of all the individual defendants, and the appeal Avas then pending. The agent of Chase informed Whiting that Chase had never authorized an appearance for him in the action, and notified Whiting that Chase gave him no authority to prosecute the appeal to the general term taken in his name, and that if he went on with it tie Avould do so without authority from Chase. Chase put in an ansAver in the Massachusetts suit which, among \u00abother things, averred that the New York court never had or acquired jurisdiction of his person or property \u25a0\u25a0so as to render a valid judgment against him. The case stood for trial for about the period of two years, the defendant meanwhile urging it on, Avhen the plaintiff applied to be non-suited and a non-suit was granted. The affidavit of Dabney, the attorney for Chase in the Massachusetts suit, states that the attornejrs for the plaintiff in that case understood that the defense was that Chase had not been served and that Whiting\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>appearance for him was unauthorized, and that the attorneys for Vilas informed him that they were non-suited because they could not induce Page to go to Boston to testify in that case; and there is no denial of these facts. In 1883, after the judgment of the special term in this action had been affirmed by the general term, Whiting wrote to Chase, asking him if he desired an appeal on his behalf to be taken to the Court of Appeals, and Chase replied that he did not recognize the right or authority of Whiting to appear for him in the action, and therefore did not wish any appeal to be taken for him. The moving affidavits charge, upon facts stated in connection therewith, that both Vilas, and the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company were informed soon after the judgment was rendered at special term that Chase claimed that he was never served, nor authorized any appearance in the action, and the opposing affidavits make no averment or denial on the subject. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, was rendered in October, 1887. Subsequently the-Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, the lessee of the-property charged with the lien, paid the amount thereof and took from the plaintiffs an assignment of the judgment against Chase, \u201c upon the assumption,\u201d as stated in the affidavit of their attorney, \u201c that it might recover back (the amount paid) from George B. Chase under the judgment of the general term.\u201d It appears that both Page and Whiting died in 1885. Page was insolvent, and the estate of Whiting was insufficient to' respond in damages to the amount of the judgment, against Chase. This proceeding was commenced in-January 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">Both motions were heard and decided together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">The <em>special term </em>denied the motions holding (x) that the reversal of the judgments against Page and Butler by the Court of Appeals, did not operate to reverse them as against Chase, and (2) that the law gave relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>by motion in the action when the attorney is insolvent, only when the motion is made without unnecessary delay ; that Chase should have moved when he learned of the unauthorized appearance pending the appeal, to. the general term, and that his delay in moving until nearly seven years after, and allowing the appeal to be heard as if by his authority, and then waiting until the-death of Page and Whiting, operated as a ratification of the attorney\u2019s appearance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">The <em>general term, </em>upon appeal by Chase and Whiting\u2019s executrix, affirmed the orders, holding with the court below that in view of the laches of Chase and of the death of Page and Whiting, Chase should not have such remedy by special motion, but should be left to-his action, in which he could be cross-examined, should he testify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">The court also overruled the claim that the judgment was joint and its reversal as to Chase\u2019s co-defendants reversed it as to him, saying that such ground was. not specified in the notice of motion, and he was not in court except to object that there was no valid judgment, so that a decision on that question would not be.binding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">From the orders of the general term, the defendant,. Chase, and the executrix of Whiting took these appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-8\"><em>Peter. B. Olney, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">The proper remedy is by motion, not by action. (Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, 42 <em>N. Y. </em>31 ; Ellsworth <em>v. </em>Campbell, <em>31 Barb. </em>135 ; Blodget <em>v. </em>Conklin, 9 <em>How.

This court has the power to and should reverse the orders, appealed from because Chase as matter of right is. entitled to the relief he seeks. He was a non-resident. The courts hold that in an action brought here on a foreign judgment, defendant may prove that he was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>never served with process in the foreign jurisdiction, and that he never authorized an attorney there to appear for him, and such proof will be fatal t\u00f3 the foreign judgment (See Borden <em>v. </em>Fitch, 15 <em>Johns. </em>121; Starbuck <em>v. </em>Murray, 5 <em>Wend, </em>148; Kerr <em>v. </em>Kerr, 41 <em>N. Y. </em>272 ; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Hoffman, 46 <em>Id. </em>30 ; Kinnier <em>v. </em>Kinnier, 45 <em>Id. </em>535, 541), and cases cited. Though our \u25a0courts may enforce the rule in Denton, <em>v. </em>Noyes as against residents of this\" State, they do not and ought not to enforce such rule against non-residents (Nordlinger <em>v. </em>De Mier, 54 <em>Hun. </em>276. See also Bordutha <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 3 <em>Gray, </em>508 ; Gilman <em>v. </em>Gilman, 126 <em>Mass. 26; </em>Wright <em>v. </em>Andrenes, 130 <em>Id. </em>149). The rule in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes has been applied in no case to a nonresident. In the following cases, the defendants were in fact residents (Hamilton <em>v. </em>Wright, 37 <em>N. Y. </em>502; Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, supra; Meacham <em>v. </em>Dudley, 6 <em>Wend. </em>515; Gazebrook <em>v. </em>McCreedie, 9 <em>Id. </em>437; Ellsworth <em>v. </em>Campbell, supra; Allen <em>v. </em>Stone, 10 <em>Barb. </em>547). \"The denial by the court below of Chase\u2019s motion was .an abuse of its discretion, and it is the right and duty \u25a0of this court to correct such abuse, notwithstanding it is-said in Vanderbilt <em>v. </em>Schreger, 81 <em>N. Y. </em>648, that whether the power of the supreme court to set aside judgments \u201c shall be exercised in any case rests in its discretion, with the exercise of which this court will not ordinarily interfere.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">The judgment is a joint judgment based solely on a joint liability, and when reversed on appeal of the two joint judgment debtors, it is gone for every purpose (Harmon <em>v. </em>Brotherson, 1 <em>Denio, </em>540 <em>; </em>Geraud <em>v. </em>Stagg, 10 <em>How. Pr. </em>373; Hawk <em>v. </em>Bishop, 10 <em>Hun. </em>509; Pallock <em>v. </em>Webster, 16 <em>Id. </em>105). The entirety of \u2022a joint liability and of a judgment thereon is recognized in the following cases (McIntosh <em>v. </em>Ensign, 23 <em>N. Y. </em>172; Perry <em>v. </em>Chester,53 <em>Id. </em>242; Brown <em>v. </em>Richardson, 4 <em>Robt. </em>604; Clason <em>v. </em>Morris, 10 <em>Johns, </em>524; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Fraw <em>v. </em>DeLaVega, 15 <em>Wall, </em>552; Wright <em>v. </em>Andrews,, 130 Mass. 140).</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">Mere delay is not such laches as to defeat this, motion. A void act is not waived by delay (Granger <em>v. </em>Schwarz, 11 <em>N. Y. Leg. Obs. </em>346; Johnson <em>v. </em>Bloomer, 3 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>328). The objection of laches will not be readily listened to where there has been na material' change in the situation of the parties growing out of the delay (Platt <em>v. </em>Platt, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>646).</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-17\"> See note, at the end of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-6\">Andrews, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8N\">We understand that it has become the settled practice in this State that relief against a judgment rendered against a' party upon the unauthorized appearance of an attorney in his name, is. to be sought on a direct application to the court by motion in the action in which the unauthorized appearance was entered. This was the remedy adopted in the leading case of Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes (6 <em>Johns. </em>297), and in every subsequent case of a like character in this State which has come to our notice (Grayback <em>v. </em>McCredie, 9 <em>Wend. </em>437; Adams <em>v. </em>Gilbert <em>Id. </em>499; Campbell <em>v. </em>Bristol, 19 <em>Id. </em>101; American Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Oakley, 9 <em>Paige </em>496 ; Hamilton <em>v. </em>Wright, 36 <em>N. Y. </em>502).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols (42 <em>N. Y. </em>31), which was the case of a creditor\u2019s bill founded on a judgment rendered against the defendant\u2019s intestate, the defendant sought to impeach the judgment by proof that the defendant was not served with process, and that an appearance entered for him in the action by an attorney was unauthorized. The court overruled the defense, holding that the authority of the attorney to appear could not be questioned collaterally, but pointed out the remedy, Earl, J., saying: \u201c I think a party should always seek relief for an unauthorized appearance in the suit in which it has been put in, where the rights and equities of all parties can be best protected.\u201d In Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford <em>(70 N. Y. </em>256), Rapallo, J., refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ring to the rule established in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, and to the cases following it, said: \u201c For reasons of public policy the court holds the appearance good, leaving the aggrieved party to his action for damages against the attorney, granting relief against the judgment only in a direct application \u201d (See also, Sperry <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 65 <em>N. Y. </em>183).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The jurisdiction of a court of equity to set aside a judgment at law obtained by fraud or on other grounds of equitable cognizance has been often asserted and is unquestioned, and it is not necessary now to deny that under special circumstances where the question of the unauthorized appearance is complicated with fraud, or the rights of purchasers, or the circumstances are such that the court can see that the right to or measure of relief cannot properly be determined on motion, having regard to all interests affected, resort may be had to a bill in equity or now in this State to an equitable \u2022action.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">There are several cases in other courts where jurisdiction in equity by original bill to set aside a judg- \" ment entered on an unauthorized appearance by \u25a0attorney, has been entertained. But all of them are marked by peculiar and special features such as those to which we have adverted (Shelton <em>v. </em>Tiffin, 6 <em>How. U. S. </em>163 ; Harshay <em>v. </em>Blackman, 20 <em>Iowa, </em>161; Wiley <em>v. </em>Pratt, 23 <em>Ind. </em>628). In Cutchfield <em>v. </em>Porter (3 <em>Ohio </em>518), the supreme court of Ohio dismissed a bill filed for relief against a judgment rendered on an appearance of \u2022an. attorney, without authority, on the express ground that the remedy should be sought by application to the \u25a0court in which the judgment was rendered. It seems to us that upon considerations both of principle and policy, relief, except in special cases, should be sought by motion in the action. It is the established rule where courts of law and equity are separated, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>equity will not grant its aid where there is a plain and adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Under our system of procedure relief on motion is administered upon equitable as well as legal principles. In ordinary cases where relief is sought against a judgment, on the ground that the appearance of an attorney was unauthorized, the rights of the parties can be as fully presented and as carefully adjudged on a motion as in an action. If the facts are controverted and the court is not satisfied upon the affidavits and papers presented as to what the real facts are, it may refer the matter for the purpose of talcing further evidence and may require the parties to submit to an oral examination or cross examination. <em>{Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 1015). The court on a motion possesses indeed all the substantial powers in conducting an investigation which formerly appertained to the Chancellor. The remedy by motion is more convenient, prompt and less expensive than by action. The unbroken practice, which seems to have prevailed in this state, to seek relief in cases like this by motion and not by action, has almost the force of law, and ought we think to be followed unless special circumstances exist which may render that remedy inadequate or incomplete. No such special circumstances existed in the present case, and we are therefore of opinion, notwithstanding the observations of GROVER, J. in his dissenting opinion in Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, that the order below cannot be sustained on the ground that it was discretionary with the court to remit the appellant to a remedy by action.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In disposing of this appeal it must, we think, be assumed, upon the papers presented on the motions, that the appellant Chase was neither served with process in the action nor authorized Mr. Whiting to appear for him, and also that he had no knowledge that such an action had been brought, nor any notice thereof mntil February 1881, after the rendition of the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ment of the special term. These facts are especially and particularly alleged in the moving papers, and are in no respect controverted by the opposing affidavits. The other circumstances are also consistent with the claim made. Chase was a non-resident of the state during the whole period of the litigation. That he was never served with process is conceded. Mr. Whiting, on the occasion of the interview with Mr. Dabney, the attorney employed by Mr. Chase, after he had been notified of the judgment rendered against him, admitted that he was not retained by Mr. Chase personally, and that he appeared for him by direction of Mr. Page, one of the co-defendants. Mr. Chase did not know Mr. Whiting and never saw him prior to the rendition of the judgment. He swears that he had no knowledge that Vilas made any claim against him. He knew that Vilas claimed title to rolling stock of the Plattsburg &amp; Montreal Railroad Company, which if established in the foreclosure action would, under the agreement between him and the receiver, be 'converted into a lien on the property. In the present action Vilas claimed that Page, Butler and Chase were jointly liable to him for the lien debt, but this claim was adjudicated adversely to him by the judgment of this court, Vilas <em>v. </em>Page (106 <em>N. Y. </em>439). There is no suggestion that Vilas ever asserted any personal claim against Chase except by and through the complaint in this action. The relations between Chase and Page at the time of the alleged retainer by the latter of Whiting to appear for Chase were hostile and so continued. But Page had an interest, in case the claim of Vilas for a personal judgment against the individual defendants should be established, that Chase should be bound by the judgment. The Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company (the real party opposing these motions) not only omitted to controvert any of the statements in the moving papers on the subject of the unauthorized appearance, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>made no request for a reference to ascertain the facts,, nor that it might be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine Chase or the other affiants on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The main question of law respects the relief, if any, to which Chase is entitled against the judgment by reason of the unauthorized appearance of Mr. Whiting. It is obvious that the court acquired no jurisdiction to render a personal judgment against Chase, unless, the appearance, although unauthorized, conferred jurisdiction, or unless the authority of the attorney to* appear is conclusively presumed from the fact of the-appearance.' The case of Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes <em>(supra) </em>held that a domestic judgment rendered by a court of general jurisdiction against a party who had not been served with process, but for whom an attorney of the court had appeared, though without authority, was. neither void nor irregular. The doctrine of the prevailing opinion in that case encountered a vigorous opposition from one of the judges at the time, and it is not too much to say that the reasoning upon which it rests has been frequently criticised by judges and the justice of the rule denied. But it has been followed and must be regarded as the law of the State (Hamilton.. <em>v. </em>Wright, <em>37 N. Y. </em>502; Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, 42 <em>Id. 2).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The Courts in this State, while holding that strictly/ domestic judgments rendered against a party not/ served, but for whom an attorney appeared without; authority, cannot be assailed on this ground whea coming in question collaterally, nevertheless grant relief, on motion, either by setting aside the judgment absolutely, or by staying proceedings, and permitting theqparty to come in and defend the action. Where the. attorney is insolvent, the judgment will be absolutely vacated and set aside (Campbell <em>v. </em>Bristol, 19 <em>Wend. </em>101). In other cases the proceedings will be stayed and the party permitted <em>to come in </em>and defend. The latter relief was granted in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes <em>(supra).. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In the present case no reli\u00e9f whatever was granted, but the application therefor was denied absolutely. Even if the judgment against Chase is governed by the rule established in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes (which, for reasons which will be stated, does not, we think, apply), then it would seem that the Court erred in denying relief. It is shown by the affidavit of the son of Mr. Whiting, which is uncontradicted, that his father\u2019s estate, at the time of his death in 1885, was entirely inadequate to pajr the amount of the judgment against Chase. It is not expressly shown what the pecuniary condition of Mr. Whiting was in 1881, when the judgment against Chase was entered. But assuming that Mr. Whiting had sufficient pecuniary ability \"at that time to respond in damages for the amount of the judgment, that, we think, is not controlling, to prevent relief on an application made after he became insolvent, provided it was made before the rights of the party procuring the judgment had changed to his prejudice. The party .against whom the judgment was rendered would still be entitled, we think, to appljr for and obtain relief by the vacation of the judgment. The plaintiff has no equity which entitles him to claim that the party injured should have been prompt to pursue and obtain a remedy by action against the attorney for damages and thereby enable the plaintiff to have the benefit of the judgment. Moreover, the judgment of the court in the (106 <em>N. Y.) </em>present action, conclusively determined as between the plaintiff and the defendants Page and Butler, that the latter had never assumed any personal obligation for the lien debt. If this judgment was not technically an estoppel of record as to the same question arising between the plaintiffs and Chase, on the ground that he was not a party to the appeal, nevertheless it furnished a strong reason for granting his absolute and final relief on this application, even if the estate of Mr. Whiting was insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>vent, instead of granting limited relief by a stay of proceedings merely with a right to come in and defend the action, thereby subjecting Chase to the trouble and expense of a new trial which could have but one result.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We have so far considered the case upon the assumption that it is governed by Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes and the \u2022cases following it. But we are of the opinion that a radi\u2022cal distinction exists between the cases hitherto decided \u2022and the present one, which prevents the application of the principle, that in the case of a domestic judgment ..strictly, a party not served, but for whom an unauthorized appearance was entered by an attorney, cannot on these grounds assail the judgment for want of jurisdiction. The distinction adverted to lies in the fact that in the cases hitherto decided in this State arising on domestic judgments, the judgment rendered was against a citizen of the State, who was within the jurisdiction, while in the present case the defendant in the judgment was at all times a non-resident and out of the jurisdiction. It is well settled that in an action brought in our courts on a judgment of a court of a sister State, the jurisdiction of the court to render the judgment may be assailed by proof that the defendant was not served and did not appear in the action, or where an appearance was entered by an attorney, that the appearance was unauthorized, and this even where the proof directly contradicts the record (Steinbach <em>v. </em>Murray, 5 <em>Wend. </em>148 ; Steinway <em>v. </em>Stillman, 6 <em>Id. </em>447; Kerr <em>v. </em>Kerr, 41 <em>N. Y. </em>272 ; Rapello, J., Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, 70 <em>Id. </em>257).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The same rule is held elsewhere, and is in consonance with the constitutional obligation under the Constitution of the United States as to the faith and credit to be given by one State to the judgments of other States (Gilman <em>v. </em>Gilman, 126 Mass. 126; Wright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>v. </em>Andrews, 131 <em>Id. </em>149; Thompson <em>v. </em>Whitman, 18 <em>Wall. </em>457 ; Knowles <em>v. </em>Gas Light Co., 19 <em>Id. </em>58).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">There is undoubtedly a logical difficulty in applying a different rule, as our courts do, in an action upon a domestic judgment where the only thing giving color of jurisdiction over the person is an unauthorized appearance by an attorney. The different rule in the two cases has been supposed to rest on the unreasonableness of compelling a party against whom judgment has been rendered in another State on an unauthorized appearance by an attorney to go to the foreign jurisdiction to attack it (See Dillon, J., in Harshay <em>v. </em>Blackman, 20 <em>Iowa. </em>161). The same reason, in justice would seem to apply in case of domestic judgment against a non-resident of the State, and besides it may be said that a non-resident, not served with process and for whom an unauthorized appearance had been entered in the foreign jurisdiction, would be much less, likely to become apprised of the pendency of the action than if he had been a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In Nordlinger <em>v. </em>DeNier (54 <em>Hun, </em>276), the general term of the supreme court in the first department, BARRETT, J. writing the opinion, set aside an unauthorized appearance entered for a non-resident defendant on the precise ground that the rule in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes did not apply in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Bodurtha <em>v. </em>Goodrich (3 <em>Gray, </em>508), was the case of an unauthorized appearance by an attorney for Bodurtha, a non-resident of Massachusetts, in an action brought in the latter State. The court reversed the judgment on writ of error, Shaw, Ch. J., saying: \u201c It would certainly be very strange if an inhabitant of another State could thus be bound by a judgment given and recorded by a court having no jurisdiction, without any act or default of such party.\u201d In Wiley <em>v. </em>Pratt, (23 <em>Ind. </em>629) the court, in a case of a domestic judgment where the party had not been served, but for whom an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>unauthorized appearance had been entered, adopted substantially the English rule as announced in Bagley <em>v. </em>Buckland (1. <em>Welsby H. &amp; N. </em>1) that where a defendant had been served and an unauthorized -appearance entered, the judgment would not be set aside, but if he had not been served it would be. Ray, C. J., after stating what he conceived to be the true \u2022rule, but excepting from it the case of a domestic judgment against a- non-resident not within the jurisdiction, said: \u201c Where the defendant has not been within the jurisdiction of the court it would not be just to comp \u00e9l him to come under that jurisdiction, and establish his defense to the action in order to claim relief from a judgment obtained without notice, and therefore the relief here must be absolute immunity from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We are bound under our decisions to follow the , doctrine of Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes in cases where it is strictly applicable. It is as to such cases <em>stare decisis. </em>But we are not disposed to extend the doctrine of that case to cases fairly and reasonably distinguishable, and the fact that a defendant against whom a judgment has been obtained here, upon an unauthorized appearance by an attorney, and who was not served, was a non-resident during the pendency of the proceedings, does, we think, constitute such a distinction .as renders the rule in that case inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Upon the point made by the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company that the defendant Chase is precluded from relief by his laches, but little need to be said. The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company acquired its interest in the property of the Plattsburgh &amp; Montreal Railroad Company in 1872. It took from Page his individual guaranty against the claim of third persons on the property including the claim of Vilas. Neither Butler or Chase were parties to the guaranty. In 1881, soon after the judgment against Chase was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>rendered, it was appraised of his claim that he had not. been served in the action and that the appearance of Whiting was unauthorized. When Vilas sued Chase on the judgment in Massachusetts, the latter promptly-disavowed the jurisdiction of the court to render the. judgment. Vilas, after the lapse of about two years, suffered a non-suit, inferably because he was unable to. establish the jurisdiction, and he took no further proceedings to collect the judgment, but after the final decision in this court he assigned the judgment against Chase to the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company,, on being paid the amount of the lien adjudged in the action, against the property in the possession of that company. The company took the assignment with full, notice of the equities of Chase. The delay of Chase, has not, so far as appears, changed the situation of either Vilas or the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company to the prejudice of either, and under such circumstances, the plea of laches, as was said in Platt <em>v. </em>Platt (58 <em>N. </em>Y. 646), will not be readily listened to, and ought not we think, to be listened to in this case to uphold, a judgment which, as was held by this court on the appeal of the co-defendants of Chase, standing in the same position with him, had no legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We think the motions in this case should have been, granted, and the judgment and appearance vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The orders of the special and general terms should, therefore, be reversed, and the motions granted, with, costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">All concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Note on Compelling an Att'orney to Disclose his. Authority to Appear, and his Client\u2019s Address or Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The decision in the text goes far to remove the -burden, which the rule in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes has laid on suitors entangled in a question of disputed authority of attorney, and establishes a rule more in harmony with the now-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>settled basis of the law as to the relative effect of judgments of courts of different states.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The question of the power of the court to compel a disclosure of the attorney\u2019s authority has recently been more fully recognized than before ; and it may now be deemed settled, I think, that a party may challenge the authority of the attorney for the adverse party to appear for that party, if he can make a <em>prima facie </em>case of want of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In respect to requiring a disclosure of the address of an adverse party the power is also now fully recognized. In equity the bill must state complainant\u2019s description and place of abode (i <em>Dan. Ch. Pr. </em>357). Uuder the Code the court may require disclosure, not only where there is suspicious, concealment as to who is the adversary, but also by a necessity of justice, where the applicant has obtained an order in the cause, or has process, which it is necessary to his case to serve personally on the adverse party, and shows also inability to make such service, and that the attorney on request for information as to the whereabouts of his client, for the purpose of enabling the applicant to make such service, refuses to disclose it. If the attorney makes satisfactory affidavit that he is ignorant of it, the court will not make ah order against him; but if his affidavit is evasive, may order a reference to ascertain the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In either case, if there is good reason to believe that concealment to evade service is practiced, the court may justly stay the proceedings of the party whose address is sought until disclosure be made, and where such party is merely standing on the defensive so that a stay would be futile, there seems to be no good reason why on the principle in Walker <em>v. </em>Walker (8 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>436; s. c., 82 <em>N. Y. </em>250; aff\u2019g 20 <em>Him, </em>400), the court might not in some cases at least, strike out his pleading and leave him in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The proper practice to procure disclosure of address is first to obtain the order or process desired to be served, and make diligent effort to serve it. Then to apply to the attorney with a request for the address, stating the object of asking it. Upon his refusal, to apply to the court or a judge on affidavits, and ask an order that the attorney disclose the address, or show cause why he should not disclose it, or the proceedings on the part of the client'be stayed, etc., and for general relief; and a stay can be asked pending the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\n<em>I.
