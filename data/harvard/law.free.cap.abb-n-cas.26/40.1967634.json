Upon the hearing upon the return day, after argument, the defendant claiming that he was a non-resident, an order committing him for contempt, with $10 costs of the proceeding was made, and upon his appeal the general term affirmed the order with $10 costs and disbursements, but upon a further appeal to the court of appeals, that court reversed both orders and denied the application of the petitioner \u201c with costs in all courts,\u201d and an order making the order of the court of appeals the order of the supreme court and directing that the defendant recover the costs of the proceeding in all courts, was duly entered in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">Upon appeal to the court of appeals the sum of $500 was paid into court as security, and upon returning the deposit the city chamberlain retained $5 thereof as his fees under the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">Defendant presented for taxation a bill of costs made up of the following items :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">Costs after notice of trial, $15 ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">Trial fee, issue of law, $20 ;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">Appeal to general term before argument, $20;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-10\">Appeal to general term for argument, $40;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-11\">Appeal to the court of appeals before argument, $30;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\">Appeal to the court of appeals for argument, $60.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-13\">The clerk refused to tax any of these items except those claimed in the court of appeals, but in lieu thereof allowed $10 motion costs at the special term, and $10 motion costs at the general term, and disallowed the disbursement of $5 above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-14\">This motion was now made to compel the clerk to tax the items disallowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-15\"><em>J.

The order to show cause had the effect of a summons and of a notice of trial and therefore no proceedings could have been taken by defendant before notice of trial. Matter of David, 2 <em>Monthly L. Bul. </em>96. The discretion vested in the court is merely whether costs shall be awarded or not. (People <em>ex. rel. </em>Donovan <em>v. </em>Fire Commissioners, 5 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>144.) The hearing upon the return of the order to show cause was similar to the trial of an action, and the defendant for the purpose of fixing the amount of costs is willing to consider it a trial of an issue of law. The order of the special term was a final determination of the whole matter, and was essentially a judgment and not a mere order, and full costs as in the trial of actions and appeals from judgments should be taxed. (See Rensaeller &amp;c. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Davis, 55 <em>N. Y. </em>145: Matter of Jetter, 78 <em>N. Y. </em>601 : Matter of Protestant &amp;c. School, 86 <em>N.

It is however a prosecution in a court of justice by a party against another party for the enforcement of a right and is a special proceeding within section 3334 of the Code above cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Section 3240 provides that costs in a special proceeding may be awarded at the rate allowed for similar services in an action brought in the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The court of appeals in this case having awarded to the successful party costs in all courts, it would appear that he is entitled to costs at the rate allowed for similar services in an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The provisions by which the court has power to award motion costs do not apply. Such costs are allowed under subdivision 3 of section 3251, which provides that upon any motion specified in section 3236, a sum to be fixed by the judge or court not' exceeding $10 besides necessary disbursements for printing and Referee\u2019s fees, may be awarded. Section 3236 refers to costs upon a motion in an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In this case there was no action but a special proceeding, the order that was appealed from and which was reversed was a final order requiring the defendant to pay a sum of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">It is true that the order committed the defendant as for a contempt in case he refused to pay, but the proceeding was not a motion in an action to punish for a contempt committed by refusal to obey an order in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">I think therefore that the taxation of the clerk must be set aside and the clerk directed to tax the costs as in an. action.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The clerk was right in refusing to tax as a disbursement the fees of the chamberlain on deposit of the sum as security to stay proceedings on appeal. That was not a disbursement in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Motion granted as indicated with $10 costs of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Note on the Distinction between Actions and Special Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The original distinction between actions and special proceedings is very well understood. The Code says, that an action is an \u201c ordinary prosecution,\u201d etc., but \u201c ordinary \u201d needs definition even more than action. It means that form of prosecution where the claimant has a right to issue summons to answer a complaint stating the facts constituting the cause of action, and defendant has a right to take issue or set up his facts in defense or counterclaim, and either party may require a trial and a judgment, enforcible by execution ; as distinguished from those forms where the statute or the court prescribes other means of bringing in the defendant, or presenting the facts and formulating the decision and its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Practically the only difficulty in the distinction is introduced by our complex statutes which have half obliterated the lines between them, by transformations from one category into another and back again. Even this would be of little importance, were it not that there are some very substantial differences between our rights in prosecuting an action, and our rights in prosecuting a special proceeding. The regulations differ more or less in regard to the service of some papers, the subjects of motions and orders, subpoenas, depositions, discovery of books and papers, amendment, abatement and continuance, and in some cases as to appeal and costs. Hence, the following suggestion of the points of departure may be useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The ordinary proceedings in an action sometimes branch out into a special proceeding, and in pursuing that branch the practitioner must not forget that he has crossed the line of demarcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">On the other hand there are a number of special proceedings which at one stage or another are, so to speak, transmuted into actions, or subjected to the regulations applicable to actions, by reason of special provisions of statutes which, with the innocent intention of simplifying the practice, declare sometimes in one form and sometimes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>another, that a special proceeding shall be from such a point, or in such a respect subject to the provisions regulating actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The following references to the principal contrasts will serve as a convenient starting point for investigating the practical limits of the distinction in reference to all important matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">There are some other special provisions peculiar to particular proceedings, which it would only confuse to notice here, the present object being to draw the general distinction, in the light of which to read special statutory provisions as to any particular proceeding, and decisions in the practice in any particular proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\n<em>Notes oti statutes and cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\"><em>Abatement </em>and continuance in case of actions is regulated by <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7755-765.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Special proceedings are not within these provisions (Matter of Palmer, 43 <em>Hun, </em>572 ; Matter of Roberts, 53 <em>Id. </em>338 ; Matter of Barney, 53 <em>Id. </em>480; compare People <em>ex rel. </em>Fairchild <em>v. </em>Coms. of Brooklyn, 105 N. <em>Y. </em>674),\u2014not even when in the surrogate\u2019s court, (Herbert <em>v. </em>Stevenson, 3 <em>Dem. </em>236, s. c., 1 <em>How. Pr. </em>N. <em>S. </em>64).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">But a special proceeding by or against an officer, receiver or other trustee, does not abate on his death or removal, the rule on that point being the same as in an action, \u00a7 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\"><em>Amendments </em>in actions are regulated by Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 721-728.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Amendments in special proceedings in the four main courts or classes of court, (supreme, superior, city, county, and New York city), are regulated by the same provisions (\u00a7 3347, subd. 6; and \u00a7 1997 as to State writs and amendments in special proceedings in all other courts of record, a term which now includes surrogates courts), are regulated by the same provisions, (id. and \u00a7 2538) ; (condemnation proceedings \u00a7 3368). \u00a7 723 as to amending, as to parties and .pleadings is applicable to all courts, \u00a7 3347, subd. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">For the purpose of <em>appeal </em>to general term an order made in a summary application after judgment in an action, is deemed to have been made in the action (\u00a7 1347).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">The rules as to <em>costs </em>in actions, and security for costs are - applied approximately in special proceedings, (\u00a7\u00a7 3240, 3379).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\"><em>Depositions de bene esse, </em>and depositions taken without the State and <em>examination of parties before trial, </em>are allowed only in actions by \u00a7\u00a7 879, etc., \u00a7 887, etc., and the statute is extended to special proceedings in surrogate\u2019s courts, (\u00a7 2538, <em>contra </em>Estate of McCoskry, 5 <em>Denn. </em>256, s. c., 10 Civ. Pro. <em>R. </em>178).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Otherwise they are not allowable in special proceedings (Matter of an attorney, 83 <em>N. Y. </em>164) ; unless it may be that \u00a7 805, as to taking an affidavit for use on a motion, applies to special proceedings ; or at least to special proceedings commenced by State writ\u2014such as <em>habeas corpus, </em>mandamus, prohibition, etc., (\u00a71997).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The regulation as to <em>discovery of books and papers, </em>(\u00a7 803-809), purport to apply only in actions and in special proceedings in surrogates courts, (\u00a7 2538, but compare as to surrogates courts, Matter of Stokes, 28 <em>Hun, </em>564, aff\u2019g. 5 <em>Redf. </em>586).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The provisions of the general statute of <em>limitations </em>of actions, are now expressly made applicable to special proceedings, \u00a7 414..</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\"><em>Motions and orders, </em>in actions, are regulated in a general way by \u00a7 767-769.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Motions in special proceedings in the four main courts or classes of courts, are subject to the same provisions so far as applicable (\u00a7 3347, subd; 6; \u00a7 1999, as to State writs). As to notice of motion, and enlarging time see \u00a7\u00a7 781-784, which, so far as express words of the statutes go, only apply in actions, and in proceedings commenced by State writ, \u00a7 1999, compare \u00a7 3347, first clause and subd. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\"><em>Preferences </em>on the calendar are subject to one system of regulation, (\u00a7\u00a7 789-795)-</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\"><em>Service of summons </em>in an action cannot be made by a party to the action, <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 425. And so also of the old common law special proceedings, now preserved under the name of State writ, such as <em>habeas corpus, </em>mandamus, prohibition, assessment of damages, and certiorari (1999), and condemnation proceedings (3362).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">Service of the corresponding process by which other special proceedings are commenced, such at least as a citation in the surrogates court, may be served by the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\"><em>Service of other papers </em>is regulated for actions by \u00a7\u00a7 796-802, and these regulations, although expressly applicable only to actions and in the main courts, (3347, subd. 6), and to special proceedings in the surrogates courts, (\u00a7 2538) ;\u2014and to condemnation proceedings, (\u00a7 3364).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\"><em>Subpoena </em>in an action issues out of the court <em>(Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 852), and disobedience is punished by proceedings for contempt (\u00a7 853), to be taken as prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 9-16, and \u00a7\u00a7 2266, etc., viz., by an order in the action, or by a new \u201c special proceeding \u201d branching out from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">Subpoena in a special proceeding is issued by the judge, arbitrator, referee or other person, board or committee, before whom the proceeding is had, (\u00a7 854), and disobedience is punished by proceedings before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>such person if he be a judge, if not, by proceedings before any judge \u25a0of such court, (\u00a7 856).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><em>Supplementary proceedings </em>to enforce judgment, are now special proceedings, \u00a7 2433.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The courts had just settled that supplementary proceedings were proceedings in the action thus placing the jurisdiction on a fair and usually secure foundation, Wright <em>v. </em>Nostrand, 94 <em>N. Y. </em>31, rev\u2019g, 47 <em>Super. Ct. </em>(J. &amp; <em>S.) </em>441, when the revisers, for some reason not generally appreciated, transformed them, by a word, into special proceedings, (\u00a7 2433), so that subpoenas therein .must now be issued by the judge or referee. People <em>ex rel. </em>Jacobs v. Ball, 37 <em>Hun, </em>245; Howe <em>v. </em>Welch, 11 <em>Civ. Pro.

Ithaca Agric. Works <em>v. </em>Eggleston, 106 <em>N.
