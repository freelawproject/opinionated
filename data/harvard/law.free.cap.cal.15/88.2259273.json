The complaint avers plaintiffs to be owners of a mine situated on a portion of a rancho, the title to which is derived from the Mexican Government; that by conveyances from the grantee, plaintiffs have the right of way over all portions of said rancho; that defendants are working another mine on the same rancho; that the only practicable road leading from plaintiffs\u2019 mine to the main highway goes by the mine defendants are working, and that defendants, to injure plaintiffs, wantonly obstruct said road by putting gates across it and preventing all ingress and egress. The complaint avers the great value of the mine, large number of laborers employed, and that said obstructions are ruinous, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">For the purposes of this application, further facts are not necessary, though it was thought proper to state thus much.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">The preliminary injunction and other proceedings were then had, as stated in the syllabus.
