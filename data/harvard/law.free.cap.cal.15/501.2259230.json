Answer, not verified, denied all the allegations of the complaint, and set up discharge in insolvency in bar. On the trial, plaintiff proved up the note mentioned in the complaint, introduced it in evidence, and rested. Defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground, among others, that the action is to recover a debt founded on the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>promise alleged to have been made by defendant after his discharge in insolvency, and that there is no proof of such new promise. Overruled. Instructions to find for plaintiff, and verdict accordingly. New trial granted, and plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-5\"><em>Bowie &amp; Griffith, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">The allegation in the complaint as to defendant\u2019s discharge in insolvency was surplusage. The complaint contained two causes of action\u2014 one on the note, the other on the new promise. This latter was unnecessary, and may be disregarded. (Gould\u2019s Pl. Ch. sec. 4, 170; 14 Johns. 380; 1 Chitty Pl. 229.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-7\"><em>E. B. Crocker, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-8\">1. There is no abuse of discretion in granting a new trial here. <em>(Drake </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>2 Cal. 197; 3 Id. 413; 4 Id. 122; Id. 288.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\">2. The gravamen of the action was the new promise, as to which plaintiff offered no proof, and hence his suit could not be sustained and the new trial was properly granted.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b502-10\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"ASK\">Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The complaint in this case does not distinctly, if at all, count on two causes of action. The whole matter of the complaint seems to be blended in one statement. If the complaint was intended to set up two causes of action, this intent was not distinctly manifested by the form of the complaint, as it should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">It is true, the complaint does <em>not </em>aver <em>that the </em>defendant was discharged in bankruptcy; it says he claimed to be, but in the next sentence it avers that after <em>his discharge </em>he promised, etc.; and we are inclined to think that the proper construction is that the gravamen of the action was designed to be the promise\u2014the previous indebtedness being averred as matter of inducement, or as indicating the extent and character of the engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">The defendant might very well have been taken by surprise under these circumstances, and supposed it not necessary to introduce proof of his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">Under these circumstances, we cannot revise the discretion of the Court below in granting a new trial, there being no palpable abuse of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
