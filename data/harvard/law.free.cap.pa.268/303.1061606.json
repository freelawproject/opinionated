The petition prayed that certain ballot boxes be opened, the ballots counted according to law, and a true return be made thereof. Harry C. Eansley, the candidate returned as nominated, moved that the proceedings he quashed, on the ground that the quarter sessions had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The court, in opinions by Patterson, J., and Shoemaker, J., in which opinions Bregy, P. J,, concurred, held there was nothing in the Acts of May 19,1874, P. L. 208; July 12,1913, P. L. 719, or July 9, 1919, P. L. 839, which gave the quarter sessions jurisdiction over such a contest, and they accordingly entered an order quashing the proceedings. See 29 Pa. Dist. R. 626.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AyhH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>December 31, 1920:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-3\">The petitioners appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-5\"><em>Allen S.
