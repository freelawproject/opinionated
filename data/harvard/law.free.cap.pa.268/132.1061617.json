While the gift of a remainder \u201cupon and after\u201d the expiration of a life estate, does not necessarily prevent its vesting at the death of testator, yet it will be so held if the language of the will, taken in its entirety, clearly discloses this to have been the intent.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-10\">2. This is the usual legal conclusion where the gift to the remaindermen is found only in a direction to \u201cdivide\u201d the estate among them, after the death of the life tenant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-11\">3 A son cannot be \u201crelatives\u201d in a gift to \u201crelatives\u201d after the death of the son as life tenant; the plural form of the word excludes this possibility.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-12\">4. That the remainder is to be \u201cdivided among my relatives\u201d after the death of the son as life.tenant, leads to the same conclusion. \u2018Divided among\u201d carries with it the thought that more than two are to take.

He provides for his sisters, brothers, wife, son and his son\u2019s children, if he has any, and if his son has no children, he then desires that his estate pass to his relatives, not to his relatives at the time of the death of testator, but his relatives, whoever they may be, at the time of the death of Harry K. Hildebrant, without children. He wanted his estate to go to his relatives of his own blood, his own family, the Hildebrants, in case Harry died without children: Jordan v.

Hildebrant, and subject to all the foregoing provisions of this my will, I direct my executor or executors to give and pay all the residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, to such child or children as the said Harry K. Hildebrant may leave to survive him; and, in the event that he shall die without leaving issue, I direct my estate to be divided among my relatives under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.\u201d He left surviving him his widow, his son, and certain collateral relatives, one of whom is the appellant. The son died first, intestate, never having had any children, but leaving as his next of Mn his mother and his widow; then the son\u2019s widow died; and finally the widow of testator died.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Upon settlement of the final account of testator\u2019s executors, the auditing judge awarded the residuary estate to the son\u2019s administrator; but, upon the hearing of exceptions filed by testator\u2019s collateral relatives, he reached a different conclusion, and, after dismissing the exceptions, made a final decree awarding one-half the residue to the administrator of the estate of testator\u2019s widow, and the other half to the executor of the will of the son\u2019s widow. From this decree, William H. Hildebrant, one of the collateral relatives, prosecuted an appeal to the Superior Court which affirmed the decree by a divided court, and therefrom the present appeal was allowed. The only question for consideration is: Who are meant by the word \u201crelatives\u201d in the residuary clause of testator\u2019s will?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>As already quoted, it gives to the widow and son successive life estates, and then proceeds: \u201cupon and after the death of nay said son......and subject to all the foregoing provisions of this my will I direct my executor or executors to give and pay all the rest and residue of my estate......to such child or children as the said Harry K. Hildebrant may leave to survive him.\u201d It may be admitted that the use of the words \u201cupon and after\u201d would not alone prevent a vesting of the estate; bait it is clear, from the foregoing language, that those who are to take the residue are not the grandchildren who survive the testator, but those, if any, who survive his son. It is fair to presume this thought was continued throughout the balance of the will; indeed it is the normal meaning of the words: \u201cin the event that he [the son] should die without leaving issue [which of course means issue surviving him and not issue surviving the testator] I direct my estate to be divided among my relatives under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania\u201d; and it is also the usual legal conclusion, where, as here, the gift to the remaindermen is found only in the direction to \u201cdivide\u201d the estate among them: Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403; Rau\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 464; Evans\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 264 Pa. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Moreover, while it is of course true that a son may be held to be a relative, even though he is called \u201cson\u201d everywhere else in the will, and though popularly he never would be called a relative, yet certainly a son cannot be \u201crelatives\u201d \u2014 the plural form of the expression necessarily excluding him. McFillin\u2019s Est., 235 Pa. 175, relied upon by appellees, is not controlling. There the gift in remainder was to the \u201cperson or persons who shall be entitled thereto as my next of kin.\u201d The son there was a \u201cperson\u201d who was the \u201cnext of kin\u201d of that testator; while here the son cannot be \u201crelatives\u201d of this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The same conclusion follows from the provision that the estate shall then be \u201cdivided among\u201d his relatives. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201cDivided among\u201d necessarily refers to a gift to more than two relatives, and hence excludes the son, even if technical rules of construction would otherwise call for a decision in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Considering the will in its entirety, as of course we must, we have reached the conclusion, for the reasons above stated, that the balance for distribution should have been awarded to testator\u2019s collateral relatives, who survived his son Harry.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The decree of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted with directions to make distribution in accordance with this <em>opinion; </em>appellees to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
