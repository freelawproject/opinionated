For reasons we will explain, the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Luis Manuel Casillas pled no contest to possession of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)). Germane to this appeal is the following excerpt from the plea proceedings:</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u201cThe Court: Louis Manuel Castillas [sic] 68803. Defendant is present with Miss Bukowski and the interpreter. People represented by Mr. Wolf. This is time and place set for preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\u201cWhat is the proposed disposition?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u201cMs. Bukowski: Mr. Castillas [sz'c] will plead to an [sic] 11377 for ninety days felony probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">\u201cThe Court: Strike the enhancement?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">\u201cMs. Bukowski: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Castillas [sic], my understanding\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">\u201cMs. Bukowski: Your Honor, I\u2019m sorry, he will also be released OR; and condition of that OR will be that he appear at sentencing on the date stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">\u201cThe Court: All right. If he does not, then ninety day maximum sentence will be three years in prison, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">\u201cMs. Bukowski: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Castillas [sic], as stated by your attorney, is that your understanding of the plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">\u201cThe Court: Maximum sentence under the terms of this plea is ninety days in jail as a condition of felony probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">\u201cWhile you\u2019re on probation, if you\u2019re [sic] ever violate[d], you could be sent to state prison for up to what\u2019s left of the maximum sentence of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u201cIf that happens, upon your release, you could be placed on parole up to five years. While on parole, if you\u2019re [sz'c] ever violate[d], you could be sent back to state prison for up to one year for each violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201cDo you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u201cThe Court: You will be released from custody today; but, if you do not show up to probation, don\u2019t show up for sentencing, the plea of guilty\u2014 pardon me, the plea of no contest will remain in effect but instead of a ninety-day maximum, go up to a three-year maximum in state prison if you don\u2019t show up.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u201cDo you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u201cThe Court: Because this is a felony, you won\u2019t be sentenced by this court. Sentencing judge wouldn\u2019t go along with the plea bargain, you\u2019ll be able to withdraw your guilty plea or your no contest plea, re-enter a not guilty and come back to this court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\u201cDo you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Released on his own recognizance (OR) pending sentencing, as provided by his plea bargain, Casillas failed to appear for sentencing. After being arrested, he moved to withdraw his no contest plea. The trial court denied the motion and sentenced him to prison for the three-year upper term. On this appeal, he contends the court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his plea because his plea did not include a valid waiver of his right to withdraw his plea (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.5 (section 1192.5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">\n<em>Cruz</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1247 [246 Cal.Rptr. 1, 752 P.2d 439] <em>(Cruz), </em>the defendant pled guilty to heroin possession under a plea bargain which provided for felony probation with up to one year local incarceration, or, at defendant\u2019s option, a sixteen-month prison term. Released on bail, the defendant failed to appear for sentencing. Several months later, the defendant having been arrested, the trial court disapproved the plea bargain, denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and sentenced him to prison for the two-year middle term. The Supreme Court held: \u201cPenal Code section 1192.5 provides that a defendant who pleads guilty pursuant to a plea bargain which is subsequently disapproved by the trial court shall be permitted to withdraw the plea if he or she so desires. The issue before us is whether this provision applies when the trial court withdraws its approval because the defendant fails to appear for sentencing. We conclude that the statute applies even to the fleeing defendant, against whom separate sanctions are available under Penal Code sections 1320 and 1320.5.\u201d <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>at p. 1249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>Cruz </em>disapproved <em>People </em>v. <em>Santos </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 67 [216 Cal.Rptr. 911], which had held that a defendant\u2019s failure to appear for sentencing forfeited his or her right either to specific enforcement of the plea bargain or to withdraw the guilty plea. <em>(Cruz, </em>supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1254.) The Supreme Court in <em>Cruz </em>refused to deny section 1192.5 protection to \u201cdefendants who plea-bargain in bad faith or \u2018breach the bargain\u2019 through illegal acts.\u201d <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>at p. 1253.) The court said this rationale \u201cerrs ... in characterizing as a \u2018breach\u2019 of the plea bargain what is really a separate offense of failure to appear. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1320 and 1320.5.) nn The imposition of an additional or enhanced sentence for a separately chargeable offense without the benefit of a trial on that charge, and in the absence of a knowing and intelligent waiver, is clearly offensive to the principles of due process.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Cruz </em>followed several appellate opinions which held \u201cthat a defendant who fails to appear for sentencing under a plea bargain does not lose the protections of section 1192.5, and must be allowed to withdraw his or her guilty plea should the court refuse to adhere to the original sentencing terms. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cruz, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 1250.) But the court added: \u201cWe do not mean to imply by this holding that a defendant fully advised of his or her rights under section 1192.5 may not expressly waive those rights, such that if the defendant willfully fails to appear for sentencing the trial court may withdraw its approval of the defendant\u2019s plea and impose a sentence in excess of the bargained-for term. Any such waiver, of course, would have to be obtained at the time of the trial court\u2019s initial acceptance of the plea, and it must be knowing and intelligent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1254, fn. 5.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\n<em>Cruz\u2019s antecedents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><em>Cruz's </em>antecedents comprised two distinct fact patterns. In <em>In re Falco </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1161 [222 Cal.Rptr. 648] and similar cases, no discussion of the consequences of nonappearance occurred during the plea proceedings; when the absconding defendant finally appeared for sentencing the court imposed a harsher disposition than bargained for, denying his request to withdraw his plea. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1163-1164; <em>In re Lunceford </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 180 [236 Cal.Rptr. 274]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1566 [237 Cal.Rptr. 137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d 358 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrero </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1080 [210 Cal.Rptr. 70], after the parties negotiated a plea bargain but before the defendant actually pled guilty, the court itself imposed a condition providing a sanction for the defendant\u2019s nonappearance at sentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 360 [court released defendant OR but summarily imposed state prison sentence with execution stayed pending his appearance at formal sentencing]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrero, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d at p. 1082 [court released defendant on bail but said nonappearance would result in increased prison term with no right to withdraw guilty plea].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In addition to protecting a defendant\u2019s established right to withdraw his or her guilty plea if the plea bargain is not honored, <em>Cruz\u2019s </em>antecedents vindicated other important policies, including the statutory scheme for OR release, the prosecutor\u2019s discretion to charge crimes, the defendant\u2019s right to trial on criminal charges, and the panoply of procedural requirements for sentencing hearings. \u201cWhile trial courts are encouraged to fashion <em>procedural </em>innovations, consistent with due process requirements, designed to effectively and fairly expedite the processing of criminal cases, we cannot condone unconventional techniques which clearly infringe upon a defendant\u2019s basic rights or otherwise fetter prosecutorial discretion as are here manifested.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>The Vargas exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1107 [273 Cal.Rptr. 48] announced this exception to the <em>Cruz </em>rule: \u201cIn a plea bargain, if the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>agrees to a specific greater term to be imposed if he should fail to appear for sentencing, and to a specified lesser term if he does appear, may the trial court impose the greater term if he fails to appear at the sentencing hearing without justification? Our answer is that it can, and we affirm the judgment in this case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vargas, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d at p. 1108.) The court reasoned: \u201cHere, unlike the <em>Morris </em>line of cases and <em>Cruz, </em>the trial court did not seek to repudiate the plea bargain or to impose a sentence more onerous than that which defendant had agreed to accept as part of the bargain itself. The plea bargain specified the sentence defendant was to receive: two years if he appeared at the sentencing hearing, and five years if he did not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1113, fh. omitted.) On this basis, the court concluded that section 1192.5 simply did not apply: \u201cThe express agreement for a two-year term required that defendant appear for sentencing. It provided for a five-year term if he did not. The latter condition having occurred, the court was free to impose the agreed upon sentence of five years. It did no less, but no more.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1539 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 7], this court distinguished <em>Vargas, </em>articulating the critical difference between <em>Vargas </em>and <em>Cruz </em>and its antecedents. \u201cIn the present case, it is clear that the plea bargain itself did not contemplate a sentence higher than the four-year middle term. The court did indicate at the time of the guilty plea, separate and apart from the plea bargain, that it would consider releasing appellant from custody on the sentencing date and continue the time for sentencing; the court advised appellant he would be \u2018subject to\u2019 a six-year upper term. At the next hearing, the court decided to release appellant pending sentencing and stated that defendant faced a maximum consecutive sentence of seven years . . . four months, if he failed to return to court as promised. The court noted appellant\u2019s release was not part of the plea agreement to which the prosecutor was a party. Ffl] Thus, there was no two-tiered plea agreement as was the case in <em>Vargas. </em>The record supports no other conclusion, and the trial court expressly stated that the plea bargain only provided for a four-year sentence. Accordingly, we reject respondent\u2019s contention that sentence was imposed in the present case pursuant to the plea bargain.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>The cases harmonized</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">From these authorities, we distill the following principles. First, when a defendant fails to appear at sentencing after entering a bargained plea with no discussion about a specific sanction for nonappearance, he or she is entitled to withdraw the plea if the court refuses to honor the plea bargain. Second, the same rule applies when, during the plea proceedings but after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the parties have negotiated the basic plea bargain, the court imposes an additional condition providing a sanction for nonappearance. Third, when the parties themselves agree as part of the plea bargain to. a specific sanction for nonappearance, the court need not permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea but may invoke the bargained-for sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In the real world, plea bargaining is a multilateral process, involving the trial court as well as the parties. In the universe of plea-bargained cases, judicial involvement may occur anywhere along a continuum, from the outset or only after the parties have reached a tentative agreement. At some point, the judge must approve the deal. This being so, to imply the bargain is in any sense complete before the judge consents to it is simply nonsensical. In plea negotiations, the distinction between the second and third situations discussed above (or between <em>Morris </em>and Vargas) may be subtle indeed. The ultimate question will be not whether the bargain occurred in a hermetically sealed environment from which the judge was excluded, but whether the return provision resulted from the give-and-take of plea bargaining or was a judicially imposed afterthought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We now apply these principles to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>The principles applied</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The present case differs from <em>Cruz </em>and the <em>Falco </em>line of cases because the plea hearing did include a discussion of a sanction for Casillas\u2019s nonappearance at sentencing. Technically, however, it differs also from <em>Vargas </em>because Casillas did not agree \u201cto a specific greater term to be imposed if he should fail to appear for sentencing.\u201d As stated by the plea judge, Casillas agreed that if he did not appear for sentencing after his OR release, \u201cthen ninety day <em>maximum sentence </em>will be three years in prison.\u201d (Italics added.) As recharacterized by the sentencing judge, the plea provided \u201cthe alternative of <em>unconditional plea </em>if he failed to appear.\u201d (Italics added.) In sum, Casillas simply agreed the 90-day part of the deal was off should he fail to appear after his OR release.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">This distinction is insignificant. We see no reason why the parties should not be free to negotiate a lesser sanction for nonappearance than imposition of a specific greater sentence. Indeed, such a lesser sanction preserves the panoply of procedural protections and rights for the sentencing hearing. Further, because the defendant\u2019s nonappearance does not automatically trigger any particular greater term, the ultimate sentence will not be a de facto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>summary punishment for nonappearance but the result of trial court discretion based on all the circumstances. This result seems infinitely more responsive to the concerns voiced by <em>Cruz </em>and the <em>Morris </em>line of cases than the <em>Vargas </em>\u201ctwo-tiered plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The question remains whether the present case involves a bargained-for provision related to the plea agreement or a judicially imposed, unrelated, unbargained-for term. The relevant transcript leaves no doubt a plea agreement already had been negotiated off the record. The agreement included the understanding Casillas \u201cwill also be released OR; and condition of that OR will be that he appear at sentencing on the date stated.\u201d From the court\u2019s immediate statement of the consequences of nonappearance (\u201cIf he does not, then ninety day maximum sentence will be three years in prison, is that correct?\u201d) and the rapid concurrence of both defense counsel and Casillas, we infer the sanction itself had been negotiated and was not simply imposed by the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In sum, we are persuaded the return provision was a valid part of the plea agreement itself and, therefore, enforceable without regard to section 1192.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court properly denied Casillas\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Stone (W.
