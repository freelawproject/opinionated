Housing Authority) challenges two findings made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Appeals Board) in favor of Roger Chandler, the L.A. Housing Authority\u2019s Chief of Police: that the Appeals Board had jurisdiction to determine whether Chandler was an employee within the meaning of Labor Code section 4850 as part of Chandler\u2019s application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and that the L.A. Housing Authority was collaterally estopped from denying that Chandler was entitled to the benefits of Labor Code section 4850 because that issue had been resolved against the L.A. Housing Authority in a previous workers\u2019 compensation case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The L.A. Housing Authority further asserts that the earlier case had been decided incorrectly and that Chandler is not entitled to benefits under section 4850. We find that the Appeals Board properly concluded that it had authority to determine the jurisdiction issue, and that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the L.A. Housing Authority from denying section 4850 benefits in this case. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In a \u201cFindings and Award\u201d issued on February 5, 1996, a workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) determined that Roger Chandler, who had been employed as the L.A. Housing Authority\u2019s Chief of Police, was temporarily disabled for a period of one year as a result of bruxism (a grinding of the teeth in sitiiations of stress). The WCJ requested further briefing on two issues: whether he had jurisdiction to determine if Chandler was an employee as defined by section 4850 as part of Chandler\u2019s application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and, if so, whether the L.A. Housing Authority was collaterally estopped from asserting that Chandler did not come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>within section 4850. The collateral estoppel issue emanated from the Appeals Board\u2019s opinion and order in <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) W.C.A.B. No. PAS 16292, which held that an L.A. Housing Authority police officer came within the definition of section 4850. (The L.A. Housing Authority\u2019s petition for writ of review was denied by Division Five of the Second Appellate District on July 25, 1994 (59 Cal.Comp.Cases 597), and its petition for review was later denied by the Supreme Court.) In a \u201cFindings and Award\u201d issued on September 3, 1996, the WCJ held that Chandler was entitled to disability benefits under section 4850.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The L.A. Housing Authority petitioned the Appeals Board for reconsideration of the WCJ\u2019s decision. On May 8,1997, the Appeals Board affirmed the September 3, 1996, findings and award on the issues pertinent to this opinion. The instant petition for writ of review followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">1. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The L.A. Housing Authority contends that the Appeals Board was without jurisdiction to determine Chandler\u2019s benefit status at the same time it heard his application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">The parties\u2019 arguments on this issue center on the case of <em>Department of Justice </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 194 [261 Cal.Rptr. 130] <em>(DOJ). </em>In <em>DOJ, </em>a deputy attorney general with a temporary disability applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, claiming that he was an employee within the meaning section 4800. (213 Cal.App.3d at p. 197.) At the time <em>DOJ </em>was decided, section 4800 provided a one-year leave of absence at full pay in lieu of other temporary disability benefits \u201c[w]henever any member of the California Highway Patrol or any member of the Department of Justice falling within the \u2018state safety\u2019 class is disabled by injury arising out of and in the course of his duties . . . .\u201d The employee\u2019s \u201cprincipal duties [must] consist of active law enforcement. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 4800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">In analyzing whether the Appeals Board had jurisdiction to determine the benefit status of the employee as part of his workers\u2019 compensation application, the <em>DOJ </em>court first looked to section 4801. Section 4801 provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the appeals board to determine . . . upon request of the Department of the California Highway Patrol or Department of Justice . . . whether or not the disability referred to in Section 4800 arose out of and in the course of duty.\u201d The court recognized that empowering the Appeals Board to determine an employee\u2019s benefit category only upon request of the employer would prevent an application from being fully adjudicated in a single proceeding, and that if the Appeals Board made a finding adverse to the employee, the employee\u2019s only remedy would be to seek a writ of mandamus in superior court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. <em>(DOJ, </em>supra, 213 Cal.App.3d at pp. 200-201.) Nonetheless, the <em>DOJ </em>court found that \u201c[t]o give effect to the triggering language \u2018upon request of,\u2019 \u201d the Legislature necessarily intended that the initial determination of eligibility be made upon request of the employer, not the employee. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">The <em>DOJ </em>court further stated that its conclusion was strengthened by comparing sections 4800 and 4801 with sections 4850 and 4851. In contrast to section 4801, section 4851 provides that \u201c[t]he governing body of any city, county, or city and county . . . may request the appeals board to determine in any case, and the appeals board shall determine, whether or not the disability referred to in Section 4850 arose out of and in the course of duty. The appeals board shall also, in any disputed case, determine when the disability commenced and ceased, and the amount of benefits provided by this division to which the employee is entitled during the period of the disability. The appeals board shall have jurisdiction to award and enforce payment of these benefits . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The <em>DOJ </em>court reasoned that an \u201cimportant distinction between the statutory schemes for section 4800 benefits and section 4850 benefits is the role assigned to the Board. This distinction convince[d the <em>DOJ </em>court that] the Board has a considerably more circumscribed fact-finding role in the administration of section 4800 benefits, which does not include determining eligibility.\" (213 Cal.App.3d at p. 203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The <em>DOJ </em>court continued: \u201cAll of the benefit schemes under consideration, Labor Code sections 4800 and 4850 and Government Code sections 21026 and 21363,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] utilize the fact-finding expertise of the Board. [Citation.] The Government Code sections expressly limit that role to a determination of causation. The Board\u2019s role set forth in section 4851 has steadily increased. In 1969 the Board\u2019s role under section 4851 was virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>identical to that in section 4801: the Board determined whether the disability arose out of and in the course of duty, and in disputed cases when the disability existed. [Citation.] In 1977 the Board\u2019s role was increased to include the determination of the amount of benefits. [Citation.] In 1985 the Board was given the jurisdiction to award and enforce payments. [Citation.] During the same period the Board\u2019s role with respect to section 4800 benefits has remained the same. It determines only whether the disability arose out of and in the course of duty and when the disability ceases. As the Board concedes, it has no authority to determine the amount of benefits or enforce the award. [Citation.] Thus, the Board\u2019s role under section 4801 is closer to that under Government Code sections 21026 and 21363, which is expressly limited to determining causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\u201cGiven the extent of the express duties assigned to the Board under section 4851 in administering the benefits provided under section 4850, including determination of the amount of benefits, it may be appropriate for the Board also to determine whether an applicant falls within the generic job titles defining eligible employees. The same role is not appropriate for the Board with respect to section 4800 benefits . . . .\u201d (213 Cal.App.3d at pp. 203-204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We are now faced directly with the issue on which <em>DOJ </em>opined by analogy.  In approaching this issue, our first task \u201cis to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. . . . The words of the statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose, and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.]\u201d (Dyna-Med, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)  Based on the broad duties assigned to the Appeals Board under section 4851, we may infer the Legislature intended that the Appeals Board have jurisdiction to determine whether an employee comes within the meaning of section 4850 at the same time it hears the employee\u2019s application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Moreover, the Appeals Board itself concluded that it has the power to make this determination. \u201cIt is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that \u2018The contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 491, 501 [138 Cal.Rptr. 696, 564 P.2d 848].) We find no fault with the Appeals Board\u2019s construction on this issue. Accordingly, we find that the Appeals Board was authorized to determine whether Chandler was entitled to section 4850 benefits as part of Chandler\u2019s application for benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>2. <em>Collateral Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">The Appeals Board found that the L.A. Housing Authority was estopped from asserting that Chandler was not entitled to the benefits of section 4850 as a result of the Appeals Board\u2019s opinion and order in <em>Chappell </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>W.C.A.B. No. PAS 16292. In <em>Chappell, </em>the Appeals Board determined that because an L.A. Housing Authority police officer had completed training at the Los Angeles Police Academy and was a police officer as defined by Penal Code section 830.31, subdivision (d) (housing authority patrol officers are \u201cpeace officers\u201d), she was entitled to section 4850 benefits. We conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents us from reassessing the merits of that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of an issue previously adjudicated if: (1) the issue necessarily decided in the previous suit is identical to the issue sought to be relitigated; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits of the previous suit; and (3) the party against whom the plea is asserted was a party, or in privity with a party, to the previous suit. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Producers Dairy Delivery Co. </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 903, 910 [226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920].)  The doctrine applies to an administrative determination when made by an administrative agency that is acting in a judicial capacity and resolving disputed issues which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 468, 479 [186 Cal.Rptr. 77, 651 P.2d 321].) An opinion and order of the Appeals Board qualifies as such an administrative determination. <em>(Unruh </em>v. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 616, 633 [102 Cal.Rptr. 815, 498 P.2d 1063]; <em>Rymer </em>v. <em>Hagler </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1171, 1179 [260 Cal.Rptr. 76].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The L.A. Housing Authority contends that collateral estoppel is inapplicable in this case. The basis of the contention is that, because Chandler is a police chief rather than a police officer (as in <em>Chappell) </em>and had no opportunity to participate in the <em>Chappell </em>litigation, the privity requirement has not been met. The contention evinces a misunderstanding of the privity requirement. It is the party <em>against </em>whom collateral estoppel is sought to be invoked that must be the same as or in privity with the party in the earlier proceeding. Here, that party is the L.A. Housing Authority, thereby establishing privity under the third prong of the collateral estoppel test.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">We suspect that, by drawing a distinction between a police chief and a police officer, the L.A. Housing Authority is actually arguing that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>not sufficient identity of issues under the first prong of the collateral estoppel test.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the L.A. Housing Authority has not offered, nor can we imagine, any reason why these distinctions should make a difference to the question of whether a peace officer employed by the L.A. Housing Authority is entitled to the benefits of section 4850. (See <em>Producers Dairy Delivery Co. </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 910-911.) Accordingly, we find that the first prong of the collateral estoppel test has also been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Although not briefed by the parties, there exists an argument why collateral estoppel may not be appropriately invoked. We consider the argument, but ultimately reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The determination in <em>Chappell </em>that the L.A. Housing Authority police officer involved in that case was entitled to section 4850 benefits was one of law. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[W]hen the issue is a question of law rather than of fact, the prior determination is <em>not </em>conclusive either if injustice would result or if the public interest requires that relitigation not be foreclosed. [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Education </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 251, 257 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 545, 825 P.2d 438], quoting <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 51, 64 [266 Cal.Rptr. 139, 785 P.2d 522], and <em>Consumers Lobby Against Monoplies </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 891, 902 [160 Cal.Rptr. 124, 603 P.2d 41], italics added.) We review this area of law to determine whether the injustice or public interest exceptions to the doctrine of collateral estoppel apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\"><em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 51, involved a Court of Appeal decision in an action brought by the City of Sacramento and the County of Los Angeles. The Court of Appeal held that the state was required to reimburse these entities for the cost of a program by which they complied with a federal mandate to extend coverage under the state\u2019s unemployment insurance law. <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 182 [203 Cal.Rptr. 258] <em>(Sacramento I); City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 51 <em>(Sacramento II).) </em>The state thereafter failed to reimburse the entities for the programs. The City of Sacramento then brought a new action on behalf of itself and all other local governments, seeking reimbursement and to bar the program in the absence of reimbursement payments. <em>(Sacramento II, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">One of the issues before the court in <em>Sacramento II </em>was whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded the state from arguing that reimbursement was not required inasmuch as the state had lost that argument in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number><em>Sacramento I. </em>Recognizing that strict application of the doctrine would bar the state from making such an argument, the <em>Sacramento II </em>court noted that \u201cthe consequences of any error [in <em>Sacramento </em>/] transcend those which would apply to mere private parties. If the result of <em>Sacramento I </em>is wrong but unimpeachable, taxpayers statewide will suffer unjustly the consequences of the state\u2019s continuing obligation to [provide reimbursement]. On the other hand, if the state fails to appropriate the funds to meet this obligation, and [the new program] cannot be enforced [citations], the resulting failure to comply with federal law could cost California employers millions. Under these circumstances, neither stare decisis nor collateral estoppel can permanently foreclose our ability to examine the reimbursability of [the program\u2019s] costs.\u201d <em>(Sacramento II, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 64-65, fns. omitted.) Accordingly, the <em>Sacramento II </em>court proceeded to consider the matter on its merits. <em>(Sacramento II, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 76-77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">In <em>Palmdale Hospital Medical Center </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1306 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 926], an unpublished Court of Appeal decision <em>(Modesto City Hospital </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services </em>(Mar. 2, 1990) B042317) held that the Department of Health Services was precluded from adjusting Medi-Cal reimbursement payments to providers more than three years after the claim for reimbursement had been submitted. (8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1309-1310.) The <em>Palmdale Hospital </em>court held that \u201cwhile the state Department of Health Services was the only losing party in <em>Modesto City Hospital, </em>that opinion, if wrong but unimpeachable, would shift to state taxpayers the cost of overpayments to Medi-Cal provider hospitals. . . . [5D This case . . . involves a public agency\u2019s ongoing obligation to administer statutes and regulations which were enacted for the benefit of the public. The public interest requires full litigation of the question, and application of collateral estoppel against the Department would therefore be unjust.\u201d (8 Cal.App.4th at p. 1311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\"><em>Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Education, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th 251, involved the constitutionality of a statute that authorizes school districts to charge fees for pupil transportation. In an earlier action, a taxpayer (Mr. Salazar) had sued the State Department of Education, among others, seeking a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. The superior court ruled that the school districts were indispensable parties and did not reach the merits. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding in a published decision that the school districts were not indispensable parties and that the statute was unconstitutional. The decision was ordered depublished by the Supreme Court. <em>(Salazar </em>v. <em>Honig </em>(May 10, 1988) B026629, review den. and opn. ordered nonpub. Sept. 1, 1988 (S006146); <em>see Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>v. <em>State Dept. of Education, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 255-256.) The State Department of Education thereafter issued an advisory informing all school districts that the statute was unconstitutional. However, numerous school districts that were not parties to the <em>Salazar </em>action did not comply with the advisory. Twenty-five school districts as plaintiffs and the State Department of Education as defendant then agreed to submit the matter for a judicial resolution. (2 Cal.4th at p. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Mr. Salazar, who had intervened in the <em>Arcadia </em>action, argued that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied to the action. The Supreme Court rejected this argument based on the public interest exception to the doctrine. The court noted that uncertainty existed regarding whether all school districts were bound by <em>Salazar </em>v. <em>Honig, supra </em>(B026629), and there is a public interest in securing a uniform understanding. (2 Cal.4th at pp. 257-258.) The court continued that if it were to apply collateral estoppel, \u201cand if <em>Salazar </em>v. <em>Honig </em>was wrongly decided, school districts would be unable to charge fees for transportation, and so they would be unable to collect those revenues, to which they are entitled by statute. Students might also be adversely affected, because those districts that could not afford to fund bus transportation out of their limited revenues might be forced to eliminate the service.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 258.) \u201cThe public interest would best be served by a determination of this important issue based on the presentation of both sides of the controversy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In conclusion, the court stated that \u201c[t]he public interest exception is an extremely narrow one; we emphasize that it is the exception, not the rule, and is only to be applied in exceptional circumstances. However, the unusually compelling facts in this case make it appropriate for us to apply the exception here.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The foregoing opinions demonstrate that the instant case comes within the rule, not the exception. Rather than involving the administration of a program affecting citizens throughout the state, this case involves a single local agency. Rather than affecting questions of great economic consequence, this case involves whether or not officers of one local agency are eligible for an increased disability benefit for the period of one year. To apply the public interest exception here would mean that anytime a public agency is subject to a judicial or quasi-judicial determination with an adverse economic consequence, that agency would not be bound by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Such an approach would effectively eviscerate the rule that collateral estoppel applies to determinations of law. Accordingly, the approach is rejected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Appeals Board properly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to prevent the L.A. Housing Authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>from asserting that Chandler was not an employee within the meaning of section 4850.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board\u2019s order of May 8, 1997, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Ortega, Acting P.

Indeed, our opinion does not constitute precedent on the issue of whether a police officer employed by some other housing authority in the State of California would come within the definition of section 4850. (Cf. <em>Ralphs Grocery Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 820, 827, fn. 7 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].) Moreover, despite the requirement that workers\u2019 compensation laws be liberally construed in favor of the employee (\u00a73202), we have difficulty understanding how an employee of an entity that is not even referenced in section 4850 could be entitled to the benefits which that section provides. Nonetheless, the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents us from addressing these concerns, which are therefore left for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
