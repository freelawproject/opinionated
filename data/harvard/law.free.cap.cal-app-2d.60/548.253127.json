J.</author>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), a statutorily created involuntary unincorporated association of California-admitted insurers, was formed to provide insureds with financial and legal assistance if their insurers become insolvent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The workers\u2019 compensation referee (WCR) assessed an award against Industrial Indemnity Company (Industrial), State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF), and CIGA proportionate to periods of coverage by Industrial, SCIF, and insolvent Pacific States Casualty Company (Pacific). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Board) rescinded the WCR\u2019s award against CIGA and substituted a joint and several award against Industrial and SCIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">In these consolidated matters, petitioners Industrial and SCIF challenge the Board\u2019s award. Concluding the Board correctly rescinded the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>against CIGA and properly imposed joint and several liability on Industrial and SCIF, we affirm the Board\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Machine handler Alvaro Garcia filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for cumulative injury sustained on the job during the period from November 6, 1990, through November 6, 1991. During that time Garcia\u2019s employer had successive workers\u2019 compensation coverage with Industrial (November 6, 1990, through June 30, 1991), Pacific (July 1, 1991, through October 26, 1991) and SCIF (October 27, 1991, through November 6, 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Before trial of Garcia\u2019s claim, Pacific became insolvent and was placed into liquidation by the Insurance Commissioner. CIGA entered the litigation due to Pacific\u2019s insolvency and sought dismissal from the case on the ground Garcia\u2019s claim did not constitute a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9), because \u201cother\" workers\u2019 compensation insurance was available through jointly and severally liable Industrial and SCIF. The WCR denied CIGA\u2019s request for dismissal and issued awards favoring Garcia proportionate to time of coverage, to wit, Industrial 64.7 percent, CIGA for Pacific 32.3 percent, and SCIF 3 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Seeking reconsideration by the Board, CIGA asserted a joint and several award should be issued against Industrial and SCIF. CIGA also asserted it could not be held responsible for any portion of Garcia\u2019s cumulative trauma award because other insurance was available to cover the entire award as Industrial and SCIF were jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Upon reconsideration, the Board rescinded the WCR\u2019s award and substituted a joint and several award against Industrial and SCIF. In absolving CIGA from any liability, the Board concluded (1) CIGA was only required to pay \u201ccovered claims\u201d; (2) \u201ccovered claims\u201d did not include claims covered by other insurance available to the claimant or insured (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9)); and (3) Garcia\u2019s claim was covered by other insurance since all carriers during Garcia\u2019s period of exposure were jointly and severally liable for benefits to an employee for cumulative trauma (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5500.5, codifying <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 79 [172 P.2d 884]).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Industrial and SCIF contend the Board erred in concluding that all benefit awards in cumulative trauma cases against more than one employer and/or one carrier must be joint and several. Industrial and SCIF further contend the Board erred in concluding CIGA need not pay insolvent insurer Pacific\u2019s proportionate liability for Garcia\u2019s cumulative trauma injury. Industrial asserts that absent an election by Garcia under Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c), CIGA was required to pay its proportionate share on behalf of Pacific.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In essence, this case poses the question: Where solvent workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers are adjudicated liable to a cumulatively injured employee, is CIGA also liable? As we shall explain, the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>Joint and Several Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Industrial and SCIF contend a joint and several award was not authorized on Garcia\u2019s cumulative trauma claim since Garcia assertedly failed to make an election under Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c), to proceed against fewer than all defendants. Similarly, CWCI contends that joint and several liability may generally be imposed only if the employee elects to proceed against more than one defendant but fewer than all defendants joined in the action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c), provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any case involving a claim of occupational disease or cumulative injury occurring as a result of more than one employment within the appropriate time period ... the employee making the claim . . . may elect to proceed against any one or more of the employers. Where such an election is made, the employee must successfully prove his or her claim against any one of the employers named, and any award which the appeals board shall issue awarding compensation benefits shall be a joint and several award as against any two or more employers who may be held liable for compensation benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Labor Code section 5500.5 \u201cgoverns the procedure to be employed in cases where an employee suffers either an occupational disease or a cumulative injury. Section 5500.5 is a codification of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 79 [172 P.2d 884].\u201d <em>(General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 272], citing <em>City of Torrance </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 371, 374-375 [185 Cal.Rptr. 645, 650 P.2d 1162]; also <em>Flesher </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 322, 327 [152 Cal.Rptr. 459, 590 P.2d 35].)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 79 <em>(Colonial), </em>the Supreme Court concluded that in cases involving progressive occupational diseases, \u201cthe employee may, at his option, obtain <em>an award for the entire disability against any one or more of successive employers or successive insurance carriers </em>if the disease and disability were contributed to by the employment furnished by the employer chosen or during the period covered by the insurance even though the particular employment is not the sole cause of the disability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 82, italics added.) The Supreme Court reasoned: \u201cTo require an employee disabled with such a disease to fix upon each of the carriers or employers the precise portion of the disability attributable to its contribution to the cause of the malady is not in consonance with the required liberal interpretation and application of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws. The successive carriers or employers should properly have the burden of adjusting the share that each should bear and that should be done by them in an independent proceeding between themselves. They are in a better position to produce evidence on the subject and establish the proper apportionment. All of them may have contributed to the disability and <em>the employee should be permitted to proceed against and have an award against any or all of them for the whole disability </em>if the evidence discloses that he was exposed to [the cause of his malady] during his period of employment with each of the employers named.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Similarly, in <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 831 [250 P.2d 148], the Supreme Court observed: \u201cThe commission found petitioner jointly and severally liable with the other insurance carrier. This finding is correct so far as the employee is concerned, since he should not be required to fix the precise portion of the disability attributable to each period of exposure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 835.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Flesher </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 322 <em>(Flesher), </em>the Supreme Court characterized the <em>Colonial </em>rule codified in Labor Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>section 5500.5 as providing that \u201c. . . an employee disabled by a progressive occupational disease may obtain <em>an award for his entire disability against any one or more of his successive employers or insurance carriers and that those held liable have the burden of seeking </em>apportionment.\u201d <em>(Flesher, supra, </em>at p. 327, italics added.) The Supreme Court noted that as originally enacted in 1951, \u201c. . . section 5500.5 was limited by its express language to occupational disease claims, but its procedures were applied by analogy to cumulative injury claims as well. [Citations.] In 1973, section 5500.5 was amended to expressly cover cumulative injury as well as occupational disease claims. [Citation.] At the same time it was also amended to limit the employers against whom compensation could be sought to those who had employed the applicant during the preceding five-year period. [Citation.] In 1977, section 5500.5 was amended to reduce the five-year period to a one-year period by 1981.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In essence, consonant with the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme, the Supreme Court decisions in <em>Colonial </em>and <em>Flesher </em>expanded the employee\u2019s procedural alternatives by recognizing the employee\u2019s right to a full award even if the employee opted to proceed against fewer than all successive employers or successive insurers. Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c), simply codified such right to opt. Contrary to Industrial\u2019s contention that section 5500.5 clearly evinces a legislative determination that joint and several awards are permissible only in specified instances of cumulative trauma cases, nothing in the statute indicates any intent to condition the joint and several liability of multiple defendants upon the employee\u2019s \u201celection\u201d or otherwise preclude an employee from obtaining a joint and several award where all carriers participate as defendants in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Our conclusion is consistent with <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 574 [65 Cal.Rptr. 69]. In <em>Marsh </em>the employee\u2019s survivors sought death benefits from four insurance companies, apparently constituting all the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carriers during the relevant periods. The appellate court observed: \u201c \u2018It is the established rule in cases where disability or death results to an employee from a progressive occupational disease or cumulative industrial injury that the employee (or his dependents) may elect to recover full compensation benefits from any employer (or insurer) in the chain of causation and that the appeals board must thereafter apportion the liability among the successive employers (or insurers) in the proportion that each period of employment (or correspondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>coverage) contributed.\u2019 [Citations.] <em>The proper procedure in such cases is to hold the employers (or carriers) in the chain of causation jointly and severally liable, </em>leaving them to debate the issue of apportionment of their relative liabilities in a separate proceeding. <em>There can be no apportionment as to the claimant </em>and there is no reason he should be required to wait until the determination of the apportionment issue to receive his award.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 578-579, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Finally, we observe that consistent with the express language of Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c), Garcia in fact made an election to proceed against \u201cone or more\u201d of his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurers, in this instance all such carriers. Garcia successfully proved his claim against those carriers elected. Thus, the award was required to be joint and several by case law and by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In sum, Garcia\u2019s employer and more than one solvent carrier were found liable for Garcia\u2019s single cumulative injury. Each such carrier was obligated to discharge fully the employer\u2019s liability to Garcia for his entire disability during the cumulative injury period. Hence, the Board properly ordered a joint and several award against Industrial and SCIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>Apportionment of Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Industrial contends no statutory basis existed for relieving CIGA of its asserted obligation to make payments on behalf of liable but insolvent insurer Pacific. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u201cCIGA was created by legislation in 1969 [citation] to establish a fund from which insureds could obtain financial and legal assistance in the event their insurers become insolvent, i.e. \u2018to provide insurance against \u201closs arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 784.) \u201cCIGA is not, and was not created to act as, an ordinary insurance company. [Citation.] It is a statutory entity that depends on the Guarantee Act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers, duties, and protections.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 786.) \u201cCIGA issues no policies, collects no premiums, makes no profits, and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 787.) \u201cCIGA\u2019s duties are not coextensive with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.\u201d <em>(R. J. Reynolds Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 601.) Instead, CIGA\u2019s authority and liability in discharging \u201cits statutorily circumscribed duties\u201d are limited to paying the amount of \u201ccovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>claims.\u201d <em>(Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>at p. 786; Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (a).) CIGA \u201cis authorized by statute to pay only \u2018covered claims\u2019 of an insolvent insurer, those determined by the Legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public. ([Ins. Code,] \u00a7 1063.2, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(R. J. Reynolds Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>at p. 600.) CIGA has the statutory authority to \u201cdeny a noncovered claim.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.2, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u201cSince \u2018covered claims\u2019 are not coextensive with an insolvent insurer\u2019s obligations under its policies, CIGA cannot and does not \u2018 \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.\u2019 [Citation.] Indeed, CIGA is \u2018expressly forbidden\u2019 to do so except where the claim at issue is a \u2018covered claim.\u2019 [Citation.] It necessarily follows that CIGA\u2019s first duty is to determine whether a claim placed before it is a \u2018covered claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Saylin </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 262.) \u201cIt is unequivocally clear the scope of CIGA\u2019s rights and duties turns on the definition of \u2018covered claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1), defines \u201c[covered claims\u201d as \u201cthe obligations of an insolvent insurer . . . imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer . . . which were unpaid by the insolvent insurer ... for which the assets of the insolvent insurer are insufficient to discharge in full [and] in the case of a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law of this state . . . .\u201d The statute then proceeds to enumerate in subdivision (c)(2) through (c)(12) specific types of claims not constituting \u201ccovered claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Subdivision (c)(9) of Insurance Code section 1063.1 provides: \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 shall not include (i) any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by the provisions of this article available to the claimant or insured . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cCases interpreting this language have established that where an insured has overlapping insurance polices and one insurer becomes insolvent, the other insurer, even if only a secondary or excess insurer, is responsible for paying the claim. In other words, <em>CIGA is an insurer of last resort and does not assume responsibility for claims where there is any other insurance available.\" (R. J. Reynolds Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 600, italics added.) However, asserting solvent insurers Industrial and SCIF provided coverage for Garcia\u2019s employer during a different time period than insolvent carrier Pacific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Industrial contends cases such as <em>R. J. Reynolds Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>are distinguishable as involving multiple policies with coverages overlapping in time. Hence, contending no \u201cother insurance\u201d covering the same time period as Pacific\u2019s policy was available to allow dismissal of CIGA under Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9), Industrial concludes the WCR correctly assigned proportionate liability among the insurance carriers providing Garcia\u2019s employer with coverage during the liability year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">CIGA\u2019s \u201cstatutory duty\u201d is to provide \u201cinsolvency insurance to pay some <em>{but not alt) </em>claims arising out of an insurance policy of an insolvent insurer.\u201d <em>(Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>125 Cal.App.3d at p. 908, italics added.) Further, in creating CIGA, the Legislature \u201cchose to provide a limited form of protection for the public, not a fund for the protection of other insurance companies from the insolvencies of fellow members.\u201d <em>(California Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Central National Ins. Co., supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d at p. 734; accord, <em>Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 785; <em>Central National Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 453, 458 [211 Cal.Rptr. 435]; <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>at pp. 909-910, 912.) Accordingly, as noted by one appellate court, various subdivisions of Insurance Code section 1063.1 express the \u201cstatutory intent not to use CIGA funds to pay the insolvent\u2019s obligations to other insurers . . . .\u201d <em>(Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>at p. 909; see, e.g., Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Similarly, subdivision (c)(9) of Insurance Code section 1063.1 also reflects the statutory intent not to use CIGA funds to pay an insolvent insurer\u2019s potential obligations to solvent insurers. Reasonably read, the statute indicates that a claim does not rise to the level of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d where other insurance providing the required coverage is available to either the claimant or the insured. Here, solvent insurers Industrial and SCIF provided coverage to Garcia\u2019s employer during the liability period for cumulative injury prescribed in Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (a). Garcia proved his</p>\n<p id=\"AvU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>cumulative injury against his employer, Industrial and SCIF. Hence, even though Garcia\u2019s employer\u2019s three workers\u2019 compensation policies did not overlap chronologically, Industrial and SCIF were jointly and severally liable to Garcia for his entire disability during the statutory liability period. <em>(City of Torrance </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 374-375; <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com., supra, </em>39 Cal.2d at p. 835; <em>Flesher, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 327; <em>Colonial, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d at p. 82; <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>257 Cal.App.2d at pp. 578-579; Lab. Code, \u00a7 5500.5, subd. (c).) Since such \u201cother insurance\u201d provided by Industrial and SCIF was thus available to cover Garcia\u2019s benefit award, CIGA was statutorily prohibited from making any payment toward his award. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In sum, the Legislature did not intend CIGA to defray or diminish the responsibility of other carriers. Instead, the Legislature intended CIGA to benefit claimants otherwise unable to obtain insurance in payment of their claims. Here, insurance other than insolvent Pacific\u2019s policy was available to satisfy the employer\u2019s liability to Garcia, to wit, the policies of solvent carriers Industrial and SCIF. Garcia had the substantive right to collect his entire benefit award from Industrial and SCIF since each was jointly and severally liable. Since Garcia\u2019s benefits claim was fully protected by solvent insurers Industrial and SCIF, both Garcia and his employer had \u201cother insurance\u201d available within the meaning of Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c). Hence, the award favoring Garcia against Industrial and SCIF did not constitute a statutorily defined \u201cCovered claim.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at subd. (c)(9).) Accordingly, the Board properly determined CIGA had no statutory liability for any portion of Garcia\u2019s award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\n<em>Other Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Citing a statutory provision prohibiting an employee from electing to proceed against an illegally uninsured employer in a claim of occupational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>disease or cumulative injury (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3716, subd. (b)), Industrial and SCIF note that Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c), does not contain any \u201ccorresponding provision\u201d forbidding the employee from electing to proceed against CIGA or otherwise allowing CIGA to \u201cescape liability.\" However, contrary to the contention of Industrial and SCIF, Labor Code section 3716, subdivision (b)\u2019s limitation on proceedings under the independent statutory scheme involving uninsured employers has no bearing on the meaning of Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c). Moreover, as discussed, the basis for CIGA\u2019s freedom from liability to Garcia is Insurance Code section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9), not Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">CWCI contends the statutory interpretation underlying the Board\u2019s holding \u201cwill frequently lead to inconsistent and absurd results\u201d in situations involving self-insurers or settlements.
