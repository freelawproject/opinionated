J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACl\">In this case, we determine whether section 223 of the Code of Civil Procedure, added by the June 5, 1990, adoption of Proposition 115, abrogates the holding in <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we explain, we conclude section 223 abrogates Hovey's requirement of individual sequestered voir dire during the death qualification portion of a capital case. Section 223 does not require individual sequestered voir dire but leaves the matter to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Because the trial court here did not exercise this discretion, we will issue the peremptory writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Petitioner Daniel Covarrubias is charged with three counts of murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187), with multiple murder and felony-murder special circumstances (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (17)), and with murder by lying-in wait (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(15)). Petitioner is also charged with the attempted murder of an infant (Pen. Code, \u00a7 664/187, subd. (a)), three counts of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 212.5, subd. (a)), burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), assault with a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) and conspiracy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1)). Various enhancements are charged attendant to the substantive offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">On December 27, 1996, petitioner moved for individual sequestered or small group voir dire. <em>(Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 1.) The Monterey County District Attorney did not oppose the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">The trial court denied the request for <em>Hovey </em>voir dire. It found that \u201cindividual and sequestered voir dire is not only not required, but that the lawful process and the best process is to conduct voir dire whenever possible in the presence of other jurors.\u201d The court further explained that \u201cwhile it is true that the <em>Hovey </em>case has not been specifically overruled by another case, another California Supreme Court case, it has been effectively overruled with the enactment of Proposition 115 and the enactment of Section 223 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which I alluded to earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Petitioner requested a stay of the trial proceedings to permit appellate review of the trial court\u2019s ruling. We granted an immediate stay and issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>an alternative writ to consider the important interpretative questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Section 223 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cVoir dire of any prospective jurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   We must reconcile section 223 with the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">I. <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">We begin with <em>Hovey. </em>In <em>Hovey, </em>the petitioner sought to limit exclusions for cause of jurors unalterably opposed to the death penalty. The California Supreme Court rejected the proposed limitation but did impose a new requirement upon voir dire procedures in capital cases. <em>(Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 69.)  <em>Hovey </em>held that \u201cthis court declares, pursuant to its supervisory authority over California criminal procedure, [fn. omitted] that in future capital cases that portion of the voir dire of each prospective juror which deals with issues which involve death-qualifying the jury <em>should be done individually and in sequestration.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(28 Cal.3d at p. 80, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\"><em>Hovey </em>reasoned that jurors were influenced by observing the death qualification of their fellow venirepersons. By hearing repeated discussions of the death penalty before any evidence of guilt is presented, jurors may infer that the court and counsel assume the penalty phase will occur. (28 Cal.3d at pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>70-71.) If a juror is predisposed to expect a guilty verdict, the juror may more readily believe the evidence constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">The exposure to the death qualification process may also make jurors more likely to impose the death penalty. For example, when the court dismisses persons who are unalterably opposed to the death penalty, remaining jurors may interpret the dismissal as a sign that the judge and law disapprove of such attitudes. Jurors whose beliefs about the death penalty are not so irrevocable as to disqualify them under <em>Witherspoon</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>may believe their attitudes are improper or suspect. Consequently, those jurors may be less inclined to express or rely on such beliefs when choosing between life and death. <em>(Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 74.) Jurors exposed to the death qualification process may also become desensitized to the intimidating duty of determining whether another person should live or die. \u201cWhat was initially regarded as an onerous choice, inspiring caution and hesitation, may be more readily undertaken simply because of the repeated exposure to the idea of taking a life.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In reaching its decision, <em>Hovey </em>relied upon a 1979 study involving 67 persons who viewed a simulated, videotaped voir dire. The 67 persons were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group was shown the full two-hour videotape which included thirty minutes of death qualification. The other group saw the same videotape but the death qualification segment was omitted. After viewing the videotapes, both groups completed a questionnaire. The responses were consistent with the prediction that exposure to death qualification alters the jurors\u2019 perspectives to the detriment of the accused. (28 Cal.3d at pp. 75-79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Accordingly, <em>Hovey </em>concluded that individual sequestered voir dire was the \u201cmost practical and effective procedure\u201d to remedy the effects of the death qualification process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (28 Cal.3d at p. 80.) <em>Hovey </em>reasoned that \u201c. . . sequestered voir dire will minimize each juror\u2019s exposure to the death-qualifying voir dire of others. It will thereby minimize the deleterious effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>of such exposure. Given the frailty of human institutions and the enormity of the jury\u2019s decision to take or spare a life, trial courts must be especially vigilant to safeguard the neutrality, diversity and integrity of the jury to which society has entrusted the ultimate responsibility for life or death.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The <em>Hovey </em>rule was announced pursuant to the California Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory powers. It was not based upon constitutional grounds. This was \u201cbecause the prejudicial effects associated with death-qualifying voir dire in open court had not been shown to be actual but only potential.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1135 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 627 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\"><em>Hovey </em>has not been overruled by the California Supreme Court and is still routinely referred to in California Supreme Court decisions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 189 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 482 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249, 31 A.L.R.5th 888]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 358 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">II. <em>Section 223</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Armed with an understanding of <em>Hovey, </em>we next examine section 223.  In analyzing section 223, our duty is \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted; and where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d (\u00a7 1858.) If section 223 is unambiguous, then it must be applied according to its plain terms. Judicial interpretation is neither necessary nor permitted. (\u00a7 1859; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 979, 985 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 699, 911 P.2d 1374]; <em>Parris </em>v. <em>Zolin </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 839, 845 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 911 P.2d 9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">By its plain terms, section 223 does not explicitly overrule <em>Hovey. </em>It does not state that there shall be <em>no </em>individual sequestered voir dire during the death qualification segment of a capital case. Section 223 does use the term \u201cshall\u201d and refers to \u201call criminal cases, including death penalty cases\u201d but then undercuts the seemingly mandatory nature of those words with the phrase \u201cwhere practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Section 223\u2019s reference to \u201cwhere practicable\u201d is not explained. The statute itself does not define what \u201cwhere practicable\u201d means. Nor does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>section 223 list circumstances where conducting voir dire in the presence of all jurors would be impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Petitioner contends the phrase \u201cwhere practicable\u201d represents a codification of <em>Hovey. </em>Amicus curiae, the Monterey County District Attorney\u2019s office, essentially agrees with petitioner. The district attorney notes that if the drafters of section 223 had wanted to overrule Hovey, they would have done so explicitly. Real party in interest, the Attorney General, interprets section 223 as no longer requiring individual sequestered voir dire during death qualification but contends the matter is committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. Respondent county counsel argues section 223 overrules <em>Hovey </em>and also contends that large group voir dire is practicable in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Given these ambiguities, we must interpret section 223.  In construing the statute, we shall ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so that we can effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].) \u201c1 \u201c[T]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1063, 1072 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 160, 820 P.2d 262], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d 894, 898-899.) \u201cSimilar rules would govern interpretation of measures adopted by initiative.\u201d <em>(Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1072.) Consequently, we should try to give effect to the intent of the electorate in passing Proposition 115. <em>(Bowens </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 36, 44 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 376, 820 P.2d 600]; <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 1063, 1071.) In analyzing that intent, we may properly consider ballot materials and arguments in those materials. <em>(Whitman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1072; see also <em>Hill </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 19-22 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 527 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628].)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Section 223 was included as part of Proposition 115, the Crime Victims Justice Reform Initiative. Enacted in 1990, Proposition 115 was adopted to make \u201ccomprehensive reforms ... in order to restore balance and fairness to our criminal justice system.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (June 5, 1990) text of Prop. 115, \u00a7 1, subd. (a), p. 33.) The voters found \u201cthat it is necessary to reform the law as developed in numerous California Supreme Court decisions and as set forth in the statutes of this state. These decisions and statutes have unnecessarily expanded the rights of accused criminals far beyond that which is required by the United States Constitution, thereby unnecessarily adding to the costs of criminal cases, and diverting the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>process from its function as a quest for the truth.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>text of Prop. 115, \u00a7 1, subd. (b), p. 33; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Boulerice </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 463, 474-475 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 279].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">In adopting Proposition 115, the voters expressly declared that their purposes were to \u201ccreate a system in which justice is swift and fair, and to create a system in which violent criminals receive just punishment, in which crime victims and witnesses are treated with care and respect, and in which society as a whole can be free from the fear of crime in our homes, neighborhoods, and schools.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (June 5, 1990) text of Prop. 115, \u00a7 1, subd. (c), p. 33; see also <em>Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 292 [279 Cal.Rptr. 592, 807 P.2d 434]; <em>Bowens </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 44.) \u201cProposition 115 plainly contemplated the abrogation of <em>[Hawkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 584 [150 Cal.Rptr. 435, 586 P.2d 916]] as well as other past decisions of this court.\u201d <em>(Bowens </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 45; see also <em>Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 356, 372 [285 Cal.Rptr. 231, 815 P.2d 304]; <em>Raven </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 336, 348 [276 Cal.Rptr. 326, 801 P.2d 1077].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">These statements reveal the general thrust of Proposition 115: to make comprehensive reforms, to create a system in which criminal justice is swift and fair, and to overrule past decisions of the California Supreme Court. Interpreting section 223 to abrogate <em>Hovey </em>would be consistent with Proposition 115\u2019s general focus. This is because such an interpretation would reform the law, alter a past Supreme Court decision, and make justice more \u201cswift\u201d by eliminating the potentially time-consuming requirement of individual sequestered voir dire during death qualification. By contrast, interpreting section 223 to codify <em>Hovey </em>would not appear to further these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Turning to the ballot arguments, we see that the arguments mention neither <em>Hovey </em>nor its requirement that there be individual sequestered voir dire during death qualification. Of course, the ballot arguments clearly do not profess to describe Proposition 115 in its entirety but speak largely in generalities. For example, the arguments in favor of Proposition 115 include statements such as \u201cProposition 115 simply remedies gross inequities and will bring more violent criminals to justice.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (June 5, 1990) argument in favor of Prop. 115, p. 34.) Many of the arguments, both pro and con, are devoted to Proposition 115\u2019s impact upon Californians\u2019 right to privacy. The proposed changes in criminal law and procedure are not addressed in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>The statement by the Legislative Analyst also does not mention <em>Hovey </em>or its requirement of individual sequestered voir dire during death qualification. Although the statement does describe some of Proposition 115\u2019s changes in criminal law and procedure, the analysis concedes that it only addresses \u201c[t]he more important of these changes.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (June 5, 1990) analysis of Prop. 115 by the Legislative Analyst, p. 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">Accordingly, our review of the ballot arguments and Legislative Analysis does not disclose any clear evidence of the electorate\u2019s intent with regard to <em>Hovey. </em> With respect to the ballot arguments, the absence of such evidence is not particularly persuasive since the ballot arguments are largely rhetorical. The California Supreme Court recognized as much in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th 1, 22, footnote 5. The court cautioned, \u201cBallot arguments often embody the sound-bite rhetoric of competing political interests vying for popular support. However useful they may be in identifying the general evils sought to be remedied by an initiative measure, they are principally designed to win votes, not to present a thoughtful or precise explication of legal tests or standards.\u201d Similarly, the failure of the Legislative Analyst to mention <em>Hovey </em>cannot be accorded too much weight since the analysis makes clear that it does not cover all subjects embraced by Proposition 115 but only summarizes the \u201cmore important of these changes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Because these materials do not disclose the electorate\u2019s intent with regard to <em>Hovey, </em>we next examine the predecessor to current section 223. An understanding of the preinitiative scope of permissible voir dire in both capital and noncapital criminal cases may assist us in interpreting section 223.  This is because \u201c[t]he adopting body is presumed to be aware of existing laws and judicial construction thereof.\u201d <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]; see also <em>Hill </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Before Proposition 115 was enacted, section 223 gave the trial court discretion in controlling voir dire. It provided, in pertinent part, that \u201cIn discharging its duties, the court shall have discretion and control with respect to the form and subject matter and duration of voir dire examination.\u201d (Stats. 1988, ch. 1245, \u00a7 2, pp. 4148-4149.) Former section 223 also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>stated that \u201c(b) In each case it shall be the duty of the trial judge to provide for a voir dire process as speedy, focused, and informative as possible, and to protect prospective jurors from undue harassment and embarrassment and from inordinately extensive, repetitive, or unfocused examinations.\u201d (Stats. 1988, ch. 1245, \u00a7 2, p. 4148.) Case law established that trial courts could, if necessary, require in camera voir dire of prospective jurors in circumstances other than death qualification. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rutkowsky </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 1069, 1073-1074 [126 Cal.Rptr. 104]; see also <em>Odle </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 932, 936, fn. 2, 946, fn. 13 [187 Cal.Rptr. 455, 654 P.2d 225].) Such procedure was authorized pursuant to the trial court\u2019s affirmative duty of selecting an impartial jury. (See, e.g., former Pen. Code, \u00a7 1078; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crowe </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 815, 828 [106 Cal.Rptr. 369, 506 P.2d 193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beyea </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 176 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254].) Federal courts had permitted similar procedures (see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colabella </em>(2d Cir. 1971) 448 F.2d 1299, 1303)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the California Supreme Court had recognized that the courts \u201cwill uphold any method of <em>voir dire </em>which results in reasonable examination of prospective jurors.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crowe, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 821; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorsey </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 953, 966 [118 Cal.Rptr. 362].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Consequently, prior to Proposition 115, individual sequestered voir dire was (1) required under <em>Hovey </em>during the death qualification process and (2) permitted in other circumstances pursuant to the trial court\u2019s discretion over voir dire in criminal cases. This was the state of the law when the voters enacted Proposition 115, and with it, section 223\u2019s requirement that \u201cVoir dire of any prospective jurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">We believe section 223 was intended to overrule Hovey\u2019s holding that individual sequestered voir dire is required during death qualification. If the electorate had intended to maintain Hovey\u2019s requirement, we believe section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>223 would say so in terms much more compelling than the current phraseology, which simply inserts the terms \u201cwhere practicable\u201d into the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is especially true given the state of law pre-Proposition 115. If current section 223 simply continues the state of the law pre-Proposition 115, thereby codifying <em>Hovey, </em>then the \u201cwhere practicable\u201d language must be read as both requiring individual sequestered voir dire in certain situations (death qualification) and merely permitting it in others. Besides requiring that \u201cwhere practicable\u201d mean two different things depending upon the context, this interpretation appears to us to be an especially inapt way of codifying existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">Section 223\u2019s explicit reference to \u201call criminal cases, <em>including death penalty </em>cases\u201d also supports our conclusion. The statute could have been drafted to provide \u201cVoir dire of any prospective jurors shall, where practicable, occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal cases.\u201d However, section 223 specifically refers to death penalty cases. To us, the reference indicates that the trial court should inquire into the practicability of large group voir dire \u201cin all criminal cases, including death penalty cases\u201d rather than conduct no inquiry whatsoever with respect to the death qualification portion of voir dire. Certainly, the express mention of death penalty cases demonstrates that the electorate had capital cases in mind when Proposition 115 was adopted. And if death penalty cases were meant to be covered by section 223, then it seems fair to assume the electorate believed that in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases, it <em>could </em>be practicable to utilize large group voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Amicus curiae, the district attorney, argues otherwise. The district attorney relies upon other parts of section 223 which do clearly abrogate prior California Supreme Court decisions. The district attorney argues that the absence of a similarly clear indication with respect to <em>Hovey </em>demonstrates that <em>Hovey </em>is still good law. For example, the district attorney refers to the second paragraph of section 223. It states \u201cExamination of prospective jurors shall be conducted only in aid of the exercise of challenges for cause.\u201d The quoted language was clearly directed at the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 392 [174 Cal.Rptr. 317, 628 P.2d 869], which allowed voir dire in aid of the exercise of peremptory challenges. Indeed, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leung </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 482, 493 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 290], we acknowledged the statutory overruling of <em>Williams. </em>According to the district attorney, this demonstrates that the electorate knew how to abrogate Supreme Court rulings, and therefore reveals that <em>Hovey </em>was never intended to be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>Our interpretation is different. If section 223 did not include the phrase \u201cwhere practicable\u201d and simply stated, \u201cVoir dire of any prospective jurors shall occur in the presence of the other jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases\u201d then it would be obvious that <em>Hovey </em>had been abrogated. In that case, the situation would be similar to that in Williams. However, if the \u201cwhere practicable\u201d language was omitted, it would also be true that individual sequestered voir dire would <em>never </em>be permitted in any criminal case, no matter what the circumstances. The words \u201cwhere practicable\u201d represent a compromise from this extreme. At the same time, the juxtaposition of the phrase \u201cwhere practicable\u201d with the deliberate use of the terms \u201cshall\u201d and \u201call criminal cases, including death penalty cases\u201d convinces us that section 223\u2019s drafters intended to vest the trial court with discretion to determine the practicability of large group voir dire in <em>all </em>circumstances, including death qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">We realize that there are often more artful ways to phrase a statute and that the fact that a statute could be more clearly worded does not necessarily foreclose a particular interpretation. However, petitioner\u2019s argument that section 223 codifies <em>Hovey </em>merely because the phrase \u201cwhere practicable\u201d was included is simply not persuasive. The words \u201cwhere practicable\u201d are not, in our view, nearly compelling enough to support petitioner\u2019s interpretation. The argument that section 223 codifies <em>Hovey </em>because the ballot arguments and Legislative Analyst statement do not mention <em>Hovey </em>is also not convincing because, as we have already discussed, those materials were never meant to be comprehensive descriptions of Proposition 115\u2019s scope. Finally, the <em>Hovey </em>rule was announced pursuant to the California Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory powers; it was not a statutory or constitutional requirement. Nonetheless, the drafters of section 223 deliberately decided to include the reference to voir dire in the presence of all jurors. We believe that fact, along with the fact that the general thrust of Proposition 115 was to reform the law, is indicative of an intent to abrogate <em>Hovey, </em>rather than an intent that it be codified.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The conclusion that the phrase \u201cwhere practicable\u201d vests the trial court with discretion in all circumstances, rather than vesting the trial court with discretion only in circumstances not involving death qualification, is also supported by other language within section 223. The last sentence of section 223 states, \u201cThe trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in the manner in which voir dire is conducted shall not cause any conviction to be reversed unless the exercise of that discretion has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, as specified in Section 13 of Article VI of the California Constitution.\u201d  It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that words of a statute must be construed in context, keeping in mind the statutory purpose. Statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>possible. <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379,1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)  Deciding that the phrase \u201cwhere practicable\u201d vests the trial court with discretion in all circumstances comports with section 223\u2019s provision regarding the trial court\u2019s \u201cexercise of its discretion in the manner in which voir dire is conducted . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Other commentators are in accord with our conclusion. For example, in summarizing the arguments against Proposition 115 and section 223, the Criminal Law Section of the State Bar of California interpreted section 223 as altering <em>Hovey. </em>The comments state that \u201cby mandating that voir dire shall occur in the presence of other jurors, the change will prevent jurors from freely expressing their personal beliefs on an individual case and relating information that is embarrassing. It is particularly important in death penalty cases that jurors feel free to express their personal views. The right to engage in private questioning of jurors should not require an additional showing of \u2018impracticability.\u2019 \u201d (Crim. Law News (June 1990) p. 8.) Another commentator stated that \u201cThe portion [of section 223] regarding the presence of other jurors during voir dire cancels the ruling in <em>Hovey. . . </em>.\u201d (Suarez, Crime Victims Justice Reform Act of 1989, An Analysis, Office of the Public Defender, City and County of San Francisco, p. 14.) A Joint Analysis of Proposition 115 prepared by the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Assembly Public Safety Committee states, \u201cIt is unclear whether [section 223] would abrogate die holding in <em>Hovey </em>.... It could be argued that <em>Hovey </em>renders such questioning \u2018impracticable.\u2019 \u201d (P. 59.) Although petitioner emphasizes this report, it can hardly be viewed as a striking endorsement of petitioner\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Our conclusion that section 223 abrogates <em>Hovey </em>is consistent with the general thrust of Proposition 115, seems less strained than the interpretation urged by petitioner, requires the trial court to consider the practicability of large group voir dire in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases and the death qualification process occurring therein, is logical given the state of the law pre-Proposition 115, and is consistent with the overall statutory scheme. For all these reasons, we hold that section 223 abrogates Hovey's requirement of individual sequestered voir dire during death qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>III. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Having so concluded, we next consider that conclusion in the context of this case. Petitioner argues that large group voir dire is impracticable in this situation for the reasons expressed in <em>Hovey </em>and because the case involved a multiple murder which generated a great deal of publicity within the community. Petitioner states that there was additional publicity because petitioner was captured and returned to the United States by bounty hunters after he fled to Mexico. Petitioner notes that some courts have made it a practice to utilize individual sequestered voir dire in similar circumstances. (See, e.g., <em>Odie </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 932, 936, fn. 2, 946, fn. 13.) Petitioner therefore asks us to grant his petition for mandate. He requests that we compel the trial court to engage in individual sequestered voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">As already discussed, under section 223, individual sequestered voir dire is no longer required during death qualification. Individual sequestered voir dire is still permissible, either during death qualification or in other circumstances, if the trial court determines that large group voir dire is impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Whether large group voir dire is practicable in petitioner\u2019s case is not for us to decide. That issue is for the trial court.  \u201cMandamus will not lie to control an exercise of discretion, i.e., to compel an official to exercise discretion in a particular manner.\u201d <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 442 [261 Cal.Rptr. 574, <em>777 </em>P.2d 610], citing <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 107, 118 [130 Cal.Rptr. 257, 550 P.2d 161]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 733, 737 [119 Cal.Rptr. 879, 532 P.2d 1247].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">\u201cMandamus will lie to compel a public official to perform an official act required by law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.)\u201d <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 432, 442, citing <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 107, 118; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 733, 737.) It can be presumed that an official duty has been regularly performed and that the law has been obeyed. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 666.) However, if it appears that an official has failed to exercise his or her discretion, then mandamus is a proper remedy. \u201cMandamus may issue ... to compel an official both to exercise his [or her] discretion (if he [or she] is required by law to do so) and to exercise it under a proper interpretation of the applicable law.\u201d <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 432, 442, citing <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 107, 118; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 733, 737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">In this case, the trial court described its decision to deny individual sequestered voir dire as follows. The court stated that it had \u201creviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>carefully all of the authorities cited by counsel for both sides in their motions concerning the voir dire process, and the defense request for individual and sequestered voir dire.\u201d The court then stated that it \u201chas reviewed the authorities in this area and has determined that individual and sequestered voir dire is not only not required, but that the lawful process and the best process is to conduct voir dire whenever possible in the presence of other jurors.\u201d The court further explained that \u201c. . . while it is true that the <em>Hovey </em>case has not been specifically overruled by another case, another California Supreme Court case, it has been effectively overruled with the enactment of Proposition 115 and the enactment of Section 223 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which I alluded to earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">We do not believe the trial court\u2019s comments reflect an exercise of discretion about whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, large group voir dire was practicable. Although we agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that section 223 abrogates <em>Hovey, </em>the trial court seemed to be focused upon the fact that individual sequestered voir dire was no longer <em>required, </em>rather than engaging in a careful consideration of the practicability of large group voir dire as applied to petitioner\u2019s case. This seems especially evident given the trial court\u2019s repeated emphasis upon its review of \u201cthe authorities.\u201d Those authorities may have supported the trial court\u2019s interpretation of section 223 with respect to <em>Hovey, </em>but the trial court\u2019s emphasis upon them indicates that the court did not thoroughly examine the application of section 223 to the specific circumstances before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The trial court\u2019s statement that individual sequestered voir dire is \u201cnot only not required\u201d but that conducting voir dire in the presence of the other jurors is the \u201cbest process\u201d and \u201cthe lawful process\u201d also demonstrates the trial court\u2019s misunderstanding of section 223. Depending upon the circumstances, conducting voir dire in the presence of the other jurors may or may not be the \u201cbest process.\u201d Certainly the trial court misapprehended section 223 to the extent its description of large group voir dire as \u201cthe lawful process\u201d implied that individual sequestered voir dire was somehow unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Further, in this case, both petitioner <em>and </em>the district attorney sought individual sequestered voir dire. Both parties agreed individual sequestered voir dire was appropriate. Yet despite that fact, the trial court never indicated that the particular circumstances of the case caused it to reject a procedure upon which both sides had agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">The trial court\u2019s reference to utilizing large group voir dire \u201cwhenever possible\u201d does not alter our view. The words \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cpracticable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>have different meanings. Webster\u2019s defines \u201cpracticable\u201d as \u201ccapable of being put into practice or being done or accomplished: Feasible.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dict. (9th ed. 1984) p. 923; see also <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1348, 1356 [270 Cal.Rptr. 779].) The distinction between the two terms was highlighted in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Ostly </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 78, 84 [343 P.2d 349]. In that case, the court reasoned: \u201cThe basic fallacy of appellant\u2019s argument lies in his failure to recognize the substantial difference between the words \u2018practicable\u2019 and \u2018possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Wilson </em>court concluded that the word \u201cpracticable\u201d meant the official body was \u201cvested with a discretion to consider the advisability\u201d of requirements under the County Charter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Similarly, section 223 vests the trial court with discretion to determine the advisability or practicability of conducting voir dire in the presence of the other jurors. Accordingly, a finding that large group voir dire should be utilized \u201cwhenever possible\u201d does not comport with section 223\u2019s description of the trial court\u2019s duty to decide whether such voir dire was in fact practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In sum, the fact that the trial court denied petitioner\u2019s request because it determined that section 223 overruled <em>Hovey, </em>rather than because it determined that large group voir dire was practicable in petitioner\u2019s case, seems clear from the overall tenor of the court\u2019s comments. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion to determine the practicability in petitioner\u2019s case of conducting voir dire in the presence of the other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to exercise its discretion to decide whether it is practicable in petitioner\u2019s case to conduct voir dire in the presence of other jurors.
