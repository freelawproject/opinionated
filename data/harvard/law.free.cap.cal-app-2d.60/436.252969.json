(Prob. Code, \u00a7 11700.) The primary issue is whether the trial court correctly applied the doctrine of estoppel to prevent Pierson, an undivorced bigamous spouse, from asserting his inheritance rights as a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d against the estate of his legally recognized first spouse who died intestate. We affirm, finding Pierson was properly estopped from claiming spousal inheritance rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The decedent died intestate on June 18, 1996. On December 4, 1996, Pierson filed a petition to determine distribution rights, by which he sought a judicial declaration that he was the decedent\u2019s \u201csurviving spouse,\u201d which would entitle him to a one-half distributive share of decedent\u2019s estate pursuant to Probate Code section 6401, subdivision (c)(2)(B). The estate\u2019s administrator filed objections to Pierson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Pierson\u2019s petition was decided by the court on the basis of documentary evidence in lieu of testimony and oral argument. The documentary evidence shows the following: The decedent and Pierson were married in 1955 in Contra Costa County. They lived together for approximately three years and separated in 1958. No children were bom of this marriage. In the underlying proceedings, Pierson averred, \u201cWe never filed for a divorce with the Court or ever obtained a divorce. Further, there has never been any order of any court terminating my marital property rights in my marriage to [decedent].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In the underlying proceedings, Pierson submitted declarations from decedent\u2019s mother, Nancy Williams, and a number of decedent\u2019s friends indicating that during her lifetime, the decedent openly disclosed that she and Pierson had never obtained a divorce. He also submitted affidavits attesting to the fact that the divorce records were searched in the counties where the parties had resided, San Francisco County, Alameda County, and Contra Costa County, but no evidence was discovered that the marriage was ever legally dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Shortly after Pierson and the decedent separated in 1958, Pierson began cohabiting with the woman he would eventually marry, Daisy Lee Pierson (hereafter solely for convenience, Daisy). The first of their five children was bom on June 10, 1958. They married on February 1, 1993. In Pierson\u2019s sworn affidavit of application for marriage license, he stated that he had not been previously married. In the underlying proceeding Pierson submitted a declaration explaining that he made this \u201cobviously false\u201d statement because he had been physically separated from decedent for 35 years and he desired to prevent embarrassment to everyone concerned. During their relationship, Pierson and Daisy acquired real property as husband and wife. They were still married and residing together at the time this matter was at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>In 1978, the decedent married Clarence Anderson, Jr. The decedent stated in her marriage license application that she was previously divorced in 1958 in San Francisco County. Clarence Anderson, Jr. died on January 16, 1983, and decedent never remarried. She died without any children or siblings, and with her mother as her sole heir. The primary asset in decedent\u2019s estate consists of real property in Oakland which was acquired with Clarence Anderson, Jr., and was community in character.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In contested probate matters where a jury is waived the court is required, as in civil actions, to make appropriate findings of fact on all issues presented to it. <em>(Estate of McCormack </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 492, 500 [82 Cal.Rptr. 651].) \u201cIt is of course settled that in a probate matter findings of fact may be included in the order or decree and need not be set forth in a separate document. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Ruben </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 600, 607 [36 Cal.Rptr. 752]; <em>Estate of McCormack, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.3d at p. 500.) We have before us the court\u2019s findings that \u201cOrange Pierson is estopped from denying the statement made on February 1, 1993, in the Affidavit of Application for Marriage license that his marriage to Dai[s]y Lee Pierson was his first marriage. The court finds that Orange Pierson is not the surviving spouse of decedent.\u201d Pierson appeals, claiming he is entitled to be recognized as the surviving spouse of the deceased with a concomitant right to a distributive share of the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Pierson claims the court erred in its application of the doctrine of estoppel to this case.  \u201cThe foundation of estoppel is justice and good conscience. Estoppel applies to prevent a person from asserting a right where his conduct makes it unconscionable for him to assert it; it is a bar to stating the truth when it would be unfair to state it.\u201d <em>(Estate of Hafner </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1395 [229 Cal.Rptr. 676].) Estoppel applies \u201cto prevent a person from asserting a right. . . where, because of his conduct, silence, or omission, it would be unconscionable to allow him to do so.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 178, 188 [82 Cal.Rptr. 238].) It prevents a person from acting in a manner inconsistent with his former position or conduct to the injury of another. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Generally, the determination of estoppel is a factual question; and the finding of the trier of fact is binding on the appellate court. <em>(Conservatorship of Kevin M. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 79, 92 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 765]; <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Marriage of Dekker </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 842, 850 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 642]; <em>County of Sonoma </em>v. <em>Rex </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1289, 1296 [282 Cal.Rptr. 796].) However, when the facts are undisputed and only one inference reasonably may be drawn, the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Platt Pacific, Inc. </em>v. <em>Andelson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 307, 319 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 597, 862 P.2d 158]; <em>Mehl </em>v. <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 710, 715-716 [119 Cal.Rptr. 625, 532 P.2d 489]; <em>Crumpler </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 567, 581 [108 Cal.Rptr. 293].) The facts material to a resolution of this case are undisputed; therefore, we independently review whether the doctrine of estoppel was properly invoked by the trial court to preclude Pierson from asserting inheritance rights in the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">As an evidentiary matter, Pierson argues that in applying estoppel, the court erroneously relied on his averment in his application for the marriage license to Daisy that he had never been married before. Pierson asserts that the trial court erroneously overruled his objection that this statement constituted inadmissible hearsay. We disagree. Evidence Code section 1220 creates an exception to the hearsay rule for an admission by a party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For such a statement to be admissible against a party as an admission, the statement must assert facts which would have a tendency in reason to prove some portion of the proponent\u2019s defense, or to rebut some portion of the party declarant\u2019s cause of action. <em>(Carson </em>v. <em>Facilities Development Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 830, 849 [206 Cal.Rptr. 136, 686 P.2d 656].) When measured against this standard, we find that the sworn statements made by Pierson in his application for a marriage license for his second marriage were properly admitted under Evidence Code section 1220 and that the statements were indeed relevant to whether or not he should be awarded heirship rights as decedent\u2019s surviving spouse. In so holding, we note several cases involving multiple spousal claimants in heirship proceedings have cited information contained in applications for marriage licenses. (See <em>Estate of Atherley </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 758, 766 [119 Cal.Rptr. 41, 81 A.L.R.3d 97], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Marvin </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 660, 665 [50 Cal.App.3d 84, 134 Cal.Rptr. 815, 557 P.2d 106]; <em>Estate of Ricci </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 146, 151 [19 Cal.Rptr. 739].)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Further, the law supports the ruling of the trial court that Pierson was estopped to deny his sworn statement that his marriage to Daisy was his first marriage.  \u201c[W]hen a person with the capacity of reading and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>understanding an instrument signs it, he is, in the absence of fraud and imposition, bound by its contents and is estopped from saying that its explicit provisions are contrary to his intentions or understanding [Citations].\u201d <em>(Larsen </em>v. <em>Johannes </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 491, 501 [86 Cal.Rptr. 744]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Savin Corp. </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 356, 363, fn. 1 [254 Cal.Rptr. 627].) This species of estoppel is denominated \u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cquasi </em>estoppel\u201d \u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018 \u201cis based upon the principle that one cannot blow both hot and cold, or that one \u2018with full knowledge of the facts shall not be permitted to act in a manner inconsistent with his former position or conduct to the injury of another.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Estate of Davis </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 579, 584 [102 P.2d 545], as quoted in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>274 Cal.App.2d at p. 189, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We believe this case contains all of the elements of <em>\u201cquasi </em>estoppel.\u201d Pierson should not be allowed to \u201cblow hot and cold\u201d by renouncing his marriage to decedent by swearing that the marriage never existed in order to remarry and then, after a 38-year separation from decedent, seek a judicial declaration that he is decedent\u2019s surviving spouse for the purpose of inheriting an interest in assets acquired during the deceased\u2019s second marriage. Since Pierson procured the marriage license to marry Daisy by asserting he had never been married before, he is now estopped to contest the validity of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Nor is there merit to Pierson\u2019s statement that the trial court\u2019s \u201cruling was only based on [his] marriage application statement that he had not previously been married\u201d and that if the court \u201c[h]ad not admitted evidence of the marriage application statement, it could not have ruled that [he] was es-topped based on said statement.\u201d The bar which the trial court imposed upon Pierson\u2019s claim of heirship to decedent\u2019s estate was not based on a simple factual misrepresentation made in a legal document but instead was based upon Pierson\u2019s course of conduct during his 38-year separation from decedent during which time both he and decedent entered into marriages with other people. A review of the record reveals there is ample evidence, aside from that claimed to be erroneously admitted, barring Pierson on the grounds of estoppel from asserting surviving spousal inheritance rights from decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Estoppel has been applied in cases where the estopped party \u201cslept on her property rights year in and year out and who, by her silence and acquiescence, allowed the rights of a third party to intervene.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, 274 </em>Cal.App.2d at p. 190.) <em>Brown </em>involved an invalid foreign divorce. The first wife waited almost 30 years before asserting a claim against property accumulated by Mr. Brown and his second wife. In the interim, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>acquiesced in her husband\u2019s use of the second wife\u2019s separate property to build up the purported community property, she accepted monthly support payments from him, and she did not challenge the relationship between her husband and his second wife. The court held her estopped to claim a community property interest, explaining estoppel applies \u201cto prevent a person from asserting a right which has come into existence by contract, statute or other rule of law where, because of his conduct, silence, or omission, it would be unconscionable to allow him to do so.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Other cases illustrate that estoppel has consistently been applied to prevent a spouse who has remarried in reliance on a divorce decree that is invalid due to a lack of jurisdiction or other defect from asserting the invalidity of the divorce after the first spouse\u2019s death in attempting to claim inheritance rights. For example, in <em>Hensgen </em>v. <em>Silberman </em>(1948) 87 Cal.App.2d 668 [197 P.2d 356], the decedent\u2019s first wife was estopped from questioning a foreign divorce\u2019s validity for the purpose of sharing in the property accumulated during the decedent\u2019s second marriage. The court noted the first wife took no action until after decedent\u2019s death to assert the invalidity of the divorce and that she, in fact, had also remarried in reliance upon it. The court stated that \u201cupon the simplest principles of equitable estoppel,\u201d the decedent\u2019s first wife could not now be heard to question the validity of the foreign divorce for the sole purpose of sharing in the property acquired by the decedent and his second wife during the years they lived together as husband and wife. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 674; see also <em>Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 681 [254 P.2d 644]; <em>Estate of Shank </em>(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 808 [316 P.2d 710]; <em>Estate of Edgett </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 700 [10 Cal.Rptr. 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Pierson, however, raises a factual distinction which he claims dictates a different result. Unlike the above cited cases, in the instant case there was no divorce, invalid or otherwise, intervening between Pierson\u2019s and decedent\u2019s first and second marriages. Nevertheless, we believe this case is controlled by analogous principles. The principles laid down in the cases cited illustrate that if a wife or a husband enters into a subsequent marriage with another person during the lifetime of the estranged spouse, he or she will be estopped from claiming the rights of a lawful spouse, including the right to inherit if the estranged spouse dies intestate. Pierson admitted in his own affidavit that he entered into a marriage with Daisy in 1993 without obtaining a divorce from the decedent, from whom he had been separated for 35 years. Pierson\u2019s marriage to Daisy formalized a union that had produced five children and had resulted in the acquisition of community property. Although apprised of the vital facts, he never interfered in or challenged decedent\u2019s marriage to Clarence Anderson, Jr. Under these circumstances, Pierson\u2019s conduct constituted a complete repudiation of his marital status as decedent\u2019s husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and he is now estopped from seeking to resurrect that status in order to establish a spousal right of heirship to decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Pierson relies on <em>Estate of Scott </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 21 [202 P.2d 357] in support of his contention that estoppel should not be applied in this case. That case held that a husband\u2019s infidelity during his deceased wife\u2019s lifetime did not prevent him from collecting his inheritance from her estate. The court reasoned, \u201c[S]ince the state Legislature has not seen fit to deprive a spouse who is guilty of marital misconduct of being the heir of his or her deceased spouse, the courts may not place any such restriction upon inheritance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 23.) But there was no bigamous marriage by the husband in the <em>Scott </em>case. We hold that under the facts before us, where both parties knew the pertinent facts and over a long passage of time remarried and conducted their affairs as if their marriage was dissolved, principles of equity demand that Pierson be estopped from asserting rights in decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Kline, P.
