J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">Yes on Measure A, Citizens for Jobs and the Economy, and Catherine Kirkpatrick (plaintiffs) obtained a preliminary injunction compelling the City of Lake Forest (the city) to disclose the expenditures it made in a preelection challenge to measure A, a local initiative. The only issue in this case is whether a city\u2019s litigation expenses incurred in pursuing a preelection challenge to the constitutionality or legality of a local initiative are reportable expenditures within the meaning of the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 81000 et seq.). Because we hold they are not reportable, we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Measure A, entitled the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative, was a local initiative that qualified for the November 8,1994, general election. It proposed to amend the Orange County general plan to permit development of a commercial airport on land occupied by the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station upon the base\u2019s closure. Alleging the proposed general plan amendment violated various state planning laws, the city, which borders the base, filed a preelection challenge to keep the measure off the ballot. (City of Lake Forest v. Tanney (Super. Ct. Orange County, 1994, No. 733984).)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The city\u2019s primary allegation was that the general plan amendment, if approved, would make the county\u2019s general plan internally inconsistent. The city also alleged the proposed amendment was invalid since it had not been submitted to the county\u2019s airport land use commission, the county\u2019s existing land use element was legally inadequate, the initiative did not identify significant and major competing interests affected by the proposed airport, and general plans may not be amended by the initiative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The trial court denied the city\u2019s petition. Measure A was later approved by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">After the petition was denied, but prior to the election, plaintiffs filed this action seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction compelling the city to disclose the expenditures it made in its effort to keep measure A off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ballot. They argued the city was required to disclose this information under the Political Reform Act because the city\u2019s preelection challenge was political, taken for the purpose of influencing the electorate. The city countered that the purpose of its challenge was solely legal, aimed at keeping an invalid initiative off the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The trial court concluded the city\u2019s action represented \u201cthe ultimate influence of the electoral process\u201d because it sought to terminate the election, thereby depriving the electorate of the right to vote on the measure. Accordingly, it issued a preliminary injunction. The city appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The general rule is that an order granting a preliminary injunction is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>(Garamendi </em>v. <em>Executive Life Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 504, 512 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 578].) However, where the issuance of a preliminary injunction \u201cis dependent upon the construction of a statute, and the matter is purely a question of law, the standard of review is not whether discretion was appropriately exercised, but whether the statute was correctly construed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 512.)  Here, the question is solely one of law, that is, whether the city\u2019s expenditures were reportable within the meaning of the Political Reform Act. Accordingly, we review de novo the court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The act requires any person who makes one or more expenditures must report them once certain thresholds are reached. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 82013, subd. (b), 84200.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under it, an \u201cexpenditure\u201d is defined as \u201ca payment, a forgiveness of a loan, a payment of a loan by a third party, or an enforceable promise to make a payment, <em>unless it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that it is not made for political purposes.\u201d </em>(Gov. Code, \u00a7 82025, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Because the act does not define the term \u201cpolitical purposes,\u201d we turn to the rules and regulations adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission (Commission) for guidance. The Commission is charged with \u201c[p]rovid[ing] assistance to agencies and public officials in administering the provisions\u201d of the act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 83113, subd. (c).) It is authorized to adopt \u201crules and regulations to carry out the purposes and provisions,\u201d and which are \u201cconsistent with,\u201d the act. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 83112.) The Commission adopted regulation 18225 which provides, insofar as it applies to the city here, that an expenditure is made for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d if it is \u201c[f]or the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the action of the voters for or against . . . the qualification or passage of any measure\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 18225, subd. (a)(1)), or \u201cis used for communications which expressly advocate the . . . qualification, passage or defeat of a clearly identified ballot measure.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 18225, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The question, then, is whether the expenditures made by a city in a preelection challenge to the legality of a ballot measure are reportable expenditures within the meaning of the Political Reform Act of 1974. Plaintiffs assert it is well settled that such expenditures are reportable, citing <em>Thirteen Committee </em>v. <em>Weinreb </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 528 [214 Cal.Rptr. 297]. That case involved a mayoral candidate who sued an opponent for defamation in connection with statements made during the course of the campaign. The court, relying on California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 18225 and a Commission advisory opinion, <em>In re Buchanan </em>(May 1, 1979) FPPC Dec. No. 78-013 [5 FPPC Opns. 14; 1979 WL 52471], held the candidate\u2019s litigation expenses were reportable expenditures. The court noted that the Commission \u201chas officially interpreted [regulation 18225, subdivision (b)(1)] to include litigation expenses of a candidate seeking to remove an opponent from the ballot as a reportable expenditure.\u201d <em>(Thirteen Committee </em>v. <em>Weinreb, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">While the holding in <em>Thirteen Committee </em>clearly applies to candidates and not ballot measures, plaintiffs contend dictum in <em>In re Buchanan </em>makes it applicable to ballot measures: \u201cWhen expenditures are made to support litigation aimed at. . . keeping a candidate <em>or measure </em>off the ballot, . . . the expenditures are made for the purpose of influencing the outcome of the election . . . against a particular candidate <em>or measure </em>and should be reported.\u201d <em>(In re Buchanan, supra, </em>FPPC Dec. No. 78-013 [5 FPPC Opns. at pp. 15-16], italics added, fn. omitted.) Plaintiffs, however, did not read far enough. Footnote 3 of the Commission\u2019s opinion specifically distinguishes between \u201c[l]itigation challenging the results of an election\u201d and \u201clitigation challenging the constitutionality or legality of a statute enacted by an initiative.\u201d Pointing out that the only connection between litigation challenging the constitutionality or legality of a measure and the election process is a \u201ccoincidental one,\u201d the Commission stated that \u201csuch litigation would not give rise to any campaign disclosure obligations.\u201d (5 FPPC Opns. at p. 16, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We agree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that a city\u2019s preelection challenge to a ballot measure, based on a claim it is unconstitutional or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>illegal, is not an attempt to influence the electorate. The sole purpose of the litigation is to test the legal validity of the measure as drafted, that is, whether the measure is properly on the ballot at all. Similar to the actions taken by a public entity and its employees during the drafting stage of an initiative, the \u201caudience at which these activities are directed is not the electorate per se.\u201d <em>(League of Women Voters </em>v. <em>Countywide Crim. Justice Coordination Com. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 529, 550 [250 Cal.Rptr. 161].) Since a city's activities in filing a preelection challenge to the legal validity of a ballot measure are not designed to influence voters for or against the measure, the reporting requirements of the act do not attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Echoing the trial court\u2019s rationale, plaintiffs then assert that removing a measure from the ballot represents the ultimate political act and attempt to influence the electorate because it prevents them from participating in the political process. They argue the city\u2019s actions were particularly egregious here because the city tried to prevent all voters within the county\u2014not just those residing within the city\u2014from voting on the measure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They insist that the proper course for the city would have been to wait until the measure passed before challenging its legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The argument has no merit.  As the courts have stated, the initiative process \u201cis not a public opinion poll. It is a method of enacting legislation, and if the proposed measure does not enact legislation, or if it seeks to compel legislative action which the electorate has no power to compel, <em>it should not be on the ballot.\u201d (American Federation of Labor </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 687, 695 [206 Cal.Rptr. 89, 686 P.2d 609], italics added; see also <em>Citizens for Responsible Behavior </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1013, 1023 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 648] [if initiative invalid, no purpose served by submitting it to voters].)  Moreover, preelection challenges are desirable because \u201c[t]he presence of an invalid measure on the ballot steals attention, time and money from the numerous valid propositions on the same ballot. It will confuse some voters and frustrate others, and <em>an ultimate decision that the measure is invalid, coming after the voters have voted in favor of the measure, tends to denigrate the legitimate use of the initiative </em>procedure.\u201d <em>(American Federation of Labor </em>v. <em>Eu, </em>supra, 36 Cal.3d at p. 697, italics added.) To suggest, as plaintiffs do, that the filing of a preelection challenge is a political act because it seeks to take away the electorate\u2019s right to vote, incorrectly presupposes the electorate has an inalienable right to vote on an unconstitutional or invalid measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Because we hold the city\u2019s expenditures incurred in association with the underlying action did not trigger the reporting requirements of the Political Reform Act of 1974, the order granting a preliminary injunction is reversed. The city shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Wallin, J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> Even though not reportable under the act, they are open to public scrutiny under other provisions of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> We invited the Fair Political Practices Commission and the League of California Cities to submit an application for leave to file an amicus curiae brief on the merits.
