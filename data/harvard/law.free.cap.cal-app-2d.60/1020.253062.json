J.</author>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Defendant, Keith E. Gatson, appeals from his convictions for: first degree murder (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 187, subd. (a)); second degree robbery (\u00a7211); attempted second degree robbery (\u00a7\u00a7664, 211); assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)); and bringing a weapon into a jail. (\u00a7 4574, subd. (a).) It was determined that defendant was engaged in the commission of the crime of robbery when he committed the murder. (\u00a7 189.) It was also found that defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of the murder and robbery (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)). Further, the jury found that a principal was armed with a firearm in each offense. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1).) In the published portion of the opinion, we address the scope of the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">II. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">When viewed in a light most favorable to the judgment <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Stainer </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 31 F.3d 907, 908-909; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110]), the evidence indicated defendant and his codefendant, Clyde Keith Davis, chased Joy Michelle Magdaleno with a gun, took her necklace, struggled with her, and pinned her to the ground. Defendant then shot her in the head and shoulder and took her purse from her automobile before fleeing in Mr. Davis\u2019s car. During the decedent\u2019s subsequent hospitalization and prior to her death on December 19, 1992, she told her brother, mother, and father on various occasions that defendant and Mr. Davis had kicked, beat, robbed, and shot her. Some of the decedent\u2019s statements were tape-recorded by her family. At the time some of the statements were made, the decedent told her family members that she was dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">in. Procedural and Factual Matters Relating to the Admissibility of the Dying Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Prior to trial, defense counsel filed a motion to suppress the decedent\u2019s statements. The issue as to whether a robbery had occurred was of some consequence. The prosecution proceeded on a robbery felony-murder theory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>Defendant was ultimately convicted of first degree murder. As a result, defendant\u2019s trial attorney quite intelligently thoroughly litigated the admissibility of the decedent\u2019s hearsay declarations concerning the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Two hearings before different judges were conducted regarding the admissibility of both the tape-recorded matters and other statements made by the decedent. After the first hearing, Judge Charles Horan initially ruled: \u201cThe court has considered the testimony and arguments relating to die statements made by the victim at various times during her hospital stay, and has listened to exhibit #1. The court\u2019s ruling is as follows: ['ll] Several of the statements do qualify as dying declarations under Evidence Code section 1242, notwithstanding the fact that several days elapsed between the victim\u2019s injuries and the statements. The test is not the duration of time between the injuries and the statements, but rather whether the statements were in fact made under an impending sense of death, and relate to the (eventual) cause of death. The statements made to the victim\u2019s mother on the day the victim \u2018coded\u2019 appear to so qualify, although the testimony from the victim\u2019s mother is not entirely internally consistent. Roughly, these statements were to the effect \u2018Did they catch him yet? Call Deborah. Tell her what a pig he is, what he did to me. They chased me, they robbed me, they kicked me, they shot me. I hurt where they kicked me\u2019, [sic] followed by a name sounding like Gatson or Gudson. Apparently during the same conversation, the victim sayd [sic] \u2018It was Keith and Keith\u2019s mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019, [szc] (See testimony of Detective Maxwell). [*][] That the victim was under an impending sense of death during the making of these statements is demonstrated both directly and circumstantially\u2014 directly through the statements of the victim to that effect which were received under Section 1250, and circumstantially through the extensive evidence bearing upon her physical state, which was severe to say the least, and earlier statements of the victim made to her brother, also admissible under Section 1250. In other words, the court finds that throughout large portions of her hospital stay the victim was in fact under an impending sense of death due to the extremely severe nature of her injuries and the sensations they caused her. The court further specifically finds that the victims [sic] statements to her mother on the date she \u2018coded\u2019 demonstrate that at that time she was under an impending sense of death as well. [C[Q As to earlier statements which mirror those set forth above, the court does not find that those statements were made under an impending sense of death, though they may have been\u2014the record is inconclusive at this point. However, the earlier statements are admissible insofar as they qualify, explain, or make clear the statements referred to in paragraph two above. Further, the <em>[sic] </em>may be admissible on the additional ground that they qualify as prior consistent or inconsistent statements, though the court makes no such ruling at this time, and will in all likelihood be unable to do so until the trial is underway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The trial judge also held an additional hearing on this issue. Judge Harvey A. Schneider, who actually tried the case, ruled: that the statement made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>the decedent on the day she \u201ccoded\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was admissible; the statements made both on the tape and to her mother by the decedent would be admissible subject to a hearing to determine whether there was a sense of impending death; and, if the defense witnesses testified concerning the decedent\u2019s mental state on December 15, 1992, the entire tape would be admissible to allow the jury to evaluate her apparent state on that date. Thereafter, the decedent\u2019s brother, mother, and father testified regarding her recorded and unrecorded statements. Defendant\u2019s witness, Dr. Ronald Markman, testified that based upon the nature of the decedent\u2019s injuries, her reference to a \u201crobbery\u201d was more than likely a simple response to a question or a repetition of the term without full knowledge of the term\u2019s meaning. During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Markman, the trial court allowed the tape recording of the decedent\u2019s statements to be played for the jury and specifically found its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. The tape was played to demonstrate the decedent\u2019s ability to communicate, which had been challenged by Dr. Markman.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">IV. Discussion Concerning the Decedent\u2019s Dying Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Defendant argues the trial court improperly allowed the admission into evidence of the decedent\u2019s statement, \u201cThey robbed me.\u201d He argues the decedent\u2019s reference to the robbery did not come within the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule because it did not relate to the cause and circumstances of the declarant\u2019s death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Evidence Code section 1242 provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement made by a dying person respecting the cause and circumstances of his death is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement was made upon his personal knowledge and under a sense of immediately impending death.\u201d  We examine a contention concerning the admissibility of hearsay utilizing the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 819-820 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436] [finding of trustworthiness for physical or mental states exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1250-1251) subject to abuse of discretion standard of review]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tahl </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 719, 725 [56 Cal.Rptr. 318, 423 P.2d 246] [abuse of discretion standard of review to be applied on appeal to the issue of whether a hearsay declaration was made under a sense of impending death as required by former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1870, subd. 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>repealed Stats. 1965, ch. 299, \u00a7 58, p. 1360 and reenacted as Evid. Code, \u00a7 1242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The \u201ccause and circumstances\u201d of the death have been described as the res gestae of the death. (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) The Hearsay Rule, \u00a7 728, p. 710; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1881) 59 Cal. 640, 648.) The California Supreme Court has held: \u201c[T]he <em>res gestae </em>embrace, not only the actual facts of the assault and the circumstances surrounding it, but the matters immediately antecedent to and having a direct causal connection with the assault as well as acts, immediately following the assault and so closely connected with it as to form in reality a part of the occurrence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cipolla </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 224, 227-228 [100 P. 252] [decedent\u2019s dying declaration, including reference to his assault, the carrying of his body to the river and throwing it in, admissible res gestae]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Yokum </em>(1897) 118 Cal. 437, 440 [50 P. 686] [decedent\u2019s statement \u201cto the effect that after the fatal shot defendant followed him up the hill, and the deceased begged him not to shoot him any more, that he was dying then\u201d an admissible dying declaration]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>59 Cal. at pp. 649-650 [decedent\u2019s explanation of circumstances leading up to the his death admissible]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nakamaru </em>(1934) 136 Cal.App. 582, 587-588 [29 P.2d 320] [decedent\u2019s statement that the defendant visited a cabin and poisoned some pancakes the previous evening an admissible dying declaration]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibson </em>(1917) 33 Cal.App. 459, 460 [166 P. 585] [defendant\u2019s statement that he had not lost a patient in 30 years made just prior to unsuccessful surgery admissible as a dying declaration]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cyty </em>(1909) 11 Cal.App. 702, 708 [106 P. 257] [\u201cnot only the actual facts of the assault and the circumstances surrounding it, but the matters immediately antecedent to and having a direct causal connection with the assault, as well as acts immediately following the assault and so closely connected with it to form a part of the occurrence\u201d are subject to dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule]; 31 Cal.Jur.3d, Evidence, \u00a7 266, p. 344; Mendez, Cal. Evidence (1993) \u00a7 9.03, p. 168.) The fact all of the foregoing decisional authority was decided prior to the adoption of the Evidence Code is irrelevant. There is no indication the Legislature intended to abrogate the foregoing decisional authority when the Evidence Code was adopted in 1965 and made effective January 1, 1967. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 12, subd. (a); see 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <em>supra, </em>at p. 13; 7 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (Aug. 1965) p. 1234; McDonough, <em>The California Evidence Code: A Pr\u00e9cis </em>(1966) 18 Hastings L.J. 89, 114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In this case, the decedent, who had a portion of her brain severely injured by the gunshot wound inflicted by defendant, was coherent and alert. She repeatedly told her family members that defendant and his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Mr. Davis, had kicked, beat, robbed, and shot her. She was adamant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>that they be apprehended. There was a sense of urgency to her pleas that family members do something to insure defendant and Mr. Davis were caught. We agree with the Attorney General that the word \u201crobbed\u201d as used by the decedent during the last days of her life was part of a comprehensive description of what caused her injuries and ultimate death. As a result, it was admissible within the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cipolla, supra, </em>155 Cal. at p. 228; Evid. Code \u00a7 1242.)
