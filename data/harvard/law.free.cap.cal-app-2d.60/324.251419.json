Real parties interpreted the language <em>\u201ctrial court\u2019s decision\u201d </em>in the 1985 amendment to mean that a party could exercise its right to file a peremptory challenge following a reversal on appeal only if the first trial was a court trial. Adopting real parties\u2019 argument, respondent court rejected the peremptory challenge because \u201cthe appeal was from a jury verdict.\u201d Respondent court then reassigned the case to Judge Schacter. This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">When interpreting the meaning of a statute, \u201c[w]e look first to the language selected by the Legislature and only review legislative history materials when there is ambiguity in the statute.\u201d <em>(Union Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 584 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 653].)  Although we are of the view that the 1985 amendment clearly and unequivocally affords a party the right to file a peremptory challenge to the original trial judge after the reversal of a judgment or order on appeal, regardless of whether the judgment originated from a judge\u2019s decision or a jury verdict, we will assume for the purpose of this discussion that there is some ambiguity in the language on which the parties focus here, <em>\u201ctrial court\u2019s decision.\u201d </em>Accordingly, we have reviewed the legislative history of the 1985 amendment, and it does not support respondent court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">One of the wide variety of factors a court may consider in reviewing legislative history to help \u201cilluminate the legislative design\u201d is the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cevil\u201d to be remedied by the legislation. <em>(Walters </em>v. <em>Weed </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1, 10 [246 Cal.Rptr. 5, 752 P.2d 443].) In the case of the 1985 amendment, the perceived \u201cevil\u201d to be remedied was that \u201ca judge who has been reversed may prove to be biased against the party who successfully appealed the judge\u2019s erroneous ruling. . . .\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1213 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended, May 15,1985, p. 1. ) The Legislature\u2019s objective in enacting the 1985 amendment was \u201cto allow a party to remove a judge whose conduct during the original trial evidenced prejudice toward a party.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1213 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 24, 1985, p. 2. ) There is not even a hint in the legislative history of the 1985 amendment that the Legislature intended to withhold the benefit of the amendment from a party which had exercised its right to a jury trial. Indeed, a major proponent of the amendment was the California Trial Lawyers\u2019 Association, one of whose members, urging passage of the amendment, submitted correspondence in which he recounted the prejudice he believed he and his clients had suffered at the hands of a particular judge in a lengthy jury trial. Suffice it to say that the Legislature was well aware, at the time it passed the 1985 amendment, that actual or perceived prejudice by a trial judge could occur in a jury trial as well as a court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The petition for writ of mandate is granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to vacate its order of July 25,1997, rejecting petitioner\u2019s peremptory challenge to Judge Schacter as untimely, and enter a new and different order honoring the peremptory challenge. Costs are awarded to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Turner, P. J., and Armstrong, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, subdivision (2), provides in pertinent part: \u201cA motion under this paragraph may be made following reversal on appeal of a trial court\u2019s decision if the trial judge in the prior proceeding is assigned to conduct a new trial on the matter. The motion shall be made within 60 days after the party or the party\u2019s attorney has been notified of the assignment.\u201d This language was added to section 170.6 in 1985 and will be referred to hereinafter as \u201cthe 1985 amendment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
