Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) and traditional writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) in Sacramento Superior Court to compel the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), its director, Dennis G. Amundson, and the North Bay Regional Center (NBRC) to set aside a DDS administrative hearing decision authorizing parental copayment for respite services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other poMs, plaMiffs argued the Legislature did not expressly authorize the copayment in the Lanterman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4500-4905) (the Lanterman Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They also maintained a DDS policy authorizing other regional centers to establish service standards requiring parental copayment violated the Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.) (APA). The trial court granted other relief sought in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, but denied their challenge to the respite copayment. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We conclude NBRC may not impose a parental copayment for respite services in the absence of express statutory authorization. We also conclude DDS may not implement a general policy on respite copayment. Accordingly, we reverse and direct the trial court to: (1) issue a writ of administrative mandate compelling DDS to set aside the administrative hearing decision approving NBRC\u2019s respite copayment; and (2) issue a writ of mandate compelling DDS to cease implementation of its statement authorizing regional centers to establish service standards requiring parental copayment to the extent it applies to respite services.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">A. <em>The Lanterman Act:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">The California Legislature enacted the Lanterman Act in 1977 \u201cto prevent or minimize the institutionalization of developmentally disabled persons<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and their dislocation from family and community . . . and to enable them to approximate the pattern of everyday living of nondisabled persons of the same age and to lead more independent and productive lives in the community.\u201d <em>(Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Services </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 384, 388 [211 Cal.Rptr. 758, 696 P.2d 150].) As the administrative law judge (ALJ) observed in this case, the Lanterman Act permitted many individuals previously placed in state hospitals to be housed and effectively treated in less restrictive community settings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">Under the Lanterman Act, \u201c[t]he State of California accepts a responsibility for persons with developmental disabilities and an obligation to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>which it must discharge.\u201d (\u00a7 4501.) The state also recognizes that \u201c[p]ersons with developmental disabilities have the same legal rights and responsibilities [as those] guaranteed all other individuals by the United States Constitution and laws and the Constitution and laws of the State of California.\u201d (\u00a7 4502.) Statutory rights include \u201c[a] right to treatment and habilitation services and supports in the least restrictive environment\u201d at state expense. (\u00a7\u00a7 4502, subd. (a), 4620, 4646-4648; see also <em>Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Services, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 389.) The Supreme Court construed the Lanterman Act to grant developmentally disabled persons \u201cthe right to be provided at state expense with only such services as are consistent with its purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 393.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">The Lanterman Act authorizes DOS to contract with regional centers such as NBRC to provide developmentally disabled individuals with \u201caccess to the services and supports best suited to them throughout their lifetime.\u201d (\u00a7 4620.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The regional centers are operated by private nonprofit community agencies. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The rights of developmentally disabled persons and the obligations of the state toward them are implemented through individual program plans (IPP) which regional centers must develop for each client. (\u00a7\u00a7 4646, 4647; <em>Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Services, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 390.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">DOS is authorized to promote uniformity and cost-effectiveness in the operation of regional centers. <em>(Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Services, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 389, citing \u00a7\u00a7 4631, subd. (a), 4681, and 4780.5.) The responsibility of DOS \u201cdoes not extend to the control of the manner in which [regional centers] provide services or in general operate their programs.\u201d <em>(Association for Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Services, supra, </em>at pp. 389-390.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>In 1992, the Legislature enacted section 4791 in response to the state\u2019s \u201cunprecedented fiscal crisis.\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 722, \u00a7 27, p. 3371, eff. Sept. 15, 1992.) The new statute required regional centers to submit to DDS detailed plans for absorbing anticipated unallocated budget reductions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Relevant to this appeal are two subdivisions of the 1992 version of section 4791:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">\u201c(c) To carry out the intent of this provision, . . . each regional center contract shall include provisions which ensure the regional center will provide services to eligible consumers within the funds available in the contract throughout the contract term. Regional centers shall implement innovative, cost-effective methods of services delivery, which may include, but not be limited to, the use of vouchers, consumer or parent services coordinators, increased administrative efficiencies, and <em>alternative sources of payment for services.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">\u201c(h)(1) The plan submitted to the department may include, but not be limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\">\u201c(A) Innovative and cost-effective methods of services delivery that include, but are not limited to, the use of vouchers; the use of consumers and parents as service coordinators; alternative methods of case management; the use of volunteer teams, made up of consumers, parents, other family members, and advocates, to conduct the monitoring activities described in Section 4648.1; increased administrative efficiencies; alternative sources of payment for services; use of available assessments in determining eligibility; and alternative nonresidential rate methodologies or service delivery models, or both. <em>In addition, the regional center shall take into account, in identifying the consumer\u2019s service needs, the family\u2019s responsibility for providing similar services to a child without disabilities.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1992, ch. 722, \u00a7 27, italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">B. <em>NBRC\u2019s Expenditure Plan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">In December 1994, DDS approved NBRC\u2019s expenditure plan for fiscal year 1994-1995.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plan merged various services under one title or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>category. It provided respite services under the title of \u201cday care,\u201d differentiating between \u201cday care for relief\u2019 and \u201cday care for work and educational purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\">NBRC informed parents and family members of its clients that beginning March 1,1995, families receiving respite care for children under 13 years of age would be expected to pay the regular cost of child care at the rate of $3 per hour. NBRC made clear it would pay a greater portion of the day care costs if \u201ca family [could] demonstrate a financial need, and when not doing so [would] jeopardize the family\u2019s ability to keep a child at home, . . It mailed families a follow-up letter on March 28, 1995, which clarified that the copayment applied to services previously called respite care. The letter also explained the procedure for requesting a fair hearing in the event families disagreed with the amount of copayment set by NBRC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">C. <em>The Plaintiffs:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">Individual plaintiffs Sheraya Clemente, Rovel Billy Abueg, and Brenton Gardner are developmentally disabled children who are clients of NBRC. Their families are eligible to receive respite services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">At the time of the administrative hearing, Sheraya Clemente was 5 years old, but functioned at the developmental level of an 18-to-22-month-old. If left unattended, Sheraya would walk out the front door and down the street. She frequently wandered around the house and pulled down unattached objects. Sheraya scattered household items, leaving silverware in her parents\u2019 bed and toilet paper in the shower. She did not respond to behavior approaches that worked with a nondisabled child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">Sheraya\u2019s IPP authorized her family to receive 96 hours of respite services each quarter. The Clementes used respite to complete household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, yard work, and maintenance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">Billy Abueg is autistic, hyperactive, and suffers severe mental disabilities. He was nearly 12 years old at the time of the administrative hearing. Billy could not talk and was not toilet trained. His destructive and disruptive behavior required 24-hour supervision by people with the physical ability to control him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-10\">Billy\u2019s IPP authorized 116 hours of respite services in the first quarter of 1995, and 92 hours of respite services in the second quarter. His parents used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>respite to attend church, or go out to dinner or a movie with their older, nondisabled son. Sometimes they attended the older son\u2019s piano recitals and school programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">Brenton Gardner has Down\u2019s syndrome. He was two and a half years old at the time of the hearing. Brenton was hard to control. He had temper tantrums because he could not communicate. His mother had to carry him everywhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">Brenton\u2019s mother requested continuation of the 75 hours of respite services per quarter. She used respite to run errands, attend meetings and support groups, and spend time with her older son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">D. <em>The Administrative Hearing:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-8\">The individual plaintiffs appealed NBRC\u2019s denial of their claim the co-payment for respite services violated the Lanterman Act. At the DDS administrative hearing, the ALJ found that \u201ceven in those circumstances that warrant the provision of Respite Care services, because the parents and family simply must get away from the demands of the client, the service being provided in some portion contains identical care strategies and methods as will be employed in any Child Care service of children that are not developmentally disabled.\u201d Citing the last sentence in former section 4791, subdivision (h)(1)(A), the ALJ concluded NBRC was authorized to charge a copayment for that portion of respite care.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">E. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Superior Court Petition:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-10\">ARC joined the individual plaintiffs in seeking relief in superior court. They sought a writ of administrative mandate to reverse the ALJ\u2019s decision on grounds DDS did not proceed in the manner required by law. Plaintiffs also alleged three causes of action in their petition for traditional writ of mandate. The first cause of action alleged DDS, Amundson, and NBRC breached their ministerial duty to assure NBRC complied with the Lanterman Act. The third cause of action alleged DDS and Amundson issued a policy authorizing copayment for services \u201csimilar to a service a child without a disability would need\u201d in violation of the APA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-11\">The court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to approve NBRC\u2019s copayment for respite services, stating that \u201c[wjhile the Lanterman Act does not explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>authorize the imposition of the co-pay, neither does it expressly prohibit it.\u201d It ruled the DDS policy did not constitute an underground regulation. The court also granted DOS\u2019s, Amundson\u2019s, and NBRC\u2019s motions to strike exhibits A and B, two ALJ decisions which found the Lanterman Act did not authorize copayments for respite services.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">\n<em>The Lanterman Act Does Not Authorize Copayment for Respite Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, the inquiry focuses on \u201cwhether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).) Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for writ of administrative mandate alleges the adverse DDS administrative decision constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because the ALJ did not proceed in the manner required by law, that is, he wrongly concluded the Lanterman Act authorized a copayment for respite services.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">\u201c[W]e independently determine the proper interpretation of the statute. As the matter is a question of law, we are not bound by evidence on the question presented below or by the lower court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 556, 562 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 531, 828 P.2d 672]; <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">The rules governing statutory interpretation are well established. \u201cWe begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Snowden, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 562.) To determine intent, we look first to the language of the statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Specific statutes must be construed with reference to the entire system of law of which they are a part, so that all may be harmonized and have effect. <em>(American Federation of State etc. Employees </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 506, 515 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 51].) We are also mindful that remedial statutes such as the Lanterman Act must be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes for which they were enacted. <em>(California State Restaurant Assn. </em>v. <em>Whitlow </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 340, 347 [129 Cal.Rptr. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>As we explained, an overriding purpose of the Lanterman Act is to enable developmentally disabled individuals to live in the least restrictive environment possible. (\u00a7 4502, subd. (a).) The state has accepted its obligation to pay for support services such as respite care regardless of the parents\u2019 financial status as a statutory entitlement\u2014unless the Legislature has created an exception to that policy. <em>(Ibid:, </em>see also \u00a7\u00a7 4620, 4646-4648.)  Plaintiffs argue respite services advance this legislative purpose by providing families with the support necessary to care for their developmentally disabled children at home and should not be conditioned on copayment without express statutory authorization. We agree with plaintiffs\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Although the state \u201caccepts a responsibility\u201d for persons with developmental disabilities (\u00a7 4501) and pays for the bulk of their \u201ctreatment and habilitation services and supports\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 4502, subd. (a), 4620, 4646-4648), the parties acknowledge the Legislature did not intend that the state assume the entire cost of services where families have the ability to pay. They cite three sections of the Lanterman Act where the Legislature expressly authorized the imposition of copayments on the families of developmentally disabled individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Former sections 4850 and 4851 assessed families a fee for management services under a sliding scale for the purpose of obtaining federal funds for those services. (Stats. 1991, ch. 14, \u00a7 1, pp. 81-84.) At the same time, the Legislature stated it intended that DDS \u201ccontinue to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies for obtaining federal financial participation for case management services without the imposition of user fees.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 82.) Sections 4850 and 4851 were repealed in 1996 in accordance with former section 4854. (Stats. 1991, ch. 14, \u00a7 1, p. 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Section 4782 states that parents of children under the age of 18 who receive 24-hour out-of-home care through a regional center \u201cshall be required to pay a fee depending upon their ability to pay, but not to exceed (1) the cost of caring for a normal child at home, as determined by the Director of Developmental Services, or (2) the cost of services provided, whichever is less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The Legislature amended section 4685 in 1992 to impose\u2014for the first time\u2014a parental copayment for day care services: \u201cWhen purchasing or providing a voucher for day care services for parents who are caring for children at home, the regional center may pay only the cost of the day care service that exceeds the cost of providing day care services to a child without disabilities. The regional center may pay in excess of this amount when a family can demonstrate a financial need and when doing so will enable the child to remain in the family home.\u201d (\u00a7 4685, subd. (c)(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>Indeed, the language and structure of section 4685 assist in our effort to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent on the question of copayment for respite. The statute specifically addresses home services. It begins with the statement that \u201c [consistent with state and federal law, the Legislature finds and declares that children with developmental disabilities most often have greater opportunities for educational and social growth when they live with their families. The Legislature further finds and declares that the cost of providing necessary services and supports which enable a child with developmental disabilities to live at home is typically equal to or lower than the cost of providing out-of-home placement. The Legislature places a high priority on providing opportunities for children with developmental disabilities to live with their families, when living at home is the preferred objective in the child\u2019s individual program plan.\u201d (\u00a7 4685, subd. (a).) Section 4685, subdivision (c)(2) states that \u201c[rjegional centers shall consider every possible way to assist families in maintaining their children at home, when living at home will be in the best interest of the child, before considering out-of-home placement alternatives. When the regional center first becomes aware that a family is considering out-of-home placement, the regional center shall meet with the family to discuss the situation and the family\u2019s current needs, solicit from the family what supports would be necessary to maintain the child in the home, and utilize creative and innovative ways of meeting the family\u2019s needs and providing adequate supports to keep the family together, if possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Section 4685 then focuses on the specific services and supports which enable developmentally disabled children to remain at home. Respite for parents and day care are listed <em>separately </em>among the types of assistance available through regional centers. (\u00a7 4685, subd. (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">DOS and NBRC argue that because child care is a component of both day care and respite, it is the same activity. The Lanterman Act expressly defines respite services. (\u00a7 4690.2, see fn. 1 <em>ante, </em>p. 1096.) It does not define day care.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, when NBRC improperly merged the categories of respite and day care in its 1994-1995 expenditure plan, it retained the distinction between respite or \u201cday care for relief\u2019 and \u201cday care for work and educational purposes.\u201d We believe the separate listing of respite for parents and day care in section 4685, subdivision (c)(1), as well as the distinction made by NBRC, acknowledge that respite and day care are qualitatively different. Respite services provide the relief necessary for families to cope with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>stress of caring for developmentally disabled children at home 24 hours a day. (\u00a7 4690.2, subd. (a)(3).) The focus is not on what families elect to do when respite services are provided, but on the fact they are relieved from the responsibility of caring for their developmentally disabled child during that period. (See \u00a7 4690.2.) The children benefit from the family setting, and the state benefits from the generally lower cost of home care. (\u00a7 4685, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore reject NBRC\u2019s argument that respite is simply \u201cadditional child care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">More important for purposes of statutory construction is the fact section 4685 identifies respite and day care as separate types of assistance available to families caring for developmentally disabled children at home, but expressly authorizes parental copayment <em>only </em>for day care. Had the Legislature intended to assess a copayment for respite services it had every opportunity to do so in the 1992 amendment which added copayment for day care.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The legislative history of sections 4782 and 4685 demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit the exceptions to entitlements under the Lanterman Act. Before 1984, the language of section 4782 did not clearly limit parental copayments to 24-hour out-of-home care provided through regional centers or state hospitals. Regional centers were charged with determining the amount of what the statute described as parental \u201ccontributions.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 1252, \u00a7 550, pp. 4520, 4560; Stats. 1978, ch. 948, \u00a7 1, p. 2929.) There was no uniformity in the way the regional centers applied the statute. Although DDS regulations construed the contributions as <em>required </em>fees, some regional centers and many parents concluded they were <em>voluntary. </em>(Sen. Com. on Health &amp; Welfare, Dept. of Developmental Services, Request for Approval of Sen. Bill No. 2310 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) as revised Nov. 14, 1984, pp. 1-2, 4.) At the urging of DDS, the Legislature amended the statute changing the \u201ccontribution\u201d to a \u201cfee,\u201d giving DDS responsibility for fee assessment, and limiting the fee to 24-hour out-of-home care for minors. <em>(Ibid.; </em>Dept. of Developmental Services, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2310 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) p. 2; Stats. 1984, ch. 268, \u00a7 36.6, pp. 1374-1375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>The Legislature amended section 4685 in direct response to The Next Step, a comprehensive legislative report of 1990 hearings on the Lanterman Act. (See Assem. Com. on Health, Staff Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1383 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) June 30, 1992, pp. 3-4.) The report expressed concern that 1990-1991 budget proposals, which included parental fees, \u201c[might] be attempts to restrict the Lanterman Act\u2019s guarantee of least restrictive services, promotion of independence and guarantee of entitlements.\u201d (The Next Step, <em>supra, </em>at p. 207.) It cited efforts by DDS to establish parental fees for case-management services in order to obtain federal Medicaid dollars, and urged rejection of copayments for that purpose. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 206-207, 214.) The proposed amendments to section 4685 included copayments for both day care and diaper costs. (Assem. Com. on Health, Staff Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1383 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) June 30, 1992 p. 2; Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Staff Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1383 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 5, 1992, pp. 2-3.) However, the actual amendment to section 4685 limited the parental copayment for diapers to children under three years of age. Moreover, regional centers continue to pay for diapers for those children when the family demonstrates financial need and \u201cwhen doing so [would] enable the child to remain in the family home.\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 1011, \u00a721, p. 4731.)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Also revealing of intent is the fact the Legislature considered legislation amending section 4685 at the same time it considered legislation which added section 4791\u2014the statute which required the regional centers to submit cost-cutting plans in response to the state\u2019s fiscal crisis. (Sen. Bill No. 485, 1 Sen. Final Hist. (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) pp. 381-382; Sen. Bill No. 1383, 2 Sen. Final Hist. (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) p. 1000.) We assume the Legislature was aware of the state\u2019s money woes, and nonetheless elected not to impose a copayment for respite services when it amended section 4685.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">We turn now to the language in section 4791, subdivision (c) and former subdivision (h)(3)(A) which DDS and NBRC argue authorize respite copayment. The vague language of the Legislature\u2019s directive in section 4791, subdivision (c) that regional centers seek \u201calternative sources of payment for services\u201d cannot be read to authorize copayment for respite services. Under the DDS and NBRC analysis, there would be no limit on the type or number of services for which a regional center could impose copayment. Such an interpretation is contrary to the remedial purpose of the Lanterman Act to provide at state expense a broad spectrum of treatment, habilitation and supports to enable developmentally disabled individuals to live in the least restrictive environment possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The legislative history also supports a narrow reading of section 4791, subdivision (c). Section 4791 was enacted as part of a budget trailer bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>which focused on the identification of Medi-Cal related savings. (Assem. Staff Analysis, Sen. Bill No. 485 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) pp. 1, 5-6.) <em>The Next Step </em>had already outlined possible sources of federal funding to reduce caseloads and expand current levels of service to the developmentally disabled. It also cautioned that efforts to obtain federal funding be consistent with service philosophies embodied in the Lanterman Act. (The Next Step, supra, pp. 219, 221-222.) In this context, the phrase \u201calternative sources of payment for services\u201d cannot be read as authorizing copayments for respite services.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We also reject DOS\u2019s and NBRC\u2019s interpretation of the last sentence in former section 4791, subdivision (h)(1)(A)\u2014in which DDS directs the regional centers to \u201ctake into account, in <em>identifying the consumer\u2019s service needs, </em>the family\u2019s responsibility for providing similar services to a child without disabilities.\u201d (Italics added.) The main part of subdivision (h)(1)(A) lists possible \u201c[ijnnovative and cost-effective methods of services delivery.\u201d The plain language of the last sentence refers to the regional center\u2019s process of identifying service needs, that is, the development of the IPP. (See \u00a7\u00a7 4646-4648.) We have difficulty extrapolating that directive to include imposition of a copayment for respite services, particularly where copayment for another type of home support\u2014day care\u2014is expressly authorized in section 4685, subdivision (c)(6).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude DDS did not proceed in the manner required by law when it denied plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to NBRC\u2019s copayment for respite services.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">\n<em>DDS May Not Implement Its \u201cCaveat\u201d on Respite Copayment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 petition alleges that on October 27, 1995, DDS and Amundson \u201cissued a policy which authorizes regional centers to establish service standards requiring a parental copay for any service purchased for the minor or the minor\u2019s family if that service is similar to a service a child without a disability would need.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> They assert the policy is a \u201crule of general applicability that is used to implement, interpret or make specific the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>of the Lanterman Act and the rights of regional center clients\u201d and therefore subject to the APA. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11342, subd. (g); <em>Winzler &amp; Kelly </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 120,125-126 [174 Cal.Rptr. 744].) DDS characterizes the statement as merely a \u201ccaveat\u201d to ensure regional centers adhere to statutory authority if they choose to implement a copayment for respite services.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We need not reach the question whether the so-called \u201ccaveat\u201d is an underground regulation issued in violation of the APA. Having concluded the Legislature did not authorize imposition of copayment for respite services, we also conclude the DDS statement\u2014by whatever name\u2014is an incorrect statement of the law. Accordingly, DDS and Amundson breached their ministerial duties by implementing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The judgment is reversed. The trial court is ordered to: (1) issue a writ of administrative mandate compelling DDS to set aside the administrative hearing decision approving NBRC\u2019s copayment for respite services; and (2) issue a writ of mandate compelling Amundson and DDS to cease implementation of the statement authorizing regional centers to establish service standards requiring parental copayment to the extent it applies to respite services. Plaintiffs shall receive costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Puglia, P.
