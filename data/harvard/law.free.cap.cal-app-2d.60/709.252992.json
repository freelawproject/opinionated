In doing so, we address the meaning of the term \u201cmental disability\u201d as defined under Government Code section 12940, the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). For some reason, the Legislature imposed a requirement that a physical disability must limit a major life activity without imposing the same requirement for a mental disability. Although we question the wisdom of making it harder for a person who has suffered a physical disability to come within the FEHA than a person suffering a mental disability, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the Legislature. Consequently, we conclude plaintiff (who suffers from a reading disorder) has raised a triable issue of fact regarding whether he suffered from a disability under the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">However, this finding does not end our inquiry since plaintiff must also show his employer had knowledge of his mental disability. The question then becomes: Is it enough that an employer be aware of deficiencies in an employee\u2019s performance which are the result of a mental deficiency <em>or </em>must an employer have actual knowledge that the employee suffers from a specific mental disability? We conclude that in order to meet the knowledge requirement of the FEHA, an employer must have actual knowledge an employee suffers from a specific disability. In this case, plaintiff never told his employer he had a learning disability. Plaintiff\u2019s nonspecific complaints of \u201ctrouble\u201d or \u201cproblems\u201d with reading or writing coupled with his job performance difficulties are not sufficient to charge his employer with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>knowledge that he suffers from a mental disability as defined by the FEHA. As a result, we conclude the trial court properly granted the employer\u2019s motion for summary adjudication with respect to plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action for tortious termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address the trial court\u2019s order granting the employer\u2019s motion for summary adjudication with respect to plaintiff\u2019s second (breach of implied-in-fact contract), third (breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing) and fourth (breach of oral contract) causes of action. In doing so, we find the trial court erred, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Edward J. Pensinger, Jr. (plaintiff) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Tulare County against Bowsmith, Inc., Allan Smith, Davis Olney and Does 1 through 10 (Bowsmith). Plaintiff alleged four causes of action: (1) tortious termination in violation of public policy; (2) breach of implied contract; (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (4) breach of oral contract. Bowsmith filed a demurrer to the complaint and plaintiff filed a first amended complaint which alleged five causes of action: the four originally pled and a fifth alleging intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Bowsmith filed a cross-complaint alleging five causes of action: (1) misappropriation of trade secrets; (2) unfair business practice; (3) intentional interference with economic advantage; (4) trade libel; and (5) defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Plaintiff subsequently requested dismissal without prejudice of Allan Smith and Dave Olney with respect to the interference claim, and Allan Smith with respect to the alter ego claim of the first amended complaint. The request was granted by the trial court. Bowsmith filed two motions for summary adjudication. The first was for summary adjudication of plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action alleging tortious termination in violation of public policy. The second was for summary adjudication of the second, third, and fourth causes of action. The two motions were heard together. The trial court granted both motions, and entered judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff and Bowsmith stipulated to dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s fifth cause of action and Bowsmith\u2019s cross-complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Plaintiff filed a timely appeal raising six contentions: (1) there was a triable issue of fact concerning whether defendant was a disabled person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>within the meaning of the FEHA; (2) the trial court erred in finding there was no evidence Bowsmith was aware of plaintiff\u2019s disability; (3) there was a triable issue of fact concerning plaintiff\u2019s qualifications to continue doing his job; (4) the trial court erred in concluding there was no evidence Bowsmith\u2019s reasons for discharging plaintiff were pretextual; (5) the trial court erred in finding there was no evidence to rebut the presumption that plaintiff\u2019s employment was \u201cat will\u201d; and (6) the action for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing survives because there was a contract for employment requiring good cause for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Plaintiff attended school in Bakersfield. He claims he had great difficulty reading and writing throughout elementary school and that his parents hired tutors to assist him. Upon completion of eighth grade, there was a debate about whether he would be allowed to attend high school because of his reading problems and his poor performance on an examination. It was only after the test was given to him orally that plaintiff was allowed to attend high school. While in high school, plaintiff continued to have problems reading and writing and took a noncollege-preparatory curriculum of courses. Plaintiff graduated from high school and began to attend junior college. However, he was unable to keep up with the course work and discontinued the academic classes. He did continue to take vocational courses such as welding and mechanics, in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">After high school, plaintiff held several jobs, including working as a welder and mechanic. He also worked as a distributor of irrigation equipment, selling, delivering, and installing the systems. The irrigation systems he sold included products produced by Bowsmith.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Plaintiff began working exclusively for Bowsmith in August 1982 as a sales representative. When he started work, he shared the responsibility for sale of Bowsmith products in California with a coworker, Darrell Willbanks. When Willbanks was terminated in 1984, plaintiff assumed responsibility for the entire sales territory of California. Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor from 1982 to 1985 was the sales and marketing manager, Stan Hawkins. While Hawkins was his supervisor, plaintiff was required to make written \u201ccall reports.\u201d Plaintiff claims that because of his difficulty in reading and writing, Hawkins permitted him to provide the information for the call reports orally rather than in writing. After Hawkins left Bowsmith, Allan Smith, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, told plaintiff to report directly to him. Plaintiff claims he orally provided information directly to Smith or someone on the inside sales staff from the time Hawkins left until July 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Plaintiff claims that from the time Hawkins left until approximately 1992, his relationship with Bowsmith was very good and he was given responsibility for additional sales territories in the Pacific Northwest. Plaintiff claims that during this period, Smith promised on more than one occasion, that plaintiff would have a job at Bowsmith for as long as he wished, so long as he \u201ckept his nose clean.\u201d However, in 1992, plaintiff claims a dispute arose between Smith and him over whether plaintiff should be paid a commission for a sale he negotiated. Although Smith ultimately paid him the commission, plaintiff claims that Smith\u2019s attitude toward him changed from that point on. It was after this incident that Smith informed plaintiff he believed Bowsmith needed a sales and marketing manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Plaintiff did tell Smith he had a problem with reading and writing. However, plaintiff never said he was disabled and Smith claims he did not know the extent of plaintiff\u2019s problem. Smith claims it was not until 1992 or 1993, when he began to insist plaintiff submit written call reports, that he learned the extent of plaintiff\u2019s problem. However, Smith did provide plaintiff a tape recorder so he could dictate his reports and then have them transcribed by Smith\u2019s sister-in-law. Plaintiff claims he dictated two tapes and submitted them for transcription, but only saw the transcript of one of the tapes and it was unintelligible. Plaintiff claims he was never told what happened to the two tapes or their transcripts. He alleges Smith never provided him any feedback on the transcriptions or requested he continue to dictate the reports. However, in May 1993, Smith purportedly sent plaintiff a memorandum stating that plaintiff had submitted only one tape for transcription and then would not allow the transcription to be given to Smith. Plaintiff claims he never saw the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Sometime in 1993, before Davis Olney was hired, Smith requested plaintiff have tests conducted to determine the extent of his reading and writing problem. Smith claims the purpose of the request was to determine what could be done to help plaintiff with his problem. Plaintiff states he was never told this was the purpose of the test and was first approached about being tested by Smith\u2019s attorney. Plaintiff claims this caused him to fear that the purpose of the testing was to provide a basis for terminating his employment. Although plaintiff said he would comply with the request, he was never evaluated while he worked for Bowsmith.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In July 1993, Olney was hired as sales and marketing manager for Bowsmith. Sometime after he assumed his position, Olney began requiring plaintiff to submit written call reports, as well as other written reports. These reports were required of all Bowsmith sales personnel. Plaintiff informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Olney it was taking a lot of time to complete the reports and Olney claims that as a result, he reduced the amount of documentation plaintiff was required to submit. However, Olney contends plaintiff never told him he had a \u201clearning disability.\u201d Plaintiff asserts there was no reduction in the reports he had to submit and in November or December 1993, he met with Smith to inform him of the problems he was having in complying with Olney\u2019s demand for reports. Plaintiff claims that during this meeting, which his wife also attended, Smith indicated he understood plaintiff\u2019s difficulties with reading and writing, promised he would speak to Olney about it, and authorized plaintiff\u2019s wife to fill out the daily call reports for him. Plaintiff also points out Smith said any additional information required by Olney could be submitted by plaintiff orally during their daily telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Olney and Smith take the position that plaintiff failed to provide the information they required despite their repeated requests to him. Olney states he informed plaintiff of the problem during a meeting in November 1993, and in two written memoranda prepared in December 1993. Based on Olney\u2019s recommendation, Smith notified plaintiff on April 21, 1994, that his employment with Bowsmith was terminated. When Smith notified plaintiff he was terminating his employment, plaintiff\u2019s difficulty with reading and writing was not discussed. Plaintiff only recalls Smith saying something to the effect that \u201cthings were not working out,\u201d and the company was \u201cgoing in a different direction.\u201d Smith claims the reason plaintiff was terminated was because he did not provide the information required by Bowsmith in order to increase its share of the market for irrigation equipment, and that he refused to cooperate with Olney in this endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In approximately November 1995, plaintiff was evaluated by an educational psychologist and diagnosed as suffering from a disability classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3d ed. rev.) (DSM-HI-R) as 315.00, \u201cDevelopmental Reading Disorder.\u201d There is no evidence that prior to this evaluation, defendant was ever formally diagnosed as suffering from a learning disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Bowsmith maintained an employment manual, a copy of which was provided to plaintiff, which states: \u201cAll of the Company\u2019s employees are employed as employees at-will of the Company. Any other term of employment or any other type of employment will require a written agreement signed by the President of the Company.\u201d From the record, it is not clear when this manual was first implemented, although Bowsmith states the version included in the record was written in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I. <em>Plaintiffs disability and the FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication with respect to his first cause of action because there were triable issues of fact on all four of the elements of his cause of action for tortious termination. He argues that contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding, there was evidence presented he suffers from a \u201cmental disability\u201d as defined under Government Code section 12940, the FEHA. Further, he claims there was evidence presented that Bowsmith was aware of this disability and terminated his employment because of it. Finally, plaintiff asserts there was a triable issue of fact regarding whether he was qualified to perform the tasks required of his job and that Bowsmith\u2019s claim that he could not was pretextual. Since he is unable to establish a triable issue of fact for each of the elements of his cause of action, plaintiff\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">A. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">When reviewing a motion for summary judgment on appeal, this court determines de novo \u201cwhether an issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Brantley </em>v. <em>Pisaro </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1601 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 431].) In other words: \u201cIn reviewing an order granting summary judgment, we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion. In doing so, we must strictly scrutinize the moving party\u2019s papers. [Citation.] The declarations of the party opposing summary judgment, however, are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact. [Citation.] All doubts as to whether any material, triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>(Ibid.)\u201d (Martinez </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 334, 341 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 772].) Our review is limited, as is the trial court\u2019s, to determining if \u201cthere is evidence requiring the fact-weighing procedures of a trial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Frank and Freedus </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 461, 468 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 678].) We do not decide the merits of the issues themselves. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Review of a motion for summary judgment involves a three-step analysis: \u201cAppellate review of summary judgment is limited to the facts contained in the documents presented to the trial court. This court exercises its independent judgment as to the legal effect of the undisputed facts disclosed by the parties\u2019 papers. [Citations.] In so doing, we apply the same three-step analysis required of the trial court: We first identify the issues framed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>pleadings, since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond. Secondly, we determine whether the moving party has established facts which negate the opponents\u2019 claim and justify a judgment in the movant\u2019s favor. Finally, if the summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, we determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Torres </em>v. <em>Reardon </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 831, 836 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 52].) A defendant may meet the burden of establishing a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action has no merit in one of two ways. \u201cA defendant or cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that <em>one or more elements </em>of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.\u201d (\u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2), italics added; see <em>Brantley </em>v. <em>Pisaro, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1598.) With this standard firmly in mind, we consider the elements of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for tortious termination in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">B. <em>Termination because of \u201cmental disability\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">\u201cAn action in tort seeking damages for discharge from employment in contravention of public policy is an exception to the general rule, now codified in Labor Code section 2922, that unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an employment is terminable at will.\u201d <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 129 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 876 P.2d 1074], fn. omitted.) However, in order to be actionable, the tortious termination must contravene fundamental public policy. <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1094 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680].) Further, the fundamental public policy \u201cmust be found in either a constitutional or statutory provision; . . .\u201d <em>(Jennings </em>v. <em>Marralle, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Plaintiff claims the fundamental public policy that was violated by his termination is found in the FEHA, which prohibits discrimination based on his mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, or, except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the United States or the State of California:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">\u201c(a) For an employer, because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, <em>mental disability, </em>medical condition, marital status, or sex of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person or to refuse to select the person for a training program leading to employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>or to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Because the FEHA is modeled after the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101 et seq.), interpretations of these laws are \u201cparticularly useful \u2018to guide the construction\u2019 \u201d of the California statute. <em>(Cassista </em>v. <em>Community Foods, Inc. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1050, 1063 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 287, 856 P.2d 1143].)  In order to prevail on a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of Government Code section 12940, plaintiff had to prove: He is a disabled person, as defined in the FEHA; he is qualified to perform the duties of the position with or without reasonable accommodation; and that he was terminated because of his disability. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 7293.7 &amp; 7293.9; <em>White </em>v. <em>York Intern. Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1995) 45 F.3d 357, 360-361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">1. <em>What is a \u201cmental disability?\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In granting the motion for summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action, the trial court found no evidence had been presented that plaintiff suffered from a \u201cdisability protected by law.\u201d In this regard, the court found that although plaintiff may have suffered from a reading disorder, \u201cthis disability does not rise to the level of disability protected by the Fair Employment and Housing Act or the Americans With Disabilities Act.\u201d The court also found no evidence had been presented that Bowsmith knew plaintiff suffered from a \u201cspecific disability\u201d during the time of his employment. The court held that \u201cknowledge of Plaintiff\u2019s shortcomings does not amount to knowledge of a specific disability.\u201d Finally, the court found there was no evidence plaintiff was discharged for any reason \u201cother than his job performance and failure to cooperate with directives of management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The court did not explain why it believed plaintiff\u2019s learning disorder did not constitute a \u201cmental disability\u201d as defined by the FEHA or the ADA. Bowsmith claims there are two bases for this conclusion. First, Bowsmith argues no admissible evidence was presented that plaintiff\u2019s difficulty with reading and writing was not simply the result of \u201can inadequate education or simply a lower rate of intelligence . . . .\u201d Second, Bowsmith claims the definition of a \u201cmental disability\u201d in the FEHA includes a requirement that the mental disability substantially limit a major life activity, and that plaintiff failed to present any evidence of this element. Considering the plain language of the FEHA, we reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The FEHA was amended in 1992 to include \u201cmental disability\u201d as one of the prohibited bases for discrimination in employment. (Stats. 1992, ch. 913, \u00a7 23.1, p. 4313.) The term \u201cmental disability\u201d is defined for purposes of the FEHA, in Government Code section 12926, subdivision (i): \u201c(i) \u2018Mental disability\u2019 includes any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and <em>specific learning </em>disabilities. However, \u2018mental disability\u2019 does not include conditions excluded from the federal definition of \u2018disability\u2019 pursuant to Section 511 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C., Sec. 12211). Additionally, for purposes of this part, the unlawful use of controlled substances or other drugs shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to constitute a mental disability.\u201d (Italics added.) The term \u201cphysical disability\u201d is defined in the same code section, but in a different subdivision, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\">\u201c(k) \u2018Physical disability\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201c(1) Having any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss that does <em>both of the following:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201c(A) Affects one or more of the following body systems: neurological, immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, including speech organs, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201c(B) Limits an individual\u2019s ability to participate in major life activities.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12926, subd. (k), italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Initially, the only evidence plaintiff submitted that he suffered from a mental disability under the FEHA was a letter from a psychologist who tested him in 1995 and found plaintiff suffered from a \u201cDevelopmental Reading Disorder\u201d as defined by the DSM-III-R. Bowsmith is correct that this letter cannot be considered for purposes of resolving the motion for summary judgment. However, in response to Bowsmith\u2019s motion for summary judgment, plaintiff submitted a declaration by the same psychologist along with his curriculum vitae, containing the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The FEHA does not define what constitutes a \u201cspecified learning disability.\u201d That determination presents a mixed question of law and fact. However, \u201cReading Disorder\u201d is defined in the section of the DSM entitled \u201cLearning Disorders.\u201d (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) pp. 46-48.) Thus, the declaration by plaintiff\u2019s psychologist was some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>evidence plaintiff suffered from <em>a </em>learning disability. While a diagnosis under the DSM does not establish conclusively plaintiff suffered from a \u201clearning disability\u201d as contemplated by the FEHA, it is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact concerning the existence of such a condition. Moreover, whether plaintiff\u2019s disability qualified as a \u201clearning disability\" under the FEHA is a factual and legal determination which Bowsmith did not challenge. The real crux of Bowsmith\u2019s argument is that it is not enough for plaintiff to have a diagnosis that he suffers from some learning disorder; he must also present evidence the disorder limits his ability to participate in a major life activity, in order for him to be considered as suffering from a mental disability as defined by the FEHA.  Bowsmith\u2019s argument is predicated on the assertion that the FEHA defines mental disability in the same manner as the ADA. However, this assertion is not supported by a comparison of both statutes. Unlike the FEHA, the ADA combines the definitions of both physical and mental disability in one section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201c(2) <em>Disability</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018disability\u2019 means, with respect to an individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201c(A) <em>a physical or mental impairment </em>that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such an individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201c(B) a record of such an impairment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201c(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12102, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">There is no doubt from this definition that establishing a mental disability for purposes of the ADA requires a plaintiff to prove that it \u201csubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities.\u201d Although the FEHA includes this requirement with respect to proving a physical disability, it is absent from the definition of mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Notwithstanding the fact the Legislature did not include the language requiring a limitation on a major life activity when it amended the FEHA to define the term \u201cmental disability,\" Bowsmith claims this is what was intended. There are several problems with this argument. Bowsmith claims this intent is evident in the provisions of the California Code of Regulations, title 2, section 7293.5 et seq. However, there is nothing in those sections that indicates any intent to engraft the requirement of a limitation on a major life activity on the definition of mental disability. The regulations only refer to the definitions of mental disability and physical disability in Government Code section 12926. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7293.6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">Further, there is no basis for us to impose a requirement that a mental disability limit a major life activity, when the Legislature saw fit not to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>so.  \u201cWhen the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007-1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].)  Undoubtedly, the Legislature was aware of the definitions of mental and physical disability included in the ADA because it referred to it repeatedly in enacting the amendment to the FEHA. (See Stats. 1992, ch. 913, p. 4282 et seq.) Undoubtedly, the Legislature also knew how to amend the FEHA to include a requirement that a mental disability effect must limit a major life activity, if it wished that result. This is evident from the other provisions of California law which were amended in 1992 along with the FEHA; specifically, Business and Professions Code section 125.6; Civil Code section 54; Education Code section 44101; and Government Code section 11135. In each of these sections the Legislature amended the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d to mirror that of the ADA, and include a requirement that the physical <em>or mental </em>disability \u201csubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities of the individual.\u201d Yet, it did not include this requirement in the definition of mental disability under the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">While we may question the wisdom of making the hurdle higher for a person who has suffered the loss of a limb to prove he or she suffers from a disability for purposes of the FEHA, than it is for a person who does not read well, we are not at liberty to ignore the plain language of the statute or supplant our judgment for that of the Legislature. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1007 [\u201cOur analysis starts from the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent\u201d].)  It must be concluded from all the evidence that plaintiff did raise a triable issue of fact concerning whether he suffered from a disability as defined by the FEHA. However, the inquiry does not end there.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">2. <em>Knowledge of the mental disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Assuming plaintiff suffered from a mental disability as defined by the FEHA, any claim he was wrongfully terminated because of that disability must be predicated upon evidence that Bowsmith knew of the disability. <em>(Landefeld </em>v. <em>Marion General Hosp., Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1993) 994 F.2d 1178, 1181-1182.) Put simply, unless there is some evidence an employer knows an employee is suffering from a disability, it is impossible for an employee to claim he or she was discharged because of it or that an employer refused to accommodate the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\u201cBefore an employer must make accommodation for the physical or mental limitation of an employee, the employer must have knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>such a limitation exists. ... In general, \u2018it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.\u2019 29 C.F.R. app. \u00a7 1630.9.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1995) 61 F.3d 627, 629-630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The evaluation of defendant conducted by a psychologist indicates he suffers from a specific learning disorder as defined by DSM-III-R. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>the definition of \u201cmental disability\u201d in the FEHA specifically includes learning disabilities. However, this diagnosis was not made until November 1995, almost 18 months after plaintiff was terminated by Bowsmith. There was no evidence presented that plaintiff was ever specifically diagnosed as suffering from a learning disorder prior to this date or that Bowsmith was made aware that plaintiff suffered from a learning disorder during the entire 12 years he was employed by them. In fact, while still employed by Bowsmith, plaintiff failed to comply with Bowsmith\u2019s request that he be evaluated to determine the extent of his reading and writing problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Bowsmith does not deny it was aware plaintiff had difficulty with reading or writing. However, Bowsmith claims knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s shortcomings in these areas is not sufficient to establish it knew he suffered from a mental disability in the form of a learning disorder. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues Bowsmith\u2019s knowledge of his difficulty with reading or writing as well as its attempts to accommodate these deficiencies during the years of his employment is evidence it knew he suffered from a mental deficiency. Thus, the question in plaintiff\u2019s case comes down to what constitutes \u201cknowledge\u201d of a mental disability for purposes of the protections of the FEHA. Is it enough that an employer be aware of deficiencies in an employee\u2019s performance which are the result of a mental deficiency or must an employer actually have knowledge that the employee suffers from a specific mental disability? Since the FEHA was only amended in 1994 to include \u201cmental disability\u201d as one of the prohibited bases for discrimination, and there is a dearth of California law on what constitutes \u201cknowledge\u201d of a disability, we look to decisions of federal courts that have addressed the issue in the context of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently addressed the issue of when an employer is deemed to know of an employee\u2019s disability. \u201cIt is true that an employer will automatically know of many disabilities. For example, an employer would know that a person in a wheelchair, or with some other obvious physical limitation, had a disability. Furthermore, an employer may actually know of disabilities that are not immediately obvious: the employee may ask for an accommodation under the ADA, or he may inform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>employer gratuitously, for example. In those cases, which are likely the vast majority, the issue we face would not arise: there could not be a genuine issue that the employer had no knowledge of a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">\u201cHowever, unlike with race or sex discrimination, there are situations in alleged disability discrimination cases where an employer clearly did not know and could not have known of an employee\u2019s disability. We think that an employer cannot be liable under the ADA for firing an employee when it indisputably had no knowledge of the disability.\u201d <em>(Hedberg </em>v. <em>Indiana Bell Telephone Co., Inc. </em>(7th Cir. 1995) 47 F.3d 928, 932.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\u201cOf course, if an employee tells his employer that he has a disability, the employer then knows of the disability, and the ADA\u2019s further requirements bind tiie employer. Furthermore, it may be that some <em>symptoms are so obviously manifestations of an underlying disability </em>that it would be reasonable to infer that an employer actually knew of the disability. For example, it would appear to most observers that an employee who suffers frequent seizures at work likely has some disability. If an employer admitted it fired the employee because of his frequent seizures, a reasonable inference might be drawn that the employer knew the employee had a disability. Nor should deliberate ignorance insulate an employer from liability.\u201d (47 F.3d at p. 934.) There was no evidence Bowsmith was aware of the specifics of plaintiff\u2019s learning disability while he was employed there. Therefore, the question is whether plaintiff\u2019s difficulties with reading and writing reports were so obviously a manifestation of his learning disability that it could be inferred Bowsmith knew of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals specifically addressed whether an employer\u2019s knowledge of an employee\u2019s inability to read or write equates to knowledge of a mental or developmental disability in <em>Morisky </em>v. <em>Broward County </em>(11th Cir. 1996) 80 F.3d 445. Morisky applied for the position of custodian in Broward <em>County. On </em>her application she indicated she did not have the required high school diploma, but asked that she be considered for the position because she had completed special education courses. When she arrived to take the test, she was accompanied by another person who informed the test proctor that plaintiff was illiterate and suffered from bronchial asthma. Plaintiff asked that someone read the test to her. Her request was refused because the test proctor believed that the ability to read was a requirement of the position for which plaintiff applied. Plaintiff did not say she suffered from any mental or developmental disability. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 446-447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Plaintiff filed a complaint under the ADA, claiming defendant did not provide a reasonable accommodation for her disability when it refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>allow her to take the test orally. Defendant claimed plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case under the ADA. The district court agreed and entered a summary judgment in favor of defendant. <em>(Morisky </em>v. <em>Broward County, supra, </em>80 F.3d at pp. 447-448.) On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, adopting the reasoning of the district court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 446.) \u201cWhile illiteracy is a serious problem, it does not always follow that someone who is illiterate is necessarily suffering from a physical or mental impairment. [Citation.] Vague or conclusory statements revealing an unspecified incapacity are not sufficient to put an employer on notice of its obligations under the ADA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 448.) The court concluded by stating: \u201cThere is no evidence in this case that the defendant knew that the plaintiff\u2019s inability to read was a result of an organic dysfunction rather than a lack of education.\u201d (80 F.3d at pp. 448-449; see <em>Illingworth </em>v. <em>Nestle U.S.A., Inc. </em>(D.N.J. 1996) 926 F.Supp. 482, 489 [employee\u2019s difficulty in mastering a computer program not such an obvious manifestation of his underlying dyslexia as to place employer on notice of the disability].)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Plaintiff never told Bowsmith he had a learning disability. Although he had difficulty in school, there is no evidence this information was provided to Bowsmith. Plaintiff states he told Smith, Olney, and his previous supervisor, Hawkins, that he had \u201ctrouble\u201d completing the written reports required of him and that it took him a long time to do so because of his \u201cproblem\u201d with reading and writing. It is further apparent from the evidence presented that plaintiff never claimed he was totally unable to read and write. Rather, he stated his ability to do so was limited and required a good deal of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We conclude, as a matter of law, that the information provided by plaintiff is not sufficient to charge Bowsmith with knowledge that plaintiff suffered from a mental disability as defined by the FEHA. Plaintiff\u2019s nonspecific complaints of \u201ctrouble\u201d or \u201cproblems\u201d with reading or writing and his inability to complete required reports are not such obvious manifestations of an underlying learning disability that it would be reasonable to infer Bow-smith knew plaintiff suffered from a mental disability as defined by the FEHA. Therefore, the motion for summary adjudication was properly granted. Regardless of whether plaintiff established he suffered from a qualifying mental disability or whether he was qualified with or without accommodation to perform his job, he did not produce any evidence Bow-smith knew of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">II. <em>Termination at will versus for good cause</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The judgment granting the motion for summary adjudication on the first cause of action is affirmed.
