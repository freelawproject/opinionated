Defendant\u2019s demurrer was sustained without leave to amend, and the action was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. On appeal, plaintiff claims that (1) her claim did not fall within the exclusive review provisions of the Medicare Act because it did not arise under the act, (2) the exclusive review provisions of the Medicare Act should not apply because Congress did not so intend and these provisions offer no remedy for her claim, and (3) the court abused its discretion in failing to grant her leave to amend her complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Defendant is a health maintenance organization which \u201carranges for the provision of\u2019 medical services to its \u201cSubscribers.\u201d Plaintiff was one of defendant\u2019s \u201cSubscribers.\u201d The agreement between plaintiff and defendant required that \u201c[i]n determining whether a specific benefit is covered, [defendant] shall rely on Medicare guidelines . . . Plaintiff and defendant agreed that \u201cSubscriber complaints regarding reimbursement and coverage issues . . . shall be resolved by the HCFA [federal Health Care Financing Administration] Appeals procedure . . . .\u201d This procedure, which was set forth in the parties\u2019 agreement, required the \u201cSubscriber\u201d to make a written request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for \u201cReconsideration\u201d of an adverse coverage determination within 60 days after the initial denial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If reconsideration was denied, defendant was required to submit the dispute to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for review. The HCFA\u2019s determination could be appealed by either party to an administrative law judge. Either party could then seek review of the administrative law judge\u2019s determination by the \u201cAppeals Council.\u201d Under certain circumstances, a party could then obtain judicial review in a federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In May 1993, defendant denied coverage for \u201clife-saving surgery\u201d for plaintiff after she repeatedly requested a coverage determination prior to undergoing this surgery. Plaintiff underwent the surgery in June 1993 and incurred medical expenses for it. Defendant thereafter rejected plaintiff\u2019s demands for reimbursement of these expenses. In March 1994, defendant asked plaintiff to \u201cexecute a release of all claims against them\u201d in return for reimbursement. Plaintiff refused. Nevertheless, defendant subsequently reimbursed plaintiff for these medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Plaintiff filed an action against defendant for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in violation of Insurance Code section 790.03 and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. These causes of action were based on defendant\u2019s initial denial of her request for coverage and subsequent delayed reimbursement of her expenses. Plaintiff alleged that she had satisfied all of her obligations under the contract including filing a timely \u201crequest for reconsideration\u201d of defendant\u2019s rejection of her claim. She asserted that defendant had known that her claim was covered but had nevertheless initially rejected it and then delayed reimbursement. Plaintiff sought monetary damages for \u201closs of use\u201d of money she expended for medical expenses prior to reimbursement by defendant, emotional distress and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in obtaining reimbursement of these medical expenses from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Defendant filed a demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Defendant claimed that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff\u2019s claim was one \u201carising under\u201d the Medicare Act which was subject to an exclusive administrative review process and plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under this exclusive review process. Defendant also maintained that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because of \u201cplaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>non-joinder (defect)/misjoinder of parties.\u201d Plaintiff claimed that she was not required to utilize the Medicare Act\u2019s review process because her action \u201cis not a coverage or reimbursement case\u201d but \u201ca bad faith case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The court granted defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend. \u201c[Defendant\u2019s demurrer is] sustained without leave to amend on the ground that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Plaintiff\u2019s tort and contract claims are \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the denial of Medicare benefits and are therefore subject to the administrative procedures mandated by the Medicare Act. <em>(Bodimetric Health Services </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. </em>(7th Cir. 1990) 903 F.2d 480; 42 U.S.C. \u00a71395 et seq.; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7417.600 et seq.) Further, the face of the complaint reveals that plaintiff has failed to join the proper defendant, the Secretary of [Health and Human Services], actions against whom must be brought in federal court. (CCP \u00a7430.10(d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7405(g).)\u201d Judgment was entered in defendant\u2019s favor, and plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u201cWhen a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. . . . And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. . . . The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">B. <em>No Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether plaintiff\u2019s causes of action were based on a claim which was subject to the exclusive review provisions of the Medicare Act. Federal law specifies the services which health maintenance organizations such as defendant must provide to Medicare-eligible members such as plaintiff who are enrolled in Medicare-subsidized health care plans. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm.) The authority to determine whether certain services are covered by such a plan has been vested by Congress in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe determination of whether an individual is entitled to benefits . . . and the determination of the amount of benefits . . . , <em>and any other determination with respect to a claim for benefits . . . </em>shall be made by the Secretary [of Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>and Human Services] in accordance with regulations prescribed by him.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(a), italics added.) \u201cIf the Secretary determines that an eligible organization with a contract under this section ...[*][]... fails substantially to provide medically necessary items and services that are required (under law or under the contract).... if the failure has adversely affected (or has substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) the individual ... [^11 ... [^D the Secretary may provide, in addition to any other remedies authorized by law, for [civil money penalties, suspension of enrollment of individuals or suspension of payment to the organization].\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395mm(i)(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">A claim which \u201carises under\u201d the Medicare Act must be brought before the Secretary through a multilevel administrative review process. This administrative review process (which was expressly set forth in the contract between plaintiff and defendant) provides the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy for such claims. (Sen.Rep. No. 404, 89th Congress, 1st Sess., (1965) reprinted in 1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 1995.) <em>Judicial </em>review of such claims is available only after the claimant has pressed the claim through every level of the administrative review process to a \u201cfinal\u201d decision by the Secretary and even then such review may only be obtained in <em>federal </em>court. <em>(Heckler </em>v. <em>Ringer </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 602, 605-606 [104 S.Ct. 2013, 2106-2017, 80 L.Ed.2d 622].) It follows that such claims are never within the jurisdiction of a state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The trial court herein concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because plaintiff\u2019s causes of action were claims arising under the Medicare Act. Plaintiff maintains that the trial court was incorrect because (1) her causes of action are state law causes of action based on her contract with defendant rather than on the Medicare Act, (2) her causes of action are not a claim for benefits but a claim for \u201cinjuries\u201d she suffered as a result of the delay and costs incurred in her successful pursuit of reimbursement for her medical expenses, and (3) Congress did not intend to preclude state actions such as hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">First, the fact that plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are based on her contractual relationship with defendant does not mean that her claims did not arise under the Medicare Act. Plaintiff\u2019s contract with defendant expressly specified that coverage determinations would be based on the Medicare Act. Moreover, the contract explicitly required that all \u201c[subscriber complaints regarding reimbursement and coverage issues\u201d be resolved through the multilevel administrative review process specified in the Medicare Act. Plaintiff may choose to characterize her complaints as contractually based causes of action, but her claims are necessarily \u201ccomplaints regarding reimbursement.\u201d Her action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>is based on allegations that defendant initially wrongfully denied coverage for her surgery and then wrongfully delayed its reimbursement of her expenses for the surgery. Under the contract, such claims must be resolved under the administrative review process specified in the Medicare Act, and therefore these claims arise under the Medicare Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Second, while plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are not actually a claim for benefits, since she has already obtained reimbursement of her medical expenses, her causes of action <em>are </em>\u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a claim that she was entitled to the reimbursement she received. Plaintiff argues that her complaint was not based on her entitlement to benefits but on defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d with respect to her claim for benefits. This argument fails because the alleged wrongfulness of defendant\u2019s conduct depends on whether plaintiff was entitled to payment of her claim. The fact that defendant ultimately paid her claim does not necessarily establish that plaintiff was <em>entitled </em>to such payment. The United States Supreme Court considered a related contention in <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Ringer, supra, </em>466 U.S. 602 (hereafter <em>Ringer). </em>Three of the four plaintiffs in <em>Ringer </em>had undergone a surgical procedure known as \u201cBCBR\u201d and then filed a claim for reimbursement. The fourth plaintiff had not undergone the BCBR procedure yet because he had learned that the procedure was not covered. None of the four plaintiffs had exhausted their administrative remedies under the administrative review procedure specified in the Medicare Act. They claimed that they were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies because other claimants who had pursued their administrative remedies had succeeded in obtaining payment of their reimbursement claims for BCBR surgery. <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>at p. 610 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2019].) The plaintiffs argued that requiring them to pursue administrative remedies in order to obtain reimbursement violated their constitutional and statutory rights. Like plaintiff herein, they did not seek benefits in their action. Instead, they sought a declaration that BCBR surgery was covered under the act and an injunction requiring payment of BCBR claims without the necessity of pursuing administrative remedies. <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>at pp. 610-611 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2019].) The United States Supreme Court asserted that \u201c[i]t is of no importance that respondents here . . . sought only declaratory and injunctive relief and not an actual award of benefits as well.\u201d <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>at p. 615 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2022].) Their claims still were <em>essentially </em>claims for benefits subject to the requirement that they exhaust the administrative review procedures. As the claims arose under the Act and the plaintiffs had not fully exhausted their administrative remedies, judicial review was unavailable. <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>at pp. 615-619 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2021-2024].)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Ringer. </em>She points out that the remedy sought by the plaintiffs in <em>Ringer </em>was, in substance, a coverage determination. Plaintiff argues that the administrative review process provides a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>remedy for adverse coverage determinations, but it does not provide a remedy for wrongful denial and delay in paying a claim. We disagree. The administrative review process applies not only to coverage determinations but also to \u201cany other determination <em>with respect to </em>a claim for benefits,\u201d and the Secretary is authorized to order civil money penalties or \u201cany other remedies authorized by law\u201d if an organization such as defendant fails to provide required services. If plaintiff had pressed her claim through the administrative review process and established that defendant initially wrongfully denied coverage, the Secretary could have found that defendant had failed to provide required services. The Secretary would then have been authorized to remediate the harm which arose from this conduct prior to defendant\u2019s ultimate reimbursement of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Plaintiff\u2019s contention that she had been injured by defendant\u2019s initial denial and subsequent delayed payment of her claim was a claim which the Secretary was authorized to resolve because it required a determination \u201cwith respect to [her] claim for benefits.\u201d We believe that plaintiff could have pursued her claim through the administrative process. While her claim might have been unsuccessful, such speculation does not excuse her failure to exhaust the required administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Plaintiff relies on a recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in which the court held that a wrongful death cause of action arising from an organization\u2019s denial of Medicare benefits could be brought in state court and did not require exhaustion of the Act\u2019s administrative review process because the action was not based on the Medicare Act and did not seek to recover benefits. <em>(Ardary </em>v. <em>Aetna Health Plans of California, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 98 F.3d 496 <em>(Ardary.) </em>We find <em>Ardary </em>distinguishable. In <em>Ardary, </em>the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the United States Supreme Court had mandated in <em>Ringer </em>that the scope of the claims to which the administrative review process applied should be interpreted \u201cbroadly.\u201d <em>(Ardary, supra, </em>at p. 500.) However, the Ninth Circuit relied on a narrow exception carved out by the United States Supreme Court which permitted the exclusion of \u201ccertain special cases\u201d from the requirement that the claim be pursued \u201cthrough administrative channels\u201d where these \u201cspecial\u201d cases involved claims that could not be remediated through the administrative process. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since the death of the health plan beneficiary in <em>Ardary </em>could not be remediated through pursuit of a posthumous coverage or benefits claim through the administrative process, the Ninth Circuit held that the administrative review process was inapplicable to the wrongful death cause of action. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hence, the claim could be brought in state court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 500-501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Whether or not we agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s resolution of the issue posed in <em>Ardary, </em>Ardary\u2019s holding is not applicable here. This case, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Ardary, </em>does not involve a claim which is so \u201cspecial\u201d that it could not have been remediated by pursuit of the claim through the administrative review process. Delays in reimbursement of claims are commonplace, and the injuries allegedly suffered by plaintiff are not so \u201cspecial\u201d that she falls within the narrow exception to the otherwise universal requirement that the administrative review process must be pursued prior to any judicial review. Unlike the beneficiary in <em>Ardary, </em>plaintiff had the distinct advantage of obtaining payment of her benefits claim without having had to avail herself of the lengthy administrative review process. The exceptional circumstances present in <em>Ardary </em>are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Plaintiff also claims that she <em>did </em>exhaust her adminstrative remedies. This assertion leads nowhere. Even if plaintiff had pursued her administrative remedies to a final decision by the Secretary, her only avenue of judicial review would be in federal court. A state trial court would still lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Finally, we do not agree with plaintiff that Congress did not intend to preclude actions like hers. In <em>Ringer, </em>the court recognized that the administrative process required a claimant to undergo the medical procedure and then press his or her reimbursement claim through multiple levels of administrative review. <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 621-622 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2025].) However, the court found that Congress had <em>intended </em>to require a claimant to pursue a potentially lengthy administrative process in order to obtain reimbursement and that this process was an adequate remedy. <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>at p. 617 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2022-2023].) The court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they should be excused from the exhaustion requirement because other claimants who had undergone the same surgical procedure had successfully pursued their claims through the administrative process. <em>(Ringer, supra, </em>at p. 624 [104 S.Ct. at 2026].) If Congress believed that requiring claimants to pursue a lengthy administrative review process to obtain reimbursement of their claims was an adequate remedy, it is inconceivable that it intended to permit claimants who had <em>not </em>availed themselves of this process to obtain <em>judicial </em>review in <em>state </em>courts of their claims that they were entitled to recover for the delay and costs incurred during their <em>successful </em>attempts to obtain payment of their claims <em>outside </em>of the administrative review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The trial court lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s action, so it did not err in granting defendant\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">C. <em>Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Failing to Grant Leave to Amend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s final assertion is that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant her leave to amend her complaint. She claims that she could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>have amended her complaint to \u201cshow that her claims were not subject to the [Medicare] Act\u201d if she had added an allegation that defendant \u201chad prevented her access to HCFA and the federally mandated hearing and review procedures . . . Plaintiff claims that such an amendment would \u201cclarify the common-law nature of her cause of action, and negate any argument that administrative remedies would be applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u201c[D]enial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion if the pleading does not show on its face that it is incapable of amendment.\u201d <em>(Gami </em>v. <em>Mullikin Medical Center </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 877 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 819].) \u201c \u2018Generally it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. . . . However, the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion. . . . Plaintiff must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [134 Cal.Rptr. 375, 556 P.2d 737], citations omitted.) \u201c \u2018Leave to amend should be denied where the facts are not in dispute, and the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is clear, but, under the substantive law, no liability exists.\u2019\u201d <em>(Kilgore </em>v. <em>Younger </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 770, 781 [180 Cal.Rptr. 657, 640 P.2d 793].)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On its face, plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not appear amenable to an amendment that would bring it within the jurisdiction of the trial court. The injuries which her complaint seeks to remediate are the delay and distress caused by defendant\u2019s initial denial of coverage and subsequent delayed payment of her claim for reimbursement of medical expenses. She claimed that this conduct was a breach of their agreement and inflicted emotional distress. Now she asserts that these allegations would have constituted a viable cause of action over which the court would have had jurisdiction if she had also alleged that defendant had prevented her from pursuing her administrative remedies. Plaintiff has repeatedly and insistently argued that she was not required to pursue administrative remedies, and she has never alleged that she attempted to pursue administrative remedies for the injuries upon which her action is based. At most, she impliedly asserted that she had attempted to pursue administrative review of her reimbursement claim prior to defendant\u2019s reimbursement of her expenses. Under these circumstances, it is our conclusion that there is no reasonable possibility that plaintiff could amend her complaint to allege that the conduct upon which she based her action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>formed the basis for one or more causes of action over which the trial court had jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It follows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Cottle, P.
