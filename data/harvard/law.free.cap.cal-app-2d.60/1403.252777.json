The amount included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the victim to secure a civil settlement from appellant\u2019s insurance carrier. Because appellant failed to demonstrate the amount of fees was unreasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">Appellant was in a traffic collision while driving with a blood-alcohol level of .19 percent. His car spun out of control and hit a car driven by Jonathan Richards, who was injured as a result. Richards retained counsel and received a civil settlement of $22,000 for claims arising from the collision. The settlement was paid by appellant\u2019s insurance carrier and compensated Richards for lost wages, medical bills, and property damage to his car. Of the settlement, $7,333 was paid to Richard\u2019s attorney as a contingency fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">Appellant pled no contest to one count of driving under the influence and causing injury. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a).) He was placed on probation and ordered to pay direct victim restitution to Richards under Penal Code former section 1202.4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The restitution amount included $7,000 for the contingency fee paid to Richards\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The California Constitution provides, \u201cIt is the unequivocal intention of the People of the State of California that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b).)  Restitution has long been considered a valid condition of probation because of its rehabilitative value. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carbajal </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1114, 1121 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 681, 899 P.2d 67].) In felony cases where probation is granted, the court must order direct victim restitution in \u201cevery case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see also \u00a7\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a), 1203.1, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">Appellant first argues the restitution order was improper because the contingency fee did not arise from the criminal prosecution. The test is not whether the victim\u2019s legal fees arose directly from the criminal case, but whether they were a \u201cdetermined economic loss incurred as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (g).) Appellant\u2019s drinking and driving directly caused the lost wages, medical bills and property damage covered by the settlement. The legal expense incurred by the victim to recover these damages from appellant\u2019s insurance carrier was \u201cproper, necessary, and a logical result of appellant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lyon </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1521,1525-1526 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 415]; see also \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(G), added by Stats. 1996, ch. 629, \u00a7 3 [recoverable economic losses include \u201cActual and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs of collection accrued by a private entity on behalf of the victim\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Appellant argued at the sentencing hearing that it was improper to award the entire contingency fee amount because some of the settlement was attributable to noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering, which may not be ordered as direct victim restitution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fritchey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 829, 841 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 585]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vega-Hernandez </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1084, 1091, 1096-1097 [225 Cal.Rptr. 209].) But he failed to demonstrate that the settlement was based on anything other than economic losses and has not renewed this issue on appeal. We need not and do not decide whether attorney\u2019s fees attributable to the recovery of noneconomic damages are allowable under section 1202.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">Appellant next claims the restitution order results in double payment to the victim. He is mistaken because there is no evidence the insurance company paid the victim\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The victim received a settlement which presumably compensated him for damages actually arising from the collision. Nothing in the record suggests this amount was increased to cover attorney\u2019s fees, and the victim suffered a loss to the extent he had to pay part of his settlement to his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Appellant finally claims the probation officer lacked sufficient information to determine whether the attorney\u2019s fees were reasonable. The amount of fees due under a contingency fee agreement may be unreasonable in light of the work actually performed (see, e.g., <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Yuki </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1754, 1769-1771 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 616]), but appellant presented no evidence at the sentencing hearing to show the contingency fee was disproportionate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">When the probation report includes a discussion of the victim\u2019s loss and a recommendation on the amount of restitution, the defendant must come forward with contrary information to challenge that amount. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1153, 1160-1161 [261 Cal.Rptr. 93].)  Here the probation report recommended payment of $7,000 for attorney\u2019s fees, and it was up to appellant to demonstrate this amount was unreasonable. Appellant\u2019s trial attorney informed the court the victim\u2019s civil case had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>settled before a lawsuit was filed, but presented no information about the work actually performed in that matter. On the record before us we have no basis for finding the contingency fee unreasonable. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by following the probation officer\u2019s recommendation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 791, 800 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 66].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">Gilbert, Acting P.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to section 1202.4 are to the version of that statute effective on the date of appellant\u2019s offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
