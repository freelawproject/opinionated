J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK\">The People of the State of California (the People) petition this court for a writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its order declaring defendant and real party in interest Alonzo Blakely\u2019s (Blakely) diagnosis of \u201cAxis II antisocial personality disorder\u201d as a matter of law does not qualify as a \u201cmental disease, defect, or disorder\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 1026.5, subdivision (b)(1). The People seek to mandate the trial court to proceed to trial on their petition for extended commitment of Blakely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The People\u2019s petition is meritorious because the trial court\u2019s order was erroneous. Whether a defendant \u201cby reason of a mental disease, defect, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>disorder represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others\u201d under section 1026.5 is a question of fact to be resolved with the assistance of expert testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Williams) (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 477, 489-491 [284 Cal.Rptr. 601].) Therefore, the question of whether a diagnosis of Axis II antisocial personality disorder qualifies as such a mental condition under section 1026.5 is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Further, the trial court\u2019s ruling the lack of effective treatment for Blakely\u2019s mental condition precludes any extended commitment under section 1026.5 also is contrary to law. The state is not obligated to release confined individuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous \u201csimply because they could not be successfully treated for their afflictions. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. _, _ [117 S.Ct. 2072, 2084, 138 L.Ed.2d 501, 518].) Therefore, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Evidence adduced at a preliminary hearing indicated that on or about January 31, 1987, Blakely injured his wife and mother-in-law by stabbing them with a large pair of scissors.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>On March 20, 1990, Blakely, as part of a plea bargain, pled guilty to charges of inflicting corporal injury upon his spouse and assaulting his mother-in-law. He admitted a deadly weapon use allegation and that he had been convicted previously of a serious felony. The issue of his sanity was submitted on the reports of various doctors. Blakely was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Pursuant to section 1026, the trial court ordered Blakely confined by the Department of Mental Health. The maximum term of confinement was computed to conclude on January 16, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In August of 1996, the Department of Mental Health requested the District Attorney of Los Angeles County to file a petition for extension of Blakely\u2019s commitment, based on a determination by the treatment staff at Atascadero State Hospital (Atascadero) that Blakely represented a substantial danger of physical harm to others by reason of a mental disease, defect or disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On October 18, 1996, the People filed a petition to extend Blakely\u2019s commitment pursuant to section 1026.5, subdivision (b). That section provides a person who committed a felony and is confined to a treatment facility may be recommitted for an additional two-year period, if the person \u201cby reason of a mental disease, defect, or disorder represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others.\u201d (\u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(1).) The People\u2019s petition was supported by a psychiatric evaluation, as well as an affidavit from the medical director at Atascadero, stating Blakely required an extension of commitment in that his mental condition rendered him dangerous to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">1. <em>The \u201cpretrial\u201d motion and hearing thereon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Blakely brought a \u201cpretrial\u201d motion, purportedly under Evidence Code section 402, requesting the trial court to determine whether his diagnosis of Axis II antisocial personality disorder constitutes a mental disease, defect or disorder within the meaning of section 1026.5. The trial court proceeded to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the significance of said diagnosis and received expert testimony on the issue. It was stipulated Blakely has a disorder which is characterized as an antisocial personality disorder within the criteria set forth in the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994) or DSM-IV, section 301.7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Ronald Markman, M.D., J.D., a forensic psychiatrist called by Blakely, expressed no opinion as to whether Blakely suffers from a mental disease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>defect or disorder within the meaning of section 1026.5, in that \u201cthe terms \u2018mental disease,\u2019 \u2018disorder,\u2019 and \u2018defect\u2019 don\u2019t correspond to the same terms in psychiatry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">However, Markman opined that under <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 71 [112 S.Ct. 1780, 118 L.Ed.2d 437], a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is insufficient to maintain continued confinement of an individual. Markman further testified there is no effective treatment for antisocial personality disorder other than incarceration. According to Mark-man, Blakely \u201chad achieved maximum hospital benefits and . . . there was no basis for further hospitalization other than for incarceration purposes.\u201d With respect to whether Blakely, age 42, poses a danger to others, Markman opined \u201c[t]he antisocial personality, as ... he or she gets older, is less prone to acting out and violent manners, although the risk is still there.\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In turn, Kaushal Sharma, M.D., the People\u2019s expert, opined antisocial personality disorder does not qualify as a disease, but it is a disorder, albeit an untreatable one. Therefore, if Blakely remained in a psychiatric hospital \u201cthere would be an attempt at treatment because if he\u2019s in a hospital setting, I believe they are at least psychiatrically and morally required to provide some treatment. But overall, in my opinion, treatment would be a sham. I think it would be really warehousing him and trying to change his behavior with little or no success and hoping that somehow something will change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">2. <em>Trial court\u2019s ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">After hearing from the above witnesses and receiving oral argument by counsel, the trial court granted Blakely\u2019s motion. It stated: \u201cUntil the Supreme Court either of the United States or California rules differently, it\u2019s this Court\u2019s view preventive detention ... is the exception, not the rule in this country.\u201d Then, the trial court erroneously equated the standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>insanity with the standard for an extension of commitment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> stating: \u201c[I]f preventive detention is the exception and antisocial personality disorder is not the kind of disorder which would justify a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, then it seems to the Court that an antisocial personality disorder does not fulfill the criteria of mental disease, defect, or disorder as used in section 1026.5(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Thereafter, as explained below, the trial court misread <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. 71, as stating the proposition a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for commitment. The trial court acknowledged <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Williams), supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at page 490, had held an antisocial personality disorder represents a mental disorder within the meaning of section 1026.5. However, the trial court found <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. 71, is overriding authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The trial court further observed \u201c[t]he duration of commitment in this case is potentially a lifetime commitment renewable every two years. It\u2019s clear from the testimony in this court that the disorder which Mr. Blakely is diagnosed with is essentially not successfully treatable by current methods of treatment, and that unless the courts are willing to say that preventive detention for purposes of protecting society constitutes a sufficient constitutional basis for continued confinement, it\u2019s this court\u2019s view antisocial personality disorder, in and of itself, cannot fulfill the criteria of a . . . \u2018disorder,\u2019 ... as used ... in [section] 1026.5(b).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The trial court subsequently attempted to clarify its ruling in a written order to the effect it had not made an \u201cevidentiary ruling regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Petition, but rather a pretrial ruling on [an] issue of law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court further determined the \u201cPeople are unable to proceed on this matter at this time as a result of court\u2019s finding . . . and that [the] People have no other basis for the extension [of commitment].\u201d The trial court then stayed Blakely\u2019s release pending the completion of appellate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">3. <em>Subsequent proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The People filed the instant petition to obtain review of the trial court\u2019s order. They seek a trial to establish that by reason of a mental disease, defect or disorder, namely, antisocial personality disorder, Blakely represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others. (\u00a7 1026.5.) We issued an alternative writ.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The People contend a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder amounts to a mental disease, defect or disorder within the meaning of section 1026.5, subdivision (b), and therefore, if a person by reason of such mental condition represents a substantial danger of harm to others, the person may be recommitted under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">1. <em>General principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\"><em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. __ [117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501], the latest pronouncement by the United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>concerning <em>civil </em>commitment of the dangerously mentally ill, has illuminated this evolving area of the law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">It now is settled \u201c[t]he State may take measures to restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill. This is a legitimate non-punitive governmental objective and has been historically so regarded. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. __ [117 S.Ct. at p. 2083, 138 L.Ed.2d at p. 516].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u201cAlthough freedom from physical restraint \u2018has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental action,\u2019 <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71, 80 ... , that liberty interest is not absolute. . . . \u2018. . . There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis organized society could not exist with safety to its members.\u2019 <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>197 U.S. 11, 26 . . . (1905). Accordingly, States have in certain narrow circumstances provided for the forcible civil detainment of people who are unable to control their behavior and who thereby pose a danger to the public health and safety. [Citations.] [The United States Supreme Court has] consistently upheld such involuntary commitment statutes provided the confinement takes place pursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. __ [117 S.Ct. at p. 2079, 138 L.Ed.2d at pp. 511-512].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">A \u201cfinding of dangerousness, standing alone, is ordinarily not a sufficient ground upon which to justify indefinite involuntary commitment. [The United States Supreme Court has] sustained civil commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor, such as a \u2018mental illness\u2019 or \u2018mental abnormality.\u2019 [Citations.] These added statutory requirements serve to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.\u201d <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. __ [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080, 138 L.Ed.2d at pp. 512-513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">California\u2019s statutory scheme embraces these dual criteria. Section 1026.5, subdivision (b), provides for an extension of commitment only if \u201cby reason of a mental disease, defect, or disorder [the person] represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>2. <em>The trial court erred in holding antisocial personality disorder, as a matter of law, does not amount to a mental disease, defect, or disorder within the meaning of section 1026.5, subdivision (b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The trial court ruled that despite <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Williams), supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at page 490, which concluded \u201ca . . . diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder may be substantial evidence of a mental disorder under . . . section 1026.5,\u201d it felt constrained by <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. 71, to hold such a disorder does not qualify as a mental condition for purposes of the statute. The trial court erred in that <em>Foucha </em>does not compel such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">By way of background, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Williams), supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 477, on a petition by the People for an extension of commitment, the lower court granted nonsuit, determining that, \u201cas a matter of law, an antisocial personality disorder is not a mental disorder within the meaning of . . . section 1026.5. In arriving at this decision, the [lower] court relied on <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>[(1983)] 35 Cal.3d 329 [197 Cal.Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680], which held that an antisocial personality disorder is not, as a matter of law, a mental disease or defect for purposes of the sanity phase of a trial. . . . The [lower] court also based its determination on the conclusion that the same criteria used to determine whether an individual is not guilty by reason of insanity should be used to determine if that individual is dangerous for purposes of extension proceedings.\u201d <em>(Williams, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 489.) The People filed a petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>Williams </em>granted the petition, holding, inter alia, \u201cAn individual is subject to extension of his or her commitment to a state hospital where, by reason of a mental disease, defect, or disorder, he or she represents a substantial danger of physical harm to others. [Citation.] The test for extension of commitment is not the same as the test for insanity. . . . [&lt;][] [Defendant\u2019s] contention that a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is insufficient as a matter of law to support an extension is clearly without merit. First, an antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder within the meaning of . . . section 1026.5. Second, the DSM III-R contains a detailed set of diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>disorder is identified by criteria other than repeated criminal and antisocial behaviors. It includes anger, unstable moods, impulsiveness, lack of remorse, inability to empathize with others, and limited frustration tolerance. Finally, all psychotherapists who testified stated that, in their opinion, [defendant] suffered from a mental disorder which caused him to be a substantial risk of harm to others. This evidence was sufficient to support a jury finding of dangerousness caused by mental disorder. <em>The [lower] court erred in removing the issue of [defendant\u2019s] mental disorder and dangerousness from the jury. </em>. . . HQ <em>We conclude that a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder may he substantial evidence of a mental disorder under . . . section 1026.5, </em>where the diagnosis is based on criteria in addition to repeated criminal or antisocial behavior.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Williams), supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 490-491, italics ours, original italics deleted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The following year, in <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. 71, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional a Louisiana law \u201cwhich permitted] the indefinite detention of insanity acquitees who are not mentally ill but who do not prove they would not be dangerous to others. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 83 [112 S.Ct. at p. 1787].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In summarizing the evidence, <em>Foucha </em>stated, \u201c[h]ere, according to the testimony given at the hearing in the [lower] court, Foucha is <em>not </em>suffering from a mental disease or illness.\u201d <em>(Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 79 [112 S.Ct. at p. 1785], italics added.) Therefore, Louisiana did <em>\u201cnot </em>contend that Foucha was mentally ill at the time of the trial court\u2019s hearing.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 78 [112 S.Ct. at p. 1784], italics added.) Instead, Louisiana sought \u201cto perpetuate Foucha\u2019s confinement [at a mental institution] on the basis of his antisocial personality which, as evidenced by his conduct at the facility, the [lower] court found rendered him a danger to himself or others.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Louisiana \u201cclaim[ed] that it may continue to confine Foucha, who is <em>not </em>now considered to be mentally ill, solely because he is deemed dangerous, but without assuming the burden of proving even this ground for confinement by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 86 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 1788-1789], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"><em>Foucha </em>found \u201cat least three difficulties with this position. First, even if his continued confinement were constitutionally permissible, keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Foucha against his will in a mental institution is improper absent a determination in civil commitment proceedings of <em>current </em>mental illness and dangerousness. . . . <em>Here, according to the testimony given at the hearing in the [lower] court, Foucha is not suffering from a mental disease or illness. </em>If he is to be held, he should not be held as a mentally ill person. [Citations.] [*]Q Second, if Foucha can no longer be held as an insanity acquittee in a mental hospital, he is entitled to constitutionally adequate procedures to establish the grounds for his confinement. ... ['ID Third, \u2018the Due Process Clause contains a substantive component that bars certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions, \u201cregardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. at pp. 78-80 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 1784-1785], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In sum, in <em>Foucha </em>\u201cthe State [did] not claim that Foucha [was] now mentally ill\u201d <em>(Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 80 [112 S.Ct. at p. 1986]), only that he had an \u201cantisocial personality.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 78 [112 S.Ct. at p. 1784].) Therefore, <em>Foucha </em>does not address whether a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder may constitute a mental disorder for purposes of an extended commitment. Hence, the trial court erred here in ruling as a matter of law that defendant Foucha\u2019s \u201cantisocial personality\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>which the evidence therein showed was <em>not </em>a mental disease <em>(id., </em>at p. 75 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 1782-1783]), is synonymous with Blakely\u2019s psychiatric diagnosis of Axis II antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">It is \u201caxiomatic, of course, that a decision does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 250, 265, fn. 5 [233 Cal.Rptr. 264, 729 P.2d 698]; <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1071 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619].) Consequently, <em>Foucha </em>does not stand for the proposition a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as a matter of law is insufficient to warrant an extended commitment. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s reading of <em>Foucha </em>was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Accordingly, the issue of whether Blakely suffers from a mental disease, disorder or defect which renders him a danger to others (\u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(1)) is not a question of law, but rather one for the trier of fact to be resolved with the assistance of expert testimony. (\u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(7); <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Williams), supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 489-491.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>3. <em>The lack of an effective treatment for Blakely\u2019s condition is not grounds for his release.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The next issue is the legal impact of the lack of any effective treatment for Blakely\u2019s diagnosed mental condition. <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S __ [117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501], readily resolves the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In making its ruling, the trial court herein observed Blakely\u2019s disorder \u201cis essentially not successfully treatable by current methods of treatment, and that unless the courts are willing to say that preventive detention for purposes of protecting society constitutes a sufficient constitutional basis for continued confinement, it\u2019s this court\u2019s view antisocial personality, in and of itself, cannot fulfill the criteria of a, quote, \u2018disorder,\u2019 ... as used ... in [section] 1026.5(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The trial court\u2019s ruling missed the mark. The law does not require release of one who is both mentally ill and dangerous merely because psychiatry has not yet developed an effective treatment for that individual\u2019s condition. California courts repeatedly have held amenability to treatment is not a condition of extending commitment pursuant to section 1026.5. <em>(People </em>v. Goff (1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 1039, 1046-1048 [179 Cal.Rptr. 190]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bennett </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 488, 494-496 [182 Cal.Rptr. 473]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Buttes </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 116, 120-124 [184 Cal.Rptr. 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Further, as noted, <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. __ [117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501], also speaks to the issue. \u201c[U]nder the appropriate circumstances and when accompanied by proper procedures, incapacitation may be a legitimate end of the civil law. [Citation.] . . . While we have upheld state civil commitment statutes that aim both to incapacitate and to treat, [citation], <em>we have never held that the Constitution prevents a State from civilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available, but who nevertheless pose a danger to others. </em>A State could hardly be seen as furthering a \u2018punitive\u2019 purpose by involuntarily confining persons afflicted with an untreatable, highly contagious disease. Accord <em>Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur </em>v <em>Louisiana Bd. of Health, </em>186 US 380 [22 S.Ct. 811, 46 L.Ed. 1209] (1902) (permitting involuntary quarantine of persons suffering from communicable diseases). Similarly, it would be of little value to require treatment as a precondition for civil confinement of the dangerously insane when no acceptable treatment existed. To conclude otherwise would obligate a State to release certain confined individuals who were both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>mentally ill and dangerous simply because they could not be successfully treated for their afflictions. Cf. <em>Greenwood </em>v <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 366, 375 [76 S.Ct. 410, 100 L.Ed. 412], (1956) (\u2018The fact that at present there may be little likelihood of recovery does not defeat federal power to make this initial commitment of the petitioner\u2019); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v <em>Donaldson, </em>422 U.S. 563, 584 [95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396], (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring) (\u2018[I]t remains a stubborn fact that there are many forms of mental illness which are not understood, some [of] which are unbeatable in the sense that no effective therapy has yet been discovered for them, and that rates of \u201ccure\u201d are generally low\u2019).\u2019\u2019 <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. __ [117 S.Ct. at p. 2084, 138 L.Ed.2d at pp. 517-518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Accordingly, Blakely\u2019s lack of amenability to beatment does not preclude an extension of his commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">4. <em>The task of the trier of fact on remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the People are entitled to a trial on their petition for extended commitment of Blakely.  The issues of whether Blakely\u2019s diagnosis of Axis II antisocial personality disorder amounts to a mental disease, defect or disorder, and whether by reason of such mental condition, Blakely poses a substantial danger of physical harm to others, are to be resolved by the trier of fact. (\u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Williams), supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">\u201cWhether the individual is mentally ill and dangerous to . . . others and is in need of confined therapy turns on the meaning of the facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiabists and psychologists.\u201d <em>(Addington </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 418, 429 [99 S.Ct. 1804, 1811, 60 L.Ed.2d 323], italics deleted.) Consistent therewith, the instant statutory scheme contemplates that in said proceeding, the trier of fact shall be aided by the expert testimony of psychologists or psychiatrists. (\u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(7).) Other relevant evidence bearing on the issues of Blakely\u2019s mental disorder and dangerousness may include, inter alia, previous instances of violent behavior <em>(Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. __ [117 S.Ct. at pp. 2079-2080,138 L.Ed.2d at p. 512]), as well as the determination of the beatment staff at Atascadero, Blakely\u2019s behavior at that facility and psychiatric evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">5. <em>The People\u2019s burden of proof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">To guide the trial court on remand (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 43), we also address the People\u2019s burden of proof under section 1026.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">The United States Supreme Court repeatedly has held due process requires the state in a civil commitment proceeding to demonsbate by <em>clear and convincing evidence </em>that the person is mentally ill and dangerous. <em>(Addington </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>441 U.S. at pp. 425-433 [99 S.Ct. at pp. 1808-1813]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 354, 362 [103 S.Ct. 3043, 3048, 77 L.Ed.2d 694]; <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>504 U.S. at p. 80 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 1785-1786].) However, the states are not precluded from adopting a more stringent standard of proof. <em>(Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>at pp. 430-431 [99 S.Ct. at pp. 1811-1812].)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">California courts have construed section 1026.5 as imposing upon the state the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>People </em>v. <em>Buttes, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d at page 125, holds \u201cthe burden of proof is placed on the prosecution to prove <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>the two conditions required for an extended commitment,\u201d i.e. mental illness and dangerousness. (Italics added.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilder </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 90, 98 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 247], is in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Section 1026.5 has been amended no less than four times\u2014in 1984, 1985, 1991 and 1994\u2014since the <em>Buttes </em>court held the standard of proof in extension proceedings is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201c \u2018[statutes are to be interpreted by assuming that the Legislature was aware of the existing judicial decisions. [Citation.] Moreover, failure to make changes in a given statute in a particular respect when the subject is before the Legislature, and changes are made in other respects, is indicative of an intention to leave the law unchanged in that respect.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 56, 65 [81 Cal.Rptr. 465, 460 P.2d 137].) Thus, <em>Buttes </em>is still the governing law on this point in view of the Legislature\u2019s inaction with respect to the <em>Buttes </em>interpretation of section 1026.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Also relevant here is Welfare and Institutions Code section 6604, pertaining to the extended commitment of sexually violent predators. With respect to the People\u2019s burden of proof, that statute provides: \u201cThe court or jury shall determine whether, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>the person is a sexually violent predator. If the court or jury is not satisfied <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that the person is a sexually violent predator, the court shall direct that the person be released at the conclusion of the term for which he or she was initially sentenced, or that the person be unconditionally released at the end of parole, whichever is applicable. If the court or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, the person shall be committed for two years to the custody of the State Department of Mental Health for appropriate treatment and confinement in a secure facility . . . and the person shall not be kept in actual custody longer than two years unless a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>extended commitment is obtained from the court incident to the filing of a new petition for commitment under this article or unless the term of commitment changes pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 6605.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604, italics added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Thus, the statutory scheme governing the extended commitment of sexually violent predators (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.) is analogous to the extended commitment of the dangerous mentally ill pursuant to section 1026.5. Where \u201cpersonal liberty is at stake, ... the applicable standard for measuring the validity of the statutory scheme . . . requires application of the strict scrutiny standard of equal protection analysis.\u201d <em>(In re Moye </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 457, 465 [149 Cal.Rptr. 491, 584 P.2d 1097].) Accordingly, there must be a \u201c \u2018compelling interest\u2019 \u201d to justify a lower standard of proof for extended commitment under section 1026.5 than under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6604. <em>(In re Moye, supra, </em>at p. 465.) There is no conceivable basis for requiring a lesser showing by the People for the extended commitment of the dangerous mentally ill than for the extended commitment of sexually violent predators.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Accordingly, to obtain an extended commitment under section 1026.5, the People are required to meet the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The alternative writ having served its purpose is discharged. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent superior court to vacate its pretrial order declaring Blakely\u2019s diagnosis as a matter of law does not qualify as a mental disease, defect or disorder under section 1026.5, subdivision (b)(1), and to proceed to trial on the People\u2019s petition for extended commitment, guided by the principles set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Croskey, J., and Kitching, J., concurred</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 1, 1998.
