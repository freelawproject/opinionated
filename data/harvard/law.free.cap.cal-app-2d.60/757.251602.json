J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABiq\">In this personal injury lawsuit arising from an automobile accident, the jury awarded the plaintiff substantial general damages, which was not in itself remarkable. What was unusual, however, was plaintiff\u2019s expert economist\u2019s testimony on \u201chedonic\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> damages, or damages to compensate for the loss of enjoyment of life. The expert told the jury the baseline value of an average person\u2019s remaining 44-year life expectancy is $2.3 million. He also explained that after adjusting the baseline value to account for the plaintiff\u2019s expected lifespan, the jury could calculate the plaintiff\u2019s hedonic damages by multiplying the percentage of the plaintiff\u2019s disability by the adjusted baseline figure. The admissibility of such testimony appears to be a question of first impression in California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We conclude the expert\u2019s testimony on hedonic damages was inadmissible as a matter of law and its admission was prejudicial. We reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">On June 29, 1994, plaintiff Shereen Loth was on a business trip driving north on Interstate 5. Plaintiff\u2019s small car was struck by a 24-wheel tractor-trailer rig owned by defendant Truck-A-Way Corporation. The collision occurred as plaintiff\u2019s car, which was in the slow lane, was passing on the truck\u2019s right. The truck made an unsafe lane change into plaintiff\u2019s lane, and its front end hit plaintiff\u2019s car\u2019s left rear. Plaintiff\u2019s car spun in front of the truck and was pushed sideways across three lanes of traffic. Plaintiff\u2019s car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>eventually separated from the truck, but was struck by another vehicle before it stopped on the shoulder, facing the wrong way.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Plaintiff walked away from the accident but her car was seriously damaged. She continued her trip in a rental car, but she had suffered a concussion, was disoriented, and was unable to handle her business affairs. (Plaintiff, a design school graduate, owns a small but growing business that manufactures and markets lingerie throughout California and in Las Vegas.) Plaintiff cut short her business trip and flew home.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Two days after the accident, plaintiff went to her doctor complaining of headaches, low back pain, and a stiff neck. Between July 1994 and March 1995, plaintiff saw five other doctors including a neurologist, a psychiatrist, and an orthopedic surgeon. She had disabling neck pain, headaches, severe low back pain, groin pain, and shooting pains down her legs. She received physical therapy which lessened her headaches, neck pain, and upper back pain, but failed to improve her low back pain, groin pain, and shooting pains down her left leg. A soft tissue injury specialist gave her cortisone shots in the lower back and sacroiliac joint, but she felt no lasting relief. She had six chiropractic sessions that were of no help. According to plaintiff\u2019s medical experts, she has exhausted her treatment options other than taking pain medications with dangerous potential side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Plaintiff sued Truck-A-Way and its employee driver for personal injuries, property damage, and lost earnings. Defendants conceded liability at trial, and the only issue for the jury was damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Plaintiff asked the jury for $208,479 in special damages, comprised of medical damages (past and future) of $27,635, temporary lost earnings of $147,675,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and property damage and miscellaneous expenses of $3,507. (Those figures do not total $208,479, but that is what the jury was told both orally and in writing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">As for pain and suffering, plaintiff asked for an unspecified amount of damages, including compensation for loss of enjoyment of life. Plaintiff, who was 27 when the accident occurred, was a star high school varsity athlete in volleyball, softball, and basketball. Before the accident, she worked 10- to 11-hour days (including a night shift as a cocktail waitress), played softball and volleyball 3 nights a week, and exercised at the gym every day. After the accident, she could not sit at a sewing machine for longer than an hour without pain, could not function as a cocktail waitress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>could not play organized sports, and could no longer water or snow ski, jog, or golf. Her social life, which had previously revolved around her athletic activities, was severely impaired. Driving a car now causes her jaw to hurt. To prevent her jaw from clenching, she must drive with her mouth agape. She has constant lower back pain that increases with activity and sometimes shoots down her leg. She had hoped to get married and have children, but her condition has made her fearful of having children and her \u201csexual spontaneity is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Over defendants\u2019 objection,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plaintiff\u2019s expert economist Stanley V. Smith testified he had computed the basic economic value of life (apart from one\u2019s earnings from employment). Smith relied upon three types of studies of: (1) the amount society is willing to pay<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> per capita on protective devices such as seat belts, smoke detectors, etc., (2) the risk premiums employers pay to induce workers to perform hazardous jobs, and (3) the cost/benefit analyses of federally mandated safety projects and programs. Based on those studies, Smith calculated the value of an average person\u2019s remaining 44-year life expectancy at $2.3 million, which he described as a baseline figure. Smith adjusted the baseline figure to account for plaintiff\u2019s longer than average remaining life expectancy of 53 years. He multiplied the adjusted baseline figure by various percentages reflecting plaintiff\u2019s possible degrees of disability to calculate various possible hedonic damage awards. For example, Smith told the jury that in plaintiff\u2019s case, a 33 percent loss of enjoyment would be worth $1,684,000, a 10 percent loss of enjoyment would be worth $510,000, and a 5 percent loss of enjoyment would be worth $255,000. Smith gave the jury a table to assist it in making its mathematical calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Defendants, having failed to prevail on their objections to Smith\u2019s testimony, offered no expert testimony to refute Smith\u2019s assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In closing argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel specifically referred to Smith\u2019s testimony, and pointed out the absence of conflicting expert testimony on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>formula for computing hedonic damages. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cNow I want you to compare the experts. Stan Smith testified. He wrote the book literally on this kind of damages. He\u2019s tops in his field. There\u2019s been no contradiction of anything that he said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Defendants\u2019 closing argument urged the jury to disregard plaintiff\u2019s claim of a lower back injury. Defense counsel conceded plaintiff had incurred a soft tissue injury to the neck and a concussion, but argued her other injuries were not related to the accident. As for pain and suffering damages, defense counsel argued that the jury needed no expert testimony to calculate an award. Counsel pointed out Smith\u2019s $2.3 million baseline figure did not take into account \u201cany unique personalities, likes, interests of any one of us. I think each one of us is a . . . distinct individual, and I think it\u2019s almost sacrilegious or almost impossible to place value on human life. That\u2019s going to be a tough job for you, and that\u2019s something that you are going to have to decide in this matter.\u201d Counsel urged the jury to ignore Smith\u2019s testimony, which he characterized as \u201cjust too speculative[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The jury returned a general verdict for plaintiff for $890,000. After the trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for new trial or remittitur, defendants appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Contentions on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Defendants contend Smith\u2019s testimony on hedonic damages was inadmissible and the amount of the judgment was unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">In California, a pain and suffering award may include compensation for the plaintiff\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life. Loss of enjoyment of life, however, is only one component of a general damage award for pain and suffering. It is not calculated as a separate award.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">\u201cCalifornia case law recognizes, as one component of general damage, physical impairment which limits the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to share in the amenities of life. <em>(Henninger </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>[(1967)] 250 Cal.App.2d 872, 883 . . . (loss of both legs); <em>Purdy </em>v. <em>Smith and Co. </em>[(1939)] 34 Cal.App.2d 656, 658 . . . (impairment of taste and smell); <em>Scally </em>v. <em>W. T. Garratt &amp; Co. </em>[(1909)] 11 Cal.App. 138, 145 .. . (loss of ability to pursue musical studies) . . . .) The California decisions rarely employ the \u2018enjoyment of life\u2019 rubric, yet achieve a result consistent with it. No California rule restricts a plaintiff\u2019s attorney from arguing this element to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>a jury. Damage for mental suffering supplies an analogue. [Citation.] A majority of American jurisdictions recognize the compensability of loss of enjoyment of life, some as a component of the pain and suffering award, others as a distinct item of damage. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Huff v. Tracy, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d at p. 943.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">There is \u201c[n]o definite standard or method of calculation . . . prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for pain and suffering.\u201d (BAJI No. 14.13 (8th ed. 1994), original brackets omitted.) As our Supreme Court stated, \u201cOne of the most difficult tasks imposed upon a jury in deciding a case involving personal injuries is to determine the amount of money the plaintiff is to be awarded as compensation for pain and suffering. No method is available to the jury by which it can objectively evaluate such damages, and no witness may express his subjective opinion on the matter. [Citation.] In a very real sense, the jury is asked to evaluate in terms of money a detriment for which monetary compensation cannot be ascertained with any demonstrable accuracy. As one writer on the subject has said, \u2018Translating pain and anguish into dollars can, at best, be only an arbitrary allowance, and not a process of measurement, and consequently the judge can, in his instructions, give the jury no standard to go by; he can only tell them to allow such amount as in their discretion they may consider reasonable. . . . The chief reliance for reaching reasonable results in attempting to value suffering in terms of money must be the restraint and common sense of the jury. . . .\u2019 (McCormick on Damages, \u00a7 88, pp. 318-319.)\u201d <em>(Beagle </em>v. <em>Vasold </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 166, 172 [53 Cal.Rptr. 129, 417 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The jury must impartially determine pain and suffering damages based upon evidence specific to the plaintiff, as opposed to statistical data concerning the public at large. The only person whose pain and suffering is relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>in calculating a general damage award is the plaintiff. How others would feel if placed in the plaintiff\u2019s position is irrelevant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is improper, for example, for an attorney to ask jurors how much \u201cthey would \u2018charge\u2019 to undergo equivalent pain and suffering.\u201d <em>(Beagle </em>v. <em>Vasold, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 182, fn. 11.) \u201cThis so-called \u2018golden rule\u2019 argument [citation] is impermissible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brokopp </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 841, 860 [139 Cal.Rptr. 888, 93 A.L.R.3d 537].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAuu\">\u201cThe appeal to a juror to exercise his subjective judgment rather than an impartial judgment predicated on the evidence cannot be condoned. It tends to denigrate the jurors\u2019 oath to well and truly try the issue and render a true verdict according to the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 604.) Moreover, it in effect asks each juror to become a personal partisan advocate for the injured party, rather than an unbiased and unprejudiced weigher of the evidence. Finally, it may tend to induce each juror to consider a higher figure than he otherwise might to avoid being considered self-abasing.\u201d <em>(Neumann </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 451, 484-485 [130 Cal.Rptr. 786]; see also <em>Sabella </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 311, 319-320 [74 Cal.Rptr. 534, 449 P.2d 750]; <em>Zibbell </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1911) 160 Cal. 237, 255 [116 P. 513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In this case, plaintiff did not make an impermissible \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument, but she did something similar. She asked the jury to accept $2.3 million as the baseline value of life and to give her a percentage of that figure (adjusted for her age) as hedonic damages. The baseline figure, however, is not based upon an analysis of any particular individual\u2019s life. It is based upon benchmark figures such as the amount society spends per capita on selected safety devices, or the amount employers pay to induce workers to perform high-risk jobs. We perceive no meaningful relationship between those arbitrarily selected benchmark spending figures and the value of an individual person\u2019s life. Moreover, our Supreme Court has rejected the notion that pain and suffering damages may be computed by some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>mathematical formula. <em>(Beagle </em>v. <em>Vasold, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 172.) Smith\u2019s hedonic damages formula, however, purports to do just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Defendants objected to Smith\u2019s testimony on several grounds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> One objection was based on the prohibition against separately instructing the jury on general damages for pain and suffering and damages for loss of enjoyment of life <em>(Huff v. Tracy, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.3d at pp. 943-944; <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Kelley Co. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 633, 654-655 [219 Cal.Rptr. 513], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Nesler </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 561, 582, fn. 5 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   Separate instructions on pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life are prohibited because they could mislead a jury to award double damages for the same injury.  Defendants argued below that Smith\u2019s testimony was inadmissible as a matter of law because of its potential for misleading the jury to award double damages. We find the objection was valid and we conclude, as a matter of law, Smith\u2019s testimony should have been excluded on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with that of other courts. \u201c \u2018One of the strongest arguments that has been advanced as a reason for not recognizing loss of enjoyment of life as a separate category of damages is that it duplicates or overlaps other categories of damages, such as permanent disability or pain and suffering.\u2019 <em>[Leiker </em>v. <em>Gafford </em>(1989) 245 Kan. 325, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>339 [778 P.2d 823, 834], disapproved on another ground in <em>Martindale </em>v. <em>Tenny </em>(1992) 250 Kan. 621, 628-629 [829 P.2d 561, 566]]. See, generally, Hermes, Loss of Enjoyment of Life\u2014Duplication of Damages Versus Full Compensation (1987), 63 N.D.L.Rev. 561; Annotation, Loss of Enjoyment of Life as a Distinct Element or Factor in Awarding Damages for Bodily Injury (1984), 34 A.L.R. 4th 293; Comment, Loss of Enjoyment of Life as a Separate Element of Damages (1981), 12 Pac.L.J. 965.\u201d <em>(Fantozzi </em>v. <em>Sandusky Cement Products Co. </em>(1992) 64 Ohio St.3d 601, 613 [597 N.E.2d 474, 483].)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In addition, Smith\u2019s testimony should have been excluded for another reason. Defendants also objected on the ground that the method of computing hedonic damages is not a matter for which expert testimony is admissible under Evidence Code section 801. That objection was also sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">A plaintiff\u2019s loss of enjoyment of life is not \u201ca subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact[.]\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No amount of expert testimony on the value of life could possibly help a jury decide that difficult question. A life is not a stock, car, home, or other such item bought and sold in some marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Smith\u2019s impersonal method of valuing life assumes that for the most part, all lives have the same basic value. That has democratic appeal, but Smith used no democratic processes in reaching that conclusion or selecting which benchmark figures to consider in setting the baseline figure. There is no statute Smith could have turned to for guidance. Our Legislature has not decreed that all injured plaintiffs of the same age and with the same degree of disability should recover the same hedonic damages; nor has it assigned set values in tort cases for the loss of an eye, ear, limb, or life. Moreover, our judicial law prohibits trial counsel from referring to the amounts of jury verdicts in other cases. (See <em>Salgo </em>v. <em>Leland Stanford etc. Bd. Trustees </em>(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 560, 579 [317 P.2d 170]; Annot., Propriety and Prejudicial Effect of Reference by Counsel in Civil Case to Amount of Verdict in Similar Cases (1967) 15 A.L.R.3d 1144.) Because counsel may not ask the jury to give the same amount of damages as in another case, it would be inconsistent to permit an expert witness to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The figures Smith included in his baseline calculation have nothing to do with this particular plaintiff\u2019s injuries, condition, hobbies, skills, or other factors relevant to her loss of enjoyment of life. The studies Smith used may help explain how much consumers will pay for safer products, or how much society should pay for government-mandated safety programs, but they shed no light on how to value this particular plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering following the automobile accident. It is speculative, at best, to say the amount society is willing to spend on seat belts or air bags has any relationship to the intrinsic value of a person\u2019s life or the value of an injured plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering. By urging the jury to rely upon a baseline value supported by factors having nothing to do with this plaintiff\u2019s individual condition, Smith\u2019s testimony created the possibility of a runaway jury verdict.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Our present system of requiring the jury to determine, without the benefit of a mathematical formula, the amount of a general damages award is not without its faults. But unless and until the Legislature devises a method for computing pain and suffering damages, a plaintiff may not supply, through expert testimony or otherwise, her own formula for computing such damages. Just as no judge may give the jury a standard for determining pain and suffering damages (see <em>Beagle </em>v. <em>Vasold, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 172), no expert may supply a formula for computing the value of life and, by extrapolation, the value of the loss of enjoyment of life. That calculation, at present, must be left to the sound discretion of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We note other jurisdictions have also excluded Smith\u2019s hedonic damages expert testimony. (See <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Ahmed </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 974 F.2d 863, 868-871; <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(N.D.Ill. 1995) 887 F.Supp. 1049, 1051-1066; <em>Fetzer </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1991) 211 Ill.App.3d 70 [155 Ill.Dec. 626, 569 N.E.2d 1237,1244-1247]; <em>Longman v.

Lopez (1994) 77 Haw. 282, 303, fn. 24 [884 P.2d 345, 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Having determined Smith\u2019s testimony was inadmissible as a matter of law, we turn to the issue of prejudice. We must examine all the evidence to determine whether \u201cit is reasonably probable that a different result would have been reached absent the error. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.)\u201d <em>(Andrews </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 938, 948 [252 Cal.Rptr. 716].) If so, reversal is required. <em>(Daly </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 725, 746 [144 Cal.Rptr. 380, 575 P.2d 1162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Because loss of enjoyment of life is simply one component of pain and suffering damages, presenting the jury with a formula for separately calculating hedonic damages created a risk of double recovery for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. The jury heard plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding the drastic lifestyle changes she had made because of her injuries, and was told it could award \u201cReasonable compensation for any pain, discomfort, fears, anxiety and other mental and emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff and of which injury was a cause and for similar suffering reasonably certain to be experienced in the future from the same cause. . . .\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s testimony alone was sufficient to support a general damages award that included compensation for loss of enjoyment of life. But there was more than just plaintiff\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The jury also heard Smith\u2019s expert testimony on how much a life is worth and how to calculate hedonic damages by multiplying that figure by the percentage of plaintiff\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">While the judge correctly instructed the jury there is no single mathematical formula for computing pain and suffering damages, the instruction was insufficient to cure the error of admitting Smith\u2019s testimony. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument that Smith\u2019s testimony was unrefuted rendered the instruction a mere wink and a nod. It is reasonably probable and almost a certainty the jury awarded a double recovery. Accordingly, the admission of Smith\u2019s testimony was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">We reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial on damages.

Berry [(N.D.Ill. 1985) 629 F.Supp. 159, affirmed (7th Cir. 1987) 827 F.2d 195, vacated (7th Cir. 1988) 835 F.2d 1222, reversed on other grounds (7th Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 802], Hedonic damages derives its name from the Greek word \u2018hedonikos\u2019 meaning pleasure or pleasurable. As interpreted by the courts around the United States, hedonic damages means either a loss of enjoyment of life or loss of life\u2019s pleasures.\u201d (Price, <em>Hedonic Damages: To Value a Life or Not to Value a Life? </em>(1993) 95 W.Va.

Smith is the same economist who testified as plaintiff\u2019s hedonic damages expert in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> In <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 177 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 580], Division Four of this appellate district denied a writ of mandate petition seeking to overturn an order striking a cause of action for hedonic damages in a wrongful death action filed under 42 United States Code section 1983. Division Four held that California\u2019s statute governing the survival of actions excludes damages for the decedent\u2019s pain and suffering and is not inconsistent with federal law. Specifically, <em>Garcia </em>held that \u201c[t]he trial court was not required to allow plaintiff to seek hedonic damages, a concept foreign to our state survival statute.\u201d (42 Cal.App.4th at p. 180.)</p>\n<p id=\"AXVA\"><em>Garcia </em>did not reach the issue of whether expert testimony on the value of life and how to compute hedonic damages is admissible in a personal injury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\"> Although plaintiff\u2019s business profits fell immediately after the accident, her company is again growing and more profitable than ever.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> Defendants raised numerous grounds below for excluding Smith\u2019s testimony. They included: (1) there is no consensus among experts in the field that a scientific method for computing hedonic damages exists <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leahy </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 587, 611-612 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 663, 882 P.2d 321]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24, 30-32 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]); (2) the method of computing hedonic damages is not a matter for which expert testimony is admissible under Evidence Code section 801; (3) Smith\u2019s testimony would be more prejudicial than probative and would enflame the jury (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352); (4) the evidence is inadmissible under California law which prohibits a separate instruction on loss of enjoyment of life damages <em>(Huff v. Tracy </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 939, 942-944 [129 Cal.Rptr. 551]) and precludes a double recovery for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life; and (5) the evidence is speculative and invades the province of the jury to compute the amount of general damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\"> Miller, <em>Willingness to Pay Comes of Age: Will the System Survive? </em>(1989) 83 Nw. U. L.Rev. 876, 879.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b662-6\"> \u201cThere are four views as to the recovery of damages for loss of enjoyment of life (hedonic damages): (1) such damages are not recoverable; (2) such damages are recoverable as a part of the damages for pain and suffering; (3) such damages are recoverable as an element of the permanency of injury; and (4) such damages are recoverable as a separate element of damages.\u201d (3 Stein on Personal Injury Damages (1992) Mental Anguish, \u00a7 3:18:1, p. 283, fn. omitted; see Note, <em>The Semantical Bifurcation of Noneconomic Loss: Should Hedonic Damage Be Recognized Independently of Pain and Suffering Damage? </em>(1990) 75 Iowa L.Rev. 1275.)</p>\n<p id=\"AD-\">Much of the debate has focused on whether the plaintiff must have been conscious or aware of the injury to recover hedonic damages. The Supreme Court of Ohio held that hedonic damages are not available to a plaintiff who was injured either in \u00fatero or at birth. <em>(Ramos </em>v. <em>Kuzas </em>(1992) 65 Ohio St.3d 42 [600 N.E.2d 241].) In New York, the highest state court held that hedonic damages are not recoverable independently of pain and suffering damages and reversed an award of hedonic damages to a comatose plaintiff. <em>(McDougald </em>v. <em>Garber </em>(1989) 73 N.Y.2d 246, 253 [538 N.Y.S.2d 937, 536 N.E.2d 372, 374].) But a New Jersey court held in <em>Eyoma </em>v. <em>Falco </em>(1991) 247 N.J.Super. 435 [589 A.2d 653], that pain and suffering damages may be awarded where the patient was comatose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\"> One author has argued, however, for a new system of determining pain and suffering damages that \u201cbase[s] the award upon a reasonable person\u2019s willingness to pay to eliminate that risk.\u201d (Geistfeid, <em>Placing a Price on Pain and Suffering: A Method for Helping Juries Determine Tort Damages for Nonmonetary Injuries </em>(1995) 83 Cal.L.Rev. 773, 780.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\"> Attorneys may, however, ask the jury to measure the plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering on a \u201cper diem\u201d basis. <em>(Beagle </em>v. <em>Vasold, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at pp. 181-182.) The court in <em>Beagle </em>explained that while the \u201cper diem\u201d argument is permissible, the \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument is not: \u201cIn holding that counsel may properly suggest to the jury that plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering be measured on a \u2018per diem\u2019 basis, we do not imply that we also approve the so-called \u2018golden rule\u2019 argument, by which counsel asks the jurors to place themselves in the plaintiff\u2019s shoes and to award such damages as they would \u2018charge\u2019 to undergo equivalent pain and suffering.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 182, fn. 11.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> For example, defendants objected, based on <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 24 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Leahy, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 587, that there is no consensus among experts in Smith\u2019s field that a scientific method exists for computing hedonic damages. We need not address that contention here because we conclude Smith\u2019s testimony was inadmissible, as a matter of law, for other reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> Defendants raised no claim of instructional error on appeal. In this case, the jury received the following standard instructions on pain and suffering damages: \u201cThe defendants having admitted liability, you must award plaintiff damages in an amount that will reasonably compensate for each of the following elements of claimed loss or harm, provided that you find it was or will be suffered by plaintiff and was or will be caused by such defendants\u2019] conduct.\u201d (Based on BAJI No. 14.01 (8th ed. 1994).)</p>\n<p id=\"Arp\">\u201cThe amount of such award shall include: HQ Medical expenses ['JQ Loss of earnings fl] Loss of use of property [QQ Costs of repair or replacement [QQ Loss of employment [QQ Loss of business or employment opportunities [QQ Pain and suffering [QQ Inconvenience [QQ Mental suffering [1 Emotional distress.\u201d (Based on BAJI No. 14.01 (8th ed. 1994).)</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">\u201cReasonable compensation for any pain, discomfort, fears, anxiety and other mental and emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff and of which injury was a cause and for similar suffering reasonably certain to be experienced in the future from the same cause. [QD No definite standard or method of calculation is prescribed by law by which to fix reasonable compensation for pain and suffering. Nor is the opinion of any witness required as to the amount of such reasonable compensation. Furthermore, the argument of counsel as to the amount of damages is not evidence of reasonable compensation. In making the award for pain and suffering you shall exercise your authority with calm and reasonable judgment and the damages you fix shall be just and reasonable in the light of the evidence.\u201d (Based on BAJI No. 14.13 (8th ed. 1994).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> Defendants cited Evidence Code section 801 below, and also specifically referred to subdivision (b) of that section. Plaintiffs assert that because defendants did not also specifically refer to subdivision (a), defendants may not rely upon subdivision (a) on appeal. We do not read the record so narrowly. It is sufficient that defendants cited section 801 in general and argued, consistent with subdivision (a), that Smith\u2019s testimony would not assist the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\"> That is not to say, however, that we believe the verdict was so large as to shock the conscience or suggest it was the result of passion or prejudice. Plaintiff testified she has substantial pain, cannot indulge in her passion for sports, and has lived a comparatively drab existence following the accident. On this record, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that a verdict of $890,000 is in any way excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> In cases involving more severe injuries where the plaintiff shows the jury a \u201cday in the life\u201d videotape to support a pain and suffering award, the admission of expert testimony on hedonic damages would present an even stronger danger that the jury would award double damages. As was stated in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 436 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 528]: \u201cThe videotape best describes the problems Ms. Jones encounters on a daily basis in a way mere oral testimony may not convey to the jurors. The videotape also best demonstrates the everyday problems a person with paraplegia encounters as a result of an injury of this kind. Moreover, the videotape is the most effective way to explain to the jury the extent of the assistance and medical attention required as a result of being rendered a paraplegic.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 446.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
