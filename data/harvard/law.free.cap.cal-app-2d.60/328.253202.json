The disappointed bidder lost, on every timely issue raised before the hearing officer, the administrative board, and the superior court. However, the superior court, exceeding its circumscribed review of administrative decisions, reversed the board, relying on a legal theory never raised in the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The superior court\u2019s rulings have prevented the state from implementing the new contract with the successful bidder. Instead, the rulings have compelled the state to continue the previous contract with the disappointed bidder\u2014under which the state pays 64 percent more for each license.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>We reverse both the judgment granting the petition for writ of mandate and the order granting the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In May 1994, the Department of General Services issued a request for proposals (RFP DMV-3026), soliciting bids for a turn-key production system to produce plasticized or plastic-based, nonembossed, credit-card size, color photo drivers\u2019 licenses, identification cards, and salesperson licenses for the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV Project).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The DMV Project required developing a related \u201cimage database,\u201d to be housed on the successful bidder\u2019s computers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The image database, to which law enforcement would have access, would contain the photographs and demographic information of all individuals holding drivers\u2019 and salesperson licenses and identification cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Among the bidders for this project were NBS Imaging Systems, Inc., which had been the vendor for California drivers\u2019 licenses since 1962, and Polaroid Corporation. Polaroid submitted two bids on the DMV Project, and its two bids received the two highest scores.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Polaroid\u2019s bids contemplated a subcontract with AT&amp;T Global Solutions, which in turn, contemplated a subcontract with Computer Deductions, Inc. (CDI) GDI\u2019s contribution as a sub-subcontractor was to involve design work related to the software necessary to develop the image database to store the photographs and demographic information.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">After Polaroid won the DMV Project contract, NBS tendered a timely protest to the Department of General Services, which forwarded the protest to the Board of Control. NBS subsequently submitted a 100-page \u201cDetailed Statement of Protest,\u201d in which it presented a myriad of challenges to Polaroid\u2019s bids. In one of these challenges, NBS relied on two specific authorities to assert Polaroid could not legally contract with CDI because CDI previously had provided consulting services to the DMV, and thus Polaroid\u2019s bids were invalid due to GDI\u2019s conflict of interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Nearly three years before the DMV\u2019s request for proposals on this project, CDI provided consulting services on another DMV matter known as the Database Redevelopment Project or Database Revitalization Project. This project involved evaluating the feasibility of transferring the DMV\u2019s driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration database from IBM computers to $18 million in newly purchased Tandem Cyclone computers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The DMV abandoned the project after it determined transferring the database to the Tandem computers would not be cost-effective. DMV staff, in a brainstorming session, identified 22 possible uses for the Tandem computer hardware, and decided to analyze further 7 of these uses for viability. The staff, together with consultants from CDI, evaluated, and rejected, these potential alternative uses. One of the rejected potential uses was housing the image database for the DMV Project. The RFP for the DMV Project was drafted before CDI participated in the database redevelopment project; CDI played no role in developing or drafting the RFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">NBS challenged Polaroid\u2019s bid exclusively on the basis of violations of Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>section 5202. As facts supporting these purported violations, NBS alleged GDI\u2019s previous consulting services \u201cresulted] from or related to\u201d four of the RFP specifications for the DMV Project: (1) on line data transfer, (2) field office photo retrieval, (3) law enforcement access to the DMV database, and (4) points for less than five-day card production delivery to the DMV. NBS later supplemented its protest to include 14 additional exhibits and an additional factual allegation: GDI\u2019s participation in the review as to whether the Tandem computers should house the image database.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">After a 14-day hearing, the hearing officer found NBS\u2019s claims were not supported by the evidence and issued a proposed decision denying NBS\u2019s protest. The Board of Control adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and the proposed decision. The board concluded neither Public Contract Code section 10365.5 nor State Administrative Manual section 5202 applied, and thus there was no valid ground for NBS\u2019s protest. Additionally, the board found even if these sections applied, CDI did not come within the sections\u2019 terms because CDI itself \u201chas not submitted a bid nor will it be awarded a contract,\u201d and \u201c[n]o credible evidence has been offered which would support a conclusion that CDI, functioning as a subcontractor for Polaroid, would be providing services . . . as an end product of its consulting services contract\u201d within the meaning of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Furthermore, the board found the facts did not support a finding of a conflict of interest. The board found the DMV had already drafted the RFP for the DMV Project before considering whether the Tandem computers might be suitable for housing the image database, and found \u201cno provisions in the previously drafted RFP were in any way changed or affected by GDI\u2019s participation in considering alternate uses for the Tandems.\u201d CDI had \u201cno involvement in the development or drafting of provisions of the RFP, and in fact had no knowledge of what was in the RFP,\u201d and GDI\u2019s services under the RFP were not \u201crequired, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate in the end product of [its] consulting service contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">NBS then sought administrative and traditional mandamus in the superior court. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1085, 1094.5.) The superior court found substantial evidence supported the board\u2019s findings of fact, and rejected both of NBS\u2019s legal bases for relief\u2014Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual section 5202. However, the superior court then overstepped its statutory bounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relying on State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4)\u2014a legal theory never presented in the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>proceedings\u2014the superior court concluded CDI could not participate in the DMV Project. Accordingly, the superior court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the board of Control to grant NBS\u2019s protest and to declare the award of the contract to Polaroid invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The court reasoned: \u201cWhat CDI did had a profound influence on the final form of the RFP, because CDI was involved in rejecting a proposal which would have led to a major change in the requirements of the RFP, At all times, the RFP called for the photo image database to be housed on the vendor\u2019s computers, and not at the DMV. If CDI had recommended that the database should be stored on the Tandems, the RFP would have been changed to reflect this new requirement. In fact, the release of the RFP was held up while this issue was under discussion. When CDI recommended that the database should not be maintained on the Tandems, it in effect recommended, or suggested, that the database should be maintained by the outside vendor, and thus effectively recommended, or suggested, that the RFP should not be changed. This is shown by the fact that the RFP was released without change once the decision was made not to use the Tandems. The Court thus finds that the effect of GDI\u2019s recommendations was to suggest that the database be maintained by an outside vendor. GDI\u2019s work as part of the Polaroid teams involves work on the software related to the photo image database. In effect, it will be doing work that was suggested by its recommendation to keep the database with an outside vendor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Polaroid continued its preparations and was set to begin license production on July 22, 1996. In June 1996, NBS filed a petition seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction, and the superior court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining further performance of the DMV contract during the pendency of this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u201cThe court\u2019s review of the administrative decision extends \u2018to the questions whether the [administrative agency] has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the [administrative agency] has not proceeded in the maimer required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.\u2019 [Citation.] The courts review the findings and decision of the administrative agency under a substantial evidence standard, as here, when no fundamental vested right is implicated. [Citation.] \u2018When the substantial evidence test applies, the trial court exercises an essentially appellate function in determining whether the administrative record is free from legal error. On appeal, our scope of review is identical to that of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(National Identification Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Control </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1454 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 257].)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In the course of the various proceedings challenging Polaroid\u2019s bid, NBS has offered four potential bases upon which the arbiter could declare the bid invalid: (1) Public Contract Code section 10365.5, (2) State Administrative Manual section 5202, (3) State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (4) paragraph II.B.15 of the RFP.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first two authorities\u2014 Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>section 5202\u2014were raised in NBS\u2019s protest, but were rejected as inapplicable at every level of these proceedings. The hearing officer, the Board of Control, and the superior court all rejected both of these sections as legal bases for invalidating Polaroid\u2019s bid. The remaining two authorities were not timely mentioned either in NBS\u2019s protest or during the administrative proceedings. Indeed, State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4)\u2014the basis upon which the trial court invalidated Polaroid\u2019s bid\u2014appeared for the first time in NBS\u2019s <em>reply brief </em>in the superior court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Subdivision (h) of Public Contract Code section 12102 governs protest procedures. This subdivision provides: \u201c. . . [Protests must be filed no later than five working days after the issuance of an intent to award. Authority to protest may be limited to participating bidders. . . . Within 10 calendar days after filing a protest, the protesting vendor shall file with the State Board of Control <em>a full and complete written statement specifying in detail the grounds of the protest and the facts in support thereof </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">NBS\u2019s protest specified that its challenge was based solely upon Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual section 5202. The hearing officer and the board addressed the applicability of these two sections in detail. As noted above, NBS made no timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>mention of State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4) or RFP DMV-3026 paragraph II.B.15 in the administrative proceedings. Accordingly, the hearing officer and the board had no opportunity to evaluate the application or import of these tardy assertions and the superior court had no authority to consider them. (See <em>Digital Biometrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Anthony </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1156 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 43].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The superior court erred in granting relief based on a legal theory never presented during the administrative proceedings. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>West Publishing Co. </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 80, 88 [216 P.2d 441]; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1417 [239 Cal.Rptr. 908] [\u201cexhaustion of remedies doctrine applies equally to questions of law and fact\u201d].) We next consider the two authorities discussed in NBS\u2019s respondent\u2019s brief which were presented during the administrative proceedings\u2014Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual section 5202.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Public Contract Code section 10365.5, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cNo person, firm, or subsidiary thereof who has been awarded a consulting services contract may submit a bid for, nor be awarded a contract for, the provision of services, procurement of goods or supplies, or any other related action which is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate in the end product of the consulting services contract.\u201d This section does not apply to \u201c[transactions covered under Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 12100).\u201d (Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 10430, subd. (b).) Chapter 3 pertains to the acquisition of electronic data processing and telecommunication goods and services. (See Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 12102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Similarly, section 5202 of the State Administrative Manual states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe requirements of Public Contract Code Section 10365.5 and this section are applicable to any information technology contract <em>that includes a consulting component. </em>fiD ... [\u2018ID ... No person, firm, or subsidiary thereof who has been awarded a consulting services contract, or a contract which includes a consulting component, may be awarded a contract for the provision of services, delivery of goods or supplies, or any other related action which is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate as an end product of the consulting services contract. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Consistent with the conclusion of every other tribunal in these proceedings, we find Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual section 5202 do not apply to Polaroid\u2019s bid. First, with regard to Public Contract Code section 10365.5, the parties themselves have conceded the DMV Project comes within section 10365.5\u2019s express exemption for transactions covered by chapter 3. As noted by the board, <em>\u201cIt is undisputed </em>that RFP DMV-3026 was issued under Chapter 3 relating to the acquisition of electronic data processing systems and telecommunications goods and services.\u201d (Italics added.) The superior court similarly observed, <em>\u201cThe parties here are in agreement, </em>and the Court finds, that the procurement in question here involved electronic data processing goods and services. Accordingly, the Court finds that Section 10365.5(a) does not apply to this procurement.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">With regard to State Administrative Manual section 5202, this section applies to any information technology contract which includes a consulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>component. The board expressly found: \u201cNo credible evidence was offered by NBS establishing that the information technology contract that will be awarded pursuant to the RFP will include a \u2018consulting component.\u2019 A review of the RFP appears to indicate that such a component is not involved in this acquisition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">GDI\u2019s prior consulting work for the DMV regarding the Tandem computers did not result in \u201crequiring], suggesting], or otherwise deem[ing] appropriate in the end product of the consulting services contract\u201d its sub-subcontracting design work for Polaroid, which relates to the software necessary to develop the image database for storing the photographs and demographic information. The board found: \u201cGDI has not submitted a bid nor will it be awarded a contract for services, goods, supplies, \u2018or any other related action which is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate in the end product of the consulting service contract.\u2019 [Citation.] No credible evidence has been offered which would support a conclusion that CDI, functioning as a subcontractor for Polaroid, would be providing services, goods, or supplies as an end product of its consulting services contract within the meaning of this statutory prohibition. Nor did GDI\u2019s activities relative to the possible use of the Tandems for the image database have any impact on RFP 3026. The final DMV draft of the RFP was ready for release to the Department of General Services prior to the Information Technology Steering Committee discussion to investigate possible use of the Tandems. [Citation.] The RFP was released without change after the April 29, 1994, decision not to utilize the Tandems for the images database. [Citation.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Though there was a short delay in release of the RFP, no provisions in the previously drafted RFP were in any way changed or affected by GDI\u2019s participation in considering alternative uses for the Tandems. [ID Further, while NBS alleged in its detailed statement of protest that GDI had input in developing the specifications for the RFP [citation], no credible evidence supporting such allegations was presented by NBS. Very convincing, unrefuted testimony was given which appears to clearly establish that the GDI representatives had no involvement in the development or drafting of provisions of the RFP, and in fact had no knowledge of what was in the RFP. [Citations.] []D The apparent caution exercised by DMV in not involving the GDI consultants in the RFP process was further reflected when a meeting was held on September 21, 1994, to consider issuance of an addendum to the RFP requiring the contractor to use the State\u2019s Calnet for transmission of data. [Citation.] GDI\u2019s consultant. . . was excluded from the meeting while the Calnet subject was discussed. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">NBS\u2019s argument takes the fact a DMV committee, in consultation with GDI, concluded one particular computer system\u2014the Tandem system\u2014 would not work, and attempts to turn this into a \u201crecommendation\u201d for every conceivable alternative. The committee made no alternative \u201crecommendation\u201d whatsoever; it simply concluded the Tandem system was not feasible. The committee did not study the best options for housing the image database. Other potential alternatives existed, such as housing the database on the existing IBM computers, having the DMV acquire or lease other computers, storing the database with another state agency, or any number of other options. The committee merely concluded the Tandem computers were not a cost-effective method of storing the database. GDI did not \u201csuggest\u201d housing the database on the winning bidder\u2019s computers within the meaning of Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual section 5202.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, these sections do not apply to Polaroid\u2019s bid.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The superior court erred prejudicially in overturning the board\u2019s decision and enjoining Polaroid\u2019s contract with the DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The judgment in No. 96CS00148 is reversed and the peremptory writ of mandate is vacated.

NBS\u2019s contract with the DMV, which has remained in effect due to the issuance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>preliminary injunction, pays NBS $0.74 per license. Under the challenged contract, Polaroid would receive $0.49 per license.</p>\n<p id=\"AhBG\">The Legislature has emphasized the importance of timeliness in the state\u2019s acquisition of goods and services pertaining to electronic data processing systems and telecommunications systems. (See, e.g., Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12100 [\u201c. . . this separate authority should enable the <em>timely </em>acquisition of goods and services . . . .\u201d (italics added)], 12101 <em>[\u201cexpeditious </em>and value-effective acquisition of electronic data processing and telecommunications goods and services (italics added)], 12102, subd. (h) [requiring filing of protest <em>\u201cno later than five working days </em>after the issuance of an intent to award\u201d and filing detailed statement <em>\u201c[w]ithin 10 calendar days </em>after filing a protest . . . .\u201d (italics added)].) In light of the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent to promote the expeditious acquisition of, and expeditious resolution of disputes involving the acquisition of, such goods and services, it may wish to consider imposing additional restrictions which would promote this goal, such as limiting the parties who may protest, limiting the matters which may be protested, imposing additional timelines within which protests and appeals must be heard, or limiting the scope of administrative or judicial review. (Cf. <em>Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9-10 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899] [in arbitration context, judicial intervention minimized].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> Former section 1285(4) of the State Administrative Manual no longer exists. It formerly provided: \u201cA person, firm or subsidiary who was awarded a consulting services contract may not submit a bid for nor be awarded a contract for the services or goods suggested in that consulting services contract (See Public Contract Code Section 10365.5) except: FU a. A person, firm, or subsidiary who was awarded a subcontract of no more than 10 percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>total monetary value of a consulting services contract is exempt; [ID b. Contracts for consulting architect or engineer services pursuant to Government Code Section 4525 et seq. are exempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACq\">Even aside from NBS\u2019s failure to exhaust its administrative remedies with respect to former section 1285(4), as discussed <em>post, </em>the contention fails for an additional reason. Although the superior court expressly stated it was treating former section 1285(4) as a regulation, our Supreme Court has held unless regulations are adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, they are void. Thus, the provisions of the State Administrative Manual have no legal effect and cannot form the basis for invalidating Polaroid\u2019s bid. (See <em>Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bradshaw </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, 570, 571 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 927 P.2d 296] [\u201cA regulation subject to the APA thus has two principal identifying characteristics. [Citation.] First, the agency must intend its rule to apply generally, rather than in a specific case. . . . Second, the rule must \u2018implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or administered by [the agency], or . . . govern [the agency\u2019s] procedure\u2019 \u201d]; see also Willis v. <em>State of California </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 287,291 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 413] [State Administrative Manual is \u201cwithout legal effect\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> NBS raised paragraph II.B.15 of the RFP in a posthearing brief. In this belatedly raised argument, NBS contended the RFP itself prevented the DMV from granting Polaroid the challenged contract due to a conflict of interest provision which provided: \u201cNo person, firm, or subsidiary thereof who has been awarded a consulting services contract, or a contract which includes a consulting component, may be awarded a contract for the provision of services, delivery of goods or supplies, or any other related action which is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate as an end product of the consulting services contract. Therefore, any consultant that contracts with a State agency to develop a feasibility study or provide formal recommendations for the acquisition of [electronic data processing] products or services is precluded from contracting] for any work recommended in the feasibility study or the formal recommendation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b289-5\"> NBS attempts to bootstrap its belatedly raised arguments concerning State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4) and RFP DMV-3026 paragraph II.B.15 to its original protest arguments. NBS argues it \u201cconsistently raised the issue of GDI\u2019s violation of state conflict of interest law and policy regarding consultants specifically referencing \u00a7 10365.5 and the policies incorporated in the State Administrative Manual.\u201d By making this argument, NBS hopes to avoid the application of the exhaustion of remedies doctrine and <em>Digital Biometrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Anthony, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 1145. However, NBS\u2019s reference to \u201cthe policies incorporated in the State Administrative Manual\u201d did not, in the administrative proceedings, timely mention either former section 1285(4) or RFP DMV-3026 paragraph II.B.15. In light of the specificity mandated by Public Contract Code section 12102, subdivision (h), a mere general reference to \u201cconflict of interest\u201d was insufficient to implicate nonarticulated theories which relied upon specific provisions in the State Administrative Manual and the RFP.</p>\n<p id=\"ACB\">Alternatively, NBS contends it would have been futile to have raised these arguments during the administrative proceedings. However, the superior court\u2019s reliance upon these two new arguments in granting NBS relief\u2014and the court\u2019s express rejection of the original arguments raised by NBS in the administrative proceedings\u2014render NBS\u2019s futility contention disingenuous. Moreover, and in any event, there is no indication the Board had predetermined its conclusion. (See <em>George Arakelian Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 654, 662-663 [221 Cal.Rptr. 488, 710 P.2d 288] [\u201cInsofar as a \u2018futility\u2019 exception exists, ... its application is very limited. Thus, exhaustion of administrative remedy is required unless the appellant \u2018can <em>positively </em>state that the [administrative agency] has declared what its ruling will be in a <em>particular </em>case.\u2019 [Citation.] There is no indication in this record to show that, at the time that a request for review would have been timely, the board had predetermined its position . . . .\u201d (italics in original)].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> Although the superior court found Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4) \u201chave the same legal effect,\u201d the court rejected NBS\u2019s arguments pursuant to Public Contract Code section 10365.5 and relied on State Administrative Manual former section 1285(4) in granting relief. At oral argument, NBS\u2019s counsel acknowledged the discrepant results of the superior court\u2019s reasoning, and asserted his client\u2019s position relied on the application of Public Contract Code section 10365.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> At oral argument, NBS\u2019s counsel denied making any such concession. However, we are bound by the determination of the trier of fact on this factual issue. NBS also offers a number of related arguments in its efforts to circumvent section 10365.5\u2019s exemption for electronic data processing procurements. Among other things, NBS cites a different conflict of interest statute, Government Code section 1090, apparently assuming one conflict of interest statute is the same as any other. However, Government Code section 1090 applies only to specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>public officers and employees and thus has no application to this matter. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Honig </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 289, 313-314 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 555].)</p>\n<p id=\"Ang\">NBS also contends \u201cthe Board failed to recognize that the operative contract for purposes of the applicability of \u00a7 10365.5 to CDI was the CDI 1991 \u2018consulting services\u2019 contract with DMV[,] not REP DMV 3026. . . . It is the . . . \u2018consulting services\u2019 contract which imposed on CDI the conflict of interest prohibitions of \u00a7 10365.5.\u201d According to NBS, \u201cCDI advised DMV on the database requirements of RFP DMV 3026\u201d as part of its previous DMV contract, and thus was prohibited from participating in the later DMV Project. NBS also contends CDI does not come within the exemption because \u201c[transactions covered under Chapter 3\u201d are contracts for \u201celectronic data processing\u201d and \u201ctelecommunications\u201d goods and services, not consulting services contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"A6q\">NBS and Polaroid additionally offer dueling snippets of legislative history, with NBS asserting the Legislature intended Public Contract Code section 10365.5 to operate broadly in order \u201cto close a loophole in the law which allowed consultants to profit from conflicts of interest.\u201d With regard to this latter contention, the exemption for electronic data processing procurements contains no ambiguity, and thus there is no need to examine the legislative history. (See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 798 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934] [\u201c \u2018[i]f the [statutory] language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the Legislature. . . .\u2019\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">All of the aforementioned arguments, and NBS\u2019s related contentions, suffer from the same flaw: As explained herein, even if Public Contract Code section 10365.5 applied to GDI\u2019s participation in the DMV Project, we would not find a disqualifying conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> Ironically, despite NBS\u2019s protestations concerning the housing of the database under the challenged contract between Polaroid and the DMV, under the <em>existing </em>contract between NBS and the DMV, <em>NBS housed and maintained the photo image database on its computer hardware at its facility.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> NBS\u2019s arguments concerning section 5202 suffer from the additional limitation that the State Administrative Manual has no legal effect.
