We agree. The Appeals Board does not possess subject matter jurisdiction over Tribe as a matter of law. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude: (1) Tribe enjoys sovereign immunity from state regulation of the employment affairs of Tribe and its members; (2) Public Law No. 280 section 4, codified at 28 United States Code section 1360, is not an explicit congressional waiver of Tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity from state worker\u2019s compensation liability; (3) Tribe has not waived its sovereign status; (4) California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws unquestionably are \u201ccivil/regulatory,\u201d not \u201ccriminal/prohibitory,\u201d under <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 373 [96 S.Ct. 2102, 48 L.Ed.2d 710]; (5) nothing in <em>California </em>v. <em>Cabazon Band of Mission Indians </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 202 [107 S.Ct. 1083, 94 L.Ed.2d 244] <em>(Cabazon), </em>alters <em>Bryan, </em>hence the Appeals Board\u2019s interpretation of <em>Cabazon </em>is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe and the beneficial owner of the Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians, an Indian reservation. Tribe is the owner and operator of a tribal gaming business known as Twin Pine Casino, which is located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation land, held in trust by the United States for the beneficial use of the Tribe. Tribe has operated the gaming casino since approximately January 1995. Tribe is insured for workers\u2019 compensation liability by Native American Insurance Company and SRT Corporation, Phoenix, Arizona. The nature and adequacy of the workers\u2019 compensation coverage provided are not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">Tribe employs approximately 117 employees at the casino. Of these employees, approximately 10 to 12, including respondent real party in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>interest, Glen Sherron, are not tribal members. Sherron was employed as a maintenance worker at the casino. He claims to have sustained a work injury on July 9, 1995, to his left eye when it was poked by a tree branch while he was putting garbage in a dumpster. Following the injury, Sherron sought medical treatment which was paid for by Tribe\u2019s insurance carrier. He was also paid his full salary for \u201ca few hours or a day\u201d of work which he missed as a result of the eye injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">On July 28, 1995, Sherron filed an application for adjudication of claim with the Appeals Board and some months thereafter filed a declaration of readiness to proceed to hearing. On December 28, 1995, Tribe filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction and sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">At a trial on the issue of jurisdiction, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) heard testimony from Stephanie Leilani Reyes, casino general manager, concerning the availability of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for industrial injuries. When a tribal employee is injured at work, an incident report is filled out and sent to the Tribe\u2019s personnel department, which in turn forwards it to Tribe\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. Any injured employee who is dissatisfied with the manner in which an injury claim has been handled by the insurance carrier may appear before the tribal council, Tribe\u2019s governing body, elected by the general council which is comprised of all members who are lineal descendants of the Middletown Rancher\u00eda. Tribe does not conduct a separate forum for workers\u2019 compensation disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">In his findings of fact and opinion on decision, the WCJ found Sherron\u2019s employment for Tribe within the jurisdiction of the Appeals Board, citing in particular, \u201c28 USC Section 1360 (part of Public Law 280),\u201d <em>Cabazon, supra, </em>480 U.S. 202, and article XIV of the California Constitution. Commenting on the existence of a forum for appeal, the WCJ stated that \u201c[the Tribe] has no workers\u2019 compensation forum set up in which to allow injured workers to appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>The WCJ recommended that Tribe\u2019s petition for reconsideration be denied. The Appeals Board adopted the WCJ\u2019s report and recommendation on petition for reconsideration. Tribe\u2019s petition for writ of review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">\n<em>The Jurisdictional Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">At the center of the jurisdictional issue before this court is the proper construction of 28 United States Code section 1360.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1360(a) gives certain states, including California, jurisdiction over civil disputes that involve Native American Indians and arise in Indian country. However, section 1360(b) limits the scope of such state power and jurisdiction. It provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>that section 1360(a) does not authorize the \u201calienation, encumbrance, or taxation of any real or personal property . . . belonging to . . . any Indian tribe, band or community\u201d; nor does it authorize the \u201cregulation of the use of such property in a manner inconsistent with any Federal treaty, agreement, or statute or with any regulation made pursuant thereto.\u201d Finally, section 1360(b) does not \u201cconfer jurisdiction upon the State to adjudicate, in probate proceedings or otherwise, the ownership or right to possession of [Native American Indian] property or any interest therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">A. <em>Native American Indian Sovereignty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Essential to the proper application of section 1360 is an understanding of the historically complex relationship between federal, state and tribal governments in their competition for jurisdiction over Indian land and affairs. (See generally, <em>Boisclair </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1140, 1147-1149 [276 Cal.Rptr. 62, 801 P.2d 305] (Boisclair); Royster &amp; Fausett, <em>Control of the Reservation Environment: Tribal Primacy, Federal Delegation, and the Limits of State Intrusion (1989) 64 </em>Wash. L.Rev. 581; Gould, <em>The Consent Paradigm: Tribal Sovereignty at the Millennium </em>(1996) 96 Colum. L.Rev. 809 [comprehensive reviews of federal preemption, Native American Indian sovereignty and state authority over Indian affairs].)  Federal authority over Native American Indian matters derives primarily from the power to regulate commerce with Native American Indian tribes (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3) and secondarily from the power to make treaties (U.S. Const., art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2). (See generally, Hansen, <em>Survey of Civil Jurisdiction in Indian Country 1990 </em>(1991) 16 Am. Indian L.Rev. 319, 321, fn. 18, citing <em>McClanahan </em>v. <em>Arizona State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 164, 172, fn. 7 [93 S.Ct. 1257, 1262, 36 L.Ed.2d 129].) The United States Constitution is silent regarding state action in these areas. A review of the evolving decisional law makes clear the federal government\u2019s predominance over Native American Indian affairs in general and over Indian land in particular. (Hansen, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">In 1832 Chief Justice John Marshall declared that Native American Indian tribes were wholly distinct nations within whose boundaries \u201cthe laws of [a State] can have no force.\u201d <em>(Worcester </em>v. <em>The State of Georgia </em>(1832) 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 561 [8 L.Ed. 483, 501].) To this day, we find deeply rooted in our jurisprudence the policy of leaving Native American Indians free from state jurisdiction and control. <em>(McClanahan </em>v. <em>Arizona State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra, 411 </em>U.S. 164, 168 [93 S.Ct. 1257, 1260].) In <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Potawatomi Tribe (1991) 498 </em>U.S. 505 [111 S.Ct. 905, 112 L.Ed.2d 1112], the Supreme Court refused to narrow the doctrine of sovereign immunity: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>\u201cCongress has always been at liberty to dispense with such tribal immunity or to limit it. Although Congress has occasionally authorized limited classes of suits against Indian tribes, . . . Congress has consistently reiterated its approval of the immunity doctrine.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 509-510 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 909-910].) Moreover, our state Supreme Court steadfastly recites that Native American Indian tribes \u201cenjoy broad sovereign immunity from lawsuits\u201d <em>(Boisclair, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1157, citing <em>Santa Clara Pueblo </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 49, 59 [98 S.Ct. 1670, 1677, 56 L.Ed.2d 106]) and \u201cmay . . . exercise sovereign power over non-Indians who enter tribal land\u201d <em>(Boisclair, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1158, citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1959) 358 U.S. 217, 223 [79 S.Ct. 269, 272, 3 L.Ed.2d 251]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">On the other hand, states have no power to regulate the use or governance of Native American Indian country in the absence of an effective waiver or consent by Congress or the tribe. <em>(Hydrothermal Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>Fort Bidwell Indian Community Council </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 489, 494-495 [216 Cal.Rptr. 59]; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Chemehuevi Indian Reservation </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 853, 857-858, 860, fn. 7 [171 Cal.Rptr. 733], cert. den. 454 U.S. 831 [102 S.Ct. 129, 70 L.Ed.2d 109].) It is settled that a waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed. <em>{Hydrothermal Energy Corp., supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d at p. 494, citing <em>Santa Clara Pueblo </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 58 [98 S.Ct. at p. 1677]; <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Indus. Com\u2019n </em>(1985) 144 Ariz. 129 [696 P.2d 223, 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Here, it is undisputed that Tribe did not consent in any form of agreement to a waiver of its general right to defensively assert sovereign immunity. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of Or. </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 657 F.2d 1009, 1013-1014 [\u201cIndian tribes may consent to suit without explicit Congressional authority\u201d].) While Congress can authorize suits against Indian nations, we are required, as a matter of law, to recognize Tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity status in the absence of an explicit congressional waiver. <em>(Santa Clara Pueblo </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 58 [98 S.Ct. at p. 1677]; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Chemehuevi Indian Reservation, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at p. 858; <em>Tibbetts </em>v. <em>Leech Lake Reservation Business </em>(Minn. 1986) 397 N.W.2d 883, 886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">In summary, our review of decisional law teaches that a \u201c \u2018 \u201c. . . policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in this nation\u2019s history.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>(Boisclair, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1147, quoting <em>McClanahan </em>v. <em>Arizona State Tax Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>411 U.S. at p. 168 [93 S.Ct. at p. 1260].) \u201cThis policy has two independent but interrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>bases: federal preemption <em>and </em>the internal sovereign rights of Indian tribes.\u201d <em>(Boisclair, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1147, italics added, citing <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Bracker </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 136, 142 [100 S.Ct. 2578, 2583, 65 L.Ed.2d 665].) States may regulate within Indian country <em>only </em>when state control is not preempted by federal law <em>or when state control does not infringe on tribal sovereignty. (Bracker, </em>supra, 448 U.S. at pp. 142-143 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2583-2584], citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Lee, supra, </em>358 U.S. at p. 220 [79 S.Ct. at pp. 270-271].)  Here, Tribe\u2019s sovereign status is an independent barrier for holding California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable because their enforcement by the Appeals Board unlawfully infringes on the right of Tribe to govern its own employment affairs. <em>(White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Bracker, supra, </em>448 U.S. at pp. 142-143 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2583-2584].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">This long-established national tradition of Indian sovereignty provides the context for our analysis of the applicability of section 1360 to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">B. <em>Section 1360: Intent and Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Although the federal government has plenary power over tribal affairs, it began to delegate some of this authority to the states in the early 1950\u2019s during an assimilationist period. <em>(Boisclair, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pp. 1149-1150.) Public Law No. 280 (Public Law 280),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of which section 1360 is part, was enacted by Congress in 1953.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It confers both civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian country to six designated states and permits other states the option of assuming similar jurisdiction. The primary focus of the legislative history of Public Law 280 is on the grant of criminal jurisdiction set forth in section 2 (codified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, supra, </em>426 U.S. at pp. 379-386 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2106-2110].) The lack of legislative attention to the civil jurisdiction provision in section 4 of Public Law 280 (\u00a7 1360) <em>(Bryan, supra, </em>at pp. 381-386 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2107-2110]) \u201chas led one commentator to conclude that such jurisdiction was \u2018an afterthought . . . added because it comported with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>pro-assimilationist drift of federal policy . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Boisclair, </em>supra, 51 Cal.3d at p. 1150, quoting Goldberg, <em>Public Law 280: The Limits of State Jurisdiction Over Reservation Indians </em>(1975) 22 UCLA L.Rev. 535, 543.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">In <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, supra, </em>426 U.S. 373, the Supreme Court attempted to reconcile these jurisdictional discrepancies. The issue in <em>Bryan </em>was whether a Minnesota statute that allowed Itasca County to impose a personal property tax on mobile homes could be enforced upon a member of the Chippewa Tribe who lived on tribal land. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 375 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2104-2105].) While the language of section 1360, granting state civil jurisdiction \u201cover civil causes of action between Indians or to which Indians are parties\u201d initially seemed sweeping, the Supreme Court <em>narrowly </em>construed it. <em>Bryan </em>held that a state could exercise civil jurisdiction under section 1360 only to the extent necessary to resolve civil disputes <em>between Indians and private individuals. </em>(426 U.S. at p. 385 [96 S.Ct. at p. 2109] [\u00a7 1360 limited to \u201cprivate civil litigation involving reservation Indians in state court\u201d].) The court applied the criminal/prohibitory\u2014civil/regulatory distinction to reach its result. <em>Bryan </em>is important because its effort to narrowly interpret section 1360 set the tone for the modem regulatory versus prohibitory analysis undertaken when a state attempts to regulate tribal activities by asserting civil or criminal jurisdiction under Public Law 280. (Royster &amp; Fausett, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number><em>Control of the Reservation Environment: Tribal Primacy, Federal Delegation, and the Limits of State Intrusion, supra, </em>64 Wash. L.Rev. 581, 607-611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\"><em>Bryan </em>thoroughly examined the legislative history of Public Law 280 and acknowledged the canons of construction applicable to congressional statutes claiming to terminate Native American Indian immunities. <em>(Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, supra, </em>426 U.S. at pp. 379-380 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2106-2107].) <em>Bryan </em>established from the \u201csparse legislative history\u201d that the primary concerns of Congress when it enacted Public Law 280 were \u201cthe problem of lawlessness on certain Indian reservations, and the absence of adequate tribal institutions for law enforcement. . . . Thus, provision for <em>state criminal jurisdiction </em>over offenses committed by or against Indians on the reservations was the central focus of Pub. L. 280 and is embodied in [section 1162], [\u00b6] In marked contrast in the legislative history [of Public Law 280] is the virtual absence of expression of congressional policy or intent respecting [section 1360\u2019s] grant of civil jurisdiction to the States.\u201d (426 U.S. at pp. 379-381 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2106-2107], italics added.) The court acknowledged that Public Law 280 was enacted during a time when Congress as a matter of policy favored assimilationist legislation. (426 U.S. at pp. 387-388 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2110-2111].) However, \u201cnothing in its legislative history,\u201d emphasized the court, \u201cremotely suggests that Congress meant the Act\u2019s extension of civil jurisdiction to the States should result in the undermining or destruction of such tribal governments .... The Act itself refutes such an inference; <em>there is notably absent any conferral of state jurisdiction over the tribes themselves </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 388-389 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 2110-2111], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Ten years later, the Supreme Court reexamined Public Law 280 in <em>Cabazon, supra, </em>480 U.S. 202, in the context of California\u2019s attempt to regulate profit-based Indian gaming activities. In <em>Cabazon, </em>the Supreme Court sharply limited the power of the states to apply their gambling laws to Indian gaming activities. In response to <em>Cabazon, </em>Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) in 1988. (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 et seq.) IGRA supersedes <em>Cabazon </em>to the extent that tribal-state conflicts over Indian gaming regulation are now governed by its statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\"><em>Cabazon, </em>however, provides guidance in resolving the immediate issue before this court of the jurisdiction of the Appeals Board over Tribe. Rejecting state jurisdiction and narrowly construing Public Law 280, <em>Cabazon </em>reaffirmed the civil/regulatory\u2014criminal/prohibitory dichotomy articulated in <em>Bryan. </em>The <em>Cabazon </em>court observed: \u201cIn \u00a7 2, California was granted broad criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians within all Indian country within the State. <em>Section 4\u2019s grant of civil jurisdiction was more limited. </em>In <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca-County </em>. . . , we interpreted \u00a7 4 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>grant States jurisdiction over private civil litigation involving reservation Indians in state court, <em>but not to grant general civil regulatory authority. . . . </em>Accordingly, when a State seeks to enforce a law within an Indian reservation under the authority of Pub. L. 280, <em>it must be determined whether the law is criminal in nature, and thus fully applicable to the reservation under \u00a7 2 </em>[section 1162], or civil in nature, and applicable only as it may be relevant to private litigation in state court [under section 1360].\u201d <em>(Cabazon, supra, </em>480 U.S. at pp. 207-208 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1087-1088], italics added, fns. omitted.) \u201cBut that an otherwise regulatory law is enforceable by criminal as well as civil means does not necessarily convert it into a criminal law within the meaning of Pub. L. 280. <em>Otherwise, the distinction between \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 4 of that law could easily be avoided and total assimilation </em>permitted.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 211 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1089], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">We find it significant that <em>Cabazon </em>declined to modify <em>Bryan </em>on a crucial point of law: Section 1360 does not confer on California the power to enforce its full panoply of general civil regulatory jurisdiction over Native American Indian <em>tribes. </em>We conclude therefore that <em>Bryan </em>is controlling on this point. <em>(Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County, supra, </em>426 U.S. at pp. 385, 389-390 [96 S.Ct. at pp. 210-, 2111-2112]; accord, <em>Cabazon, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 208 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1087-1088]; <em>Boisclair, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 1150; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>v. <em>Naegele Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 509, 519-520 [213 Cal.Rptr. 247, 698 P.2d 150]; <em>Hydrothermal Energy Corp. </em>v. <em>Fort Bidwell Indian Community Council, supra, </em>170 Cal.App.3d at p. 494; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Chemehuevi Indian Reservation, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at p. 856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">No cases have been cited to us, nor do we find any law, to support the position taken by the Appeals Board that section 1360 is a congressional waiver of Tribe\u2019s sovereign status. In <em>Three Affiliated Tribes </em>v. <em>Wold Engineering </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 877 [106 S.Ct. 2305, 90 L.Ed.2d 881], the United States Supreme Court again emphasized that nothing in section 1360 confers state jurisdiction over the tribes themselves, stating: \u201cPublic Law 280 certainly does not constitute a \u2018governing Act of Congress\u2019 which validates this type of interference with tribal immunity and self-government. We have never read Pub. L. 280 to constitute a waiver of tribal sovereign immunity, nor found Pub. L. 280 to represent an abandonment of the federal interest in guarding Indian self-governance.\u201d (476 U.S. at p. 892 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2314].) If Congress had intended to confer state workers\u2019 compensation jurisdiction over Native American Indian tribes when it enacted Public Law 280, it would have expressly said so. <em>(Tibbetts </em>v. <em>Leech Lake Reservation Business, supra, </em>397 N.W.2d at p. 887.) Section 1360 is unquestionably not such an expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>With these principles in mind, we address the specific conclusion of the Appeals Board and find it erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">C. <em>State Workers\u2019 Compensation Laws Are Regulatory, Not Prohibitory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law is a statutory system enacted under the constitutional grant of plenary power to the Legislature to establish a complete and exclusive system of workers\u2019 compensation. (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lab. Code, \u00a7 3201.) It is an expression of police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3200 et seq.) reflects California\u2019s strong state interest in ensuring certain and reasonable compensation for workers injured in the course and scope of their employment. It is a civil regulatory law. It is the quintessential example of regulation by the state in its purest form: Rights to common law remedies are usurped by a set of highly structured, specific rules regarding work injuries. The purposes of the act are several. \u201cIt seeks (1) to ensure that the cost of industrial injuries will be part of the cost of goods rather than a burden on society, (2) to guarantee prompt, limited compensation for an employee\u2019s work injuries, regardless of fault, as an inevitable cost of production, (3) to spur increased industrial safety, and (4) in return, to insulate the employer from tort liability for his employees\u2019 injuries.\u201d <em>(S. G. Borello &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Industrial Relations </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 341, 354 [256 Cal.Rptr. 543, 769 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">In this case, the Appeals Board implies that California\u2019s exercise of police power to regulate industrial injuries somehow transforms the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act into a penal statute. This outcome, reasons the Appeals Board, is reinforced by the requirement in Labor Code section 3700 that every employer in California, except the state, is required to \u201csecure the payment of compensation.\u201d Moreover, the Appeals Board alludes to the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>that under California law \u201c[t]he failure to secure the payment of compensation ... is a misdemeanor.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3700.5.) Embracing this logic, the Appeals Board concludes that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is prohibitory, hence criminal, under <em>Cabazon </em>and that Congress grants California criminal jurisdiction to enforce its civil regulatory workers\u2019 compensation laws against tribal employers, ostensibly under section 1162. This rationalization must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">Invoking a criminal sanction for its violation does not necessarily convert a statute or ordinance into a criminal law under section 1162 and make the statute enforceable in Indian country under Public Law 280. <em>(Cabazon, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 211 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1089].) Often the police power of a state is equated with the power to govern. However, characterization of regulatory legislation as an expression of police power does not authorize the state \u201cto bulldoze away everything lying within its path.\u201d <em>(Pacific Employers Ins, Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 634, 640 [33 Cal.Rptr. 442].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">Here, the Appeals Board relied on the police power origins of California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws to support its characterization of these laws as \u201ccriminal/prohibitory.\u201d To the contrary, California does not prohibit industrial injuries; it regulates them. The Appeals Board ignored the manifest regulatory status of our state workers\u2019 compensation laws as well as the fact that Congress under section 1360 did not grant states regulatory jurisdiction over Native American Indian tribes. Additionally, we find the Appeals Board\u2019s sinuous logic undermined by the fact that Tribe actually carries some sort of workers\u2019 compensation insurance which paid for Sherron\u2019s medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">Curiously, Sherron did not seek to have either the WCJ or the Appeals Board order Tribe to file a copy of its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy in the proceedings below. It is well established that the party seeking the relief afforded under the state workers\u2019 compensation laws has the burden of proving the requisite jurisdictional facts. Nonetheless, Sherron asserts in his answer that \u201c[n]o evidence was submitted to the record to indicate the insurance policy had some way of compensating injured workers for residual problems with their injuries.\u201d Sherron requests that we order Tribe to file the policy. The insurance policy is not part of the record on review and thus cannot be considered. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">Furthermore, we note that an exhaustion-of-remedy issue is neither before us nor determinative of the outcome. That is, assuming Sherron had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>aware of his tribal remedies and failed to exhaust them before filing a state workers\u2019 compensation claim, there remains the threshold issue of subject matter jurisdiction and Tribe\u2019s right to be protected from Appeals Board/ state interference under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. (See <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Indus. Com\u2019n, supra, </em>696 P.2d at pp. 228-230 [purchase by Arizona tribe of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, which by its terms made applicable Arizona\u2019s state compensation laws, did <em>not </em>constitute waiver of the tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity from state law and its industrial commission].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\"><em>Tibbetts </em>v. <em>Leech Lake Reservation Business, supra, </em>397 N.W.2d 883, is consistent with our analysis of the jurisdictional issues before this court. Minnesota, like California, is a Public Law 280 state. In <em>Tibbetts, </em>the Minnesota Workers\u2019 Compensation Court of Appeals determined that Public Law 280 constituted a congressional waiver of a tribal employer\u2019s sovereign immunity from state workers\u2019 compensation liability for its employees. The Supreme Court of Minnesota reversed for several reasons, including its dismissal of the notion that Minnesota\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 176.001 et seq.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was not a civil regulatory law under <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Itasca County supra, </em>426 U.S. 373. <em>(Tibbetts </em>v. <em>Leech Lake Reservation Business, supra, </em>397 N.W.2d at p. 887.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">In the case before us, the Appeals Board declined to find <em>Tibbetts </em>relevant. However, we find that the stated purpose underlying Minnesota\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws is virtually the same as that expressed in article XIV, section 4 of the California State Constitution. We conclude therefore that <em>Tibbetts </em>is relevant to the issues in this case; it is also sound law and persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Consistent with <em>Tibbetts, </em>the State of Washington\u2019s board of industrial insurance appeals declined to find jurisdiction to enforce a workers\u2019 compensation claim against a tribal employer. <em>(In re: William L. Mathews </em>(1994) 21 Indian L. Rep. 5131.) Following <em>Bryan, </em>the industrial appeals judge stated: \u201cThe Department of Labor and Industries\u2019 procedure for processing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation claims is an administrative, or civil/regulatory process, and therefore, such jurisdiction was not authorized by Congress.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5132.) The judge also stated that claimant was not left without a remedy. \u201cIndian tribal courts are effective forums for the exclusive adjudication of claims involving Indians and non-Indians alike.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly, in <em>Zempel </em>v. <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund </em>(Mont. 1997) 938 P.2d 658, the Supreme Court of Montana upheld the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by the state workers\u2019 compensation court over a workers\u2019 compensation claim filed by an employee of a tribally owned business who was injured on the Indian reservation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 664.) Likewise, a recent Appeals Board case, <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Sycuan Gaming </em>Center, WCAB Case No. SDO 207197, involved the same issue before this court. The workers\u2019 compensation judge dismissed the injured employee\u2019s application for compensation benefits with prejudice on March 22, 1996, finding no waiver of sovereign immunity either by congressional act or by the Indian tribe. Reconsideration apparently was not sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">D. <em>40 United States Code Section 290 Is Not Applicable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Finally, this court invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing regarding the relevance of 40 United States Code section 290 which gives a state limited jurisdiction to apply its compensation law on federal lands located within the state boundaries to cover injuries sustained by employees not directly employed by the federal government.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 290 does not operate as a congressional waiver of Tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity in this case and was not intended to apply state workers\u2019 compensation laws to Native <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>American Indian <em>tribes. (Tibbetts </em>v. <em>Leech Lake Reservation Business, supra, </em>397 N.W.2d at pp. 887-888.) It is not dispositive of any issues before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">For the reasons discussed above, section 1360 is not a congressional waiver of Tribe\u2019s right to sovereign immunity from state workers\u2019 compensation liability. The Appeals Board does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">The decision of the Appeals Board dated July 29, 1996, is reversed. Parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">Peterson, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 22, 1998. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">Petitioner also seeks a peremptory writ or in the alternative a writ of prohibition. The Legislature has adopted the \u201cwrit of review\u201d as the statutory method for review of compensation decisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board and for \u201cinquiring into and determining the lawfulness of\u2019 the orders, decisions, and awards of the appeals board. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5950.) Although a writ of mandate shall lie in proper cases (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5955), such extraordinary relief is both duplicative and unnecessary in the matter before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">The WCJ heard evidence that an injured worker can appear before the tribal council when he or she has a contested issue. Under questioning by the WCJ, Ms. Reyes testified as follows: \u201cQ Is there any sort of system set up to deal with a situation in which an injured worker feels he is not receiving the correct medical treatment? In other words, do you have a workers\u2019 compensation court set up to deal with injured workers who are appealing the benefits that are being provided under this workers\u2019 compensation policy?</p>\n<p id=\"ARS\">\u201cA No, we do not.
