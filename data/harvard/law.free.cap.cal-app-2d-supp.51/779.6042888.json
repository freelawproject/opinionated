It further appears, without conflict, that the defendant did not cross Hill Street, as charged, but crossed Sixth Street. Without pausing to consider whether or not this variance between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 781\">*Supp. 781</page-number>charge and proof amounts to a failure of proof, we note that it also appears, without dispute, that the defendant began his journey across the roadway while the traffic was advised by the signal devices in operation that it could \u201cGo\u201d and that he was already several steps into the roadway when the signal changed. Two or more persons who had progressed as far as had the defendant before the signal changed to \u201cStop,\u201d ventured no further in the direction they had been going, but turned about and returned to the sidewalk they had lately quitted; the defendant walked on to the opposite sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In order to avoid being classed as a criminal, what is a person caught in progress across a roadway, when the traffic signal changes from \u201cGo\u201d to \u201cStop,\u201d to do? Is he to stop in his tracks (and possibly in those of the street car company also) and await the release of a \u201cGo\u201d signal? Such a construction of the code provisions would result in so much danger to the trapped pedestrian and in such a snarl of traffic that it is to be avoided if another solution of the question is reasonably possible. <em>(Department of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>[1939] 14 Cal. (2d) 189, 195 [93 P. (2d) 131].) Equally absurd would be the requirement that he turn at right angles to the course he had been following, so as to proceed with the new flow of traffic and in the path of the vehicular traffic. Only two alternatives are left him; either to retrace his steps or to go on. But if either of these choices violates the injunction that \u201cpedestrians shall not cross the roadway against a red or stop signal,\u201d both do, for movement in either direction would be against the signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">There is a construction of the code provision which avoids the absurdities noted, and does so without placing any strain upon the words the legislature selected. Of the many meanings in which the word \u201ccross\u201d may be employed, there is one in common use that aptly fits the word as it appears in the section we are considering. It is the first definition of \u201ccross\u201d as a verb given in 25 C. J. S. 10: \u201cTo pass from side to side.\u201d It is among the definitions given in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2nd ed.): \u201cTo pass or extend from one side to the other of; ... as, to cross a stream ...\u201d Within this definition, a person born in the Middle West does not cross the continent if he journeys either to the Pacific Coast or to the Atlantic Seaboard. Nor does one cross the continent by plane between sunrise and sunset, if the first hundred miles of the trip is made before sunrise, or the last hundred miles is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 782\">*Supp. 782</page-number>made after sunset. So also, one who has advanced into the roadway, even though but a few steps, before the appearance of the \u201cStop\u201d signal, cannot be said to cross the roadway against that signal, whether he returns to the curb he has just left or continues on to the opposite curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Support of some strength is found for our conclusion in cases holding that it is not a violation of an ordinance prohibiting the crossing of roadways except in crosswalks for one alighting from a street car in a safety zone to cross from the zone to the curb outside a crosswalk. In <em>Croxall </em>v. <em>Broadway Department Store, </em>(1932) 127 Cal. App. 153, 156 [15 P. (2d) 546], the court stated: \u201c. . . the pedestrian crossing from the safety zone to the curb does not come within the strict letter of the ordinance relating to those who are crossing the roadway from curb to curb. (The ordinance, whose pertinent provisions are quoted, uses no such term as \u201ccurb to curb\u201d; that appears to-be the court\u2019s interpretation of what it means to cross a roadway.) See also <em>Brockway </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., </em>(1938) 29 Cal. App. (2d) 244, 247 [84 P. (2d) 524], and <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>(1936) 82 F. (2d) 992, 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Further support for our conclusion is found in the provisions of section 476, added to the Vehicle Code in 1939. This section deals with the respective conducts of vehicular traffic and of pedestrians as affected by green or \u201cGo,\u201d yellow or \u201cCaution\u201d and red or \u201cStop\u201d signals. So far as pertinent to our problem it is provided that when the green or \u201cGo\u201d signal appears, \u201cPedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk,\u201d but that when the red or \u201cStop\u201d signal is shown, \u201cNo pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until green or \u2018Go\u2019 is shown alone.\u201d Reading sections 563 and 476 together, they appearing as parts of the same code, we conclude that a pedestrian may not, where traffic control signals are in operation, <em>enter </em>upon the roadway until the green or \u201cGo\u201d signal is shown, but that when it is shown, he may not only enter upon but <em>proceed </em>across to the opposite side of the roadway, even though the signal changes to red or \u201cStop\u201d before he completes his passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Shaw, J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
