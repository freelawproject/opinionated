Elaine Bialcddk, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b376-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ajj\">Appellant contends' that its' records were \u201csubstantially, complete., and. accurate.\u201d and .that, the. Tax Commissioner lacked authority \u2019to institute the test, check herein, .This court finds, that contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">, First, appellant\u2019s cash register tapes and guest checks were inadequate based upon statutory, requirements and this court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonald\u2019s </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 5. R. C. 5739.10 authorizes the Tax Commissioner to conduct a test check when a vendor fails to comply \u00a1with the requirements of.R., C.: 5739.11 that, .it keep1 \u201ccomplete, and-accurate records \u00f3f sales, together, with-.a. record of the tax collected thereon.\u201d ... .. \u25a0 ...</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">, <em>Jn, McDonald\u2019s, supra,, </em>this court held, at page, 8, that \u201cthe record-keeping requirements within R. 0.5739.11 -must-be construed in a manner.which will.allow the-T'ax.Commis.sioner .to .determine if .sales taxes which should have-b\u00e9en charged-by-vendors were actually.collected.and remitted A the state Treasurer * * * [and] in order to be \u2018adequate,\u2019 a vendor\u2019s records must enable the Tax Commissioner to ascertain if the proper sales tax was collected according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">As in <em>McDonald\u2019s, </em>the.cash register tapes here are inadequate.: Appellant\u2019s tapes-reveal only daily, totals for each of three categories of sales. Such information is not sufficiently detailed to \u201callow the. Tax Commissioner to determine if sales taxes which should have been, charged * * * were actually collected and remitted * * * .\u201d Further, appellant\u2019s guest checks were found to be incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">Appellant contends further that the test check was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>conducted \u201cfor a representative period,\u201d as required by R. C. 5739.10 and 5739.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">However, the record indicates that the Tax Commissioner\u2019s agent consulted with the taxpayer and, together, they selected the week of May 1, 1974. Appellant has not shown that the test check was not conducted \u201cunder conditions, which approximate, as nearly as possible, the conditions under which the business was operated by the taxpayer during the audit period.\u201d <em>Cherry Street Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St. 2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Therefore, appellant, having \u201cfailed to carry out <em>* * * </em>[its] burden of proving which of * * * [its] sales are exempt <em>(Cherry Street Corp., supra), </em>the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and is, therefore, affirmed.,</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-8\">0\u2019Neill, C.
