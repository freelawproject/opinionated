Util. Comm. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">On authority of that case, the commission was correct in finding the appellant to be in violation of R. 0. 4921.07, 4921.10, and 4921.14. In this case, the commission issued a cease and desist order, as in <em>Duff, </em>and imposed the further penalty of a 30-day suspension of the appellant\u2019s irregular route certificates. The appellant holds 19 irregular and 9 regular route certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The appellant set out as one ground for rehearing and appeal that \u201c [t]he order is unreasonable and unlawful because the discipline imposed on CMF is excessive and unreasonable and is, thus, an abuse of discretion by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">This court has held that the commission has authority under R. C. 4921.10 to suspend motor transportation certificates for good cause. In <em>Dworkin </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 174, 111 N. E. 2d 389, the court upheld an order suspending operations under a certificate for 30 days, based upon violations of state tax and licensing laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>load limit regulations, and administrative orders. Paragraphs two and three of the syllabus provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u2018 \u2018 The authority to revoke, alter or amend includes the lesser authority to suspend operations under a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201cSuch action by the commission for \u2018good cause\u2019 may be based on a violation of a statute or a valid rule or order of the commission. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In <em>Ohio Transport </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 98, 128 N. E. 2d 22, the court affirmed an order of the commission revoking a contract carrier permit because of numerous violations of load limit laws. The court stated in paragraph three of the syllabus that:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u201cThe determination of the character and degree of. the administrative action to be invoked against a carrier is the duty of the Public Utilities Commission, and such determination by the commission will not be disturbed by this court unless it is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">In those cases, the carriers were found to be in knowing violation of explicit statutes and rules. The instant case presents a very different situation. Here, the appellant claimed that it was legally entitled to \u201ctack\u201d its irregular and regular route certificates. The commission concedes that there is no statute, rule, or regulation which prohibits the practice of \u201ctacking,\u201d and at the time this action was commenced, the issue was in litigation before the commission in the <em>Duff </em>case, upon a complaint filed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Under these circumstances, though the court affirms the commission\u2019s finding of a violation, the majority of the court cannot agree that the suspension of appellant\u2019s irregular route authorization was reasonable as a penalty for that violation. Appellant has presented a colorable legal argument that tacking is permissible, an argument which the court agrees has been urged with more vigor, than persuasion. Federal decisions do permit \u201ctacking\u201d of regular and irregular interstate routes, though it should be noted that \u2022 federal route certificates differ significantly from their Ohio counterparts: <em>Aetna Freight Lines, Inc. </em>(1948), 48 M. C. C. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>'' Were'there a definite\u2019 commission rule, order,; or decision either forbidding tacMng of different certificates by a Single operator dr requiring prior approval by the commission for such practice, there would be no question that the penalty was reasonable-. Here, the- penhlty = of a major- suspension- of -this operator\u2019s permit was imposed' because the operator engaged in a questionable\u2019practice; which other operators also engaged in, as shown by \u2022 the <em>Buff </em>6\u00e1se,- 'a\u00f1d which the commission had under'advisement at the time. Under these circumstances the penalty df a 30-day suspension is unreasonable:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Under this court\u2019s jurisdiction to modify orders Of the commission, the court modifies this order solely to-remove the' 30-day suspension of the appellant\u2019s operating privileges pursuant to its irregular route authority. .The order is affirmed -in all other respects. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed'as* modified.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-7\">\u25a0 O\u2019Neill, C.

Util. Comm. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 186, decided this date, insofar as it affirms the findings and conclusions- of the Public Utilities Commission. However, I am unable to agree with the majority\u2019s modification of the penalty. imposed Upon appellant by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The appellant in that case filed the complaint with the commission alleging that the aforesaid Duff Truck Line, Inc., was conducting certain movements which were illegal. The \u201cillegal\u201d conduct complained of by the appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that-Duff was \u201ctacking * * * an irregular route certificate to another regular or irregular route certificate.\u201d It should he noted that this is the identical activity of which appellant is accused. - ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Appellant, as its defense to the charge in the instant case, states that since there are no statutes or commission rules or regulations which specifically prohibit the tacking of certificates and since there are no indexes or regularly published reports of commission cases, it was impossible to ascertain whether the movements included in this case were unlawful. This kind of a sham defense, under these circumstances, not only is repugnant but also is insulting. An attempt to assert innocence through ignorance of the law while pointing the finger of accusation against a competitor is ignorance of another design, and I cannot condone such subterfuge by removing the 30-day- suspension imposed by the commission. 1 -, \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Counsel for the appellant admitted at the hearing .that \u201cthis is a matter that has been ruled-on by this commission in. at least five different other cases and in the Supreme. Court of Ohio on at least four.\u201d As recently as-February 11, 1976, this court impliedly recognized the distinction, be-, tween regular and irregular route certificates in the case of <em>Sewell Motor Express, Inc., </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Commercial Motor Freight knew that it was improper to \u201ctack\u201d'regular and irregular route certificates.' -What-', ever rationalization it may presently seek, to employ to excuse its admitted impropriety should not be sanctioned, by this court. To do so makes a perversion of the clear statutory intent in R. C. 4921.10 and a mockery of the standard of \u201cshowing \u00bf public convenience and necessity\u201d bef\u00f3te a certificate mil be granted. . .</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-8\">W.
