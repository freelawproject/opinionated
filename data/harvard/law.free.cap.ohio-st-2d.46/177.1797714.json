See <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society </em>(1975), 421 U. S. 240, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141, <em>147 F. D. Rich Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Lumber Co. </em>(1974), 417 U. S. 116, 126. See, also, 1 Speiser, Attorneys\u2019 Pees, Sections 12.1,12.3 (1973). This rule is followed in Ohio,.* See <em>Shuey </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 413; <em>State, ex rel. Michaels, </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 599; <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Vogelin, </em>(1950), 152 Ohio St. 538; <em>State, ex rel. Beebe, </em>v. <em>Cowley </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 377. The. rationale behind the creation and perpetuation of the aforesaid rule is that \u201c ['t]he subject of costs is one entirely of statutory allowance and control.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Michaels, </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>supra.(165 Ohio St. at 607).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We are well aware that the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d has been criticized in- recent years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but, in our view any departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>from such a deeply-rooted policy as the exclusion of attorney fees as costs is a matter of legislative concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Appellee contends, however, that \u201c [a]n award of attorney fees is within the purview of an action under Section 3319.16 of the Revised Code and the pleadings in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">R. C. 3319.16 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u201cAny teacher affected by an order of termination of contract may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which the school is located * <em>* *. </em>Such appeal shall be an original action in said court and shall be commenced by the filing of a petition against such board, in which petition the facts shall be alleged upon which the teacher relies for a reversal or modification of such order of termination of contract. * * * The court shall examine the transcript and record of the hearing and shall hold such additional hearings as it deems advisable, at which it may consider other evidence in addition to such transcript and record.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201cUpon final hearing, <em>the court shall grant or deny the relief prayed for in the petition as may he proper in accordance with the evidence adduced in the hearing. * * *\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Appellee contends that the emphasized portion of R. C. 3319.16 set forth above impliedly permits the Court of Common Pleas, in the exercise of its equitable powers, to permit the recovery of attorney fees in situations where the public policy of this state would otherwise be subverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">We disagree. The General Assembly has expressly provided for the recovery of attorney fees, as part of the costs of litigation, with respect to certain statutory actions. See, e. <em>g., </em>R. C. 163.21, 309.13, 733.61, 1313.51, 5519.02. See, also; <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Cotner </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 17; <em>State, ex rel. White, </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St. 2d 37; <em>Shuey </em>v. <em>Preston, supra. </em>In light of the expressed precedent in this state, <em>State, ex rel. Michaels, </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>supra, we defer to the General Assembly on the matter of statutory authorwation of recovery of attorney fees as part of the costs of litigation. Accordingly, we hold that R. C. 3319.16 does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>not provide statutory authorization for the recovery of attorney fees in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Appellee\u2019s final contention is that attorney fees may be awarded, as an exception to the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d as part of the relief granted a petitioner in actions where the losing party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, obdurately, or for oppressive reasons. In support of his assertion, appellee cites <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>(1889), 46 Ohio St. 367; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Mason </em>(1859), 10 Ohio St. 277; <em>Fortman </em>v. <em>Rottier </em>(1858), 8 Ohio St. 548; <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1839), 9 Ohio 104; <em>Channell </em>v. <em>N. C. R. Union </em>(1971), 28 Ohio App. 2d 260; and <em>Stolberg </em>v. <em>Members of Bd. of Trustees for State College of Conn. </em>(C. A. 2, 1973), 474 F. 2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>an action in tort to recover damages for an assault and battery, the court held, in the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cIn an action to recover damages for a tort which involves the ingredients of fraud, malice, or insult, a jury may go beyond the rule of mere compensation to the party aggrieved, and award exemplary or punitive damages; and this they may do, although the defendant may have been punished criminally for the same wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u201cIn such a case, the jury may, in their estimate of <em>compensatory </em>damages, take into consideration and include reasonable fees of counsel employed by the plaintiff in the prosecution of his action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The rule enunciated in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>has consistently been followed in Ohio, although without agreement as to whether such attorney fees are allowable as compensatory,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or as punitive,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> damages. We do not depart from this well-settled rule of law, but do not perceive its application to the instant cause. The cases relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>by appellee,' with the exception of <em>Channell </em>v. <em>N. C. R. Union, supra</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Stolberg v. Members of Bd. of Trustees, for State College of Conn., </em>supra,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> involved actions for malicious prosecution, assault and- battery, and other related- theories sounding in tort. They- did not involve, as here, an action, instituted pursuant to a specific statutory provision, brought for the purpose of terminating a contract. \u25a0 - - \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Moreover, in his complaint filed in the Court of Comnlon Pleas, -appellee did. not allege that the R. C.' 3319.16 proceedings were instituted by appellant in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, obdurately, or for oppressive reasons.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Furthermore, neither the Court of Common Pleas nor the Court of Appeals below expressly held that appellant\u2019s actions in seeking to terminate appellee\u2019s contract' were of that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the bad faith, vexatious, wanton, obdurate or oppressive conduct exception to the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d that attorney fees are not recoverable in the absence of statutory authorization is not properly presented in the instant cause. Therefore, we need not determine, under the facts of this case, whether the rule of law expressed in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>should be extended beyond its present limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, affirming the allowance of attorney fees, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.

The Court of Common Pleas held plaintiff\u2019s removal from office to be \u201cunwarranted, \" unauthorized\u2019, arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.\u201d Upon motion of the plaintiff for attorney fees, the Court of Common Pleas granted same. The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating: \u201cin the absence of any positive rule or law to the contrary, we would not be justified in setting aside the order appealed from as being either unjust or unlawful.\u201d It is apparent, then, that the Court of Appeals did not develop its reasoning for affirmance of the award of attorney fees. Since we are, of course, not bound by-decisions of the various Courts of Appeals in\" this state, and since we are unpersuaded- by the \u201creasoning\u201d of the Court of Appeals in <em>Chan~ nell, </em>we reject application of <em>Channell </em>to the cause at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In <em>Stolberg, </em>the plaintiff, a college, assistant professor, instituted an action pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.
