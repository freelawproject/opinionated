The Court of Appeals agreed that \u201cthe arrest of Hubbard in St. Clair Township was a legal arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Appellant has not directly appealed or challenged those findings, but argues, in effect, that once officer Bar-nickel was outside of the city of Hamilton he ceased to be a policeman with respect to Anderson. Such argument fails to recognize that the offenses for which Anderson was charged and convicted arose out of Anderson\u2019s interference with a concededly valid policeman-arrestee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The record adequately establishes a violation of R. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>2921.31, that appellant obstructed official business, and of R. C. 2921.33, that appellant did \u201cinterfere with a lawful arrest of himself or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-7\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Stern and W. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b264-8\">Celebrezze, J., concurs in the judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b264-9\">Corrigan and P. Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Hn <em>obiter dicta, </em>the opinion in <em>Fairborn </em>v. <em>Munkus </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St. 2d 207, 209, reads: \u201cThe general common-law rule is that the power of a municipal police officer is limited- to the boundaries of his municipality, and that he may not, even with a warrant, make an arrest outside his territory for a misdemeanor.\u201d See, also, <em>State </em>v. <em>Vanbarg </em>(1975), 44 Ohio Misc. 11; <em>State </em>v. <em>Elder </em>(1953), 67 Ohio Law Abs. 385; Opinions of Attorney General (1974), No. 74-094. But, cf., R. C. 737.19, which authorizes a village marshal to \u201cpursue and arrest any person fleeing from justice in any part of the state,\u201d and R. C. 2935.30, which gives a municipal police officer \u201cof another state\u201d certain arrest powers when in \u201cfresh pursuit\u201d of a person believed to have committed a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The court states:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u201cThe officer was in pursuit; the officer had a right to make the arrest after he was pursuing him [Hubbard] for offenses which occurred within the city of Hamilton. And it\u2019s my opinion that anyone obstructing that arrest under the state law, the officer would, also, be entitled to arrest him. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to hold * * * [where] a police officer is lawfully chasing a person for an offense which occurred in his community that if at the end of the chase someone tries to interfere with him arresting that man, he is violating the law. And I hold that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b264-10\">Corrigan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av7\">dissenting. Absent statutory authorization, an arrest without a warrant for the commission of a misdemeanor, committed in his presence but not within the municipal limits which he serves, cannot be made by a police officer outside the corporate boundaries of the municipality which he serves.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
