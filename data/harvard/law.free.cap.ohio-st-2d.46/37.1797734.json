C. 3501.11 (K), and therefore controlling, because it concerns a matter of local self-government. See <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 338, and progeny. It is appellant\u2019s position that because Section, 2, Article X requires the clerk of council to determine the sufficiency of a referendum petition, the board of elections is thereafter without power to do so, and acts in a purely ministerial c\u00e1p\u00e1city to place the referendum on the ballot.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>W\u00e9 disagree..</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Section 2, Article X, provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\"><em>\u201c* * * </em>When said petition is filed the clerk of the-council shall first ascertain the sufficiency of the petition, and, if found sufficient, the council shall thereupon, -within thirty (30) days of the filing of such petition reconsider such ordinance or resolution. If council fails t\u00f3 repeal! said ordinance o;f resolution within thirty (30) days the cc\u00ed\u00fcnci] shall submit it to a vote of the electors at the next general, or regular municipal election occurring more than ninety (90) days after the filing of such petition ***.\u201d-'</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">R. C: 3501.11 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u201cEach board of elections shall <em>* * *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\"><em>a </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u201c (K) Review, examine, and certify the sufficiency and validity of petitions and nomination papers [.] \u201d ;</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">In clear language, Section 2, Article X of the Fairview Park charter-requires the clerk of council to determine the sufficiency of a1 referendum petition prior to action thereon by council. R. C. 3501.11 (K) imposes upon the board of elections the subsequent responsibility to review, examine* and certify the sufficiency and validity of the petition. The Fairview'Park charter makes no reference to the board of elections, nor purports to negate duties imposed upon the board by R; C: 3501.11 (K). Thus, we fail to see a conflict b\u00e9tween-these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">In <em>State ex rel. Janasik, </em>v. <em>Sarosy </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 5, the Telator sought to prohibit the board of - el\u00e9ctions from placing a referendum on the ballot. The board-denied that it had -a duty to ascertain the v\u00e1lidity of - the1 petitions, beca\u00fas\u00e9'th\u00e1t was the responsibility of the village clerk.' W\u00e9 held: b \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201c * * * [E]ven though such petitions are retained by the clerk and the initial duty is on such clerk to determine the validity' of the petition, if a protest is mad\u00e9 to the board \u00e1s to the validity of the petitions it is incumbent on the board to examine and determine the validity of the petitions. \u2019\u25a0\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>'\u25a0 </em>Previously, in <em>State, ex rel. Ehring, </em>v. <em>Bliss </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 99, we stated, in paragraph one of the syllabus: <em>1 </em>\u2018Under the provisions of Section 4785-13^ .General Code [now R. C. 3501.11], and cognate sections, a county board of elections is authorized to review, examine and certify the sufficiency and validity of petitions and-nominating papers oven in the absence of a protest thereto. <em>(State, ex rel. McGinley, </em>v. <em>Bliss et al., Board of Elections, </em>149 Ohio St. 329, approved and followed.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Appellant asserts that <em>Sarosy </em>is inapposite, because it concerned a non-charter municipality, and because the village clerk therein, pursuant to R. C. 731.29, was not specifically required to determine the sufficiency of the petition, but only to accept its filing, and certify the text of the ordinance, or measure to the board of elections. R. C. 731.29- further states, however, that the \u201c* * * clerk shall retain the petition.\u201d Implicit in this statute1, as we recognized in <em>Sarosy, </em>is the requirement that the village clerk make an initial determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. Thereafter, pursuant to R. C. 3501.11(K), the board of elections must make its own determination. In its procedural aspects, <em>Sarosy </em>is indistinguishable from, and therefore governs, this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Because the complaint in mandamus herein challenges the fact bf the board\u2019s discretion, not an abuse thereof, the Court of Appeals properly granted the motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint. A writ of mandamus will not issue to control judicial or quasi-judicial discretion.'</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-9\">O\u2019NeU\u00edL, C. J., Corrigan, Stern, Ceuebrezze, W. Brown and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b82-10\">Herbert, J., concurs except for the footnote.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AR\"> Appellant, citing <em>State, ex rel. Kittel, </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 497,- also- asserts that once- the clerk of council has determined a referendum .petition to be sufficient, and council has \u00a1accepted that determination by passing a resolution submitting the, referendum to a vote of the city's electors, the board of elections has po ..authority to reverse the finding of sufficiency. .......</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\"><em>In Kitt\u00e9l, </em>petitions to place a proposed charter \"amendment on the ballot -were circulated and filed. Thereafter, council \u2022 voted unanimously to submit the proposed amendment to the electors.- -The .sufficiency of the, petitions was challenged. Interpreting Section 9, \u00a1Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, which provides that \u201c[a]mendm,ents to any charter framed and adopted as herein provided may-be submitted to' the electors of a municipality by a two-thirds vote' of the legislative authority thereof '* * this court, in paragraph two; of the syllabus, held that when \u201cthe legislative. authority in fact passes an ordinance of submission by :,a vote of two-thirds or more of .its, members, any defects in the filing or signing of the petition become immaterial * *</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">. Therefore,' appellant\u2019s reliance upon paragraph three of the syllabus in; <em>Kittel, </em>Which states' that a eouncilmanic determination of the sufficiency of <em>\u00e1' </em>petition is \u201cconclusive\u201d in the absence-of fraud, or gross abuse of discretion, is misplaced, since the sufficiency or insufficiency of the petitions in <em>Kittel </em>was irrelevant, and the language in paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>three dictum. See. <em>State, ex rel. Bd. of Edn., v. Morton </em>(1975), 44. Ohio St. 2d 151, 153-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">\u25a0- Moreover, our\u2019 decision in <em>Kittel </em>was in no way concerned with .the duty imposed by statute upon a board of elections to determine the suffi'cieh'cy''''\u00f3f' petitions. That is to s\u00e1y, G. -C. 4785-13k\" -(how .ft. C. 3501.11(K)), which imposes the duty upon the-board to determin\u00e9 'sufficiency and validity, was not discussed or involved. \u25a0 , .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
