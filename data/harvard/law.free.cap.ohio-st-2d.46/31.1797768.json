In such a case, the jailer in effect represents the lower court * * <em>*. We </em>believe that such a conclusion is required by <em>Fallen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 139.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In the case at bar, appellant filed his original notice of appeal with the Legal Officer of the Chillicothe Correctional Institute on July 18, 1975, well within the time for perfecting his appeal. Through no f\u00e1ult of appellant, the notice of appeal was erroneously mailed to Lucas County. Therefore, appellant, who properly followed institution procedure, has filed his notice of appeal \u201cin time\u201d by delivering such notice \u201cto the proper prison authorities for forwarding to the court.\u201d <em>Williamson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals for a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b74-9\">O\u2019Neill, C.
