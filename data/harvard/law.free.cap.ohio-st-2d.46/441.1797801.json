No affidavits or other evidentiary support is submitted by respondent to support his denial of the cotnplaint\u2019s allegation relating' to the adoption of a charter by the \"electors of Garfield Heights. Thus, respondent has failed to comply with Civ. R. 56(E) which requires that he \u201c* * * must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Respondent\u2019s answer, which admits paragraph three of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>complaint which sets forth Section 9. of the Charter, presents a patent inconsistency with his apparent denial of the charter\u2019s existence, further emphasizing why respondent \u2022can not here rest upon such denial \u25a0 to avoid \u2018 summary' j\u00fadgm\u00e9nt. ' \" . ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u25a0 Disposition of this case is made upon the basis of State, <em>ex rel. Platz, </em>v. <em>Mucci </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 60, on-both the \u2022question- of whether a public school .t eacher is in public employment and whether a charter provision prohibiting a member of. council, from.holding other- public office or public employment\u201d is constitutional. Thus, we hold that a public school teacher receiving a salary supported by tax moneys is in other public employment, and the creation of a class prohibited as to \u201cpublic employment\u2019-\u2019 has a reasonable basis so as to be within the equal protection clause \u2022of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The filing of this action in this court was authorized \u25a0on-January 26; 1976, by resolution of the city council of relator, and was so filed on February 2,1976. The time lapse between the action of relator to obtain judicial determination herein and respondent\u2019s election of -November 4, 1975, was not inexpedient nor was relator\u2019s payment of respondent\u2019s salary tantamount to a condonation. The issue here is the right of r\u00e9spondent to the office of -member of city coun-cil in light of the qualification and forfeiture provision as aforesaid and does not involve a question of entitlement to salary. The defense of laches is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Accordingly, a writ of quo w\u00e1rr\u00e1nto is allowed'.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\n<em>Writ alloived.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
