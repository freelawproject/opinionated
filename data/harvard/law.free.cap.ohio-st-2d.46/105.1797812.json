Util. Comm., supra, </em>at page 46, it was held that when an order of the commission changing utility rates has been reversed by this court for failing to adequately set forth the reasons prompting the decision, \u201cthe increased rates pursuant to such order could no longer be lawfully charged, and those fates in effect prior to the above order were reinstated by operation of law, and continued in effect until further order of the commission.\u201d The utility raises two issues in this case: whether <em>Slagle </em>applies to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 403, 330 N. E. 2d 1, and whether <em>Slagle </em>was erroneous and should be overruled. Since the utility-raises substantial questions as to the correctness of <em>Slagle </em>itself, we find it appropriate to begin our consideration with that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The difficulty presented in this case and in <em>Slagle </em>is that the statutory plan for public utility regulation set out in Title 49 of the Revised Code does not specifically prescribe' the immediate effect upon existing rates of this court\u2019s' reversal .of a commission order revising rates; nor do the statutes prescribe a particular procedure to be fol-' lowed. <em>. i '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The process of public utility rate-making in Ohio isi wholly controlled by statute. Any public utility desiring to&lt; establish a rate or to change an existing rate must file ai written application with the commission. R. C. 4909.18. The duty of the commission is to determine the justness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and reasonableness of the proposed rates, based upon the valuation of the utility\u2019s property, giving due regard to relevant factors such as the necessity for making reservations for surplus, depreciation and contingencies, and such other matters as are proper according to the facts of each case. R. 0. 4909.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The process of rate-making frequently involves extensive hearings, voluminous testimony, and the determination of difficult and abstruse technical questions which must be resolved on the basis of complex and often disputed evidence. The function of the commission is to carry through this process, in accordance with the statutory plan, and to fix lawful and reasonable rates based upon the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The function and jurisdiction of this court in an appeal from an order of the commission is limited. Under R. C. 4903.13, our task is to affirm an order of the commission if it is not unreasonable or unlawful. This court has often emphasized the limited nature of that authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Our function is not to weigh the evidence or to choose between alternative, fairly debatable rate structures. That would be to interfere with the jurisdiction and competence of the commission and to assume powers which this court is not suited to exercise. \u2018 \u2018 * * # The members of this court are neither accountants nor engineers, and manifestly it would be unfair to the litigants and to the commission for the court to pretend that it is in a position to better evaluate the evidence and determine the difficult question of the reasonableness of the order than is the commission.\u201d <em>Dayton </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 160, 162, 187 N. E. 2d 150. Our task is not to set rates; it is only to assure that the rates are not unlawful or unreasonable, and that the rate-making process itself is lawfully carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In large measure, the purpose of the decision in <em>Slagle </em>was to affirm the limited nature of this court\u2019s jurisdiction in these types of cases. Our decision was that this court\u2019s reversal of a commission order rendered that order of no further legal effect. Upon a literal reading of the duties of this court under R. C. 4903.13, that decision is a logical result, for the statute directs that the order be \u201creversed, vacated or modified\u201d if found to be unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The order which this court reversed in <em>General Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 271, 285 N. E. 2d 34, and which was later at issue in <em>Slagle, </em>was an order which was defective because the commission had failed to carry out its statutory duty to provide adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law. This court could not modify the order without indulging in extensive examination of the record and improper speculation as to the actual basis for the decisions made by the commission, nor could this court determine that the order was based upon the evidence. Upon a literal reading of R. C. 4903.13, it would appear that this court might only reverse or vacate the order, in the sense of ending the order\u2019s legal effect, while leaving any subsequent proceedings for remedying defects in the order to the judgment of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In fact, however, upon further reflection and examination of Ohio\u2019s statutory plan for public utility regulation, and of the principles upon which this court\u2019s jurisdiction is based, we are now convinced that our decision in <em>Slagle </em>was in error and must be reversed. Several considerations compel this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">I A.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The opinion of this court in <em>General Telephone </em>reversed the order of the commission,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in <em>CE1, supra </em>(42 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>St. 2d 403), we reversed in part and affirmed in part. In both cases, this conrt remanded the. canses to the commission. ..</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">To \u201cremand\u201d is to send a canse back to .the original tribunal for -further proceedings, generally upon orders or directions from the higher court. \"When a court acts to remand a cause,- it is not itself finally determining the outcome of the cause, nor is it executing a judgment in favor of one of the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment is given legal effect when it is executed by the lower tribunal, and the judgment as rendered is that of the tribunal to. which the cause had been remanded. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Kemper </em>(1887), 45 Ohio St. 93, 11 N. E. 130. Since the effective, final .judgment upon re7 mand is that of the lower tribunal, it is. manifest that this' court\u2019s judgment does not. take effect as a matter of Jaw. In <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 400, 159 N. E. 475, this court was .called upon- to interpret Section 2 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Article IV of the Constitution, which, then as now, confers the jurisdiction of this court in terms virtually identical to R. C. 4903.13, <em>i. e., </em>jurisdiction to \u201creview and affirm, modify, or reverse\u201d the judgment. The court held, in paragraph one of the syllabus, that the authority of this court to remand is \u201c* * * a necessary concomitant of the jurisdiction to review, affirm, modify, or reverse.\u201d That decision concerned an appeal from a Court of Appeals, but the same principle must apply here, since virtually identical jurisdictional language is involved. The holding in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>supra, necessarily affirms that this court has authority to remand causes to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">That conclusion is also supported by other authority and by accepted practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Labor Board </em>(1939), 305 U. S. 364, it was held that a federal Circuit Court of Appeals had inherent authority to remand a cause to a federal board, based upon statutory provisions for review similar to those at bar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This court has also frequently recognized and exercised the authority to remand cases to administrative boards. In <em>Superior Metal Products </em>v. <em>Admr., Bur. of Employment Services </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 143, 146, 324 N. E. 2d 179, it was stated: \u201cThis court holds that the power to reverse and vacate decisions necessarily includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>power to remand the cause to the decision maker.\u201d The same principle has been applied to various other types of cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and. has been applied as well in order to remand cases, for further proceedings even without reversal of the decisions below. <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>State </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 613, 169 N. E. 299; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Schenck </em>(1856), 6 Ohio St. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">This court has impliedly recognized the existence of such authority in appeals from the. commission on numerous occasions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have also specifically held that this court has the authority, and even in some cases.the duty, to remand causes to the commission. In <em>East Ohio Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1938), 133 Ohio St. 212, 12 N. E. 2d 765, paragraph thirteen of the syllabus states</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u201cWhere the court determines that certain findings of the Public Utilities Commission are unreasonable and unlawful while others were properly made, and from the record the court is unable to substitute specific findings for those improperly made by the commission, it is the duty of the court to remand the proceedings to the commission, as a fact finding body, with, instructions to carry out the rulings of the court and correct the. findings which were found to be unreasonable and unlawful. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">All of these considerations conclusively establish that this court does possess the authority to remand causes to the commission, as we did in both <em>General </em>Telephone, <em>supra </em>(30 Ohio St.'2d 271), and <em>CE1, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">As was pointed out above, the effective judgment upon remand is the judgment of the lower tribunal. See R. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>2505:37 ;an.d\u00a1 2505,39. That principle applies to. orders of the commission,; -and it therefore follows that the execution of: this, court\u2019s judgment of reversal - and, remand occurs only when, the; commission carries out the- mandate; of thin court by its,order and not, as held in <em>Slagle., </em>at-the moment of this, court\u2019s reversal by operation of law. \u25a0 . : .</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">IB.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u25a0 In <em>Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1923), 107 Ohio St. 370, 140 N. E. 86, this, court specifically\u2019,held that the. reversal and remand of-a- rate schedule : did-.not act to \u2022 automatically reinstate \u25a0 the rates theretofore, in,force. The'court, at page 374, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\"><em>\u201c </em>*.*\u25a0\u2022* Therefore, when- the order -of the Public Utilities Commission was reversed by this court, and the \u25a0cause remanded generally for further proceedings according to law, the. cause came again before the;Public Utilities Commission.for the exercise by it of.its judgment, apd, .if the record before it was not sufficient to enable it. to intelligently exercise' such judgment, it was its- duty to either itself -supplement that record or permit- the parties interv usted to make such supplement, and then base its conclusion upon such record.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">\u25a0 -Thecircumstances of that case were unusual, as pointed out -in <em>Sldgle. </em>The reversal of the rate schedule was or-i defed- Without\u2019 an accompanying, majority opinion by the court. Nevertheless, the court did recognize the authority to. remand.cases to the commission, and. recognized, as well, that, the reversal and remand did not act to automatically reinstate- th\u00e9 .previous rate schedule.. \u2019 \u25a0 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">-' : A simil\u00e1r, issue was presented in <em>Keco </em>v. <em>Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co. </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 254, 141 N. E. 2d 465: Ip that!-case, the issue Was whether an .action .for unjust enrichment lies, to- recover an increase in -rates charged by a public utility under -an order of the eommis-f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sion, where the order is subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court on the grounds that it is unreasonable and unlawful. The court, in <em>Keco, </em>held that an action for restitution did not lie. For the present purposes, it is significant to note t'he dates involved\u2014the increase in rates was granted by an order dated May 28, 1953; on May 25, 1954, this court reversed and remanded the cause; and on June 4, 1954, the commission issued its order reducing the rates. The appellant sought restitution for the period from May 28, 1953 to June 4,1954. Thus, this court\u2019s dismissal of the entire claim to a right of restitution necessarily held that the original rate order remained in effect during the period after this court\u2019s reversal and before the commission\u2019s new order.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The opinion in <em>Keco </em>did not specifically consider the moment at which this court\u2019s reversal and remand of a commission order takes effect, so that the case cannot be considered binding precedent on the issue herein. Nevertheless, that case and the <em>Cincinnati \u00a3 Suburban Bell </em>case, <em>supra </em>(107 Ohio St. 370), are persuasive authority and are the only cases on point in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">1 C-</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Most importantly, the holding in <em>Slagle </em>is incompatible with the statutory scheme for regulation of public utilities established by the General Assembly in Title 49 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The basic principle of Ohio\u2019s regulatory scheme for uti'ifv ra.tc\u00ab is that those rates are to be set by the commission upon hearings and evidence, and that only those rates which have been found to be fair and reasonable after such hearings may lawfully be charged. Utilities are protected by being assured a fair rate of return, while consumers are protected by being assured that service will be adequate and rates reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The rates fixed by order of the commission then go into.effect immediately unless stayed by the. filing of a \u2022bond during an appeal, and the order establishes the only .rate which the utility may lawfully charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The. basic, argument in support of the position in <em>Slagle </em>isthat when this court reverses a commission order approvirig a revised rate schedule, the order, and the schedule are then no longer in effect. Therefore, it is argued that B.. C. 4905.32 \u00a1applies, which provides that: ,</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u201c\u00d1o-;public utility shall charge, demand, exact, receive, or collect-a different rate, .rental, toll, or charge for.any service rendered,, or to be rendered, than that applicable to such service as specified in its schedule filed with the Public Utilities Commission which is in effect at the, time. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ATB\">There are. fundamental practical and statutory objections to. that, construction of the statute., The logical result of that-argument would be that no rate could be charged, since this court had struck down the only rate schedule which was filed and. in effect with the commission. That result would of , course be manifestly unfair and , perhaps disastrous, for .-the unlucky utility.. In other, states, it .has accordingly been held.that the utility in .such, cases.has a right to charge a reasonable rate. <em>Arizona Corp. Comm. </em>v. <em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1951), 71 Ariz. 404, 228 P. 2d. 749; <em>Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Georgia. Pub. Serv. Comm. </em>(1948), 203 Ga. 832, 49 S. E. 2d 38; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Hutchinson Gas Co. </em>(1928), 125 Kan. 346, 264 P. 68; 73 Corpus Juris Secundum 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">_ Presumably, it. was in order to. prevent such an imr permissibly-..burdensome. result ,that <em>Slagle </em>adopted the principle, that\u2019 the effect of reversal was to reinstitute the rates charged by the utility before the order complained :.of. But those .-rates, are ones the commission has rejected as.unreasonable. That .act might b.e based upon some legal fiction that the old 'rates are still constructively or. presumptively filed. Yet, the.practical effect is that this court would bo directly ordering a utility to charge rates found to be unreasonable by the commission, rates which differ from those actually-on file and which are only marginally and technically more defensible than any other past rate schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The statutory framework for utility rate-making, conflicts with such a holding. Various statutes require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>public utility rates \u201cshall be just, reasonable, and not more than the charges allowed by law or by order of the Public Utilities Commission\u201d (B. C. 4905.22); that a utility\u2019s rates shall hot differ from those \u201cspecified in its schedule filed with the Public Utilities Commission which' is in effect at the time\u201d (B. C. 4905.32); and that if the utility \u201cdoes or causes to be done, any act or thing * * * declared to be unlawful\u201d it is liable in treble damages to the person, firm or corporation injured thereby (B. C. 4905.61).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\\ The heart of this statutory plan is that the only proper rate is that set out in the approved rate schedule on file with the commission and open to public inspection, and that this schedule can be ch\u00e1nged only by an order of the commission. ' \u25a0 '' \u25a0 \u2022 \u25a0 <em>\u201c</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">B. C, 4909.17 provides, in part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">1\u201cNo rate, joint rate, toll, classification, charge, or rental, no change in any rate, joint rate, toll, classification, Charge, or rental, and n\u00f3 regulation or practice affecting any rate, joint rate, toll, classification, charge, or rental of a public utility\u2019 shall become effective until the Public Utilities Commission,' by order, determines it'to bb j\u00fast and reasonable <em>*\u25a0* </em>\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Even more specific is B. C.' 4909.15, which-provides, in part, that after the commission has ordered\u2019that a new \u2018fate be substituted' for an existing one \u201c * * * no change in the rate, fare, toll, charge, rental, schedule,'classification, or service, shall he made, rendered, charged, demanded, exacted, of changed hy such public utility without the order of the'commission, and any other rate, fare, toll, Charge, rental, classification, or service is prohibited J\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">/ For this court to require, upon penalty of treble damages, that a public utility change its rates before the commission itself has ordered a change, would he to f eq\u00fair\u00e9 the Utility to directly violate B. C. 4909.15. ....</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">\u00d1o such result was intended'by the General Assembly in its delineation of the authorities of the commission and of thi\u00e1'c\u00f3\u00fart. Bather, the st\u00e1tutes make clear that-public \u25a0 Utilities are'required to'charge the'rates andfees' stated' in the schedules filed with the commission pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>commission\u2019s orders; that the schedule remains in effect until replaced by a further order of the commission; that this court\u2019s reversal and remand of an order of the commission does not change or replace the schedule as a matter of law, but is a mandate to the commission to issue a new order which replaces the reversed order; and that a rate schedule filed with the commission remains in eff\u00e9ct until the commission executes this court\u2019s mandate by an appropriate order. This holding is consistent with the basis Of this court\u2019s jurisdiction, with precedent and established practice, and with the statutory framework for public utility rate-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">I D.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The difficulty which today\u2019s holding does pose is that the customers of public utilities may be charged a rate found by this court to be unreasonable or unlawful during the period preceding the execution of this court\u2019s mandate by an order of the commission. There are a number of answers to this difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">First, the \u201cunfairness\u201d is often merely technical or wholly illusory. In both <em>General Telephone </em>and <em>GE1, </em>supra, it was the utility which appealed the rate orders. In the former case, the order was found by this court to be technically insufficient, but upon remand the commission reinstituted exactly the same rates which it had originally found reasonable. <em>Slagle, supra. </em>There is no apparent unfairness in charging that same rate in the brief interim period. In <em>CE1, </em>this court found that the rates granted were too low, so that any delay in adopting a new rate schedule would tend to continue rates which this court had found to be unreasonably low. If there is any unfairness in this, it is to the utility and not'to the consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Second, even in cases where this court finds that rates should be reduced, the commission has a clear responsibility to do this promptly. If it becomes apparent that there will be a long delay in establishing new rates, the commission also has authority to temporarily alter rates under the emergency powers of R. C. 4909.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Third, the practical problems of administering rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>hearings and appeals therefrom necessarily cause delays, and there is simply no way that an-immediate and perfect modification of utility rates can-be achieved.-The language quoted with approval in <em>Keco,, supra </em>(166 Ohio St.), at page 259, applies with equal force in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u201cIt may seem inequitable to permit the defendant to retain the difference in the. rates-collected under the May 28, 1953, order of the commission and the rates finally fixed by the commission on June 4, 1954, but absolute equity in a particular case must sometimes give way to the greater overall' good. In adopting a comprehensive scheme- of public utility rate regulation, the Legislature has found. it impossible to do absolute justice under all circumstances. For ex\u00e1mple, under present-statutes a utility may not charge increased rates during proceedings before the commission seeking same and losses sustained thereby may not be recouped. Likewise, a consumer is not entitled to a refund of excessive rates paid during proceedings before the commission seeking a reduction in rates. Thus, while keeping its broad objectives in mind, the Legislature has attempted to keep the equities between the utility and the consumer in balance but has not found it possible to do absolute equity in every conceivable situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II. --</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">'\u2022 - As mentioned above, appellant has- urged that the present case is distinguishable from <em>Slagle, </em>because in that ease the entire order of the commission was struck down for failing to comply with the statutory requirements as to the form of an order, whereas in this case the order was formally sufficient, but was reversed in part because this court found that some of the commission\u2019s findings were unreasonable and unlawful. That distinction would have the paradoxical effect of permitting a utility to charge rates after this court had in f\u00e1ct found them to be unreasonable and unlawful, but, under <em>Slagle, </em>of forbidding the utility to charge rates which the commission had found to be reasonable and which this court had not actually even considered. In any event, since we find that the rule itself is faulty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>we need not further consider whether an exception to it should be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">We also need not address the constitutional issues raised by the appellants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We hold that the rates in effect for appellant prior to the commission\u2019s November 28, 1973, opinion and order were not reinstated by operation of law when this court reversed that order in part. The June 16,1975, order of the commission, which so held, is unlawful and it is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.

I do not now quarrel with the first paragraph of the syllabus, although I have doubts that it is necessary to a resolution of this cause. I view the second paragraph of the syllabus as a presently needed declaration of the legal principle suggested by the practical effect of <em>Keco Industries </em>v. <em>Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co. </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 254. As noted below, this principle was not carried into the <em>Keco </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\"><em>Keco </em>arose because, on May 28,1953, the utility in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>case was awarded a rate increase by the commission and the city appealed to this court. <em>(Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>[1954], 161 Ohio St. 395.) Finding the increase to be unreasonable and unlawful, the court reversed the order setting new rates and, on May 25, 1954, the cause was remanded to the commission for further proceedings. On June 4, 1954, .the commission ordered the rates reduced. Subsequent thereto, Keco Industries sued the utility, alleging that the latter had been unjustly enriched by the amount of the rate increase charged between May 28, 1953, and June 4, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Paragraph two of the <em>Keco </em>syllabus states:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u201cWhere' the' charges collected by a public utility are based upon rates which have been established by an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, the fact that such order is subsequently found to be unreasonable or unlawful on appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, in the absence of a statute providing therefor, affords no right of action for restitution of the increase in charges collected during the pendency of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">It is clear to me that the above words, \u201cpendency of the appeal,\u201d refer to the preceding phrase, \u201cappeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d Throughout the opinion, Judge Matthias leaves no doubt of his intention in this regard. At page 258, the opinion states:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u201cIn the present case we have rates which were established by the proper designated authority after a hearing and consideration in full compliance with the law, and, <em>until such time\u25a0 as they were set aside by the Supreme Court, </em>they were, in the absence of a stay, the lawful rates and the <em>only </em>ones which could be collected by the utility.\u201d (Emphasis added in part.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">And, again, at <em>page </em>259:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\u201cFrom the above consideration it is our conclusion that the rates of a public utility in Ohio are subject to a general statutory plan of regulation and collection; that any rates set by the Public Utilities Commission are the lawful rates until <em>such time as they are set aside </em>as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>unreasonable and unlawful <em>by the Supreme Court </em>* <em>* </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">' \u2022 It would '.seem logical that) an. appeal to - this court is concluded when' an entry of judgment is entered' here, or, with more certainty, when an order of remand is issued and the mandate of the court is officially entered upon the record. However, as described in <em>Keco, </em>this court issued its mandate on May 25, 1954, and the commission\u2019s responding order was not entered until June 4..</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">If the appeal to this court was no longer pending after May 25, logic would dictate that the increase in rates charged during the above ten-day period would have fallen outside both the syllabus and the opinion- in the ease. However, the court\u2019s final judgment' denied restitution for the entire period sought. c</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">When this court decided <em>Gene </em>Slagle, <em>Inc., </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 44, <em>Keco </em>was the only Ohio precedent from which guidance was available.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A reading of both the opinion and syllabus of <em>Keco </em>left open the question of the status of a PUCO order which has been reversed by this court as unlawful and unreasonable, and which has not been supplanted with a' subsequent order from that agency. As a pure legal issue, <em>Slagle </em>filled that void in a manner which seemed as natural as night following day\u2014when a PUCO order is finally reversed, it simply has no further effect in law; and the relative positions of parties which had been altered by the order reverted, from the time of reversal to the time of a new order, to that which existed in the absence of the order. At the time <em>Keco </em>was announced, such a conclusion was not only logical, it was also practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Unfortunately, the same does not obtain today. The logic of the premise remains, but its practicality has dissolved under a mountain of delay, occassioned by a deluge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>of filings in an agency which must do its best to cope with the 70\u2019s while statutorily geared for the 40\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In <em>Keco, </em>as heretofore noted, only ten days elapsed between this court\u2019s mandate and the responding PUCO order. Eighteen years later, as illustrated in <em>Slagle, </em>the period of time between this court\u2019s mandate and the agency order had ballooned to 85 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As I now view it, our error in <em>Slagle </em>was not in announcing an invalid principle of law, it was in our understandable unwillingness to accept, as inevitable, the inordinate delays now associated with important PUCO decisions. Hence, the instant syllabus and judgment represent the acceptance of, and a necessary response to, reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">As a regulated monopoly, appellant\u2019s production and marketing of its product rests mainly in the hands of the legislative branch of our state government. This is so with all public utilities in Ohio. Equally entrusted to the General Assembly is an obligation to protect the interests of the consumer of the utility\u2019s product. It has long been recognized that balancing these often competing and always vital concerns is a serious and demanding responsibility, the totally satisfactory execution of which has been elusive to some of the best minds of bur times.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">As stated by the trial judge in Keco, <em>\u201c* * </em>* the Legislature has attempted to'keep the equities between the-utility and the consumer in balance but has not found it possible to do absolute equity in1 every conceivable situation.\u201d Apparently, the viability of that observation has not diminished with time. Hopefully, however, the search com tinues for a permissible result which will put- it to permanent rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">As heretofore stated, the- somewhat paradoxical conclusion that a reversed PUCO .order - remains efficacious in the absence of a concomitant stay of its execution results, in my opinion, from a recognition of extant exigency. At the .heart of this determin\u00e1tion, however, would seem to be the thought that R. C. 4903.13 withholds from this court the power to remand a cause to the PUCO, for its further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>-consideration, in the absence-of an accompanying reversal, vacation or modification.-.-.Were.it not- so,- the outcome in. <em>General </em>Telephone <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. </em>Comm. (1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 271, <em>Slagle, </em>and the instant cause below' could have been different, and the litigatory thrashings about which have- ensued, as-a-result of those- cases could have easily been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">My suggestion in this regard should- not be interpreted as an advocacy of advisory opinion writing, as I doubt that such a drastic alteration of the traditional posture of the Ohio Judiciary would, or could, necessarily follow from a utilization- b\u00a3 the above ..procedure; As a matter of fact, this court has already employed- the method in at least two cases, both of which concerned an area of the law involving the same basic derivative jurisdiction as does the caus\u00e9\" at.bar. See <em>B. F. Keith Columbus Co. </em>v. <em>Bd. of </em>Revision (1947), 148 Ohio St. 253, 74 N. E. 2d 359; <em>T. F. Scholes, Inc., </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1956), 166 Ohio St. 67, 139 N. E. 2d 7; R. C. 5717-04; R. C. 4903.13; Section 2 of Article IY of the Constitution of Ohio (as amended November 7, -1944) ; Section 2 (B) (2) (c) of Article IY of the Constitution of Ohio (as amended May 7,'1968). It has yet to be suggested that the court\u2019s disposition of those two appeals, under their facts, was anything but permissible, appropriate and efficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In the field of public utility law, there exists a constitutionally recognized need for broad cooperation between this court and the agency whose heavy burden it is to execute its statutory function as expeditiously-as possible. The presence- of authority in this court to remand without reversal may now be worthy of serious consideration. Perhaps it would constitute a worthwhile contribution to the efficiency so sorely needed and diligently pursued--by many in state government today.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b163-11\">I remain convinced that <em>Cincinnati &amp; Suburban Bell Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1923), 107 Ohio St. 370, could not reasonably have provided a precedent for deciding the issue involved in <em>Slagle, </em>nor is it of value to us in the instant cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
