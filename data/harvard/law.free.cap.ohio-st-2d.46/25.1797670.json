' ; ; \u25a0\u2022'..,\u2022\u2022 ' :</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">..In <em>Hoffman v. United States. </em>(1951), 341 U. S. 479, 486, the United States. Supreme Court stated with \u2018respect to a witness\u2019s'-privilege against. self-incrimination: : \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\"><em>\u201c* * </em>* It is for the court to say whether his silence is justified, Rogers v. <em>United </em>States, 340 U. S. 367 (1951), and to require him to answer if. <em>\u25a0 </em>it \"clearly -appears to the court that he is mistaken.\u2019 <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>75 Va. 892, 899 (1881).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">The court stated further, at page 488, that it must be U* \u25a0* <em>f -tiperfectly clear,: </em>from- a-oarefuT consideration of all the circumstances in.the case, that-the' witness Is-mistaken, and the answer[s] cannot possibly have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate. *.* * [Citations omitted.]\u201d s \u2019 '/</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">.. .. Front a review.of the record, this, court agrees.with the Court of Appeals that \u201c [t]here is evidence that Everett was a companion and accompanied the defendant the night before the killing, and during the intervening time up to the time of the killing. Any statement Everett made under oath during the trial of defendant could be used against him upon a subsequent trial of his own. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>had a duty to protect the constitutional rights of Everett as well as to ensure defendant a fair trial. The trial court could not compel Everett to testify, and to have done so, or in any way coerce Everett, would have been reprehensible. * * *\u201d See <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">With regal\u2019d to the prosecution\u2019s conduct herein, the instant case is distinguishable from the recent case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(C. A. D. C. 1973), 478 F. 2d 976, which involved a similar fact situation. In that case the court, reversing defendants\u2019 convictions, held, at page 979, that \u201c [w]e think that the prosecutor\u2019s warning was plainly a <em>threat </em>that resulted in depriving the defendants of * * * [the witness\u2019s] testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the instant case, no such \u201cthreat\u201d was involved. In Everett\u2019s own words, \u201cHe [Mr. Jacobson] didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t want me to testify; he said it was something or another that I didn\u2019t have to testify, or something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">This court does not find any improper action prejudicial to defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.
