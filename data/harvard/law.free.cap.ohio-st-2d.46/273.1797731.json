Cf. <em>Salyers </em>v. <em>Burkhart </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 186, 339 N. E. 2d 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Initially, appellant submits that the degree of fort ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>munity:afforded boards of education<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be extendedlo' school teacheis. In support of this contention, appellant relies lip\u00f3n <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn., supra </em>(32 Ohio App. 2d 297;)) in which the court stated that teachers are immune from liability .for''torts committed within the- scope of'-''those duties- involving the exorcise of judgment and- discretion^ A close reading of the opinion in <em>Hall </em>reveals that the Court of Appeals addressed itself only to those defend-' ants mentioned in the appellant\u2019s assignment of error: (The Columbus Board of Education, an elementary school principal,' the superintendent of the Columbus Public School System and the assistant superintendent.) Further-\u00bb more, the language in the syllabus regarding the liability of teachers:wa's not necessary to a resolution of the issues before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Decisions, from other jurisdictions have rejected such immunity claims on behalf of public school teachers. In <em>Crabbe v. County School Bd. of Northumberland Co. </em>(1968), 209 Va. 356, 164 S. E. 2d 639, suit was brought against the school board and a high school teacher whose alleged negligence caused injuries to a pupil. After holding that- th\u00e9 school board was immune from liability, the Supreme' Court of Virginia addressed itself to the issues of the teacher\u2019s responsibility, .stating at page 359:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">* *. .\"We do not agree with the contention of this, defendant that the immunity of the school board from liability to-'the: plaintiff extends to him. It is true that at the time, the. plaintiff was injured through the alleged negligence of the. defendant Albrite, the latter was employed in and performing his duties as an instructor at the school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>But the fact that Albrite was performing a governmental function for his employer, the school board, does not me tin that he was exempt from liability for his own negligence in the performance of such duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Remanding the case for a new trial, the court, at page 360, concluded by finding that \u201c* * * the plaintiff has stated a good cause of action against defendant Albrite, even though the school board involved enjoys the sovereign immunity of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Similarly, in <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Koustenis </em>(1970), 260 Md. 98, 271 A. 2d 547, the defendant teacher attempted to raise the immunity of the board as a bar to the action. In considering that argument, the court noted that a teacher is not required to take an official oath, receives no commission, is not commonly thought of as an officer or occupant of an office, and does not exercise the sovereign powers of government. Based on those factors, the <em>Duncan </em>court concluded that a teacher is not a public official,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but rather is a professional contract employee of the state, and not entitled to the immunity from tort liability vested in school boards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Other courts are in agreement with the holdings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Crabbe </em>and <em>Duncan, </em>and have refused to extend the tort immunity of the board to its teachers or other employees. See <em>Lovitt </em>v. <em>Concord School Dist. </em>(1975), 58 Mich. App. 593, 228 N. W. 2d 479; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1959), 184 Kan. 486, 337 P. 2d 652; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Calamus Com. School Dist. </em>(Iowa 1970), 174 N. W. 2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">As stated in <em>Leymel </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>105 Cal. App. 694, 699, 288 P. 858:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u201c* * * No matter how highly we regard the profession of teaching, we cannot conclude that the teacher is exercising some of the sovereign powers of the state in performing the arduous duties of his profession. He must be paternal * # * the moralist * * * a disciplinarian * * * an educator * * <em>*. </em>In doing these things he can accomplish them as the man and the citizen, and for success in his endeavors he does not need to be clothed with any of the sovereign functions of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Appellant contends further that teachers stand <em>in loco parentis </em>to their students and should be accorded the same tort immunity which is given to parents. See <em>Teramano </em>v. <em>Teramano </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St. 2d 117, 216 N. E. 2d 375.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we agree that a teacher has the obligation of maintaining supervision and discipline within the areas of his responsibility, it does not follow that the considerations of public policy expressed in <em>Teramano </em>would be served by granting teachers the immunity therein accorded to parents. In <em>Teramano, </em>the court was concerned with the \u201cparental relationship\u201d and implicitly with the effects on the peace and harmony of the home if tort actions were allowed by a child against his parent. Clearly, the parent-child relationship is unique, and the effect upon classroom environment of a student\u2019s suit against a teacher is minimal when compared to the disruptive influence on the home that would result from a tort action by child against parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>' \u2022 \u25a0 Other courts have considered the <em>in loco parentis </em>a'rgu-. ment, and have used the duties arising from the teacher-pupil relationship as a basis for imposing a standard of due care-'-u-pon the'teacher, 'Speaking'of ibis responsibility, the Suprem\u00e9 Court of Vermont in <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1965), 124 Vt. 445, 207 A. 2d 146, stated, at page 448:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><em>te\u00bb * </em>#-pn a'limited' sense the'teacher stands in the parent\u2019s place in his relationship to a pupil under his care and chkrge, and has such-\u00bf.'portion\u2019of the.powers of the parent over the pupil as is necessary to carry out his em-. ployment. In such relationship, he owes his pupils the duty of supervision, and' if a failure 'to use due care in such supervisi\u00f3n' results in injury to the pupil in his charge,' makes him liable to such pupil. Common sense and fairness must c\u00e1lT-forthe exercise of reasonable care-in such-duty of. supervision, not-.\u00f3nly' in the Commission of acts -that will not injure the pupil, but in a neglect or failure to act, when from such failure to act,'injury results-. *\u25a0 *\u2022 * If the teacher is liable for misfeasance, we .find no- sound reason why; he' should \"not also be held liable for nonfeasance, if his-acts \u00f3r neglect are the direct proximate cause of the injury to the pupil. \u201d \u25a0 ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u25a0 - Likewise,-in <em>Gaincott </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1937), 281 Mich. 515, 518, 275 N. W. 229, 231:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u201cAt least in a limited sense the relation of a teacher to a pupil is that of one <em>in-\u2019loco, parentis. </em>We are not here concerned -with the law applicable to. punishment- \u00f3f a- pupil by a teacher; but rather with the law\"applicable to the duties of a- teacher in the care and custody of a pupil. In the faith--ful discharge-of such duties .the teacher is-bound to use. reasonable Care, tested in the.',light: of the existing relationship. If, through negligence^ the teacher is guilty of a breach of such duty and in consequence thereof a pupil-suffers injury, liability results. It. is not essential to such liability that the teacher\u2019s negligence should be so extreme as to be wanton or wilful.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Thus, the distinction noted iii <em>Segerman </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>(259 A. 2d 794) is pertinent. Although teachers may stand <em>in loco parentis </em>as regards the enforcement of authority, teachers do not stand <em>in loco parentis </em>with regard to their negligent acts. A teacher is civilly liable for negligently causing the injury of a child, while a parent of the child is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In <em>Guyten v. Rhodes </em>(1940), 65 Ohio App. 163, 29 N. E. 2d 444, the court stated, at page 165:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cIf the teacher is liable for malfeasance, there appears no sound reason why he should not be held liable for either misfeasance or nonfeasance, if his acts or neglect are the direct proximate cause of injury to the pupil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Additionally, a large number of decisions from other jurisdictions demonstrate that tort immunity is not accorded to teachers<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and that actions against them for personal injuries resulting from their negligent acts have been consistently allowed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>From a review of the instant record, this court agrees with the finding of the Court of Appeals that there were genuine' issues as to material facts before the trial court and, therefore, the entry of summary judgment was improper.
