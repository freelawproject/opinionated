Canada, </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 191, 151 N. E. 2d 722; <em>State, ex rel. Petit, </em>v. <em>Wagner </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 297, 164 N. E. 2d 574; <em>Leavers </em>v. <em>Canton </em>(1964), 1 Ohio St. 2d 33, 203 N. E. 2d 354; <em>State, ex rel. Mullin, </em>v. <em>Mansfield </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St. 2d 129, 269 N. E. 2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">At the heart of appellant\u2019s contention is her assertion that the phrase \u201cgeneral laws\u201d must include the common law of the state. Such an argument was rejected in <em>Leis </em>v. <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. </em>(1920), 101 Ohio St. 162, 128 N. E. 73, and wo are not convinced that a departure from the holding in <em>Leis </em>is presently desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Appellant asserts further that the ordinances are invalid because the certificate requirement and warranty do not trar a real and substantial relationship to the general of the nublic.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">The \u201creal and substantial relationship\u201d standard, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>used to test the constitutionality of a municipal police regulation, is stated in <em>.West Jefferson </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1965), 1 Ohio St. 2d 113, 119, 205 N. E. 2d 382:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u201cPolice regulations, whether by ordinance or statute, will frequently interfere with, the enjoyment and use of property and with the making-of contracts.. However, this court has consistently held that a police regulation having that effect may be valid unless it clearly appears that such regulation bears no real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare, of the public or is unreasonable or arbitrary. \u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">See <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Columbus </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 103, 146 N. E. 2d 854; <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>Cleveland </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 127, 163 N. E. 2d 682; <em>Ghaster Properties, Inc., </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 425, 200 N. E. 2d 328; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Oberlin </em>(1965), 1 Ohio St. 2d 143, 205 N. E. 2d 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">; Moreover, because municipalities are presumed to be familiar with local conditions and the needs of the community, a court will not substitute its judgment for legislative discretion unless there has been a clear and palpable abuse of power. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Oberlin, supra; Allion </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 416, 124 N. E. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In the case at bar, Ordinance No. 556-1973 encourages inspection of residential housing prior to sale and, thus, supplements enforcement of the city\u2019s housing code. The ordinance bears witness to the city\u2019s attempt to preserve the quality of its existing housing stock and, in that respect, possesses a real and substantial relation to the-public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public, and is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Appellant also argues that the warranty established by subsection (D) is vague and indefinite, and violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. From an examination of subsection (D), it is sufficiently clear that an implied warranty of compliance with the city\u2019s building and zoning codes is created and that the warranty runs to the prospective buyer. Thus, the provisions are not so vague that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at their meaning and differ as to their application. <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 161, 324 N. E. 2d 563; <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 26, 266 N. E. 2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In reply to the cross-appeal, appellant urges that the necessity of a warrantless inspection by appointment prior to issuance of a certificate of inspection, and the attendant criminal penalty imposed by subsection (F), are contrary to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">From an examination of Ordinance No. 556-1973, it can be seen that the homeowner, prior to entering into a contract for the sale of the property, is required to tender to the prospective buyer a Certificate of Housing Inspection. The failure to so comply, with three exceptions, renders the seller subject to the criminal penalty provided in subsection (F) and- Ordinance No. 557-1973. A critical aspect of the legislation, however, is that the seller can obtain the certificate only by agreeing' to a time when an inspector is permitted access to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Obviously, the seller is faced with <em>a </em>serious dilemma'; either he must consent to a warrantless search or face the possibility of a criminal penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Generally, a search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United </em>States (1967), 389 U. S. 347, 358. Thus, it may be represented that because the' seller arranges for the inspection, including a proper time, he consents to the search. However, a valid consent involves a waiver of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>rights and cannot be lightly inferred; hence, it must be \u201cvoluntary and nncoereed, either physically or psychologically.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fike </em>(C. A. 5, 1972), 449 F. 2d 191, 193; <em>Phelper </em>v. <em>Decker </em>(C. A. 5, 1968), 401 F. 2d 232; <em>Cipres </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C. A. 9, 1965), 343 F. 2d 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In the case before ns, the coercion represented by the sole alternative of possible criminal prosecution clearly negates any \u201cconsent\u201d which may be inferred from the allowance of the inspection and, therefore, the validity, of such searches upon the basis of consent is not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">A finding that the provisions of subsection (F) and Ordinance No. 557-1973 cannot be constitutionally enforced is further warranted in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967), 387 U. S. 523. There, after a lessee refused to permit a warrantless inspection of his residence, he was arrested and charged with violation of a provision of the San Francisco Housing Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In reaching its determination that the Fourth Amendment bars prosecution of a person who refuses to permit a warrantless, code-enforcement inspection of his personal residence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court in Camara, at page 529, noted with approval its language in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948), 333 U. S. 10, 14:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u201c \u2018The'-right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but-to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance. When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman, or government enforcement agent. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Additionally, the <em>Camara </em>decision rejected arguments similar to those advanced by the city herein, <em>i. e., </em>that these types of warrantless administrative searches can be justified on the grounds that they make minimal demands on occupants,1 that warrrants in such cases are unfeasible, or that area inspection programs could not function under reasonable search warrant requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As applicable to the instant facts, the import of <em>Camara </em>is that the- Fourth Amendment prohibits placing appellant in a position where she must agree to a warrantless inspection of her property or face a criminal penalty. Therefore, where \u25a0 a municipal ordinance requires the owner of real property to tender a certificate of housing inspection to a prospective, buyer, and such certificate may be obtained only by allowing a warrantless inspection of the property-, the imposition of a criminal penalty upon the owner\u2019s failure to tender the certificate violates the owner\u2019s .rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Con-stitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The final issue raised in this appeal concerns the validity of the presumption in subsection (D).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There, the buyer is presumed not to have knowledge of any deficiencies in the structure unless (1) he signs a written statement specifically noting each deficiency, or (2) he derives a substantial part of his income from real estate operations or actively engages in that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">For a statutory presumption to be sustained, there must be a natural and logical connection, in light of com*<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mon experience, between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Tot </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1943), 319 U. S. 463; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>American Sugar Refining Co. </em>(1916), 241 U. S. 79; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc. </em>(C. A. 2, 1971), 446 F. 2d 480; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dempsey </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 219, 259 N. E. 2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In the instant case, subsection (D) provides that the sell r does not warrant that the structure is in substantial compliance with the building code where the buyer has aelual knowledge of the deficiencies in the structure. However, the ordinance also would presume no actual knowledi\u2019- of the buyer where he fails to sign the prescribed written statement. This is a result which would not naturally follow and which ignores common methods by which a buy- r may obtain such information; for example, through his actual observations or oral communications with the seller. Additionally, as noted by the Court of Appeals, to presume a buyer has actual knowledge of deficiencies solely because he engages in the real estate business does not take into consideration those defects which are discernible only from actual physical inspection. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the presumption, and exceptions thereto, must be declared to be arbitrary and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In view of all of the foregoing, the judgment of the. Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-8\">: O\u2019Neill,, C. J., Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze and P.

Although ,1 :: concur, I take this occasion. to express my views upon the imposition of, criminal penalties for the failure of a homeowner, to permit an-administrative inspection of. his. .premises. \u25a0 ; \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Justice Herbert accurately concludes that imposition of such criminal /.penalties upon an individual who. does not consent , to .a-warrantless inspection of her premises by a governmental .officer, pursuant to a city ordinance enacted to ensure-'the safety of its housing stock, violates the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u2022' Insertion of a clause within the ordinance at issue herein requiring'the officials charged with conducting the housing inspections pursuant to the aforesaid ordinance To obtain a search warrant whenever a homeowner refuses to. permit a warrantless inspection of his premises, after advising such person that he or she had a constitutional right to refuse entry of the officials without a warrant, would save the constitutionality of the criminal penalties provided in the ordinanee.-for the refusal of a homeowner to permit inspection of his premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967), 387 U. S. 523, buttresses the above conclusion. . .</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">In <em>Camara, </em>at page 534, the court held\":</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u201cIn summary, we hold that administrative searches of the kind at' issue here are significant intrusions upon the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment,- that such searches when authorized and conducted without a warrant procedure lack.the traditional safeguards which the -Fourth Amendment guarantees to the individual, and that .-the reasons put forth in <em>\u25a0Frank </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>and in other eases for upholding: these warrantless searches- are insufficient to justify so substantial a weakening of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections. - Because of the nature of the municipal programs under .consideration, however, these conclusions must be the beginning, not the end, of our inquiry. * \u2022* \u00ae\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\">The <em>Carhara </em>court, upon examination of the competing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>governmental and individual interests involved whenever administrative searches occur, concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u201c * * * But we think that a number of persuasive factors combine to support the reasonableness of area code-enforcement inspections. First, such programs have a long history of judicial-and public acceptance. See <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>359 U. S., at 367-371, 3 L. Ed. 2d at 882-884. Second, the public interest demands that all dangerous conditions be prevented or abated, yet it is doubtful that any other canvassing technique would achieve acceptable results. Many such conditions\u2014faulty wiring is an obvious example\u2014 are not observable from outside the building and indeed may not be apparent to the inexpert occupant himself. Finally, because the inspections are neither personal in nature nor aimed at the discovery of evidence of crime, they involve a relatively limited invasion of the urban citizen\u2019s privacy. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cHaving concluded that the area inspection is a \u2018rea-\"\u25a0nable\u2019 search of private property within the meaning of \u2022he Fourth Amendment, it is obvious that \u2018probable cause\u2019 lo issue a warrant to inspect must exist if reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an area \"Rpection are satisfied with respect to a particular dwelling. Much standards, which will vary with the municipal program being enforced, may be based upon the passage of \u201cme, the nature of the building (e. <em>g., </em>a multi-family apartment house), or the condition of the entire area, but they \"\u201c11 not necessarily depend upon specific knowledge of the \u25a0ndition of the particular dwelling. <em>* </em>* 387 U. S. at 537-538.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The <em>Camara </em>court capsulized the problem presented by die instant ordinance when it stated, at page 539:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u201c* * * in the case of most routine area inspections, there is no compelling urgency to inspect at a particular Hme or on a particular day. Moreover, most citizens allow mspeetions of their property without a warrant. Thus, as a Practical matter and in light of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>requirement that a warrant specify the property to be searched, it seems likely that warrants should normally be sought only after entry is refused unless there has been a citizen complaint or there is other satisfactory reason for securing immediate entry. Similarly, the requirement of a warrant procedure does not suggest any change in what seems to be the prevailing local policy, in most situations, of authorizing entry, but not entry by force, to inspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Since the insertion of such a \u201cwarrant\u201d clause into the ordinance at issue herein is a legislative judgment, it would be improper for this court to do so under the particular facts of this case. I write separately in this ease only to clearly indicate my views upon the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>as it applies to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
