C. 3319.11 to notify her by April 30th of its intent not to rehire her' and appellant is deemed reemployed by operation of law. This court finds that contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">In <em>State, ex rel. Rutherford, v. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 242, this court held in paragraph one of the syllabus, that: \u25a0 .</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">\u201cA teacher employed under a limited contract, having given, in accordance with Section .4842-8, (general dode [now R. C. 3319.11], a written notice to his board of education to the effect that he will not accept employment as. a teacher for the ensuing year, may withdraw such . notice provided he makes such withdrawal <em>before the board of education has acted upon such notice, </em>and before the fir^t day of June in the year of his employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">It is clear, under the facts in this case, that appellant\u2019s purported withdrawal of her resignation wap given more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>than two weeks after'-1he school board had acted thereon. Consequently, it was--not incumbent upon the appellc-e board of education to notify appellant'prior to April 30, 1974, that her contract of employment would not be renewed. See <em>State, ex rel. Ford, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Appellant is not entitled to the writ requested,- and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b384-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.
