Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">The question presented is whether an indigent criminfil defendant is entitled to a free transcript of a co-defendant\u2019s prior trial, to aid in the conduct of his own defense to an identical indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956), 351 U. S. 12,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court held that an indigent defendant is constitutionally entitled to a free transcript of \u2019his trial, or an adequate alternative thereto, when that transcript or alternative is essential to an effective appeal from his conviction. The court in <em>Griffin </em>was faced with an Illinois rule which allowed a convicted criminal defendant to present claims of trial error on appeal only if a transcript of the testimony adduced at trial was procured. Justice Black, writing for four members of the court, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u201cCounsel for Illinois concedes that these petitioners needed a transcript in order to get adequate appellate review of their alleged trial errors. <em>[Id., </em>at.page 16.]</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u201c* * * [T]o deny adequate review to the poor means that many of them may lose their life, liberty or property, because of unjust convictions which appellate courts would set aside. Many States have recognized this and provided aid for convicted defendants who have a right to appeal and need a transcript but are unable to pay for it. A few have not. Such a denial is a misfit in a country dedicated to affording equal justice to all and special privileges to none in its administration of its criminal law. * * * <em>[Id., </em>at page 19.]</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u201c# * * We do not hold, however, that Illinois must purchase a stenographer\u2019s transcript in every case where a defendant cannot buy it. The Supreme Court Tof Illinois] may find other means of affording adequate and effective anpellate review to indigent defendants.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at page 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma City </em>(1969), 395 U. S. 458 (and <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago, infra), </em>the Supreme Court reversed state court decisions which made free transcripts available to indigents upon appeal from felony convictions, but denied those transcripts upon appeal from misdemeanor convictions. In <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1963), 372 U. S. 477, and <em>Long </em>v. <em>District Court of Iowa </em>(1966), 385 U. S. 192, the court applied the <em>Griffin </em>principle to transcripts of habeas corpus proceedings, where those transcripts were deemed essential to effective direct appeals from initial proceedings in habeas corpus. In <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>LaVallee </em>(1967), 389 U. S. 40, the court found meritorious an indigent\u2019s claim to a transcript of his own preliminary hearing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 114.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">More recently, the Supreme Court has placed emphasis upon judicial and extrajudicial alternatives to the free transcript. In <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1970), 396 U. S. 282, 286, the court refused to decide whether \u201ca state [must] furnish an indigent state prisoner free of cost a <em>trial </em>transcript to aid him to prepare a petition for <em>collateral relief,\u201d </em>requiring instead that petitioner seek to borrow a copy of the requested transcript from state authorities, his co-defendant, or some other custodian of a copy. (Emphasis added.) In <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(1971), 404 U. S. 189, the court rejected, upon a motion by an indigent for a transcript of his trial for use on direct appeal, a statutory distinction between felonies and nonfelonies, but remanded the cause to the Supreme Court of Illinois for consideration of alternatives to a complete transcript. In <em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1971), 404 U. S. 226, the court accepted petitioner\u2019s assertion that a transcript of a prior mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>trial would be of value upon retrial, but affirmed, nevertheless, a state court decision which denied that claim. The court stated, at pages 229-230:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u201c* * * The trials of this case took place in a small town where, according to petitioner\u2019s counsel, the court reporter was a good friend of all the local lawyers and was reporting the second trial. It appears that the reporter would at any time have read back to counsel his notes of the mistrial, well in advance of the second trial, if counsel had simply made an informal request.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u201c* * * [Petitioner has conceded that he had available an informal alternative which appears to be substantially equivalent to a transcript.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\"><em>Mayer </em>and <em>Britt </em>delineate two factors relevant to a determination of an indigent\u2019s need for a transcript of a prior proceeding: \u201c(1) the value of the transcript to the defendant in connection with the appeal or trial for which it is sought, and (2) the availability of alternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as a transcript.\u201d <em>Britt, </em>at page 227. Once an indigent defendant has \u201c [made] out a colorable need for a complete transcript, the burden is on the state to show that only a portion of the transcript or an \u2018alternative\u2019 will suffice * * <em>Mayer, </em>at page 195. \u201c* * * Our cases have consistently recognized the value to a defendant of a transcript of prior proceedings, without requiring a showing of need tailored to the facts of a particular case. * * * [E]ven in the absence of specific allegations, it can ordinarily be assumed that a transcript of a prior mistrial would be valuable to the defendant in at least two ways * * *.\u201d <em>Britt, </em>at page 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\"><em>Mayer </em>and <em>Britt </em>stand for the proposition that once an indigent defendant has made a colorable, as opposed to a particularized, showing that a complete or partial transcript of a prior proceeding is' of value, the state must demonstrate that an available alternative device will provide substantially the same information, and serve substantially the same function, as a transcript. As we have indicated, the Supreme Court has'applied this principi\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to a request for a trial transcript to be used Upon appeal as of right from a criminal conviction; to a -request for a transcript of a habeas corpus proceeding, to be -used upon appeal as of right 'from that proceeding; and to requests for transcripts of preliminar y hearings and mistrials.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Supreme -Court has not, however, applied the requirements of.: <em>Mayer </em>and <em>Britt </em>to a motion-by an indigent for .a transcript of his'original trial, to aid .the indigent in preparing a petition for-p'ostconviction relief. <em>See-Wade </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra. </em>Nor has the .court, extended <em>MLayer </em>and <em>Britt </em>..to cover a prior, proceeding, such as. the prior trial of a co-defendant, outside, the chain-of a-.defendant\u2019s own trial and appeal. In fact, numerous federal court decisions have specifically declined to so-extend-Mayer,and <em>Britt, </em>requiring instead that an indigent- defendant show;a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for a requested.transcript. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Virginia (W. </em>D. Va. 1974), 387 F. Supp. 370 (transcript of. trial requested for use in preparation of petition, for. postconviction-relief); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(M. D. Pa. 1974); 369 F. Supp. 951 (transcript of trial requested for. use in framing motion for new trial); <em>Bozeman </em>v. <em>United States </em>(E. D. Va. 1973), 354 F. Supp. 262 (transcript of trial requested for nse in preparation of petition for .postconviction relief).; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Maine </em>(C. A. 1, 1971), 448 F. 2d 1325 (transcript of trial requested for use,in preparation-of\u25a0 petition for postconviction relief); <em>Bentley </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C. A. 6, 1970), 431 F. 2d 250, certiorari denied, 401 U. S. 920 (transcript of trial requested for -use in preparation of petition for postconviction relief); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carella </em>(C. A. 2, 1969), 411 F. 2d 729, certiorari denied, 396 U. S. 860 (transcript of trial requested for use in preparation of petition for postconviction relief). Only when a federal appellate court <em>departed </em>from this standard of \u201cparticularized need\u201d did the Supreme Court grant certiorari. <em>MacCollom </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C. A. 9, 1974), 511 F. 2d 1116. certiorari granted (1975), U. S. , 46 L. Ed. 2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In a 1974 decision, <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt </em>(1974), 417 U. S. 600, the high court refused to extend the constitutional require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ment that an indigent be provided appointed counsel upon a direct appeal from a criminal conviction, <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California </em>(1963), 372 U. S. 353, to subsequent discretionary state appeals, and to petitions for review addressed to the United States Supreme Court. Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, rejected both the petitioner\u2019s due process and equal protection claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">' \u201c [W]hile no one would agree that the state may simply dispense with the trial stage of proceedings without a criminal defendant\u2019s consent, it is clear that the state need not provide any appeal at all. [Citation omitted.] The fact that an appeal <em>has </em>been provided does not automatically mean that a state then acts unfairly by refusing to provide counsel to indigent defendants at fevery stage of the way. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, supra. </em>Unfairness results only if indigents ar\u00e9 singled out by the state and denied meaningful access to that system because of their poverty. [Ross, at page 611.]</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201c[Moreover], the fact that a particular service might be of benefit to an indigent defendant does not mean that the service is constitutionally required. The duty of the state under our cases is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State\u2019s appellate process.\u201d Id., at page 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">' Applying all the foregoing principles to the facts presented by this cause, we conclude that the appellant, is not entitled to a free copy of the transcript which he requests\u2019 Appellant asserts\u2018that, he needs that transcript to provide \u201cthe scenario of the alleged crime,\u201d and to facilitate the impeachment of prosecution witnesses. We remain unconvinced, however, that the transcript which appellant seeks is necessary, or would even be helpful, to his defense. The facts presented by the <em>Turner </em>case, and by this ease, are few. \u00edn <em>Turner, </em>two eyewitnesses identified Turner one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>of three criminals. In this case, the same two eyewitnesses identified appellant as another of those three criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">. . The fact is that appellant received indictment by grand jury, and trial by jury. He was defended at trial by court-appointed counsel, which counsel also represented him upon direct appeal to the Court of Appeals, and upon subsequent discretionary appeal to this court. Appellant has been furnished a free.transcript of his trial to assist conduct of those appeals... Appellant has had opportunity to invoke numerous means of discovery, and to confront, and cross-examine, the witnesses against him. Appellant has received, in short, every substantive and procedural guarantee which the Constitution requires, and which our legal system affords. To require him to delineate with greater particularity the way or ways in which the requested transcript might be of value to him would not, in our judgment, deny him \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to our legal system, or an \u201cadequate opportunity to present his claim\u201d of innocence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Moreover, upon this record, by appellant\u2019s implicit admission, available alternative devices were more than adequate to \u201cfulfill the same functions as a transcript.\u201d- <em>Britt, supra </em>(404 U. S. 226),- at page 227. Those alternative devices included:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">1. A bill of particulars \u2018 \u2018 setting up, specifically the nature of the offense charged and of \u2019the conduct of [the] defendant alleged to constitute the offense.\u201d Grim. R. 7(E)..</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Pursuant to the rule, a bill-of particulars <em>must </em>be furnished by the prosecutor upon timely request. The reco''d herein discloses that no&gt; such motion was filed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">2.

It requires the disclosure of <em>all evidence </em>known by the prosecuting attorney which is favorable to the accused, including evidence adduced at a prior trial of a co-defendant. Upon disclosure of such evidence,, a defendant might bolster his motion for a transcript of the co-defendant\u2019s prior trial, by delineating with particularity its value to him. The fact that no such disclosure was made by the prosecutor in this cause is a further indication that the <em>Turner </em>transcript is of no' value to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Under Crirn. R. 16(B)(1)(g), a defendant may, upon completion of a witness \u2019 direct examination at trial, move the court to \u201cconduct an in camera inspection of the witness\u2019 written or recorded prior statement with the defense attorney' and prosecuting attorney present and participating, to determine the existence of inconsistencies, if any, -between the testimony of such witness and the prior statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies exist, the statement shall be given to the defeuse attorney for use in cross-examination of the witness as to the inconsistencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The foregoing subsection, by its terms, includes <em>any </em>written or recorded prior statement within the possession of the prosecuting attorney, including the testimony of a -witness at a prior trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The record in this cause does not disclose -that counsel for the appellant filed even one motion pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">- \u2022 4. Counsel for the appellant stated, during oral argument in this court, that prior to filing his motion for a free transcript \u00f3f the <em>Turner </em>trial, he contacted the clerk of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, to ascertain if a copy of the <em>Turner </em>transcript had been filed in that court in connection'with an appeal from Turner\u2019s conviction'. Counsel for appellant also stated during oral argument' that' he made an attempt to contact Turner\u2019s counsel, but was not successful.
