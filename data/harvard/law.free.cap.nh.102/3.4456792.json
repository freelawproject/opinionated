H. 140, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">It is not essential to the validity of a complaint or indictment that it could possibly be made more comprehensive and certain; it is only necessary that it allege \u201cevery element of the offense charged in language sufficiently definite to apprise the respondents of what they-'must be prepared to meet for trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>97 N. H. 141, 146. In the present case the complaint used the words of the statute and also alleged specific overt acts, namely that the defendant threw \u201ctwo stones on the windshield\u201d of the automobile of the complainant\u2019s husband, \u201cwhereby\u201d his property was damaged \u201cin an amount exceeding Fifteen Dollars.\u201d This has been held sufficient. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>99 N. H. 88, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Such cases as <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>89 N. H. 134, relied upon by the defendant, where the accused was not informed of facts reasonably necessary to enable him to prepare for trial, are clearly distinguishable from the situation before us and do not support the defendant\u2019s position. It follows the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
