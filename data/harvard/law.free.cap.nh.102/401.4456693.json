H. 203, 205. Therefore any such right of action which survived the deceased did so solely by virtue of RSA ch. 556 and only to the extent therein specified. <em>Costoras </em>v. <em>Noel, </em>101 N. H. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>By its terms said section 19 provides that \u201cAny person interested . . . <em>may begin </em>an action as administrator, which shall not be abated . . . because such person is not administrator, nor by his decease, if <em>the administrator . . . </em>shall . . . indorse the writ and <em>prosecute it </em>as plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). In our opinion the clear import of this language is that the Legislature in the interest of expediency wanted to allow any interested person to initiate such an action provided it be prosecuted thereafter by an administrator. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>61 N. H. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">This interpretation is consonant with the provisions of RSA 556:14 requiring that the damages recovered in such an action, less certain specified expenses including \u201cthe expenses of administration ... all of which shall be approved by the probate court\u201d are to be distributed to certain specified beneficiaries. This is a strong indication that the Legislature intended that actions to recover damages for wrongful death were to be handled by an administrator accountable to the probate court. This interpretation also insures an orderly procedure in the prosecution of the action and a supervised payment of claims and distribution of the proceeds by placing these matters in the hands of the court-appointed fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Being an action for wrongful death, it survived only by virtue of and to the extent specified by RSA ch. 556. <em>Schindler </em>v. <em>Trust Co., </em>99 N. H. 284. It was begun by the husband as a \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d under authority of section 19 thereof. However no administrator of the estate \u201cat the first or second term of the court indorse [d] the writ and prosecute [d] it as plaintiff\u201d as required thereby. \u201cWithout the statute the suit could not have been brought as it was; and no person, legally representing the deceased, appeared within the time fixed by the statute . . . there is no plaintiff in court., and the action cannot be maintained.\u201d <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>61 N. H. 504, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
