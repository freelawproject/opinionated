H.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">By \u201cCoverage B\u201d of the policy, the insurer undertakes \u201cto pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident.\u201d This undertaking is qualified by certain \u201cExclusions,\u201d none of which is claimed to be applicable here. Under the head of \u201cConditions\u201d appear certain definitions, including a definition of the term \u201cproducts hazard,\u201d which is not material to the coverage applicable to the pending action.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Under the head of \u201cLimits of Liability, Coverage B\u201d appears the following: \u201cThe limit of property damage liability stated in the declarations as applicable to 'each accident\u2019 is the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages arising out of injury to or destruction of all property of one or more persons or organizations, including the loss of use thereof, as the result of any one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u201cSubject to the limit of liability with respect to 'each accident\u2019 the limit of property damage liability stated in the declarations as 'aggregate operations\u2019 is the total limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages arising out of injury to or destruction of property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>including the loss of use thereof, caused by the ownership, maintenance or use of premises or [by?] operations rated on a remuneration premium basis or by contractor\u2019s equipment rated on a receipts premium basis ....</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">\u201cThe limits of property damage liability stated in the declarations as \u2018aggregate operations, aggregate protective\u2019 and \u2018aggregate contractual\u2019 apply separately to each project with respect to operations being performed away from the premises owned by or rented to the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The plaintiff claims that the limit of its liability under the policy for all property damage occasioned by the fire or fires of April 21, 1957 is the limit of \u201c$25,000 each accident\u201d specified in the declarations. The defendants on the other hand contend that the damage suffered by each of them was a separate \u201caccident,\u201d and that the applicable limit is \u201c$50,000 aggregate operations\u201d as specified by the declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The issue presented is not readily determinable from an examination of the policy, which must be considered as a whole. The limits of liability for bodily injury in part follow a familiar form of \u201c$100,000 each person\u201d and \u201c$300,000 each accident.\u201d See 8 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice 296. These limits are followed by a third less familiar limit of \u201c$300,000 aggregate products.\u201d See Products Liability Insurance, 1957 Wis. L. Rev. 429. By endorsement, relating solely to coverage A against bodily injury liability, the term \u201caccident\u201d was amended to \u201coccurrence,\u201d and the latter word defined therein to include either \u201caccident\u201d or \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in bodily injury.\u201d The endorsement further provides that \u201call damages arising out of such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from each premises location shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d Further provisions of the policy itself, under the heading of \u201cConditions,\u201d which bear upon the limit of \u201c$300,000 aggregate products\u201d are as follows: \u201cSubject to the limit of liability with respect to each accident, the limits of bodily injury liability and property damage liability stated in the declarations ... are respectively the total limits of the company\u2019s liability for all damages arising out of the products hazard. All such damages arising out of one lot of goods or products prepared or acquired by the named insured or by another trading under his name shall be considered as arising out of one accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Thus it seems apparent that in case of accidental bodily injury to several persons, suffered as a result of operations conducted or products prepared by the insured, the applicable limits of coverage under the policy would be $100,000 as to any one person or claimant, and $300,000 as to any one accident, or occurrence if more than one person should be injured thereby. And in the event of injury as the result of products obtained from the insured, liability for bodily injury suffered by several persons on account of \u201cone lot of goods\u201d would be limited to \u201c$300,000 each accident\u201d because under the provision last quoted all damages are to \u201cbe considered as arising out of one accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">It is also apparent that in a case where the insurer paid a total of $300,000 in settlement of such claims for bodily injury the limit of liability for \u201caggregate products\u201d would also be reached, since it was the same as the limit for \u201ceach accident.\u201d By the same token under the \u201cCondition\u201d last quoted, the plaintiff\u2019s liability for property damage arising out of one lot of products would be \u201cconsidered as arising out of one accident\u201d and hence governed by the \u201c$25,000 each accident\u201d limit under coverage B, rather than the \u201c$50,000 aggregate products\u201d limit thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Interpretation of the policy limits applicable to coverage B arising out of the \u201cpremises-operations\u201d hazard appears to be somewhat less plain. See 5 Couch, Cyc. of Insurance Law, Supp. s. 1189-1. It seems significant however that as to coverage B, while no separate limit of liability as to \u201ceach person\u201d is stated comparable to such a limit imposed as to coverage A, as to each type of coverage there is a limit for \u201ceach accident.\u201d Since in the case of bodily injury liability, the limit applicable to \u201ceach accident\u201d was evidently intended to apply to liability arising out of the claims of several persons injured in a single accident, it is reasonable to assume that the same construction was intended to apply to the liability limit for property damage arising out of \u201ceach accident,\u201d unless some other provision of the policy indicates differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We find no provision which indicates that a different construction was intended. On the contrary, the principle controlling liability for bodily injury appears to be expressly extended to property damage by the \u201cCondition\u201d headed \u201cLimits of Liability, Coverage B,\u201d previously quoted: \u201cThe limit of property damage liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each accident\u2019 is the total limit . . . for all damages arising out of injury to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>destruction of all property of <em>one or more persons ... as the result of any one accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Thus if the damages suffered by these defendants may properly be said to have been \u201cthe result of any one accident,\u201d the limit of plaintiff\u2019s liability is $25,000 as it contends, rather than \u201c$50,000 aggregate operations\u201d as the defendants assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Upon the question of what constitutes a single accident in a case such as this, the authorities are in disagreement. Anno. 55 A. L. R. (2d) 1300, 1303. The defendants rely upon <em>Anchor Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>McCaleb, </em>178 F. 2d 322 (5th Cir. 1949) involving a policy the terms of which do not appear in detail in the opinion. Damage was occasioned to several property owners by the intermittent eruption of an oil well over a period of two days, and the damage to each individual was held to be a separate accident. Hence the \u201caggregate\u201d limit was held applicable as \u201ca total limit of damage to property of different persons from a closely related series of events, such as were evident in this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>325. <em>Cf. </em>also, <em>Johnson Corp. </em>v. <em>Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>6 N. Y. App. Div. (2d) 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">A later decision by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, respecting coverage for damage to the property of fourteen different owners caused by collision of a truck with a freight train which also damaged sixteen freight cars, held that under a policy partially resembling the one issued by this plaintiff a $5,000 limit applicable to \u201ceach accident\u201d was controlling as to all claims presented, because according to the ordinary meaning of the word, a single accident was involved, and because no intention was shown to consider liability for property damage in terms of the individual claims of \u201ceach person\u201d damaged. <em>St. Paul-Mercury Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Rutland, </em>225 F. 2d 689 (5th Cir. 1955). See 8 Appleman, Insurance Law, <em>s. </em>4891, supp. <em>p. </em>86. This decision has since been followed in other jurisdictions, in cases presenting similar problems <em>(Truck Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Rohde, </em>49 Wash. 2d 465), including the question of liability for damage by fire. <em>Tri-State Roofing Co. </em>v. <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>139 F. Supp. 193 (W. D. Pa. 1955); <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Iowa Nat\u2019l Mut. Ins. Co., </em>264 F. 2d 224 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We conclude that the principles applied in the <em>Rutland </em>case should be controlling here. As pointed out by a recent commentator, \u201cin the <em>Rutland </em>case . . . under the plaintiff\u2019s reasoning, the insured would have possessed only $5000 worth of protection ... if the railroad owned all of the property damaged [but if] sixty persons happened to own portions of the property . . . this elastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>policy would have expanded to provide $300,000 in protection.\u201d 10 Syracuse L. Rev. 69, 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We are particularly satisfied that this was not the intention of the parties to this contract, in view of the express if somewhat tautological provision that the limit \u201c$25,000 each accident\u201d should be the \u201ctotal limit\u201d for all damages for injury of \u201call property of one or more persons ... as the result of any one accident.\u201d See 10 Syracuse L. Rev. <em>supra, </em>69, 70, 73 note 24. This is an indication that in interpreting the limit of property damage liability for \u201ceach accident,\u201d as in the case of the bodily injury limit for \u201ceach accident,\u201d the word \u201caccident\u201d was intended to be construed from the standpoint of cause rather than effect. Since a single cause produced the damage for which recovery for property damage is sought by these defendants, the limit of \u201c$25,000 each accident\u201d should apply. \u201cEvery consideration would indicate that the parties to a standard policy make a normal, common sense contract under which the insured decides to purchase and pay for a definite amount of protection with respect to what reasonable persons would regard as one accident, no matter how many persons should become involved.\u201d 10 Syracuse L. Rev., <em>supra, </em>77.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">A further question is presented as to whether the plaintiff is obligated to defend the pending or future actions once the policy limit of $25,000 has been exhausted by the payment or settlement of claims or judgments. Under our decided cases, and subject to qualifications there stated, it is plain that it is not. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>90 N. H. 320; <em>Ocean Accident Corp. </em>v. <em>Laundry Co., </em>92 N. H. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">By its policy the plaintiff agrees to defend any suit to recover damages because of injury to or destruction of property, even if groundless, but expressly stipulates that this right and duty is \u201cwith respect to such insurance as is afforded by this policy,\u201d which is the language of the Standard Automobile Liability Policy as revised in 1955. 1955 Proceedings Section on Insurance Law, ABA 48, 53. See DesChamps, The Obligation of the Insurer to Defend, 26 Ins. Counsel J. 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The further question raised by the plaintiff\u2019s petition, relating to the priority of claims of the defendants, appears to require no extended consideration. The policy authorizes the plaintiff to \u201cmake such . . . settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.\u201d Its duties to the insured in this regard have been well defined. <em>Dumas </em>v. <em>Hartford </em>&amp;c. <em>Ind. Co., </em>94 N. H. 484. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>it should develop that the pending claims cannot be satisfied within the limit of the policy and doubt should exist concerning the ability of the insured to satisfy any excess, a variety of means of avoiding preferential treatment of individual claims may be thought available. See 'Keeton, Preferential Settlement, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 27. No ground for establishing priority of any claim over another has been suggested by the briefs, and the plaintiff is under no present obligation to avoid any preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">The plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought by its petition as herein indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
