See RSA 194:21, 27, as amended. As this appears to be the sole purpose of your inquiry we must respectfully decline to answer since it is not the subject for an advisory opinion to the Legislature under our Constitution. N. H. Const., Pt. II, <em>Art. </em>74; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N. H. 524. The constitutional provision for advisory opinions, with exceptions not material here, does not permit the Supreme Court to advise the Legislature as to the meaning and scope of existing statutes. This rule has been long established in this jurisdiction. <em>In re School-Law Manual, </em>63 N. H. 574; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>67 N. H. 600; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>62 N. H. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">There are cases where the Governor and Council are entitled to advisory opinions as to their official-duty and authority under existing law. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N. H. 505; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>102 N. H. 183, 184. This has no applic\u00e1tion to legislative requests for advisory opinions where the legal question does not await \u201cthe consideration and action\u201d of the inquiring body. <em>In re School-Law Manual, supra, </em>576.</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-7\">Frank R.
