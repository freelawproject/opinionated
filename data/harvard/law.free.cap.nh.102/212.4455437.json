I A Uniform Laws Annotated 295; RSA 346:69 I (d).\u201d <em>Pineau </em>v. <em>White, </em>101 N. H. 119, 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">It is not necessary to decide whether the so-called \u201cOne Year Bond\u201d constitutes an express warranty under RSA 346:12 as we are of the opinion that an implied warranty of fitness (RSA 346:15 I) could be found on the evidence and was in no way precluded by the express provisions of the \u201cBond.\u201d RSA 346:15 VI. Plaintiff never had any mechanical experience concerning cars. He was buying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>used car. After trying it out he told the salesman there was a noise in the motor and the latter agreed to repair it. Plaintiff signed the agreement of purchase in reliance on that assurance. The \u201cBond\u201d given to plaintiff at the time of purchase stated that defendant \u201chas inspected the above vehicle and certifies that in its opinion the parts hereinafter specified [including the. motor] are in good working order and condition.\u201d This statement was not inconsistent with the promise made by defendant\u2019s salesman that the noise in the motor would be fixed. RSA 346:15 I, VI. This evidence was sufficient to establish an implied warranty of fitness. <em>Pineau </em>v. <em>White, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">There was noise in the motor after plaintiff received delivery of the car. He took it to defendant\u2019s garage the following week and on several occasions thereafter with complaints about it. There was evidence that \u201cin order to have that car right, it would have to have a short block assembly.\u201d The motor had not been fixed on July 25, 1956. Plaintiff and his wife testified Mr. Irwin told them \u201che already had put all the money into the car that he was going to, that it was a lemon, that he wasn\u2019t going to do any more repairs to it.\u201d On this evidence the Court was warranted in finding a breach of the implied warranty of fitness. <em>Clover &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Smith Co., </em>96 N. H. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Where rescission takes place after acceptance, the buyer must return or offer to return the goods to the seller in substantially as good condition as they were in at the time the property was transferred to the buyer and the buyer must \u201cnotify the seller within a reasonable time of the election to rescind.\u201d RSA 346:69 III. Plaintiff did not notify defendant of his intention to rescind until July 25, 1956. However he was in defendant\u2019s garage complaining about the noise in the motor within one week of August 15, 1955, the date of purchase. At one time he \u201chad been in and out of the garage practically every week or every other week.\u201d Mr. Irwin had the car in the garage \u201cpart of the time\u201d although plaintiff knew about the noise from the beginning \u201cWhat I was trying to do was get the car fixed.\u201d The car had been driven about 1,000 miles while plaintiff had it. On this evidence it was a question of fact for the Trial Court whether plaintiff notified the defendant within a reasonable time of his intention to rescind and whether the car was in substantially as good a condition as it was at the time of sale. 72 A. L. R. 726, 745; 77 A. L. R. 1165, 1187; 41 A. L. R. (2d) 812, 825; <em>Id., </em>1173, 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>There being evidence on which the Trial Court could find an implied warranty of fitness, a breach thereof by the defendant and notification to it by plaintiff within a reasonable time of his election to rescind, defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of its motion to set aside the verdict is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
