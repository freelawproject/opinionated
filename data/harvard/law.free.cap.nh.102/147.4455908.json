At best, the defendant claims, the plaintiff is only a nominal party and the Vending Company, being \u201cthe true party at interest,\u201d should have been joined as a plaintiff. Since this was not done, the defendant asserts he is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">An examination of the assignment in question shows that in addition to the usual terms it expressly states that the original of the contract \u201cis in the hands of the Clerk of the Superior Court as an exhibit in the case of <em>Oscar Pratte </em>v. <em>Spiros A. Balatsos, </em>delivery of which original shall be made by me to Recreation Vending, Inc., when said case is finally adjudicated as to damages due said Oscar Pratte from said Spiros A. Balatsos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Beneath the plaintiff\u2019s signature is a so-called \u201cacknowledgment of Spiros A. Balatsos,\u201d the material portions of which state that the defendant \u201chereby acknowledge [s] full notice of the above described assignment which I have read and understand and which will not be used by either Oscar Pratte or myself in connection with the issue now pending between us as to the amount of damages that the Superior Court may award to said Oscar Pratte in our case now pending.\u201d This remains unexecuted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">It is obvious from the wording of the assignment and the fact that the Vending Company, though aware of the situation, made no claim to damages, that the chose in action was not assigned. It follows the company has no interest in this action. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>77 N. H. 282; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Florence Iron Co., </em>222 N. Y. 290, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>302. The Court acted properly in refusing to join the company or to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s case <em>(Scamman </em>v. <em>Sondheim, </em>97 N. H. 280; <em>Poisson </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>101 N. H. 72), and the defendant\u2019s exception thereto is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The defendant next contends that the Court erred in admitting testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s accountant. It appears this witness, who prepared the plaintiff\u2019s income tax returns, testified as to certain conclusions drawn from his examination of the plaintiff\u2019s books and illustrated his deductions by a chart. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>95 N. H. 217, 221. The plaintiff testified as to the authenticity of his books, which he kept himself, and that the entries were in the regular course. Both he and the accountant were in court subject to cross-examination, and so were the books. The record discloses that they were turned over to the defendant\u2019s counsel, who examined them, though he did not seek to introduce them. Much extraneous matter was contained in the books, and in the circumstances no reason appears why the court\u2019s records should have been encumbered with them. The evidence appears clearly admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellard, supra, </em>221; V Wig., Ev. (3d <em>ed.) s. </em>1530, 1957 Supp., <em>pp. </em>74, 75; <em>Id., s. </em>1560, <em>p. </em>416; see <em>Geralds </em>v. <em>Champlin, </em>93 N. H. 157, 160. It follows the defendant\u2019s exception to this evidence cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">There remains to be disposed of the defendant\u2019s contention that the damages awarded were \u201cconclusively against the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Wisutskie </em>v. <em>Malouin, </em>88 N. H. 242. In so doing the defendant relies upon the following questions and answers in cross-examination at the hearing on damages in March, 1958:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u201cQ. Oscar, the juke business has been going down pretty much?</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u201cA. I\u2019m doing better than I ever did, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u201cQ. You are <em>now f</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">\u201cA. <em>Now.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">The accountant\u2019s testimony fixed the loss to the plaintiff from September 15, 1954, to May 30, 1957, at $2,846.79. The defendant argues that the plaintiff would never have \u201csold\u201d the contract for $2,400 in July, 1957, when it had about ten years to run, if business had been as good as claimed. He argues that the amount of the verdict is \u201cunreasonable because it does not reflect any consideration of an extremely damaging admission against interest of the plaintiff upon cross-examination regarding the sales price of the lease.\u201d We cannot accept this contention. In the first place, the defendant\u2019s testimony that business had never been better ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>viously related, to March, 1958, and not the previous July when the contract was assigned. Again, if there could be said to be any conflict between the plaintiff\u2019s statement on cross-examination and his books, upon which the accountant\u2019s conclusions were based, this was for the Court to resolve. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>Hagianis, </em>97 N. H. 314. Since the amount of the verdict was within reason and not conclusively against the weight of the evidence, it must be upheld. <em>Boy </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>97 N. H. 36, 40. The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
