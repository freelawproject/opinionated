These generally fall into the category of health, welfare and public safety. Suitable penalties to insure their enforcement <em>\u201cnot exceeding ten dollars for each offense\u201d </em>may be provided (emphasis supplied). RSA 31:39.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Towns derive their power from the Legislature and \u201care bound by the limits imposed upon them <em>. \u201d Opinion of the Justices, </em>101 N. H. 544, 545, and cases cited. \u201cIn the nature of things, such [local] legislation must be not inconsistent with the laws of the state <em>. ... \u201d State </em>v. <em>Paille, </em>90 N. H. 347, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The State has undertaken to regulate hunting, fishing and the use of firearms throughout the state during certain periods of the year. RSA Tit. XVIII, Fish and Game. Among other provisions, a hunter may enter upon improved land of another and discharge firearms during a certain period of the year unless such land is posted (RSA 572:15) and likewise a hunter may enter upon uncultivated land unless ordered to leave by the owner or unless said land is posted by orders of the Fish and Game Department. RSA 572:50 (supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The Durham by-law would prohibit hunting and the discharge of a firearm in the entire town unless written permission of the owner was obtained and is thus inconsistent with the statutory law of the state regulating hunting and the discharge of firearms. The by-law \u201cassumes authority which the legislature has taken away\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Paille, supra, </em>351) and hence is invalid. <em>State </em>v. <em>Angelo, </em>71 N. H. 224. In attempting to provide for a maximum fine of $50, the town has exceeded its statutory authority.
