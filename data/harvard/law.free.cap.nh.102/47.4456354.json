J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">The plaintiff, an attorney who was chairman of the Democratic State Committee, alleges \u201cthat in substance the article [written and published by the defendants] called the plaintiff \u2018a pig-in-the-parlor\u2019 element\u201d; that the article has exposed him to public hatred, shame, contempt, ridicule, humiliation and disgrace; and that the article has injured his reputation as an attorney and injured his status as Democratic State Chairman by putting him \u201cin ridicule and shame before the general public and the Democrats of the State of New Hampshire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Research has not disclosed any case involving a public officer or a political candidate which holds that the phrase \u201cpig-in-the-parlor element\u201d is a defamatory one. Every person, whether he be a newspaper editor, a political columnist or an unsung voter, has a right to comment upon or criticize political parties, public officers and candidates and their programs. <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>48 N. H. 211, 216; <em>Lafferty </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>81 N. H. 67, 71; Noel, Defamation of Public Officers and Candidates, 49 Col. L. Rev. 875. From an early date a citizen has been allowed \u201cto give useful information to the community\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>9 N. H. 34, 41, 42) without being subject to actions for libel, in order that competent officers be elected and incompetent officers be removed. It frequently appears that the comment or criticism is not particularly useful and may be foolish, illogical, prejudiced or extravagant but this does not put it beyond the pale of fair comment into the orbit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>libel. Restatement, Torts, <em>s. </em>606, <em>comment </em>c. \u201cFreedom of discussion is not to be confined within narrow limits although its outer boundaries are circumscribed by the law of libel.\u201d <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Claremont Eagle, Inc., </em>95 N. H. 375, 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The phrase \u201cpig-in-the-parlor\u201d suggests something out of place. \u201cA nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, \u2014like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.\u201d <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Ambler Co., </em>272 U. S. 365, 388. The fact that the phrase is not a complimentary one does not automatically make it a libelous one. Criticism does not have to be diluted with praise in order to avoid the impact of a libel suit. The phrase \u201cpig-in-the-parlor\u201d also has some neutral tones to it in song and poem for young children but we may assume that it was not used in that sense in this case. See Bley, The Best Singing Games for Children of all Ages, <em>p. </em>50 (1957); Depew,. The Cokesbury Party Book 79, 80 (1932); Thomas Hood\u2019s Poetical Works, The Irish Schoolmaster 61 (Jerrold <em>ed. </em>1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The article published by the defendants was essentially a comment on two alleged factions within the Democratic Party prior to a primary election. The article placed one faction in the category of modern \u201clace curtain\u201d Democrats which sought \u201cto take party control away from the pig-in-the-parlor element\u201d of the \u201cOld Guard leadership\u201d which presumably referred to the plaintiff. \u201cIf criticism of a public officer or candidate is a means of attacking a political system of which he is a part, or if the criticism for any other reason affects a public policy of widespread interest, the area of comment may be extended as far as the interest is felt.\u201d Restatement, Torts, s. 607, <em>comment </em>b. It is not uncommon to find political commentators employing the basic and never-changing plot of \u201cWesterns\u201d on television programs where there are only \u201cgood guys\u201d and \u201cbad guys.\u201d So too in the political arena editors and columnists may place one public officer or political faction in the good category while the nonfavored officer or faction is placed in the other category. Since discussion of these political matters are considered desirable in the interest of free speech and necessary in the public interest, the doctrine of fair comment tends to restrict the law of defamation in this area. Note, Fair Comment, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 1207, 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The tendency of commentators to ascribe virtue and culture to one person, party or faction and the lack of it to the opposition is not a new development in this state. The first meeting of the Grafton and Coos Bar Association in 1882 produced the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201cMany centuries ago, a fellow by the name of Doe was chief Medicine man in the tribe in which he lived. In this tribe, the educated, 'well-behaved, and virtuous class, the g. o. p. of moral ideas, were called, as now, Republicans, while the low, uncultivated and vicious class were known, as now, as Democrats.\u201d Carpenter, \u201cAddress,\u201d 1 Proceedings of Grafton &amp; Coos Bar Association 45-6 (1882). See Reid, Of Men, and Minks and a Mischievous Machinator, 1 N. H. Bar J. (No. 2) 23, 27 (1959). For the other side of the coin see Metcalf, Harry Bingham Memorial 87 (1910) where the Republican Party was described as a \u201cconglomeration of odds and ends, \u2014 the refuse of all parties \u2014 bound together by no ties but common love of spoils and plunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The plaintiff, a public officer in his capacity as chairman of the State Democratic Committee, was identified solely in that position in the article which criticized one faction of the party. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Coos Bay Times Pub. Co., </em>122 Ore. 408; <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Beacon Journal Pub. Co., </em>66 Ohio App. 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The article considered in its full context was capable of a defamatory meaning but, in the absence of malice or bad faith, was \u201cprivileged in the public interest.\u201d Prosser, Torts, 619 (1955); Restatement, Torts, <em>ss. </em>614, 619. However the existence of malice or bad faith, which would constitute an abuse of the privilege, remains a question of fact for the jury. <em>Lafferty </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>81 N. H. 67; 1 Harper and James, The Law of Torts, s. 5.27 and <em>s. </em>5.29, <em>p. </em>467 (1956). Accordingly the orders sustaining the demurrer and granting the motion to dismiss were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
