The section defines grossly careless or negligent operation as \u201cthat manner of operation of a motor vehicle which, although short of wilful and intentional wrong, is marked by more want of care than simple inadvertence and is carelessness substantially and appreciably higher in magnitude than ordinary negligence or carelessness, or a high degree of indifference to the operator\u2019s duty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The complaint alleged in detail the course of conduct later disclosed by the evidence at the trial, and characterized it in the language of the statutory definition quoted above. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Turgeon, </em>101 N. H. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The carelessness with which this defendant is charged consisted of the operation of his automobile under circumstances which would lead a reasonable man to appreciate the existence of a greater than ordinary risk that sleep would overtake him. The defendant had gone without sleep for a long period of time during which he had done a full day\u2019s work, had later done other physical labor, had hunted for six hours in the late evening and early morning of the next day, and had then consumed \u201ctwo drinks\u201d of intoxicating liquor at a time when any relaxation was likely to produce drowsiness. Under the conditions disclosed the possibility that the defendant would fall asleep at the wheel was a foreseeable risk, of which it could be found that he knew or should have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The evidence reported by the transferred case warrants, although it does not necessarily compel, a finding that the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>fact fell asleep while driving, and that his indifference to the risk that he might do so brought his conduct within the purview of the statute. See <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Lackey, </em>107 Vt. 192; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>117 Conn. 428. See also, anno. 28 A. L. R. (2d) 12, 62-69. The defendant\u2019s motion should be granted or denied according to the findings of fact which the trial court makes upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
