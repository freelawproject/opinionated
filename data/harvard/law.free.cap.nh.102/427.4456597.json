Laws 1955, c. 275, <em>ss. </em>2, 3 (RSA 147:23, 23-a (supp.) ). The defendant argues that its motion to dismiss, made in advance of trial, was erroneously denied because the court is without authority to enjoin it from performing its legal duties. <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Verrette, </em>79 N. H. 356; Rhyne, Municipal Law 797. The plaintiffs\u2019 bills however did not seek to enjoin the city from operating a dump, but from operating a \u201cburning dump\u201d on the premises in question. Since the statute specifically provides that the disposition of waste shall be \u201cin such a manner as not to create a nuisance\u201d (RSA 147:26 (supp.) ) and the plaintiffs alleged irreparable injury, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was properly denied. See <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>39 N. H. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">As proprietor of the dump and of the land upon which it was situated, the defendant was under the duty imposed upon any owner to use the land in a reasonable way under all the circumstances (Ho<em>ran </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>72 N. H. 93, 100; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>70 N. H. 485; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Brick Company, </em>68 N. H. 185) and in a manner which would not \u201cdeprive the plaintiffs of the reasonable enjoy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ment of their property to a substantial extent, considering all the circumstances of the situation.\u201d <em>Page </em>v. Brooks, 79 N. H. 70, 73. Even though the defendant was exercising a public right in performance of a public duty imposed upon it, if its use was unreasonable as against adjoining owners, the plaintiffs may have relief both in equity and at law. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Derry, </em>73 N. H. 198, 204. \u201cTowns like individuals . . . are bound to so use their own as not to injure the property of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also, <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>76 N. H. 229; <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>90 N. H. 256; anno. 52 A. L. R. (2d) 1134, 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">Whether the use made constituted a nuisance was a question of fact to be determined by the Trial Court. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra; True </em>v. <em>McAlpine, </em>81 N. H. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The Court found that continued operation of the dump will be unreasonable as to the plaintiffs, that it has subjected them to substantial annoyance from smoke and smell, is a substantial nuisance, has resulted in some depreciation in the value of their properties, and if continued would render their enjoyment especially uncomfortable and inconvenient, and produce a tangible and appreciable injury to their property. These findings the defendant maintains are not warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">An expert witness called by the plaintiffs testified that their respective properties were depreciated in value, because of the dump, in percentages ranging from twenty to fifty per cent of their market values. The defendant argues that its motion to strike the witness\u2019 testimony was erroneously denied, because the witness lacked personal knowledge of the extent to which the properties were affected by the alleged nuisance and his testimony was inconsistent, incredible, and based upon hearsay. Although the Trial Court did not accept the witness\u2019 estimates of the amount of depreciation, his testimony was properly received in the Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Edgcomb Steel Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>100 N. H. 480, 492. See <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Company, </em>101 N. H. 35, 42-43. Much of his testimony was in response to hypothetical questions which supplied facts established through other witnesses. The variance in percentages of depreciation could findably be accounted for by factors such as relative location, and the course taken by smoke from the dump, which the witness himself observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The findings relative to the interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 enjoyment of their properties and to \u201csubstantial annoyance from the smoke and smell\u201d were warranted by the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>parties themselves concerning the charred and unburned paper and debris blown upon their property, and the frequency of smoke and odors at times \u201calmost sickening to smell,\u201d which variously caused a \u201cburning\u201d sensation of the eyes, or could be \u201cfelt ... in our throats,\u201d and required that bedroom windows be closed and picnics be held indoors. If the findings were not couched in the precise language of <em>Page </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra </em>(but see <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Concord, supra, </em>486), they were nevertheless equivalent to a finding of deprivation of \u201creasonable enjoyment ... to a substantial extent.\u201d <em>Page </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>73. The findings warranted in turn the further finding that \u201csome depreciation\u201d had resulted, and the ultimate conclusion that the city\u2019s use was unreasonable, and such as to produce tangible and appreciable injury. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Concord, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Other findings and rulings plainly indicate that in reaching its conclusion, the Court considered the circumstances of the need of the city for a dump, and the probable expense of operating one by a method which would not permit the escape of smoke, odors, and debris to the adjoining properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The injunction does not purport to require the city to establish another dump, or to operate this or any other dump in any particular manner, except that a \u201cburning dump\u201d may not be operated so as to permit the escape of smoke, odors or debris to the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. The decree does not prohibit a burning dump at some other location in Keene or elsewhere where it will not affect the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. Hence we see no basis for the defendant\u2019s further argument that the decree, by directing what the city shall do, invades its discretionary powers or violates constitutional provisions relating to the separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The issue of reasonable use is one of fact which in this case has been decided adversely to the defendant upon evidence sufficient to warrant the decision made. Neither the order of the Trial Court nor the opinion of this court stands for the proposition that a burning dump is a nuisance <em>per se </em>or that it necessarily violates the prohibition of RSA 147:26, <em>supra, </em>against a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
