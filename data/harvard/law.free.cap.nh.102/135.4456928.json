This is a question of fact and if there was any evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>findings and recommendations of the master the Trial Court\u2019s action in approving his report and issuing a decree in accordance therewith must be sustained. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>97 N. H. 311, 312; <em>Fagan </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>101 N. H. 18, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">Plaintiff owns the DeWitt hotel situated at the corner of Chestnut and Porter Streets. When a double house was converted into the hotel in 1903 its foundation was not altered. There was evidence that the southwesterly corner of its foundation wall sets at the intersection of Chestnut and Porter Streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The Hartford building owned by the defendants is situated at the corner of Chestnut and Congress Streets. It was erected \u201cin the \u201920\u2019s\u201d and a plan received in evidence shows the northwesterly corner of this building to be at the intersection of Chestnut and Congress Streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">A plan recorded with a deed in 1815 was introduced in evidence. It showed the distance on the easterly side of Chestnut Street between Porter and Congress Streets to be 150 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">By deed dated July 23, 1894, Elvira P. Mendum conveyed to Charles H. Mendum a tract bounded southerly by Warren (now Porter) Street and having a frontage on Chestnut Street of \u201cseventy-five feet more or less.\u201d The northerly part thereof having a frontage of \u201ctwenty-five feet\u201d on Chestnut Street was conveyed to Amon 0. Benfield the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title. The balance with a frontage on Chestnut Street of fifty feet \u201cmore or less\u201d and bounded on the south by Porter Street is now plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The lot at the corner of Congress and Chestnut Streets on which the Hartford building is located was acquired by defendants\u2019 predecessor in title on July 11, 1914, from John S. Melcher. The deed described a tract bounded northerly by Congress Street, with a frontage on Chestnut Street of \u201ca distance fixed by plan in the office of the assessors of taxes of said Portsmouth as seventy-five and 2/10 feet to land of Amon 0. Benfield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">On the basis of the 1815 plan showing the distance on the east side of Chestnut Street between Porter and Congress Streets to be 150 feet and the above conveyances of these premises as being \u201cseventy five and 2/10 feet\u201d and \u201cseventy five feet more or less\u201d along Chestnut Street between Porter and Congress Streets the master could properly find that this \u201cindicates an intent of the original divider to split the Chestnut Street frontage in two equal parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Having found that the northwest comer of the Hartford building marked the northerly end of the frontage on Chestnut Street and the southwesterly corner of the foundation of the DeWitt hotel the southerly end of it the master could properly find that \u201cthe westerly terminus of the boundary line between these two tracts where it intersects Chestnut Street at exactly one half the distance between the point marked by the northwesterly corner of the foundation of the Hartford building and the southwesterly comer of the foundation of the DeWitt Hotel building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The parcel situated north of this midway point marking the westerly terminus on Chestnut Street of the boundary line between the two original tracts is owned by the defendants. Out of the tract south of that point the defendants\u2019 predecessor in title was conveyed a lot having a frontage on Chestnut Street of 25 feet (being \u201cthe tract which was first conveyed out of the Mendum Estate\u201d) and the balance of the land adjoining on the south is plaintiff\u2019s property. The master could therefore properly fix the northwesterly corner of plaintiff\u2019s land and the southwesterly corner of defendants\u2019 land \u201cat a point on Chestnut Street situate twenty-five feet southerly of one half the distance between the southwesterly corner of the foundation of the DeWitt Hotel building and the northwesterly comer of the foundation of the Hartford building.\u201d As there is no dispute between the parties as to the easterly terminus of the boundary between their land the \u201cboundary line between land of the parties shall then extend easterly on a straight line to corner as previously found by the Court in the prior hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">There being evidence in the record in support of the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, the Trial Court\u2019s approval thereof and decree in accordance therewith and the denial of contrary motions by the plaintiff were proper. <em>Fagan </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>101 N.
