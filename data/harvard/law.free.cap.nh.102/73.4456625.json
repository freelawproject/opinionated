The bill further provides that nothing contained therein shall prevent the service fees so paid from being collected by the carrier from the passengers involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The charge proposed to be imposed is denominated by the bill a \u201cservice fee\u201d for the use of \u201cpublic\u201d landing areas constructed, operated or maintained in whole or in part by state funds. <em>Cf. Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N. H. 548. No constitutional provision precludes the imposition of such a charge, provided it is reasonable recompense exacted for use of the facilities furnished. <em>Tirrell </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>86 N. H. 530; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N. H. 513. <em>Cf. Marine Corps League </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>96 N. H. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">By definition of the act which the bill would amend, an \u201cair carrier\u201d is a carrier engaged solely in intrastate transportation (RSA 422:3 II); and your inquiiy is restricted to the question of possible violation of the Constitution of this state. We therefore have not felt called upon to express any opinion as to whether the proposed fee could be regarded as affecting interstate commerce, or in any way invalid as a violation of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Constitution, Art. 1, <em>s. </em>8, <em>cl. </em>3. And see 49 U. S. C. A., s. 1301, <em>et seq. </em>However we see no reason to anticipate objection to the proposed statute upon that ground. <em>Cf. Tirrell </em>v. <em>Johnston, supra; Aero Transit Co. </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019rs, </em>332 U. S. 495. The specific question embodied in your resolution is answered in the negative.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqK\"><em>Bussell Hilliard, </em>Director of State Aeronautics Commission, <em>Louis C.
