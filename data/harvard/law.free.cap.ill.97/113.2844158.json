Cyrus Epler, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-10\" pgmap=\"113(180) 114(117)\">This was a bill in chancery, filed in the Scott county circuit court on the 12th day of December, 1878, by plaintiffs in error, against Amelia Hewitt, Ann Beedham and Sarah Boyal, for the partition of certain lands. The bill alleges that Elizabeth Green died intestate on the 14th of November, 1878, leaving her husband, Benjamin Green, and her sisters, Amelia Hewitt, Ann Beedham and Sarah Boyal; that at the time of her death Elizabeth Green was seized in fee of the premises mentioned in the bill; that she derived title to the same through the will of William C. Thompson, deceased, who was her former husband; that after his decease she married the said Benjamin Green; that upon the decease of the said Elizabeth Green, without issue, the said Benjamin Green, as surviving husband, became entitled to one-half of said premises, and her surviving three sisters to one-sixth respectively. By an amendment to the bill it was further alleged that the said William C. Thompson, at the time of his death, left him surviving his widow, Elizabeth Thompson, and Mary Thompson, his only daughter; that after her father\u2019s death the said Mary intermarried with Henry Abbott, by whom she had one child, and soon thereafter died, leaving her infant child and her husband, its father, her surviving; that the child survived its mother but a short time, when it died, leaving its father, the said Henry, as its only heir; that after the death of the said Mary Abbott, and her said infant child, the said Elizabeth Thompson was married to the said Benjamin Green, and remained his wife up to the time of her death; that said Abbott, husband of the said Mary Abbott, deceased, and father of her said child, still survives them.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\" pgmap=\"114\">A copy of the will of the said William 0.

The defendants being dissatisfied with that decree, have brought the record to this court, and assigned for error the sustaining of the demurrer to the bill.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-9\" pgmap=\"114\">Mr. Owen P.

These words imply an .absolute right of disposal in the wife, which carries with it the fee. To show that this power of disposal may be given impliedly, and that the idea of an unconsumed residue is not countenanced, we refer to the following cases: Ide v. Ide, 5 Mass. 500; Jackson v. Bull, 10 Johns. 19; Jackson v. Robbins, 16 id. 537; King\u2019s Heirs v. King\u2019s Admrs. 12 Ohio, 390; McLean v. McDonald, 2 Barb. 534; Olney v. Hall, 21 Pick. 311; Helmer v.

Thompson, through which all the parties claim. It is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b116-5\" pgmap=\"116\">\u201c Second. After the payment of such debts and funeral expenses, I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Elizabeth Thompson, the farm on which we now reside, situate in said county, and known and described as the north-east quarter of the south-west quarter of section seven, township fifteen,* range thirteen, also all my personal property of every description, so long as she remains my widow; at the expiration of that time the whole, or Avhatever remains, to descend to my daughter, Mary Thompson.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b116-6\" pgmap=\"116\">Plaintiffs in error insist that under this provision of the will Elizabeth Thompson took an absolute fee simple estate in the premises therein mentioned, Avhich are the same lands now in controversy, and of which partition is sought by complainants\u2019 bill. If she did not take an inheritance, as contended, but a mere life estate, as is claimed by defendants in error, then it is clear complainants shoAved no title to the premises in themsehres, and the demurrer to the bill Avas therefore properly sustained by the court.</p> <p id=\"b116-7\" pgmap=\"116(170) 117(113)\">To us there seems no room for doubt as to the proper construction of the clause in question. The devise of the farm and personal estate is expressed in a single sentence, one clause of which relating to the land, and another to the personalty. By their punctuation these clauses of the sentence are merely divided by a comma and are connected by the conjunctive adverb \u201calso,\u201d which, in that connection signifies in like manner, or in addition to; that is, the testator gives and bequeaths the farm, and in like manner gives and bequeaths the personalty. Then follows the qualifying or adverbial clause, \u201cso long as she remains my widoAV,\u201d Avhich is introduced for the purpose of limiting the entire gift, both of personalty and realty, to the Avidowhood of the taker. He gives and bequeaths both only so long as she remains his widow. This is both the grammatical and legal construction of the sentence. The meaning is precisely the same as if the testator had said: \u201c I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, so long as she remains my widow, the farm, etc., on which we now reside, and in like manner I give and bequeath to her all my personal estate.\u201d She took a mere life estate in the entire gift. The misapprehension as to the legal effect of the devise doubtless grows out of the use of the expression \u201cwhatever remains\u201d by the testator, in limiting the remainder to his daughter. The use of that expression is of no vital significance, and can not be permitted to override the clearly expressed intention that the widow should take a life estate only.</p> <p id=\"b117-6\" pgmap=\"117\">As part of the estate devised was personalty, it is but reasonable to suppose that some of it would be of that species of property whose value and use consist solely in its consumption, such as provisions, etc., and it was doubtless the intention and expectation of the testator that property of this character should and would be consumed by his widow, and of course not in existence when her estate terminated. It was also reasonable to suppose that if she lived long as his widow, some of the articles of personalty would be worn out, lost or destroyed; hence, in making the limitation over, it was but natural and proper to use the expression \u201c whatever remains.\u201d It had reference to the anticipated condition of the personal estate when it would, under the limitation, pass into his daughter\u2019s hands. And this is all the significance the expression has.</p> <p id=\"b117-7\" pgmap=\"117(103) 118(20)\">It is further claimed by plaintiffs in error that the estate of the daughter was a contingent remainder, and that inasmuch as she died before the the termination of the particular estate which supported it, it never vested at all. Counsel are entirely mistaken in this view. The estate of the daughter had not a single element in it that distinguishes a contingent from a vested remainder. There was certainly no uncertainty as to the person who was to take. It was Mary Thompson, the daughter, clearly. And the time of her taking in possession was equally certain, namely: when Elizabeth Thompson ceased to be the widow of the testator, whether it was effected by death or a second marriage.</p> <p id=\"AiU\" pgmap=\"118\">A clearer example of a vested remainder could scarcely b.e conceived. But admitting, for argument\u2019s sake, plaintiffs in error are right upon this question, the admission is certainly fatal to' their right of recovery; for, if the daughter took a contingent remainder, of necessity the widow could not have taken a fee, and their right of recovery rests entirely upon the hypothesis that she took a fee simple title under the will.</p> <p id=\"AYj\" pgmap=\"118\">We are, in any view, clearly of opinion that the decree of the circuit court was right, and it is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b118-7\" pgmap=\"118\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
