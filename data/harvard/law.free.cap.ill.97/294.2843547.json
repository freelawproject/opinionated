The summons was returned by the sheriff with this return:</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-13\" pgmap=\"294\">\u201cThe president of the within named company not being found in my county, served this writ by reading and delivering a copy thereof to William H.

To show the reason of doing so, and why leave should be granted, he filed the affidavit of Walter McDonald, the deputy sheriff who made the service and return, and who made affidavit that he served the summons in accordance with the directions written in pencil upon the said summons; that-at the time he served said summons and made said return he did not personally know that Jenkins was secretary of said company, defendant. He did not know who was the president of said planing mill company, that he made no inquiry as to who the president was, and that he made no attempt to find said president. The return upon said summons, in so far as it implies that the president of said planing mill company could not have been found in Cook county, is incorrect, and was made by inadvertence. He made the service upon the person he was directed to serve, and made no attempt to serve any one else. He also filed the affidavit of A. C. Hesing, that he was at the time president of the company, defendant,'and that he was continuously in the'city of Chicago, at his office or residence, during the lifetime of the summons; also, that Wm. H. Jenkins was not the secretary of the company at the time of the service, but that Washington Hesing was such secretary. Also the affidavits of Washington Hesing and Wm. H.

Planing Mill Co. v. National Bank, 86 Ill. 587. By inadvertence, the judgment was made to affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, Avhen it was, in reality, intended to affirm only an order of that court allowing an amendment of the sheriff\u2019s return to the summons, and to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p> <p id=\"b299-5\" pgmap=\"299\">Upon having our attention, called to this mistake, we, of our own motion, ordered a rehearing of the cause; and Ave have heard additional arguments on the question, of avIiether it Avas proper to allow the amendment to be made to the sheriff\u2019s return to the summons.</p> <p id=\"b299-6\" pgmap=\"299\">The question has been thoroughly discussed on both sides, and we have given such careful and deliberate consideration to it as we have deemed necessary to a correct conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b299-7\" pgmap=\"299\">That the return, as originally made, was sufficient, and that as amended, it is insufficient to sustain the judgment, is fully shoAvn by the former opinion.</p> <p id=\"b299-8\" pgmap=\"299\">In the earlier cases in this court, it was held the circuit court may authorize a sheriff to amend his return, either before or after the rendition of a decree or judgment, and this, too, Avithout notice to the opposite party of an intention to apply for leave to amend.

Wilson, 57 Ill. 226, this doctrine Avas, however, in part, overruled, and it Avas there said: \u201c The true rule of practice, iipon much and mature reflection, Ave think, should only permit such amendments as a matter of course; and without notice, during the term at which the cause is determined.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b300-4\" pgmap=\"300\">Since then, it is held amendments may be made, by the sheriff, to his return, after the expiration of the term at which the cause is determined, only upon notice to all parties interested. National Ins. Co. v. Chamber of Commerce, 69 Ill. 22; Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Kellogg, 82 id. 614; Barlow v. Standford, id. 298.</p> <p id=\"b300-5\" pgmap=\"300\">. In each of the foregoing eases, and, so far as we have been able to discover, in all the cases hitherto decided by this court, in which the sheriff has been permitted to amend his return after judgment, the amendment has been in affirmance of judgment; and the question we are now to consider is, was the Superior Court authorized to allow an amendment, which, instead of being in affirmance of judgment, creates such error as necessitates its reversal, by this court?</p> <p id=\"b300-6\" pgmap=\"300\">Under the English statutes, and decisions thereon, no amendment was admissible save in affirmance of judgment. Blackamoer\u2019s Case, 4 Coke\u2019s R., part 8, p. 452, side p. 156 a; 1 Tidd\u2019s Practice (4th Am. ed.) 696; Wooden &amp; Hazel\u2019s Case, 1 Leonard, 134; Thompson v. Crocker, 1 Salkeld, 49; Walker v. Slackoe, 5 Modern, 69. And this seems to -be the ruling in every State of the Union where the question has been directly the subject of adjudication. Stewart v.

Lapice, 5 Smedes &amp; Marshall, 451; Englis v. Furness, 3 Ab. Pr. Rep. 82; Gasper v. Adams, 24 Barb. 287.</p> <p id=\"b300-7\" pgmap=\"300(41) 301(35)\">But counsel contend that the decisions in England, and in the other States, bearing upon the question, depend so much upon matters of local practice, and special statute, that they are not of controlling authority here; and they say that the fourth section of our statute of \u201cAmendments and Jeofails \u201d expressly authorizes the amendment of sheriffs\u2019 returns, according to the truth, whether that be in affirmance of judgment, or to produce error therein.</p> <p id=\"b301-4\" pgmap=\"301\">We can not concur in this view. A statute allowing such amendments would, in our opinion, be a most dangerous one to the stability of judgments, and we shall not assume that the legislature intended so to enact, in the absence of phraseology admitting of no other reasonable construction.</p> <p id=\"b301-5\" pgmap=\"301\">The first section of our statute of \u201cAmendments and Jeofails\u201d empowers the court in which an action is pending, to \u201c permit amendments iu any process, pleading or proceeding in such action; either in form or substance, for the furtherance of justice, on such terms as shall be just, at any time before judgment rendered therein.\u201d The word \u201creturn\u201d does not occur in this section.</p> <p id=\"b301-6\" pgmap=\"301\">The second section includes \u201c returns,\u201d and authorizes their amendment after judgment, but then only in affirmance of judgment. It is as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b301-7\" pgmap=\"301\">\u201cAfter judgment rendered in any cause, any defects or imperfections in matters of form, contained in the record, pleadings, process, entries, returns or other proceedings in such cause, may be rectified and amended by the court in affirmance of the judgment, so that such judgment shall not be reversed or annulled.\u201d * * *</blockquote> <p id=\"b301-8\" pgmap=\"301\">The fourth section is:</p> <blockquote id=\"b301-9\" pgmap=\"301\">\u201cAll returns by any sheriff or other officer, or by any court or subordinate tribunal, to any court, may be amended in matters of form, or according to the-truth of the matter, by the court to which such returns shall be made, in its discretion, as well before as after judgment.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b301-10\" pgmap=\"301(51) 302(62)\">It is to be kept in mind that no authority is given, in either of the preceding sections, in express terms, to amend returns before judgment. It was thought necessary, in' the second section, although the word process had been previously used, to expressly name \u201c returns \u201d as being amendable\u2014and it is but fair to assume that the same idea obtained in the enactment of the first and fourth sections\u2014that is, that to embrace returns they must be specifically named\u2014and, not having been named in the first section, nor their amendment provided for before judgment in the second section, it was necessary to confer this power of amendment in the fourth section.</p> <p id=\"b302-4\" pgmap=\"302\">The concluding words of the fourth section are strongly confirmatory of this view. They are, \u201c as well before as after,\u201d\u2014from which the only reasonable implication is; provision for amendment \u201cafter,\u201d already exists, but it is necessary now to confer power to amend before. The words are not equivalent in meaning to \u201ceither before or after,\u201d\u2014but clearly imply the \u201cconferring of a like power to do before that which there is already power to do after.</p> <p id=\"b302-5\" pgmap=\"302\">This view leaves the second section, only, applicable to amendments to returns after judgment; and, as has been seen, they can, by virtue of it, only be made in affirmance of judgment.</p> <p id=\"b302-6\" pgmap=\"302\">The order of. the court allowing the amendment to the sheriff\u2019s return was erroneous, and it is reversed; but the judgment below must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b302-7\" pgmap=\"302\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b302-8\" pgmap=\"302\">Cbaig, J.: I do not concur. In my opinion, the fourth section of the statute cited in the opinion authorized the amendment of the sheriff\u2019s return.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
