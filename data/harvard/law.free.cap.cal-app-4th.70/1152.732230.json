We conclude that, in general, juvenile waivers are subject to the same principles governing waivers by adults. Like an adult criminal defendant, a juvenile can knowingly and intelligently waive or restrict appellate review, particularly when the waiver is part of a plea bargain that includes a stipulated disposition. But where, as here, a juvenile admits the truth of criminal allegations and acknowledges the maximum length of a possible commitment to the California Youth Authority (CYA), without agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>that the juvenile court\u2019s disposition will in fact be a CYA commitment, the waiver will not preclude the juvenile arguing on appeal that the commitment was an abuse of the juvenile court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">It was alleged in petitions filed by the District Attorney of Solano County that 16-year-old Uriah R. had committed possession of marijuana for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359), attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 664),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> first degree robbery producing great bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 12022.7), assault with a deadly weapon on a public transit employee producing great bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2), 245.2, 12022.7), and unlawful possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021). The juvenile court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to join Uriah\u2019s case with those of two other juveniles involved in all but the marijuana charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">About the time the jurisdictional hearing was to be held, the prosecutor and counsel for Uriah had agreed to a partial negotiated disposition. A new charge, that Uriah had been an accessory (\u00a7 32), was added. Uriah would admit this charge, and the ones of unlawful weapon and marijuana possession; the remaining charges would be dismissed, but they could be considered at disposition <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 754 [159 Cal.Rptr. 696, 602 P.2d 396]). Uriah was aware that the maximum possible incarceration was five years in CYA. The juvenile court was given a three-page \u201cWaiver of Constitutional Rights and Declaration in Support of Minor\u2019s Motion to Admit\u201d signed and initialed by Uriah. Several of the initialed admonitions read as follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">\u201cAppeal Rights: Even though the court will take jurisdiction (I will be convicted) in this case as a result of my admission, I have the right to appeal the judgment and rulings of the courts. I give up my right of appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-9\">\u201cThe maximum punishment which the court may impose based upon this admission is a commitment to the California Youth Authority for 5 yrs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-10\">\u201cI understand that if, as a result of my admissions, I am made a ward of the court, the court has many options at its disposal ranging from returning me to my home to placing me in the California Youth Authority. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-11\">\u201cWhether or not I will be granted probation is determined solely by the judge. I understand that the court\u2019s order of disposition (my sentence) is solely within the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>The court asked Uriah whether he had read the form, whether his attorney had explained it to him, and whether he understood that \u201cyour maximum period of confinement is five years.\u201d Uriah answered \u201cYes\u201d to all three questions. The court then accepted his admissions, which it found were made after Uriah had \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived [his] rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The court rejected the urging of Uriah\u2019s mother and counsel that the most appropriate disposition would be probation or local placement;' the court agreed with the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for a CYA placement. Uriah was made a ward of the juvenile court and committed to the CYA for a period not to exceed four years and four months. The commitment term was calculated as follows: three years for what the commitment order described as \u201cAccessory to attempted murder,\u201d plus eight months for the weapons charge and another eight months for the marijuana charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Uriah filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">In his opening brief Uriah contends: (1) the juvenile court abused its discretion in ordering the CYA commitment; (2) the weapons \u201csentence\u201d should have been stayed pursuant to section 654 pending completion of the term on the accessory charge; and (3) \u201cbecause the juvenile court did not specify an intent to sentence consecutively, the maximum period of Youth Authority confinement must be stated to be three years, the maximum term for any single count.\u201d  The Attorney General in his brief responded that review of the second and third of these contentions was precluded by Uriah\u2019s waiver of appellate rights, but that his first contention could be examined on its merits. We requested supplemental briefing on the effectiveness and extent of Uriah\u2019s waiver with respect to the issues he raised in his brief. The parties\u2019 supplemental briefing has not only been very helpful, it reveals a surprising area of agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">The parties concur that there is no reported decision addressing the issue of juvenile appeal waivers. They further concur \u2014 as do we \u2014 that the most logical starting point for analyzing the issue of juvenile waivers is the treatment of adult waivers. That area is largely settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Proceeding from the premise that the right to appeal is purely statutory, courts have reasoned that if in the course of pleading guilty a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>defendant may validly waive important constitutional rights, the merely statutory right to appeal could also be surrendered. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1653, 1659 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 445]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 552, 557-559 [217 Cal.Rptr. 402].) Although the issue of whether the guilty plea was informed and voluntarily made will always remain open for appellate review, the plea will generally preclude review of matters or rulings occurring prior to the change of plea; an adult is allowed to bring up only \u201cconstitutional, jurisdictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings\u201d (\u00a7 1237.5, subd. (a)), but not issues of guilt or innocence, or irregularities that do not go to the fundamental power of the state to try the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 363, 369 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 406] and decisions cited.) Exceptions to this general rule may exist by virtue of statute (see \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (m); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 800, subd. (a)), or court rule (see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 31(d)), or may be reserved by the parties at the time the guilty plea is entered (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Sumstine </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 909, 914 [206 Cal.Rptr. 707, 687 P.2d 904]). Because waivers of appellate rights are ordinarily found in the context of a plea bargain, the scope of the waiver is approached like a question of contract interpretation \u2014 to what did the parties expressly or by reasonable implication agree? (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas, supra, </em>at pp. 1658-1659; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 114, 120 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 490].)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">As a general proposition, a broad or general waiver, such as \u201cI waive my appeal rights,\u201d will include error occurring prior to the waiver, but not subsequent error because the defendant could not make \u201ca knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to appeal any unforeseen or unknown future error . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vargas, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 1653, 1662.) If, however, the defendant agrees to a bargain which includes a specific or indicated sentence, and if that is the sentence actually imposed, the defendant\u2019s waiver will foreclose appellate review of the sentence; any challenge to the sentence will be deemed a challenge to an integral component of the bargain. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Panizzon, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 68, 78-79, 85-86; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 114, 122.) The waiver will not cover claims that the trial court imposed a sentence in excess of its fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>jurisdiction or the terms of the bargain, but the waiver will not allow review of alleged error in the computation or imposition of the sentence, including application of section 654. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen, supra, </em>at pp. 121-124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Uriah argues in effect that a juvenile should not be allowed to waive the right of appeal. He notes that waiver is not mentioned in either the statute authorizing juvenile appeals (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 800) or the court rule governing admissions of criminal allegations (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1487) and thus concludes that this omission \u201cis a strong indication that for juveniles, s\u00fach a waiver is impermissible.\u201d But there are two statutory recognitions that a juvenile can waive his constitutional right to counsel (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 634, 700) and two rule recognitions that a juvenile may waive additional constitutional rights and admit the charging allegations (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 1485(e), 1487(f)). Moreover, just like appeals from adult criminal court, all appeals from the juvenile court have a purely statutory basis. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Chi Ko Wong </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 698, 709 [135 Cal.Rptr. 392, 557 P.2d 976]; <em>In re Rottanak K. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 260, 265 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 543]; <em>Moch </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1919) 39 Cal.App. 471, 478 [179 P. 440].) The same logic upholding adult waivers is equally applicable to juveniles \u2014 the mind capable of waiving constitutional rights is just as capable of waiving a less important statutory right. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Charles, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d 552, 559-560.) Put another way, the person deemed intelligent enough to appreciate the consequences of admitting having committed a crime can also make an intelligent appreciation of the decision to forego review of that admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The general validity of juvenile waivers notwithstanding, the pertinent issue becomes the scope of the waiver that Uriah actually made. And here context is crucial. This was not the ordinary criminal prosecution, which almost invariably involves incarceration. Here, however, the venue was juvenile court, with a range of judicial responses extending all the way from release to parents to a CYA commitment. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 727, 730.) Nothing said on the record by counsel, court, or client at the time Uriah admitted the allegations establishes that the decision to commit Uriah to the CYA had already been made. The same is true of the dispositional hearing. No one \u2014 not the probation officer, not the deputy district attorney, not the court \u2014 suggested there was no need to consider other alternatives because it was already decided that the minor would be sent to CYA. Further corroboration can be found in the waiver form executed by Uriah. It shows that Uriah was advised that \u201cthe court has many options at its disposal ranging from returning me to my home to placing me in the California Youth Authority\u201d and that \u201cdisposition,\u201d including probation, \u201cis solely within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>discretion of the court.\u201d The extent of the bargain was that Uriah would admit the three least serious allegations, the four more serious violent charges would be dismissed, and the parties would proceed to the disposi-tional phase where the worst possible result for Uriah would be a CYA commitment not to exceed five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Clearly there was no specified disposition that was an integral part of the plea bargain. Because the plea agreement left the ultimate result reserved and unresolved, Uriah could not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to complain of whatever unforeseeable error might occur at the dispositional hearing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Panizzon, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 68, 84-86; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 1653, 1662.) In challenging the CYA commitment Uriah is not seeking \u201cappellate review of an integral element of the negotiated plea agreement, as opposed to a matter left open or unaddressed by the deal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Panizzon, supra, </em>at p. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">The Attorney General concedes that Uriah can challenge the decision to commit him to the CYA, but he argues that the contentions based on section 654 and the terms imposed on the accessory and weapon charges cannot be reviewed because these are matters affecting \u201cthe maximum term of confinement to which he consented.\u201d The Attorney General apparently reasons that because Uriah acknowledged that the \u201cmaximum punishment\u201d he might receive was five years with the CYA, and the total term of the actual commitment was four years and four months, any claims regarding the configuration or computation of the commitment term is covered by the appellate waiver. In effect, the Attorney General reads the minor\u2019s part of the bargain as \u201cI don\u2019t accept that I am going to CYA, but if I do it will be for no more than five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">The Attorney General appears to be proposing that a waiver can be valid in situations where a defendant or juvenile agrees to a disposition with a ceiling or maximum term of possible incarceration. Although one court has intimated that an appellate waiver may be acceptable in exchange for an indefinite term (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 114, 122), and the Attorney General\u2019s reading of the waiver form is not beyond plausibility, we cannot find waiver here. As already established, Uriah was never expressly told by the change of plea form that he would be committed to the CYA. Nor is this want remedied by the brief reporter\u2019s transcript, which has no mention of appellate consequences of Uriah admitting the allegations. There is nothing in the change of plea form or the reporter\u2019s transcript to show that Uriah was acquainted with the consequences of waiving his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>to appeal with respect to error past, present, and future. It is therefore very unlikely that he made an informed waiver of the length of a CYA commitment should one be ordered. Because the relevant portions of the record cannot remove the substantial element of speculation from the Attorney General\u2019s construction, the written waiver cannot be read as accepting a CYA commitment of five years or less. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosso </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1006-1007 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 218]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 1653, 1662.) Because the matter of disposition was left unresolved at the time Uriah admitted the allegations, the length of a CYA commitment amounts to an issue that may \u201cfairly be characterized as falling outside of [his] contemplation and knowledge when the waiver was made . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Panizzon, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 68, 85-86.) Finally, because the disposition was not precisely specified, it does not constitute an integral element of the bargain that a waiver would ordinarily exempt from scrutiny. Accordingly, the issues Uriah seeks to raise do not challenge the validity of his admissions. (See <em>id.., </em>at pp. 78-79.) If Uriah were an adult, the issues he now seeks to raise would not be foreclosed by his waiver. We discern no reason why a stricter standard should be applied to juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">We summarize our conclusions: (1) a juvenile is just as capable as an adult of making an intelligent and voluntary waiver of the purely statutory right to appeal; (2) the relevant statutes governing the proceedings conducted pursuant to the juvenile court law do not prohibit juvenile waivers; (3) a juvenile can agree to what is in obvious effect a plea bargain and, as an integral part of that bargain, the right to appeal may be waived; and, (4) in situations not involving a specified disposition, a juvenile\u2019s general waiver will not preclude attacks on subsequent errors that are unforeseen or unforeseeable at the time the waiver was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">A final note. The fact that a waiver of right to appeal will only rarely be applied according to its ordinarily brief and general language makes it important that the scope of the parties\u2019 understanding of the waiver be put on the record. This may be done orally by court or counsel; a voluntary and enforceable waiver may also be shown by a writing, such as a change of plea form. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Panizzon, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 68, 83-84, and decisions cited.) In this case, however, the scope of his waiver was never explained to Uriah or stated for the record. The broad interpretation urged by the Attorney General is too heavily dependent upon speculation to be enforced. It therefore cannot block our examining the merits of Uriah\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The commitment order is modified to show that appellant was found to be an accessory, within the meaning of section 32, with no further reference to any criminal offense. As so modified, the order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Hanlon, P. J., and Sepulveda, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Unless otherwise indicated all further statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Section 1237.5 imposes certain procedural requirements an adult criminal defendant who pleads guilty must satisfy before an appeal will be perfected. (See also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 31(d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1084, 1093-1094 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 969 P.2d 146]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Panizzon </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 68, 74-75 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 913 P.2d 1061].) The parties agree that these requirements do not apply to juvenile appeals. (See <em>In re Joseph B. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 952, 955-960 [196 Cal.Rptr. 348, 671 P.2d 852].) Nevertheless, the adult standard of nonjurisdictional irregularities and issues going to guilt or innocence have been applied to juveniles, (In <em>re John B. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 477 [263 Cal.Rptr. 607].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b935-7\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1152.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
