The court subsequently entered judgment in favor of respondent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Appellant complains that the trial court erred by bifurcating the statute of limitations issue, altering the order of proof, excluding evidence of equitable estoppel, instructing the jury, and dismissing his fraud cause of action. We find that no prejudicial errors were committed, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Appellant began his employment with Southern Pacific in 1963, and worked thereafter as a switchman, brakeman, and conductor. During the course of his employment duties until 1990, appellant was regularly subjected to loud, irritating noises from the locomotive engine, wheels and train whistle. The intensity of the noise varied with appellant\u2019s location on the train and the duties he performed. Southern Pacific never informed appellant that the \u201cnoise\u201d he experienced would cause permanent harm to his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">In 1984, Southern Pacific retained M.T.S. Associates (hereafter M.T.S.), a consulting company that provides \u201chearing conservation programs\u201d to the railroad and other industries, to collect sound level survey information, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>\u201ceducate employees on the hazards of noises and what they could do to protect themselves,\u201d and conduct hearing evaluations of Southern Pacific\u2019s employees. The primary purpose of the educational aspect of the M.T.S. program implemented for respondent was to inform \u201crailroad employees that certain levels of sound could damage their hearing.\u201d Employees were also advised that when the decibel level reached the point that they were forced to \u201craise their voice\u201d to be heard in conversation, they needed to use \u201cear protection.\u201d The hearing evaluations were \u201cstrictly for monitoring purposes,\u201d and did not diagnose the cause of hearing loss or notify employees that they had an \u201con-the-job related\u201d injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Appellant became aware that he suffered from hearing loss in 1984, when he was directed by Southern Pacific to take a hearing test. According to a \u201ctest card\u201d used by M.T.S., an audiogram performed upon appellant on May 25,1984, indicated that he suffered hearing impairment \u2014 that is an \u201cincrease in the decibel threshold\u201d \u2014 in the left ear, while his right ear then tested \u201cnormal.\u201d The audiogram result was consistent with appellant\u2019s complaint to the technician of \u201chearing difficulty\u201d in his left ear. Appellant was furnished with fitted earplugs by the technician following the 1984 test. Appellant acknowledged that he \u201chad a concern\u201d with his hearing in 1984, but felt it \u201cwas minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Appellant\u2019s hearing was tested again by M.T.S. on April 6, 1989. He then told the technician that he thought his hearing was \u201cworse.\u201d In regard to the state of his hearing in 1989, appellant testified at trial, \u201cI knew I had a problem.\u201d An audiogram taken in 1989 found no significant change in the left ear, but detected deterioration in the higher frequencies in the right ear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The audiogram results revealed that appellant suffered from \u201chigh above normal range of hearing loss.\u201d Due to the \u201cchange in hearing\u201d in the right ear, the evaluator made a notation on the test card questioning appellant\u2019s claim that he used hearing protection. A notation was also made that appellant was \u201cput on the list for counseling\u201d and further observation, and given the admonition, \u201cstrongly urge ear protection at all times in noise.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was again \u201cfitted for earplugs\u201d for use \u201cin the field.\u201d He was also scheduled for counseling during the next visit to the facility by M.T.S. late in 1989, but before then the contract with respondent was terminated. Appellant testified that he did not recall receiving earplugs in 1989, and did not wear hearing protection until he was directed to do so in 1992, although it was available to him earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>By no later than 1990, appellant suffered from \u201cringing\u201d in his ears, which he actually described as \u201ca sound of rushing air.\u201d Prior to June 15, 1991, he learned \u201cthrough the media\u201d that exposure to loud noise may damage hearing, and related the noise and hearing loss to \u201cwhere [he] worked at the time.\u201d He also testified that \u201c99 percent of the loud noises\u201d to which he had been exposed were generated by the \u201crailroad.\u201d Appellant claimed, however, that the \u201cfirst time\u201d he was informed he \u201chad a hearing problem\u201d was in a letter from Audiometric Services dated May 27, 1992, which referred to the change in his hearing found in the 1989 test. Before that date, he only entertained \u201ca suspicion\u201d of hearing loss. The letter advised appellant to consult a physician. Appellant testified that upon receiving the letter he associated his hearing loss with the noise to which he had been exposed at work, and intended to make a claim with Southern Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Appellant was subsequently examined by a Dr. Riordan. Appellant told Dr. Riordan that he had \u201cbeen exposed to noise produced by locomotive [engines] without wearing hearing protection.\u201d In Dr. Riordan\u2019s report, dated August 17, 1992, appellant indicated during the examination that he began experiencing ringing in the ears, or \u201ccontinuous non-pulsating bilateral tinnitus,\u201d in 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201caudiological evaluation\u201d of appellant stated in the report was: \u201cBilateral high frequency sensorineural hearing loss consistent with exposure to noise and presbycusis.\u201d According to appellant\u2019s testimony at trial, he concluded that his \u201chearing loss was caused from work\u201d only when he subsequently received Dr. Riordan\u2019s report in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Larry Evans, who was also a conductor for Southern Pacific until he retired in 1993, was a witness for appellant. He testified that he became aware of the requirement for Southern Pacific employees to wear hearing protection. He was not permitted to give the date the use of hearing protection became mandatory or his personal practice before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">I.-III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">IV. <em>The Statute of Limitations Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Appellant also submits that the statute of limitations instruction given by the trial court was an incorrect statement of law. Specifically, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>complains of language in the verdict form that asked the jury to determine whether he knew \u201cor should . . . have known that his hearing damage was <em>potentially </em>caused by his work at Southern Pacific?\u201d (Italics added.) Appellant asserts that the \u201c \u2018potentially work-related\u2019 standard\u201d expressed in the instructions is contrary to the test of accrual of a FELA cause of action, and \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d the proof required to support a finding against him on the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The FELA provides that, \u201cNo action shall be maintained under this chapter unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued.\u201d (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56.) Compliance with the three-year statute of limitations is a condition precedent for recovery in a FELA action. <em>(Emmons </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1983) 701 F.2d 1112, 1117; <em>Frasure </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. Co. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1991) 782 F.Supp. 477, 479.) In cases of latent or progressive injuries, such as that suffered by appellant, the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d directs that the cause of action does not commence to run until the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury and its cause. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Kubrick </em>(1979) 444 U.S. 111, 122-123 [100 S.Ct. 352, 359-360, 62 L.Ed.2d 259]; <em>Dubose </em>v. <em>Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1984) 729 F.2d 1026, 1028-1029; <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>CSX Transp., Inc. </em>(E.D. Mich. 1995) 887 F.Supp. 983, 989.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">We think the trial court\u2019s use of the \u201cpotentially caused\u201d language was in accord with existing law. Under the discovery rule, the test is an objective inquiry into whether the plaintiff knew or should have known, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the essential facts of injury and cause. <em>(Albert </em>v. <em>Maine Cent. R. Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1990) 905 F.2d 541, 544; <em>Townley </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1989) 887 F.2d 498, 501; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co. </em>(S.D.Miss. 1992) 813 F.Supp. 1227, 1231.) Constructive rather than actual knowledge of the fact of causation triggers a duty to investigate the possible causes \u00b0 of injury. <em>(Fries </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Transp. Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1990) 909 F.2d 1092, 1096; <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Maine Cent. R. Co., supra, </em>at p. 544; <em>Nemmers </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(7th Cir. 1986) 795 F.2d 628, 631-632; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co., supra, </em>at p. 1232.) Thus, in accordance with the objective test, \u201cdefinite knowledge\u201d that the injury is work related is not necessary in order for the cause of action to accrue. <em>(Albert </em>v. <em>Maine Cent. R. Co., supra, </em>at p. 544; <em>Dubose </em>v. <em>Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., supra, </em>729 F.2d at p. 1031.) Once the plaintiff believes or suspects that the <em>\u201cpotential </em>cause of his injury\u201d is work related, an affirmative duty to investigate is imposed. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co., supra, </em>at p. 1232, italics added; see also <em>Frasure </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. Co., supra, </em>782 F.Supp. at p. 480.) \u201cA plaintiff need not be sure which cause is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>predominant, as long as [he] knows or has reason to know of a <em>potential cause.\u201d (Tolston </em>v. <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1996) 102 F.3d 863, 865, italics added; see also <em>Fries </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Transp. Co., supra, </em>at p. 1096; <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>CSX Transp., Inc., supra, </em>887 F.Supp. at p. 989.) We find no error in the language of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">V. <em>Preemption of Fraudulent Concealment Cause of Action.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The preponderance of appellant\u2019s brief is devoted to the argument that the trial court erred by finding his cause of action under state law for fraudulent concealment was preempted by the FELA. Appellant insists that the FELA, which \u201ccreates liability only for negligence,\u201d was not intended to \u201cpreempt state laws designed to prevent and deter intentional torts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">The doctrine of federal preemption is derived from the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (art. VI, cl. 2) and is designed to prevent the states from impinging on federal law and policy. <em>(Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 504, 516 [112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407].) \u201cUnder the supremacy clause . . . , federal law preempts state law where Congress so intends.\u201d <em>(Fenning </em>v. <em>Glenfed, Inc. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1290 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 715].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn determining whether a state statute [or a state cause of action] is pre-empted by federal law and therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, our sole task is to ascertain the intent of Congress. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Sepulveda </em>v. <em>Highland Fed. Savings &amp; Loan </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1692, 1703-1704 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 555], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">\u201cAll preemption cases begin with the presumption that federal statutes do not supersede the historic police powers of the state unless Congress manifests a clear intent to do so.\u201d <em>(Viad Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 330, 333 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 136].) \u201c \u2018Preemption of state law by federal regulation is not favored. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Sepulveda </em>v. <em>Highland Fed. Savings &amp; Loan, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 1708; see also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 519, 525 [97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309-1310, 51 L.Ed.2d 604]; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 218, 230 [67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447].)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Three forms of preemption may occur: (1) where Congress expressly specifies that its enactment preempts state law (express preemption); (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive that there is a reasonable inference Congress intended to dominate the field and state laws on the same subject are precluded (field preemption); and (3) where federal law actually conflicts with state law and it is impossible for a private party to comply with both requirements (conflict preemption). <em>(English </em>v. <em>General Electric Co. </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 72, 78-79 [110 S.Ct. 2270, 2274-2275, 110 L.Ed.2d 65]; <em>Industrial Truck Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 125 F.3d 1305, 1309.)  The provisions of the FELA neither expressly preempt appellant\u2019s fraudulent concealment action nor fatally conflict with it. Thus, we are left with an inquiry into field preemption.  \u201cTo impliedly preempt a field, Congress must create a scheme of regulation so pervasive one could reasonably infer that Congress intended to occupy the field completely, leaving no room for supplemental state law.\u201d <em>(Nordgren </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Company </em>(8th Cir. 1996) 101 F.3d 1246, 1251; see also <em>Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>de la Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 153 [102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d 664].) \u201cWhere Congress intends to occupy a field, state law in that field is preempted. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 212-213, 103 S.Ct. 1713, 1726-27, 75 L.Ed.2d 752 (1983).\u201d <em>(Springston </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 130 F.3d 241, 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The FELA has been uniformly found to comprise \u201cthe exclusive remedy for injured railroad employees. <em>Wabash R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>234 U.S. 86, 34 S.Ct. 729, 58 L.Ed. 1226, (1914); <em>Janelle </em>v. <em>Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>524 F.2d 1259, 1261 (5th Cir.1975). FELA is worded broadly and is interpreted even more broadly.\u201d <em>(Earwood </em>v. <em>Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. </em>(N.D.Ga. 1993) 845 F.Supp. 880, 885; see also <em>Lilly </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk R. Co. </em>(1943) 317 U.S. 481, 485 [63 S.Ct. 347, 350-351, 87 L.Ed. 411].) \u201cIt is clear that Congress manifestly intended to occupy the field of recovery for personal injuries to railroad employees incurred in the course of employment when it enacted FELA. See <em>[New York Cent. R.Co. </em>v.] <em>Winfield, </em>244 U.S. [147,] 152, 37 S.Ct. [546,] 548 [61 L.Ed. 1045].\u201d <em>(Nordgren </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Company, supra, </em>101 F.3d at p. 1252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">In <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. </em>(1926) 272 U.S. 605 [47 S.Ct. 207, 71 L.Ed. 432], the United States Supreme Court was presented with the issue of the validity of state statutes which required all trains operating in the state to have an automatic firedoor and a cab curtain. A field preemption challenge to the statutes was made under the federal Locomotive Boiler Inspection Act (hereafter the BIA, codified in the federal Transportation Code, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701 et seq.), enacted as an amendment to the FELA and intended to protect train service employees and the traveling public from defective locomotive boilers and equipment. <em>(Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1949) 337 U.S. 163, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>189-191 [69 S.Ct. 1018, 1034-1035, 93 L.Ed. 1282, ,11 A.L.R.2d 252].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The power delegated to the Interstate Commerce Commission by the BIA to prescribe regulations for locomotive equipment was found to be a \u201cgeneral one. It extends to the design, the construction, and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.\u201d <em>(Napier </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra, </em>at p. 611 [47 S.Ct. at p. 209].) The comprehensive scope of the authority conferred upon the commission to regulate the design, construction and material of every part of the locomotive, led the court to conclude that the BIA was intended to occupy \u201cthe field of regulating locomotive equipment used on a highway of interstate commerce,\u201d <em>(Napier </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra, </em>at p. 607 [47 S.Ct. at p. 207]) and therefore preempted additional state requirements for locomotive equipment. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 613 [47 S.Ct. at p. 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">To support his argument against preemption, appellant relies primarily on the opinion in <em>Viad Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th 330, where the Second District confronted the issue of preemption in the context of negligence, strict product liability, warranty, personal injury and wrongful death actions brought by the real parties in interest, employees and relatives of employees of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads, against the petitioner for damages resulting from exposure to asbestos insulation contained on locomotives manufactured by the defendant\u2019s predecessor in interest. The petitioner in <em>Viad </em>claimed preemption of the state law tort causes of action by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The court in <em>Viad </em>acknowledged the venerable decision in <em>Napier, </em>but was influenced by \u201ca number of other factors\u201d and \u201ctwo recent Supreme Court cases,\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 470 [116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700] (hereafter Medtronic) and <em>Silkwood </em>v. <em>Kerr-McGee Corp. </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 238 [104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443] (hereafter <em>Silkwood) </em>and concluded \u201cthat, notwithstanding <em>Napier, </em>the tort damages sought by real parties against petitioner are not preempted by the BIA.\u201d <em>(Viad Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 336-337.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court in <em>Viad </em>departed from the holding in <em>Napier </em>under an altered preemption analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>derived from <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood </em>that focused on \u201ca precise identification of what field is preempted by the federal legislation at issue.\u201d <em>(Viad Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 339.) The court concluded \u201cthat although <em>Napier </em>expressly involves the BIA and contains language that could be construed to support petitioner\u2019s position, we must nevertheless be guided by the analysis employed more recently in <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood. </em>Although those cases involve different statutes, they are more directly applicable because they involve state law tort damages. The language in <em>Napier </em>that Congress intended to occupy \u2018the field of regulating locomotive equipment\u2019 must be read narrowly in light of the circumstances in existence at the time of its writing and in light of the statutory framework as a whole.\u201d <em>(Viad Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 340-341, fn. omitted.) \u201cBecause ... no intent to expressly preclude tort remedies against a manufacturer\u201d was found in the BIA, the court declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>to \u201csay the field, which <em>Napier </em>found to be completely occupied, includes tort liabilities not contemplated at the time <em>Napier </em>was written.\u201d <em>(Viad Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at p. 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">We do not agree with <em>Viad </em>that the <em>Napier </em>analysis of the broad preemptive reach of the BIA and the FELA has been undermined by the decisions in <em>Medtronic </em>and <em>Silkwood. </em>First, <em>Medtronic </em>was not a field preemption case, but rather focused upon an express preemption provision in the MDA and accompanying regulations, which, in contrast to the BIA, the court found did not evince a legislative intent to foreclose established state tort remedies absent a direct threat of interference with a specific, articulated federal interest. <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 500 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2257-2258].) Further, nothing in the BIA is comparable to the Atomic Energy Act examined in <em>Silkwood, </em>which in companion legislation demonstrated congressional intent to leave existing state tort remedies intact. <em>(Silkwood, supra, </em>464 U.S. at pp. 251-252 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 626-624].) To promote the primary objective of safety, the FELA provided a federal remedy for injured employees where none existed before, leading to the inference that Congress intended to supplant other future remedies furnished by state law. Finally, given the interstate nature of railroads and the need for national uniformity of regulations, the impact of state tort actions and attendant conflicting liability determinations upon locomotive design, manufacture, materials and operation, militates in favor of preemption to avoid the unintended result of forced conformance with diverse state standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The Ninth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion of <em>Viad </em>in <em>Law </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 114 F.3d 908, 911-912, a case in which railroad workers claimed severe hearing loss due to excessive noise generated by locomotives, and sued the defendant locomotive manufacturers under various state law tort theories for defective design, failure to properly insulate work stations, and failure to warn of the risk of hearing loss. The court observed that the \u201cbroad preemptive sweep\u201d of the BIA announced in <em>Napier </em>was \u201cnecessary to maintain uniformity of railroad operating standards across state lines. . . . Any state law that undermines this regime is preempted by the BIA.\u201d <em>(Law </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>114 F.3d at p. 910.) Preemption was extended to common law tort liability, not just direct state regulation of railroad safety. The court reasoned, \u201c[i]t has long been settled that Congress intended federal law to occupy the field of locomotive equipment and safety, particularly as it relates to injuries suffered by railroad workers in the course of their employment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 910.) The railroad workers\u2019 \u201ccommon-law claims\u201d for damages due to hearing loss were found to \u201cfall squarely within this preempted field.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court in <em>Law </em>also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>rejected the notion that the plaintiffs would be \u201cwithout a remedy for their injuries\u201d were manufacturers held not liable for design defects. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 912.) Under the FELA, the court observed, railroad workers may \u201crecover against their employers for all occupational injuries, including hearing loss caused by locomotive noise. . . . flQ Thus, the federal government has established a comprehensive mechanism for vindicating the rights of railroad workers \u2014 a mechanism that doesn\u2019t undermine the BIA\u2019s goal of uniformity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.', </em>see also <em>First Sec. Bank </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1998) 152 F.3d 877, 880-881; <em>Springston </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp., supra, </em>130 F.3d at pp. 244-245; <em>Missouri Pacific R.R. </em>v. <em>Railroad Com\u2019n of Texas </em>(5th Cir. 1988) 850 F.2d 264, 268; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 720 F.2d 1149, 1152; <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Missouri Pacific R.R. </em>(E.D.Okla. 1993) 832 F.Supp. 328; <em>In re Train Collision at Gary, Indiana </em>(Ind.Ct.App. 1996) 670 N.E.2d 902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">We agree with the reasoning of <em>Law, </em>but are presented with an additional issue not directly confronted in that opinion; whether a cause of action for the <em>intentional </em>tort of fraudulent concealment falls within the comprehensive preemptive reach of the FELA. That the exclusive remedy provided by FELA preempts state law in actions by railroad employees predicated upon the <em>negligence </em>of their employers is well settled. <em>(Dice </em>v. <em>Akron, C. &amp; Y. R. Co. </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 359 [72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398]; <em>Wabash R. R. </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1914) 234 U.S. 86 [34 S.Ct. 729, 58 L.Ed. 1226]; <em>Nordgren </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Company, supra, </em>101 F.3d at p. 1250; <em>Janelle </em>v. <em>Seaboard Coast Line R. Co. </em>(5th Cir. 1975) 524 F.2d 1259, 1261; <em>Earwood </em>v. <em>Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., supra, </em>845 F.Supp. at p. 885; <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth. </em>(E.D.Pa. 1991) 757 F.Supp. 623, 626-627; <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Ry. </em>(1994) 266 Ill.App.3d 329 [203 Ill.Dec. 741, 640 N.E.2d 661, 663].) \u201c[I]f the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act applies to an employee\u2019s negligence claim, the act supersedes a state\u2019s common and statutory law, even though the employee seeks relief in a state court.\u201d <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R.R. </em>(1991) 237 Neb. 617 [467 N.W.2d 388, 393].) Directing our attention to <em>Pikop </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(Minn. 1986) 390 N.W.2d 743, appellant maintains that where, as here, an intentional tort has been asserted, the action \u201clies outside the scope of FELA,\u201d and no preemption occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Although appellant\u2019s action for intentional misrepresentations is not premised upon principles of negligence, it nevertheless falls within the scope of an actionable claim under the FELA.  The provisions of the FELA make the railroad directly liable for \u201cthe negligence of any of the officers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>agents, or employees of such carrier . . . .\u201d (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   The definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d for purposes of the FELA is an expansive one, however, encompassing \u201cany intentional tort which inflicts bodily injury upon the employee.\u201d <em>(Slaughter </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company </em>(D.C.Cir. 1962) 302 F.2d 912, 915 [112 App.D.C. 327, 8 A.L.R.3d 436].) A plaintiff proceeding under the FELA \u201cmay prevail in an intentional tort case by showing either that the intentional tort was committed in furtherance of the employer\u2019s objectives or that the employer was negligent in hiring, supervising, or failing to fire the employee . . . .\u201d <em>(Lancaster </em>v. <em>Norfolk and Western Ry. Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1985) 773 F.2d 807, 818; see also <em>Jamison </em>v. <em>Encamacion </em>(1930) 281 U.S. 635, 641 [50 S.Ct. 440, 442-443, 74 L.Ed. 1082]; <em>Besta </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1984) 580 F.Supp. 869.) To rule otherwise and deny liability for intentional misconduct, a much graver breach of duty than negligence, would grant a plaintiff in a FELA case fewer rights than an \u201cordinary tort plaintiff,\u201d a result manifestly unintended by the act. <em>(Lancaster </em>v. <em>Norfolk and Western Ry. Co., supra, </em>at p. 818.) Appellant\u2019s action against respondent for fraudulent concealment of the dangers of excessive noise is essentially one for failure to provide a safe place to work or failure to warn of known risks, both of which are authorized by the FELA. (See <em>Law </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>114 F.3d at pp. 910-912; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company </em>(6th Cir. 1962) 309 F.2d 546, 549; <em>McClellan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1932) 62 F.2d 61, 63; <em>Holladay </em>v. <em>Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co. </em>(S.D.Iowa 1966) 255 F.Supp. 879, 883-884; <em>Mortensen </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 241, 244 [53 Cal.Rptr. 851].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Further, appellant seeks recovery for compensable physical injuries under the FELA. Thus is his case distinguishable from an intentional tort action for merely <em>emotional harm, </em>which is excluded from the coverage of the FELA, and was for that reason found <em>not </em>preempted by the federal statute in <em>Pikop </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Co., supra, </em>390 N.W.2d at pages 753-755. (See also <em>Cavanaugh </em>v. <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(D.Minn. 1996) 941 F.Supp. 872, 878-879.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In appellant\u2019s action, which falls within the scope of the FELA, the objective of a uniform federal compensatory scheme may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>compromised by a conflicting state system of compensation that authorizes a plaintiff to proceed with a case otherwise barred by the governing federal statute of limitations. (See <em>Law </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>114 F.3d at p. 912.) We do not ignore or minimize the state interest in protecting its citizens from fraudulent concealment of dangers by railroad employers, but conclude that where a remedy for it has been provided by the broad reach of the FELA, which occupies the field for personal injuries to railroad employees incurred in the course of employment, the state common law tort action is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Strankman, P.

The statute at issue in <em>Medtronic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>contained an express preemption clause, which prohibited establishment of any state requirement distinct from that contained in the MDA, but no provision regarding a right of action against manufacturers.
