Kroncke of failing to stop and report an auto accident (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 20001, 20003),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a felony, and giving false information to a police officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 31), a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">The principal issue is whether sections 20001 and 20003 require that a driver involved in an injury-producing accident identify himself as the driver, when that is not reasonably apparent. As we shall explain, the pertinent sections do impose such a duty. We further conclude that requiring the driver to inform investigating officers that he or she was the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident does not violate the driver\u2019s constitutional right against self-incrimination. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">\n<em>Overview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">This case arises from the death of Martin Jacobsen, a 21-year-old Danish tourist. According to Kroncke, he met Jacobsen in the early morning hours in San Francisco and offered to drive him to Marin County. Immediately after they drove across the Golden Gate Bridge, Jacobsen suddenly jumped from Kroncke\u2019s pickup truck and suffered injuries that were eventually fatal. Kroncke got off at the next freeway exit and returned to where Jacobsen lay on the side of the road. Within a minute, a Golden Gate Bridge officer also arrived at the scene. Kroncke gave his name and other identifying information to the officers at the scene. He also told the officers he was driving on Highway 101 when he spotted Jacobsen on the side of the road and stopped to render aid. In instructing the jury, the court stated that sections 20001. and 20003 impose a duty on a driver to \u201cdisclose to the investigating officers that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident, if such involvement is not reasonably apparent.\u201d Kroncke contends the pertinent Vehicle Code sections impose no such duty, and the trial court prejudicially erred when it gave the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">\n<em>Prosecution Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">On September 28, 1995, Danish tourists Martin Jacobsen and his cousin Nikolas Sorensen arrived in San Francisco, where they stayed in a downtown youth hostel. A few days later, Jacobsen told his cousin he was going to the Haight-Ashbury district to sleep with the homeless in the park. At 12:30 a.m. on October 4, Jacobsen left for the Haight with his sleeping bag and a small amount of money. He left his identification and most of his money at the hostel. He told Sorensen he would meet him at the hostel in the afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">About 3:30 a.m., some three hours after Jacobsen left his hostel, a witness saw Jacobsen\u2019s body lying against the guard rail in the northbound lane of Highway 101, just before the Waldo tunnel in Marin County. The witness stopped at a turnout before the tunnel and used a call box to summon help. While he was at the call box, the witness saw a pickup truck pull up to Jacobsen\u2019s body. A heavyset man \u2014 Kroncke\u2014got out of the truck, walked to Jacobsen\u2019s body, and shook him. Emergency vehicles arrived at the scene approximately one minute later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">Golden Gate Bridge District Sergeant David Mills was the first officer to arrive at the scene. He saw Kroncke\u2019s pickup truck stopped in the slow lane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>and Jacobsen lying by the guardrail. Jacobsen was seriously injured and gasping for air. Mills called for an ambulance. Mills did not believe that either Kroncke or his truck was connected to Jacobsen or the accident. Kroncke did not volunteer any information about how Jacobsen came to be on the roadway, nor did he tell Mills he was involved in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">A few minutes later, District Lieutenant Michael Locati arrived at the scene. In response to Locati\u2019s questions, Kroncke said he was going northbound when he happened to see Jacobsen lying by the side of the road. Kroncke also said he was a Golden Gate Transit bus driver. Kroncke gave Lieutenant Locati his name and address and Locati wrote down Kroncke\u2019s license plate number. Nothing at the scene or in what Kroncke said led Locati to believe Kroncke was connected with Jacobsen or the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">Marin County Deputy Sheriff Fred Marziano also stopped at the scene to render assistance. Marziano, who knew Kroncke casually from various professional and social contacts, asked Kroncke if he knew what had happened. Kroncke said he did not know what had happened. He said he was driving up the freeway when he saw a person by the side of the road. There was nothing about the position of Kroncke\u2019s pickup or Jacobsen\u2019s body that indicated the pickup had struck Jacobsen or that he had fallen from that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">Jacobsen was taken to Marin General Hospital where the treating doctor determined he had a terminal brain injury. He was placed on life support, but died three days later. At the time he entered the hospital Jacobsen had a .16 percent blood-alcohol level. An autopsy revealed Jacobsen had suffered a \u201ccontrecoup\u201d injury, from which the expert opined Jacobsen\u2019s head was in motion when he suffered a blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">The prosecution\u2019s accident reconstruction expert opined Jacobsen was sitting upright and facing to the rear when he stepped or jumped from a moving vehicle near the .6 mile marker on Highway 101. Jacobsen rolled on the asphalt for about 56 to 84 feet and came to rest 70 feet north of the .6 mile marker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">More than three weeks after the accident, on October 31, 1995, Marin County Sheriff Detective Jeff Carroll interviewed Kroncke in connection with Jacobsen\u2019s death. Kroncke told Carroll he had been in San Francisco early on the morning of October 4, and was driving back home to Marin County when he came across a body on the right shoulder of the roadway. Kroncke stopped to render aid and noted Jacobsen\u2019s pupils were \u201cblown,\u201d which indicated to Kroncke that Jacobsen had suffered a head injury. Carroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>asked Kroncke if he had ever seen the injured person before. Kroncke responded he did not recognize the person and had never seen him before.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Three days later, Kroncke contacted Detective Carroll and said he wanted to give an additional statement. In a tape-recorded interview, Kroncke admitted Jacobsen had jumped from his truck. Kroncke said he drove to Haight Street in the early morning hours of October 4. There, he saw a person setting trash can fires and helped detain him until the police arrived. Afterwards, he saw Jacobsen ask a police officer for directions to the water. A few minutes later, Kroncke saw Jacobsen near Cala Foods with a group of homeless people. Kroncke offered Jacobsen a ride to his hostel, and Jacob-sen accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">After they drove around a bit, Jacobsen said his hostel was locked until morning and Kroncke asked Jacobsen if he wanted to go Marin for a drink. Jacobsen agreed. After they crossed the Golden Gate Bridge and passed Vista Point, Jacobsen started panicking, and said he wanted to go back to San Francisco. Kroncke said he would turn around and drive him back, but Jacobsen said he wanted to get out. Just north of Vista Point, Jacobsen suddenly opened the passenger door and stepped out of the pickup. Kroncke was traveling at 40 to 45 miles per hour at the time. Kroncke drove through the Waldo tunnel to the Spencer exit. He sat there in shock for \u201cseveral minutes\u201d before he decided to drive back to look for Jacobsen. When he returned he found Jacobsen lying on the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">Kroncke testified that on October 4, 1995, it was too hot to sleep and he went for a drive. His intent was to drive toward the Cliff House in San Francisco to get a view of the Mount Vision fire, which was then burning in western Marin County. He eventually ended up in the Haight-Ashbury district where he saw firefighters extinguishing a trash can fire. Kroncke saw a second fire and then saw a man light a third fire. Kroncke detained the man until Officer Ramos arrested him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">While Kroncke was talking with the police, Jacobsen approached Officer Ramos and asked for directions to the water. Ramos suggested Jacobsen take a bus and pointed to a nearby bus stop. As he was leaving the area, Kroncke saw Jacobsen standing near several homeless people in front of Cala Foods. Concluding Jacobsen was \u201cout of his element,\u201d Kroncke approached him and asked if he wanted a ride. Jacobsen accepted. Following a brief skirmish with a drug dealer, Jacobsen got into Kroncke\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>After Jacobsen got into the truck, Kroncke drove out to Land\u2019s End where they observed the Mount Vision fire. They then drove through the Marina and North Beach looking for Jacobsen\u2019s hostel. Jacobsen could not remember where his hostel was, and Kroncke was unable to find it for him. Jacobsen eventually told Kroncke he had not checked out a key and would not be able to get into the hostel until 6:00 a.m. that morning in any event. Kroncke was not in any hurry because he had the next day off. Eventually they ended up at the Vista Point in San Francisco located at the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge. There, Kroncke asked Jacobsen if he wanted to go across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin County. Jacobsen agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">As they were driving across the bridge about 45 miles per hour, Kroncke pointed out various landmarks. Jacobsen was talkative at that point. However, after Kroncke crossed the bridge and arrived at a point where the view of San Francisco was cut off, Jacobsen\u2019s demeanor changed. Jacobsen demanded that Kroncke stop and let him out. Kroncke explained he could not stop on the freeway, but said he would turn at the next exit (Spencer Avenue) and take Jacobsen back to the city. Jacobsen appeared to be panicking. Suddenly, Kroncke heard the sound of whooshing air, as if Jacobsen had opened the car door. He looked over towards Jacobsen and saw his back as he stepped from the truck. Kroncke was shocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Kroncke continued driving, passed two turnouts, and got off at the first exit (Spencer Avenue) where he stayed for a few minutes wondering what to do. Ultimately, he decided to return to the area where Jacobsen had jumped rather than calling for help on a nearby phone. Kroncke returned to that area by the shortest route possible. Kroncke stopped his truck 20 feet from Jacobsen so he could see him in his headlights. Kroncke shook Jacobsen, and noticed blood coming from his nose, and that his eyes were half open but unfocused. Kroncke, who had training as an emergency medical technician, determined Jacobsen\u2019s injuries were severe and there was nothing he could do. Kroncke was still in shock at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">About 30 seconds later, Sergeant Mills arrived at the scene. A few minutes after Mills arrived, Kroncke voluntarily gave Mills his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration and said, \u201cH\u00e9re\u2019s my info, I\u2019m the driver, and this is the vehicle.\u201d Kroncke did not recall having any substantive conversations with any other officer that night. He was in \u201cno shape to talk\u201d and didn\u2019t say anything. Kroncke waited until an ambulance took Jacobsen away, and then went home to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">Kroncke denied he was attempting to deceive the officers at the scene. He gave the officers his identification and thought it was fair to assume they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>would know he was the driver. Kroncke believed he had identified himself \u201cas being involved in what was going on. . . . [The truck] was the one involved and I am the driver, not just someone who happened along.\u201d Given the position of his pickup, Kroncke assumed the officers would reasonably conclude he was connected to the body on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">On October 31, when Detective Carroll asked Kroncke if he had seen Jacobsen before, Kroncke answered no because he had not seen him <em>before the day of the accident. </em>Kroncke admitted he told Carroll he had been driving northbound on Highway 101 when he saw the body on the side of the road, and that he may have left Carroll with the impression he found Jacobsen on the side of the road. On November 3, after speaking with his brother who is a highway patrol officer, Kroncke decided to speak with Detective Carroll again. Kroncke\u2019s motive was \u201cto set the story straight,\u201d even though he did not believe he had previously told Carroll anything that was false or inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Over defense objection, the court instructed the jury that sections 20001 and 20003 impose a duty on a driver to \u201cdisclose to the investigating officers that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident, if such involvement is not reasonably apparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">The jury returned a verdict finding Kroncke guilty of violating sections 20001 (failure to report an accident) and 31 (giving false information to a police officer.) The court sentenced Kroncke to three years\u2019 probation, conditioned on his serving six months in county jail. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">A. <em>The Trial Court Properly Instructed the Jury That Sections 20001 and 20003 Impose a Duty on a Driver to Disclose That He Was the Driver of a Vehicle Involved in an Accident, If Such Involvement Is Not Reasonably Apparent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">Kroncke first contends the trial court erred when it instructed the jury he had a statutory duty to disclose to the investigating officers that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident. Kroncke contends sections 20001 and 20003 contain no express requirement to that effect, and therefore the trial court erred when it gave the instruction. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">Section 20001, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to any person, other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>than himself or herself, or in death of any person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and shall fulfill the requirements of Sections 20003 and 20004.\u201d Section 20003, subdivision (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person shall also give his or her name, current residence address, . . . the registration number of the vehicle he or she is driving, and the name and current residence address of the owner to . . . any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Kroncke correctly points out that the quoted sections do not explicitly impose a requirement that a person identify himself as the driver of a vehicle involved in an injury-producing accident. However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Monismith </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 762 [81 Cal.Rptr. 879] <em>(Monismith), </em>the court rejected such a literal interpretation of sections 20001 and 20003, and concluded that to comply with section 20001 the driver must identify himself as the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident, at least where such is not reasonably apparent from the circumstances. In <em>Monismith, </em>as here, the defendant was charged with violating sections 20001 and 20003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the defendant gave identifying information, he failed to inform the officers at the scene that he was the driver of a car <em>involved in the accident. </em>The trial court specifically instructed the jury that the defendant had a duty to \u201c \u2018identify himself as the driver involved in the accident.\u2019 \u201d (1 Cal.App.3d at p. 765.) As Kroncke does here, the defendant argued on appeal that the pertinent sections do not require the driver of a vehicle to report that his vehicle was involved in the accident, but only to give the specific information the sections specify. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In rejecting this contention, the <em>Monismith </em>court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">\u201c[Defendant\u2019s] contention flies in the face of the language of both sections 20001 and 20003, since the introductory sentence of each refers to the \u2018driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury.\u2019 Clearly, the code sections are concerned not with just a driver and not with just a vehicle, but with the driver of a vehicle <em>involved in an accident. </em>[Citations.] While it is true, as defendant argues, a court cannot, by an extension of the language of a statute, make something a crime which the Legislature has not defined as criminal, it is also true that a court, in interpreting legislation of this character, looks at the evil which the statute is designed to remedy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>Obviously the statute here is designed to prevent the driver of a car involved in an accident from leaving the scene without furnishing information as to his identity. It seems equally clear that the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident can furnish such identification only by identifying himself as the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident. (\u00a7 20001.)\u201d <em>(Monismith, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 766, italics in original.)  Thus, the <em>Monismith </em>court concluded the trial court did not err when it instructed the jury \u201cthat to comply with section 20001 defendant was under a duty not only to identify himself, as he did, but also to identify himself as the <em>driver of a vehicle involved in the accident.\u201d {Id. </em>at pp. 767-768, italics in original.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">The facts in <em>Monismith </em>are similar to those in the case at bench. In <em>Monismith, </em>the defendant\u2019s car struck and fatally injured a pedestrian. However, the defendant\u2019s companion was actually driving at the time of the accident. Because the companion did not have a driver\u2019s license, he asked the defendant to say that he (the defendant) was driving. The defendant returned to the scene of the accident and gave the investigating officers his name, address, registration, and driver\u2019s license, but falsely told the officers he was driving. He did not tell the officers his car was involved in the accident, nor did his companion disclose this information. (1 Cal.App.3d at p. 764.) The defendant and his companion both denied to bystanders that their car had struck the victim. The defendant was convicted of violating sections 20001 and 20003 because he failed to disclose his car was involved in the accident, even though he was not actually driving at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Monismith, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at pp. 764-765, 766.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">If anything, the facts of the present case present a more compelling case in favor of the People\u2019s position than those in <em>Monismith, </em>because here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>Kroncke <em>was </em>driving the vehicle at the time of the accident. Nevertheless, both Monismith and Kroncke failed to identify the \u201cdriver involved\u201d in their respective accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Kroncke makes several arguments to discredit and distinguish <em>Monismith, </em>none of which are persuasive. We note that <em>Monismith </em>has been the law of this state for nearly 30 years without drawing criticism from any published case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">First, Kroncke contends <em>Monismith </em>erroneously interprets the language of section 20003. We disagree. We agree with <em>Monismith </em>that \u201c. . . the code sections are concerned not with just a driver and not with just a vehicle, but with the driver of a vehicle <em>involved in an </em>accident.\u201d (1 Cal.App.3d at p. 766, italics in original.) Consequently, to comply in a meaningful way with the statute, a driver must identify himself as the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">As the <em>Monismith </em>court observed, in understanding the meaning and scope of a criminal statute, we must be guided by the evil the Legislature sought to avert and the method chosen to do so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berry </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 778, 783 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 416].)  Moreover, \u201c \u201c\u2018[t]he primary rule of statutory construction, to which every other rule as to interpretation of particular terms must yield, is that the intention of the legislature must be ascertained if possible, and, when once ascertained, will be given effect, even though it may not be consistent with the strict letter of the statute. . . \u2019 \u201d <em>(Dickey </em>v. <em>Raisin Proration Zone No. 1 </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 796, 802 [151 P.2d 505, 157 A.L.R. 324], quoted in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 304, 311 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 830].) Thus, \u201c \u2018[i]n the analysis of statutes for the purpose of finding the legislative intent, regard is to be had not so much to the exact phraseology in which the intent has been expressed as to the general tenor and scope of the entire scheme embodied in the enactments. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Frisbie </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 634, 639 [122 P.2d 526], quoted in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 311; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jimenez </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1625 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 268] [applying similar rules to section 20001], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kobrin </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 416, 419, 427 fn. 7 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 895, 903 P.2d 1027].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">Here, sections 20001 and 20003 are part of a statutory scheme which imposes on drivers the obligation to self-report when the driver\u2019s vehicle has been involved in an accident. The purpose of these st\u00e1tutes is \u201cto promote the satisfaction of civil liabilities arising from automobile accidents. . . .\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 424, 430 [91 S.Ct. 1535, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>1539, 29 L.Ed.2d 9]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>supra, 11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1625 &amp; 1628, fn. 10.) In those cases where it is not apparent that a person was driving, section 20003 would fail to serve the purpose of the statutory scheme if it did not impose a requirement that the person at the scene disclose that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Second, Kroncke contends <em>Monismith </em>\u201chas no precedential value\u201d because that court stated it found no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions \u201cunder the facts peculiar to this case.\u201d <em>(Monismith, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 767.) Obviously, the fact the <em>Monismith </em>court was considering particular facts does not deprive the court\u2019s statutory interpretation of precedential value. Moreover, as we have already explained, the facts here are closely analogous to those in <em>Monismith </em>and, if anything, present a more compelling case in favor of the People\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Third, Kroncke contends <em>Monismith </em>is distinguishable because in <em>Mo-nismith </em>the vehicle struck a pedestrian, while in the present case Jacobsen jumped from the vehicle. Although Kroncke does not make the argument in so many words, he effectively contends that Jacobsen\u2019s decision to jump from Kroncke\u2019s vehicle did not constitute a reportable \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of sections 20001 and 20003. We disagree. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 283 [215 P.2d 127], the court applied section 20001\u2019s predecessor statute to a case in which a person fell out of a car as it was making a turn. The court concluded this constituted an accident within the meaning of the statute. (96 Cal.App.3d at pp. 286-289.) The court stated: \u201cAs defined in Webster\u2019s Dictionary, an accident is an event that takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 288.) Certainly, from Kroncke\u2019s perspective, Jacob-sen\u2019s decision to leave the vehicle as he was traveling down the freeway was an event that took place without Kroncke\u2019s foresight or expectation.

He merely is required to identify himself as the driver of a vehicle which was at or near the scene of the accident when it occurred.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 635.) However, as Kroncke himself notes, the Supreme Court later disapproved this interpretation of section 20001 in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1039, 1045 [80 Cal.Rptr. 553, 458 P.2d 465], There, the Supreme Court criticized <em>People </em>v. <em>Bammes, supra, </em>265 Cal.App.2d 626, and found that <em>\u201cBammes </em>inaccurately characterized the \u2018hit-and-run\u2019 statute involved in that case (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20001), a statute similar in all relevant particulars to the statute involved in the present case .... First, although it is true that neither section 20001 nor section 20002 explicitly requires drivers involved in accidents to identify themselves <em>as </em>involved drivers, neither can fairly be read to require only that an involved driver identify himself as merely having been \u2018at or near the scene of the accident when it occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 1045, italics in original.) Thus it is <em>Bammes, </em>and not <em>Monismith, </em>that lacks precedential value on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Finally, Kroncke contends <em>Monismith </em>is undermined by <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1039, and <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424, both of which concern whether California\u2019s accident reporting statutes violate a driver\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We discuss those cases in detail below, but note for now that neither case overrules or undermines <em>Monismith'' </em>s statutory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">B. <em>The Statutory Requirement Does Not Violate a Person\u2019s Constitutional Right Against Self-incrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Kroncke next contends that if we interpret sections 20001 and 20003 to mean a person must disclose that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident, then those sections would violate the person\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Both our own Supreme Court <em>(Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1039) and the United States Supreme Court <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424) have already addressed the constitutional validity of California\u2019s compulsory accident reporting statutes vis-a-vis the Fifth Amendment.  In <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, </em>our Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of section 20002, subdivision (a), which required (and still requires) a driver involved in an accident causing property damage to stop and identify himself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (71 Cal.2d at pp. 1041-1042.) The California Supreme Court concluded the required disclosures did in fact compromise a driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1047.) The court nevertheless upheld the statute on the ground \u201cthat the state may require a person to disclose information otherwise subject to a claim of privilege if in place of the protection conferred by the privilege there is substituted another protection, having the same scope and effect as the privilege, namely, immunity from use of the information or its fruits in connection with a criminal prosecution against the person.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at p. 1049.) In short, the court concluded that although the required disclosures might indeed violate the driver\u2019s right against self-incrimination, the state could nevertheless compel the disclosures provided the courts granted the driver use immunity with respect to the disclosed information. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1049-1050 [\u201c[I]f the disclosures compelled by section 20002 . . . and the fruits of such disclosures may not be used in a criminal prosecution relating to the accident, the requirements of the privilege against self-incrimination are met.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court. </em>(402 U.S. at p. 434 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1541].) In <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424, a four-judge plurality of the United States Supreme Court disagreed with the California Supreme Court and concluded that section 20002, subdivision (a)(l)\u2019s<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> disclosure requirements do <em>not </em>implicate the right against self-incrimination. The plurality determined that, unlike registration schemes aimed at identifying criminal behavior, the statute in question was essentially regulatory, its purpose being \u201cto promote the satisfaction of civil liabilities arising from automobile accidents.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 430 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539].) Contrary to the kind of disclosure statutes that the court had found self-incriminating, section 20002 was not directed at a \u201c \u2018highly selective group\u2019 \u201d or one \u201c \u2018inherently suspect of criminal activities,\u2019 \u201d but was instead \u201c \u2018directed at the public at large.\u2019 \u201d (402 U.S. at p. 430 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539].) In sum, the high court found \u201cdisclosures with respect to automobile accidents simply do not entail the kind of substantial risk of self-incrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>involved in [other cases]\u201d and \u201cthe statutory purpose is noncriminal and self-reporting is indispensable to its fulfillment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539]; see also <em>Craib </em>v. <em>Bulmash </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 475, 488-489 [261 Cal.Rptr. 686, <em>777 </em>P.2d 1120]; <em>Fahlgren </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 930, 937-938 [231 Cal.Rptr. 229].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Justice Harlan, in his concurring opinion, urged there was a \u201creal\" and not an \u201cimaginary\u201d risk of self-incrimination in complying with the statute. However, he determined that the \u201cpresence of a \u2018real\u2019 and not \u2018imaginary\u2019 risk of self-incrimination is not a sufficient predicate for extending the privilege against self-incrimination to regulatory schemes of the character involved in this case.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 439 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1543] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) He reasoned that California had a vital interest in the individual financial responsibility of those who own and operate vehicles; that \u201ccompelled self-reporting is a necessary part of an effective scheme of assuring personal financial responsibility for automobile accidents\"; and that to extend the privilege against self-incrimination to the \u201ccompelled self-reporting . . . regulatory scheme\u201d will impair the state\u2019s capacity to pursue simultaneously the objectives of ensuring financial responsibility for accidents and criminal sanctions to deter dangerous driving. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 448 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1548] (cone, opn. of Harlan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\"><em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424, supports the conclusion that California\u2019s accident reporting statutes \u2014 including sections 20001 and 20003 \u2014 do not violate a driver\u2019s right against self-incrimination. However, Kroncke contends the plurality based their conclusion on the premise that the statute they were examining required disclosure of <em>only </em>the driver\u2019s name and identifying information, and did not compel the driver to disclose he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in an accident. Consequently, Kroncke contends that if we construe section 20003 as requiring the driver to disclose that he was a driver involved in the accident, then the statute would violate the driver\u2019s right against self-incrimination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">It is true, as Kroncke points out, that the second section of the plurality opinion (and Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent) suggests the plurality viewed the statute at issue as requiring the driver to disclose <em>only </em>his name and identifying information. (See, e.g., 402 U.S. at pp. 432, 433-434, &amp; 468 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1539-1541, &amp; 1557-1558] (dis. opn. of Brennan, J.).) Nevertheless, the central reasoning of the plurality was that there was no Fifth Amendment violation because \u201cdisclosures with respect to automobile accidents simply do not entail the kind of substantial risk of self-incrimination involved in [other cases]\u201d and \u201c. . . the statutory purpose is noncriminal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>self-reporting is indispensable to its fulfillment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539]; see also <em>Craib </em>v. <em>Bulmash, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 488-489; <em>Fahlgren </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at pp. 937-938.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">After reaching these conclusions, the plurality went on to express an alternative and separate rationale for the result it reached. In the second section of the plurality\u2019s opinion, the court stated: <em>\u201cEven if we were to view the statutory reporting requirement as incriminating in the traditional sense, </em>in our view it would be the \u2018extravagant\u2019 extension of the privilege Justice Holmes warned against to hold that it is testimonial in the Fifth Amendment sense.\u201d (402 U.S. at p. 431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539], italics added.) It was in this portion of the opinion that the plurality suggested that the act of stopping and leaving identifying information was a \u201cneutral act\u201d not warranting application of the privilege against self-incrimination. The rationale of the first section of the opinion is not undermined in anyway by this second section. One cannot ignore the implication of such conduct and disclosure by a driver, however. By leaving his name and address, the person depositing the information implicitly discloses he <em>was </em>the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident, the one who caused the damage. By describing this disclosure as a \u201cneutral act,\u201d the court was merely saying that compulsory self-identification of a driver in an accident does not warrant protection under traditional Fifth Amendment jurisprudence. This is because such compulsory disclosure, while it may reveal that the person was a driver involved in an accident, identifies, but does not necessarily implicate anyone in criminal conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court quickly pointed out: \u201cWhatever the collateral consequences of disclosing [a] name and address, the statutory purpose is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>implement the state police power to regulate use of motor vehicles.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 432 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1540].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Harlan expressed concern that the privilege might impair the state\u2019s interest in ensuring financial responsibility and deterring dangerous driving through criminal sanctions. He explained that the cases in which the Supreme Court found that disclosure requirements had violated the privilege against self-incrimination all involved registration laws that focused almost exclusively on criminal conduct. \u201cIn contrast,\u201d he observed, \u201cthe \u2018hit and run\u2019 statute [in <em>Byers] </em>predicates the duty to report on the occurrence of an event which cannot, without simply distorting the normal connotations of language, be characterized as \u2018inherently suspect\u2019 .... And, having initially specified the regulated event\u2014 i.e., an automobile accident involving property damage \u2014 in the broadest terms possible consistent with the regulatory scheme\u2019s concededly noncriminal purpose, the State has confined the portion of the scheme now before us ... to the minimal level of disclosure . . . .\u201d (402 U.S. at p. 456 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1552] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.); see also <em>Craib </em>v. <em>Bulmash, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 488-489 .)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Justice Harlan went on to reason: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s decision to compel Byers to stop after his accident and identify himself will not relieve the State of the duty to determine, entirely by virtue of its own investigation after the coerced stop, whether or not any aspect of Byer\u2019s behavior was criminal. Nor will it relieve the State of the duty to determine whether the <em>accident which Byers was forced to admit involvement in </em>was proximately related to the aspect of his driving behavior thought to be criminal. In short, Byers <em>having once focused attention on himself as an accident participant, </em>the State must still bear the burden of making the main evidentiary case against Byers as a violator of [a criminal statute]. To characterize this burden as a merely ritualistic confirmation of the \u2018conviction\u2019 secured through compliance with the reporting requirement in issue would be a gross distortion of reality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>\u25a0 \u2022 \u25a0 \u2022 ffl] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 RD Considering the noncriminal governmental purpose in securing the information, the necessity for self-reporting as a means of securing the information, and the nature of the disclosures involved, I cannot say that the purposes of the Fifth Amendment warrant imposition of a use restriction as a condition on the enforcement of this statute.\u201d (402 U.S. at pp. 457-458 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1552-1553], italics added, fns. omitted (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) Kroncke\u2019s name could easily be substituted for Byers\u2019s; Justice Harlan\u2019s reasoning applies with equal force and the same conclusion should obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Thus, we find no Fifth Amendment violation under either the plurality or concurring opinions in <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">The dissent\u2019s conclusion that it violates the Fifth amendment to require a driver involved in an accident to identify himself as such, is based on the dissent\u2019s very different perspective on the issue before us. We believe that in light of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s underlying purpose, in an increasingly complex society, the ability to invoke the privilege may be reduced when invocation would interfere with the effective operation of a generally applicable statute aimed at regulating civil responsibility. It is the context in which the disclosure is required and the underlying purpose of the disclosure that is most important and determines the analytical framework. We derive this framework from reading <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424, and <em>Baltimore Dept. of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Bouknight </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 549 [110 S.Ct. 900, 107 L.Ed.2d 992] and the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of its own precedent that each of those cases contains. The dissent believes it is the substance of the disclosure that controls the Fifth Amendment analysis. As we have indicated, however, the central teaching of <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>is that \u201cdisclosures with respect to automobile accidents simply do not entail the kind of substantial risk of self-incrimination involved in [other cases]\u201d and \u201cthe statutory purpose [of the hit-and-run statutes] is noncriminal and self-reporting is indispensable to its fulfillment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539]; see also <em>Craib </em>v. <em>Bulmash, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 488-489; <em>Fahlgren </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at pp. 937-938.)  Thus in cases which involve the \u201c[t]ension between the State\u2019s demand for disclosures and the protection of the right against self-incrimination,\u201d we must balance the public need against the individual claim to constitutional protection in deciding whether the privilege applies. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 427 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1537].) Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, the \u201ctestimonial\u201d character of the disclosure is not dis-positive. As the United States Supreme Court has more recently observed: \u201cThe possibility that [a law] will compel testimonial assertions that may prove incriminating does not, in all contexts, justify invoking the privilege to resist production.\u201d <em>(Baltimore Dept. of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Bouknight, supra, </em>493 U.S. 549, 555 [110 S.Ct. 900, 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>The dissent discounts the relevance of <em>Bouknight, </em>by claiming the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis was based on the fact that Ms. Bouknight, who was ordered to produce a child over whom she had custody, had accepted child custody under conditions to which she had agreed. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1572-1573.) Although this is factually true, the important legal point in <em>Bouknight </em>was similar to that in <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424. As the <em>Bouknight </em>court put it, \u201cBouknight may not invoke the privilege to resist the production order because she has assumed custodial duties related to production <em>and because production is required as part of a noncriminal regulatory regime, </em>[f] The Court has on several occasions recognized that the Fifth Amendment privilege may not be invoked to resist compliance with a regulatory regime constructed to effect the State\u2019s public purposes unrelated to the enforcement of its criminal law.\u201d (493 U.S. at pp. 555-556 [110 S.Ct. at p. 905], italics added.) In fact, the <em>Bouknight </em>court specifically cited <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>as \u201cconfirming] that the ability to invoke the privilege may be greatly diminished when invocation would interfere with the effective operation of a generally applicable, civil regulatory requirement.\u201d (493 U.S. at pp. 557-558 [110 S.Ct. at p. 906].) The <em>Bouknight </em>court noted that the <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>plurality focused on the insubstantial risk of incrimination and the noncriminal nature and broad applicability of the California statute, while the concurrence, although acknowledging that \u201cin particular cases the California statute would compel incriminating testimony,\u201d nevertheless concluded that the noncriminal purpose and the general applicability of the reporting requirement demanded compliance even in such cases. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">The dissent also observes the <em>Bouknight </em>court went on to note that the \u201ctestimonial aspects\u201d involved in producing the child might require a limitation on the use of those testimonial aspects in a subsequent criminal proceeding. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1572.) More precisely, after holding that Ms. Bouknight could not invoke the privilege to resist the production order, the <em>Bouknight </em>court stated: \u201cWe are not called upon to define the precise limitations that may exist upon the State\u2019s ability to use the testimonial aspects of Bouknight\u2019s act of production in subsequent criminal proceedings. But we note that imposition of such limitations is not foreclosed.\u201d (493 U.S. at p. 561 [110 S.Ct. at p. 908].) Similarly, in this case, we are not called upon to define the precise limitations on the state\u2019s ability to <em>use </em>the \u201ctestimonial\u201d aspect of the required disclosures. We hold only that a person may not rely on the Fifth Amendment privilege to resist making the disclosure in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">In contrast to our analysis, the dissent concludes that the central issue is whether the disclosures the statute requires are \u201ctestimonial in nature.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1561-1564.) Even if we were to agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>this is the central issue in this case, we believe the dissent has drawn an erroneous distinction between the disclosures the Supreme Court found proper in <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>and the disclosure the dissent claims is improper here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Section 20003 requires a driver involved in an accident to disclose \u201chis or her name, current residence address, ... the registration number of the vehicle he or she is driving, and the name and current residence address of the owner to . . . any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident.\u201d We believe the dissent would agree that these explicit disclosures are permitted under <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, the dissent attempts to draw a distinction between these disclosures, which it considers nontestimonial in nature, and the driver\u2019s disclosure that he was driving a vehicle involved in an accident, which it considers testimonial in nature. The distinction does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">As the dissent notes, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018[I]n order to be testimonial, an accused\u2019s communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1562, quoting <em>Doe v. United States </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 201, 210 [108 S.Ct. 2341, 2347-2348, 101 L.Ed.2d 184].) In the dissent\u2019s own words, \u201ca testimonial communication is one in which a person reveals knowledge or information from his own mind. Conversely, if all that is required is the production of \u2018real or physical evidence\u2019 or noncommunicative conduct the privilege is not violated.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">In our view, when a driver at the site of an accident gives his name, current residence address, registration number, and the name and current residence address of the vehicle\u2019s owner, he reveals or discloses <em>information </em>\u2014 as opposed to \u201creal or physical evidence\u201d \u2014 that may not otherwise be available to the prosecuting authorities. We fail to see how disclosing such identifying information is any less \u201ctestimonial\u201d than disclosing that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident. Moreover, the required disclosure of this identifying information also carries risks of self-incrimination \u2014 it could reveal, for example, that the driver was unlicensed, had outstanding warrants, or was\" driving a stolen car. While any of this information could provide a link leading to criminal prosecution, the United States Supreme Court has concluded the Fifth Amendment does not make statutes requiring disclosure of identifying information in this context unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>In short, it appears the United States Supreme Court approaches the analysis first by looking at the nature of the statute requiring the disclosure. If the statute aims to regulate conduct in which the state has a legitimate interest, compliance serves to achieve important state goals of a noncriminal nature, and the disclosures do not entail a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of self-incrimination, then the court will not permit the Fifth Amendment privilege to block the regulatory scheme. Only when the law in question would primarily advance the state\u2019s penal interests, or create a substantial risk of self-incrimination, does the Supreme Court appear willing to extend Fifth Amendment protection. (See <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>230 S.E.2d at p. 259; <em>People </em>v. <em>Samuel, supra, </em>327 N.Y.S.2d 321, 325, 328.) Thus the court has upheld an order requiring a mother to produce or disclose the location of an abused child over whom she had custody <em>(Baltimore Dept. of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Bouknight, supra, </em>493 U.S. 549), and a statute requiring a businessman to produce records he has maintained to show compliance with the Emergency Price and Control Act <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948) 335 U.S. 1, 17-18, 32 [68 S.Ct. 1375, 1384-1385, 92 L.Ed. 1787]). In each of these cases, the parties were required to disclose knowledge and information otherwise unknown to the government; nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court denied their claims of Fifth Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">Sections 20001, 20002, 20003, and 20004 all impose obligations on those who are privileged to drive in California. The Legislature requires drivers to self-report the fact of an accident and identify themselves and the owner of the vehicle involved. The state grants a substantial privilege when it licenses drivers to use California roadways. The exercise of that privilege includes the potential of placing others at significant risk, and may lead to injury and death as happened here. The statutes require the driver/owner to provide identifying information regarding both himself and the vehicle so that those who have been damaged or injured can collect from those who are at fault. The legitimate aim of the statutes is civil remediation and regulation of drivers who use the roadways in California. A driver in most circumstances will comply without providing any incriminating \u201ctestimony\u201d against himself and is certainly free to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege after he has met the statutes\u2019 requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">Kroncke testified at trial that he provided the officers at the scene with his name, driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration. He also claimed to have identified himself, at least implicitly, as the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Like Kroncke, most citizens understand the reasonable and constitutional reporting requirements the Vehicle Code imposes. The dissent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>in its scholarly discussion of the Fifth Amendment, unnecessarily finds a conflict between a Constitutional right and a statutory responsibility reasonably imposed for civil purposes. The right at issue here, for a citizen to be free from being \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u201d (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) is not violated when a driver is compelled pursuant to section 20003 to identify himself as the driver of an automobile involved in an accident. The state still bears the responsibility of independently proving the driver\u2019s conduct was criminal. The Fifth Amendment was never intended to be a refuge for those facing civil liability. It was not intended to force investigating agencies, or citizens, to invest time and energy puzzling out who was driving when injury accidents occur. Nor was it intended to permit drivers to engage in the obfuscation even Kroncke knew was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">In sum, we follow what we believe to be the law announced in <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>and conclude that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not relieve a California driver of his duty to comply with the reporting requirements of sections 20001 and 20003, including his duty to identify himself as the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">C., D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AcZ\">Walker, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">Subsequent statutory references are to the Vehicle Code, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">Officer Ramos testified and confirmed that Kroncke had detained an arson suspect on October 4, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1248-6\"><em>Monismith </em>involved an earlier version of section 20003 that read: \u201cThe driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person shall also give his name, address, the registration number of the vehicle he is driving, the name of the owner, and upon request and if available exhibit his driver\u2019s license to the person struck or the driver or occupants of any vehicle collided with or shall give such information and exhibit his license to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident. . . .\u201d With respect to the issue presented in this case, we see no substantive difference between the former and current versions of section 20003. <em>(Monismith, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 765.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">We agree with this commonsense statutory construction.

In <em>Banks, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a criminal statute which required, among other things, that a driver involved in an injury-producing accident \u201creport forthwith to the police authority.\u201d (230 S.E.2d at p. 257.) The <em>Banks </em>court specifically noted that the <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>court did not consider whether such a reporting requirement would violate the Fifth Amendment. Nevertheless, the <em>Banks </em>court held that \u201cwhen we balance the public interest, on the one hand, and the individual\u2019s constitutional claim, on the other, the additional requirement of police reporting does not tip the scales in favor of the accused.\u201d (230 S.E.2d at p. 259.) The <em>Banks </em>court reached this conclusion even though, in the case before it, complying with the statute would have necessarily disclosed grounds for a criminal prosecution.

Moreover, it is not a criminal offense under California law to be a driver \u2018involved in an accident.\u2019 An accident may be the fault of others; it may occur without any driver having been at fault. No empirical data are suggested in support of the conclusion that there is a relevant correlation between being a driver and criminal prosecution of drivers. So far as any available information instructs us, most accidents occur without creating criminal liability even if one or both of the drivers are guilty of negligence as a matter of tort law.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at pp. 430-431 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1539].)

The dissent believes he complied with the requirements of sections 20001 and 20003 and did not need to do more. We agree that a driver may invoke a privilege under the Fifth Amendment and refuse to discuss the circumstances or details of the accident if he so chooses. He may not, however, invoke the privilege to avoid identifying himself as the driver. Kroncke certainly waived any Fifth Amendment privilege when he voluntarily sought to \u201cset the story straight\" and disclosed to Detective Carroll on November 3 that he was the driver. Never has he claimed his earlier failure to say he was driving was based on a belief that what he said might be incriminatory. The Fifth Amendment does not license prevarication. Had Kroncke simply complied with the statute, and had he later been prosecuted for a crime in which the state sought to use his admission of driving, we would be presented with the issue of whether his admission could be used in the criminal case against him. We disagree with the dissent\u2019s view that the <em>use </em>of his disclosure is presented on these facts. It is not his admission of being the driver that is being used, it is his failure to do so.

This case involves a very narrow issue: the scope of a motorist\u2019s responsibility to stop and provide identifying information under Vehicle Code section 20003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Vehicle Code section 20003 as enacted by the Legislature essentially requires a motorist involved in an accident causing death or injury to do two things, 1) stop at the scene and 2) provide identifying information about himself, the car and the owner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority adds an additional requirement: the affirmative disclosure to a police officer that the motorist was involved in the accident. In amending the statute by judicial gloss, the majority ignores settled rules of statutory construction, violates the separation of powers and runs afoul of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">I. <em>Judicial Legislation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">The first difficulty is that the majority seeks to make criminal something . the Legislature has not. The duly enacted law makes it a crime to fail to stop and provide identifying information. The majority would declare it a crime to fail to <em>explicitly admit </em>involvement in an accident resulting in death or injury. The majority asserts the statutory language demonstrates that the Legislature intended to require this admission. I disagree. In referring to \u201ca driver involved in an accident\u201d the statute defines the class of drivers compelled to stop and provide identification. It does not, by its' plain language, compel the explicit admission of involvement. If the language is ambiguous, standard rules of construction require that a statute imposing penal consequences be narrowly construed. (See generally, 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Introduction to Crimes, \u00a7 28, pp. 37-38.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the government requires its citizens to do something under threat of penal consequence, its pronouncement must be clear. A citizen is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>not obligated to guess what conduct is required or suffer a criminal penalty if he divines wrongly. He is required to do what the law says, but no more. This concept is a venerable one. Over 100 years ago, Justice Bradley in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1886) 116 U.S. 616, 627 [6 S.Ct. 524, 530-531, 29 L.Ed. 746] quoted Lord Camden who wrote a century before <em>Boyd. </em>In <em>Entick </em>v. <em>Carrington and Three Other King\u2019s Messengers </em>(1765) 19 Howell\u2019s State Trials 1029, 1066, Lord Camden wrote: \u201cIf it is law, it will be found in our books; if it is not to be found there, it is not law.\u201d If the Legislature wants to clarify its requirement, it is certainly free to do so. We are not empowered to criminalize conduct by judicial ukase, or to punish that which the Legislature has not brought within its penal reach. To attempt to do so is a violation of the separation of powers provision of the California Constitution. (Art. HI, \u00a7 3; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lim </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 872 [118 P.2d 472]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Aggeler </em>(1941) 47 Cal.App.2d 848, 853 [119 P.2d 204].) Even if the Legislature had passed the legislation proposed by the majority, it would run afoul of the protections of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">It is the majority\u2019s expansion of the statute that creates the constitutional infirmity, as will be discussed below. The statute as written is sound. We should construe the statute narrowly to achieve its purpose. The aim of the statute is to promote the satisfaction of civil liabilities arising from automobile accidents. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1546-1547; <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 424, 430 [91 S.Ct. 1535, 1539, 29 L.Ed.2d 9] <em>(Byers).) </em>To achieve this purpose, the Legislature recognized that we live in an increasingly anonymous society. If motorists could leave the scene of an accident without identifying themselves, the satisfaction of civil liability would be made almost impossible. Thus, the law requires a motorist to stop and provide identification before receding into the nameless crowd. Armed with that identity, a civil litigant, or criminal investigator can conduct further investigation and seek appropriate legal redress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature enacted a statute designed to secure identity. The majority rewrites it to be a statute which facilitates the building of a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">The majority relies in part on <em>People </em>v. <em>Monismith </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 762 [81 Cal.Rptr. 879] <em>(Monismith), </em>the opinion of a two-judge panel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>case did reach the conclusion noted by the majority. However, the opinion is bereft of either apposite authority or compelling logic. The <em>Monismith </em>court accurately pointed out that the statute \u201cis designed to prevent the driver of a car involved in an accident from leaving the scene without furnishing information <em>as to his </em>identity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 766, italics added.) The court then vaulted to a conclusion it did not even attempt to logically defend: \u201cIt seems equally clear that the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident can furnish such identification only by identifying himself as the driver of the vehicle involved in the accident.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Such a conclusion is not clear at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">A driver can comply with the statute by stopping and providing the statutorily required data. Such conduct would fulfill the statutory goal of preventing drivers from leaving the scene unidentified. If, having stopped and given the facts enumerated by statute, the driver\u2019s involvement is evident, or later discovered, so be it. If not, \u201cour accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by . . . compelling it from his own mouth.\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 460 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 1620, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].) The <em>Monismith </em>court, in its brief opinion, did not address the issue of testimonial communication in any way. The <em>Monismith </em>court did not do so because it recognized the immunity articulated by the California Supreme Court in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1039 [80 Cal.Rptr. 553, 458 P.2d 465]. <em>(Monismith, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 767.) Only later did the United States Supreme Court decide <em>Byers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">The majority writes that <em>\u201cMonismith </em>has been the law of this state for nearly 30 years without drawing criticism from any published case.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1546.) In the 30 years since <em>Monismith </em>was decided it has also never been cited as authority for the majority\u2019s proposition. Indeed, it has been cited in a grand total of one published decision. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bautista </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1 [265 Cal.Rptr. 661], referred to <em>Monismith </em>in deciding whether a Vehicle Code section 20001 conviction was a crime of moral turpitude which could be used to impeach an accused burglar. It must be remembered that <em>Monismith </em>was decided when the law of California, recognizing the Fifth Amendment problem, extended use immunity to one who admitted he had been in an accident. The case has not been tested in the 30 years since its publication. Its vitality in the wake of <em>Byers </em>is suspect at best. <em>Monismith </em>is far too slender a reed to support the significant constitutional conclusion the majority seeks to build upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">II. <em>The Fifth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">It should be noted at the outset that this kind of case will arise but rarely. In the vast majority of instances, if a driver stops his car at the scene of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>death or injury-causing accident, it will be evident from the observable circumstances such as body damage, paint transfers and so on that the car was, indeed, involved in the accident. Other witnesses may have seen the accident; so involvement will be clear and the only outstanding question will be identity. Here we deal with the unusual case in which the involvement is not evident. In such a case, can the statute require a motorist to provide law enforcement with the majority\u2019s compelled admission? Resolution of the question turns on the extent of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against self incrimination. This inquiry, in turn, revolves around whether such a disclosure is testimonial in nature and whether it involves a substantial risk of self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">A. <em>Testimonial Communications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">The United States Supreme Court has addressed the testimonial question in a number of different contexts. Examination of this body of precedent reveals that the disclosure in question here is testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">In <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 1 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653], the court held the Fifth Amendment limitations on governmental action apply to the states under the authority of the Fourteenth Amendment. In doing so the court observed: \u201cGovernments, state and federal, are thus constitutionally compelled to establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured, and may not by coercion prove a charge against an accused out of his own mouth. Since the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States from inducing a person to confess through \u2018sympathy falsely aroused,\u2019 [citation], ... it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that it also forbids the States to resort to imprisonment, as here, to compel him to answer questions that might incriminate him.\u201d (378 U.S. at p. 8 [84 S.Ct. at p. 1493].) The court went on to observe: \u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment secures against state invasion the same privilege that the Fifth Amendment guarantees against federal infringement \u2014 the right of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty ... for such silence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">The Supreme Court examined the scope of the privilege two years later in <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 757 [86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908] (Schmerber). Following an accident, Schmerber had been arrested for drunk driving. Schmerber\u2019s blood was drawn, without his consent,' at the direction of a police officer. The blood sample revealed the presence of alcohol. Schmerber argued that compelling him to give a blood sample violated his Fifth Amendment privilege. In ruling to the contrary the court held: \u201c[T]he privilege protects an accused only from being compelled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature, . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 761 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1830].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\"><em>Doe </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1988) 487 U.S. 201 [108 S.Ct. 2341, 101 L.Ed.2d 184] turned squarely upon an interpretation of the meaning of the term \u201ctestimonial.\u201d Doe claimed the Fifth Amendment prevented the government from requiring that he sign a release authorizing foreign banks to turn over certain records. The court concluded that the signing of the release was not a \u201ctestimonial communication.\u201d Justice Blackmun explained: \u201c[I]n order to be testimonial, an accused\u2019s communication must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual assertion or disclose information.\u201d (487 U.S. at p. 210 [108 S.Ct. at p. 2347].) \u201cIt is the \u2018extortion of information from the accused,\u2019 [citation], the attempt to force him \u2018to disclose the contents of his own mind,\u2019 [citation], that implicates the Self-Incrimination Clause. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 211 [108 S.Ct. at p. 2348].) \u201cThese policies [upon which the privilege is founded] are served when the privilege is asserted to spare the accused from having to reveal, directly or indirectly, his <em>knowledge of facts relating him to the offense </em>or from having to share his thoughts and beliefs with the Government.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 213 [108 S.Ct. at p. 2349], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Numerous cases have concluded that a variety of behaviors and disclosures are nontestimonial in nature. Thus, individuals may be required to provide fingerprints <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bryant </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 215 [79 Cal.Rptr. 549]), give blood samples <em>(Schmerber, supra, </em>384 U.S. 757), stand in a lineup <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 218 [87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149]), produce handwriting exemplars <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 263 [87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178]), wear certain clothing <em>(Holt </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1910) 218 U.S. 245 [31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 751 [72 Cal.Rptr. 873, 446 P.2d 993]), and turn over records or other items <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 391 [96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39]). An analysis of this body of authority teaches that a testimonial communication is one in which a person reveals knowledge or information from his own mind. Conversely, if all that is required is the production of \u201creal or physical evidence\u201d or noncommuni-cative conduct, the privilege is not violated. \u201c[T]he protection of the privilege reaches an accused\u2019s communications, whatever form they might take, . . .\u201d <em>(Schmerber, supra, </em>at pp. 763-764 [86 S.Ct. at p. 1832].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">What the majority would require, under compulsion of fine or criminal confinement for failure, is the production of <em>testimonial </em>information, communicative information of the motorist\u2019s \u201cknowledge of facts relating him to the offense,\u201d of the \u201ccontents of his own mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>The majority takes issue with the conclusion that a compelled admission that a driver was involved in an accident causing death or injury is a testimonial communication. \u201cWe fail to see how disclosing such identifying information is any less \u2018testimonial\u2019 than disclosing that he was the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident. . . . While any of this information could provide a link leading to criminal prosecution, the United States Supreme Court has concluded the Fifth Amendment does not make [the] statute[]. . . unconstitutional.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1555.) The reality is th\u00e1t merely providing identification is fundamentally different from admitting involvement in an accident causing death or injury. In <em>Byers, </em>Justice Burger classified such identifying information as \u201cneutral.\u201d <em>(Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at pp. 431-432 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1539-1540].) The majority cites not a single case holding that providing identification is a testimonial communication or implicates the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">On the contrary, numerous cases have upheld the compulsion of identification, even by those in custody and upon specific questioning by law enforcement. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 914 [245 Cal.Rptr. 458] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 36 [223 Cal.Rptr. 475].) The question in determining whether a disclosure is testimonial is not, as the majority implies, whether the disclosure facilitates further investigation of a crime. Standing in a lineup or providing fingerprints obviously does so. The question, as the Supreme Court has explained, is whether the state has compelled an individual \u201cto disclose the contents of his own mind\u201d; to reveal \u201chis knowledge of facts relating him to the offense.\u201d Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more direct compulsion of one\u2019s \u201cknowledge of facts relating him to the offense\u201d than to compel him to reveal he killed or injured someone while driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">As the majority points out,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the act of stopping and providing identification carries with it some <em>implicit </em>meaning. Most conduct does. Of course, a motorist may stop and produce identification for reasons other than admitting culpability. He may stop as a witness. He may stop to aid the injured. He may stop out of curiosity. Even if one interpretation of such conduct supports an inference of involvement, it is not the only reasonable conclusion available. The majority would compel a motorist to remove all doubt by confessing involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">The majority quite rightly notes the Supreme Court\u2019s several references to balance. It is precisely at the point between nontestimonial conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>explicit admission that the court strikes the all-important balance. The majority\u2019s central error is that they place the scales in the wrong place. Rather than acknowledging the court\u2019s reliance on the long-standing concept of testimonial assertions, the majority sets the balance elsewhere, concluding that compulsion of an explicit admission is permissible if the motives are pure. No court has gone that far; nor should we.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">The majority accurately observes: \u201cBy describing this disclosure as a \u2018neutral act,\u2019 the <em>[Byers] </em>court was merely saying that compulsory self-identification of a driver in an accident does not warrant protection under traditional Fifth Amendment jurisprudence.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1551.) They go astray with their next sentence which contains the <em>majority\u2019s </em>rationale, not that of the Supreme Court: \u201cThis is because such a compulsory disclosure, while it may reveal that the person was a driver involved in an accident, identifies, but does not necessarily implicate anyone in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The majority\u2019s conclusion is an unsound extension of the <em>Byers </em>property damage scenario. A motorist legally compelled to admit he has just killed or injured someone directly implicates himself and runs a substantial risk of incrimination, bringing the Fifth Amendment into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">The majority attempts to avoid the conclusion that producing identification is not testimonial by noting that doing so \u201ccould provide a link leading to criminal prosecution.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1555.) As indicated earlier, a Fifth Amendment analysis often involves two issues: 1) whether the information is testimonial; and 2) whether its compulsory revelation presents a significant risk of incrimination. The \u201clink in the chain\u201d question relates to the risk of incrimination, not the testimonial nature of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">B. <em>Risk of Incrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">The Supreme Court has also visited the issue of whether a compelled disclosure presents a substantial risk of incrimination in a number of cases. One such case is <em>Marchetti </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 39 [88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889] <em>(Marchetti) </em>which dealt with statutes regulating taxation of wagers. Under the statutes, those who accept wagers were required to pay occupational taxes and to register with the local Internal Revenue director. Registrants were required to admit they were in the business of accepting wagers. The issue, as framed by Justice Harlan for the majority, was \u201cwhether the methods employed by Congress in the federal wagering tax statutes are, in this situation, consistent with the limitations created by the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 44 [88 S.Ct. at p. 700].) The court concluded the statutes did violate the Fifth Amendment. In doing so, Justice Harlan observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>gambling is a highly regulated enterprise and numerous statutes impose criminal penalties for its pursuit. He also noted that the information acquired by the statutes at issue would be readily available to prosecuting authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Justice Harlan explained the court\u2019s analysis in this manner: \u201cThe central standard for the privilege\u2019s application has been whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d <em>(Marchetti, supra, </em>390 U.S. at p. 53 [88 S.Ct. at p. 705]). \u201cIn these circumstances, it can scarcely be denied that the obligations to register and to pay the occupational tax created for petitioner \u2018real and appreciable,\u2019 and not merely \u2018imaginary and unsubstantial,\u2019 hazards of self-incrimination. [Citations.] Petitioner . . . was required, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide information which he might reasonably suppose would be available to prosecuting authorities, and which would surely prove a significant \u2018link in a chain\u2019 of evidence tending to establish his guilt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 48 [88 S.Ct. at pp. 702-703], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Application of the <em>Marchetti </em>principles shows the majority\u2019s requirement would suffer the same infirmity. The statute, by its language, does not apply to the public at large, or even to all drivers. Its obligations fall on only those drivers involved in accidents that result in death or injury. The conduct of drivers who cause serious accidents is addressed by numerous penal provisions which punish unsafe driving. The required admission created by the majority would be given directly to a law enforcement officer and readily available to prosecuting authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">An officer, called to the scene of an accident in which someone is killed or injured, obviously investigates a very serious circumstance. Any driver \u201cinvolved\u201d in such an accident is necessarily and reasonably suspected of potentially criminal conduct. A significant proportion of these accidents will involve one or more Vehicle Code violations: speeding (Veh. Code, \u00a7 22348 et seq.), driving under the influence (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152 et seq.), following too closely (Veh. Code, \u00a7 21703), changing lanes unsafely (Veh. Code, \u00a7 21658) or driving recklessly (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23103), to name but a few. If death results, vehicular manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (c)) might very well be charged, predicated upon a Vehicle Code violation. It is certainly true that a driver may drive perfectly and conform with every law and yet be blamelessly involved in a serious accident. What is important for our analysis is not that some conduct may be innocent, but rather, that much driving which causes death or injury will, indeed, be criminal. Further investigation is obviously needed to determine who, if anyone, is at fault. A driver so involved does not face a benign situation in which mere administrative details are at issue. Requiring a motorist to reveal his involvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>in the accident when it is not otherwise apparent, requires him to provide factual information to the government which may very well be used later to prosecute him. One compelled to admit that he just killed or injured someone while driving faces far more than a \u201ctrifling or imaginary\u201d risk of incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Based on long-standing United States Supreme Court jurisprudence the requirement imposed by the majority violates the Fifth Amendment. The admission they would compel is testimonial in nature. Its effect is that the person making such an admission runs a substantial risk of incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">\n<em>The Byers Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">The majority relies heavily upon the analysis of <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1039 and <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424. In <em>Byers </em>the United States Supreme Court reviewed the California Supreme Court\u2019s disposition in the same case. The celebrated Mr. Byers was in an auto accident and fled without providing the statutorily required identification. It was his failure to stop and produce identification that was at issue before both supreme courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Byers </em>is misplaced for three reasons. First, <em>Byers </em>did not resolve, or even address the judicially compelled admission that is at issue here. Second, the majority inaccurately apprehends the precedential value <em>Byers </em>does have. Third, they extend <em>Byers </em>beyond its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\"><em>Byers </em>addressed a very precise issue. \u201cThis case presents the narrow but important question of whether the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is infringed by California\u2019s so called \u2018hit and run\u2019 statute which requires the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident to <em>stop at the scene and give his name and </em>address.\u201d <em>(Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 425 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1536], italics added.) In answering the question Justice Burger, writing for the plurality, considered two factors: 1) what the statute required of a driver involved in an accident causing property damage; and 2) the degree to which those requirements presented a risk of incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">In applying <em>Byers </em>it is important to be clear on what it considered. The case dealt only with the two statutory requirements as legislatively enacted: the duty to stop at the scene of an accident and the duty to provide identifying information. The plurality did not expend a syllable discussing whether the statute required the additional admission urged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">It is also important to note that <em>Byers </em>dealt with a statute that applied to accidents involving property damage. It did not address a statute relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>accidents causing death or injury. Indeed, in a footnote to the plurality opinion, Justice Burger observes that in injury or death cases \u201c. . . there is a statutory use restriction [Vehicle Code sections 20012, 20013] for these compelled disclosures.\u201d <em>(Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 426, fn. 1 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1537].) The statutes Justice Berger cites do restrict admissibility of an officer\u2019s written reports. Because <em>Byers </em>was not a death or injury case the plurality did not pursue further whether a driver\u2019s oral statements would be admissible. (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Misner </em>(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 377 [285 P.2d 938].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">In part I of <em>Byers </em>the plurality considered the risk of incrimination as a factor implicating the protections of the Fifth Amendment. Justice Berger pointed out: \u201cWhenever the Court is confronted with the question of a compelled disclosure that has an incriminating potential, the judicial scrutiny is invariably a close one. Tension between the State\u2019s demand for disclosures and the protection of the right against self-incrimination is likely to give rise to serious questions. Inevitably these must be resolved in terms of balancing the public need on the one hand, and the individual claim to constitutional protections on the other; neither interest can be treated lightly.\u201d (402 U.S. at p. 427 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1537].) The plurality then concluded that merely stopping at the scene of an accident causing property damage and identifying oneself does not entail a sufficient risk of criminal inculpation to infringe upon by the Fifth Amendment. \u201cA name, linked with a motor vehicle, is no more incriminating than [a] tax return, linked with [a] disclosure of income [citation]. It identifies but does not by itself implicate anyone in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 433-434 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1540-1541].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">In the second part of <em>Byers </em>the plurality concluded that the statute\u2019s requirements did not violate the Fifth Amendment because the information required by the statute was not testimonial. Justice Berger explained the plurality\u2019s view: \u201cThe act of stopping is no more testimonial \u2014 indeed less so in some respects \u2014 than requiring a person in custody to stand or walk in a police lineup, to speak prescribed words, or to give samples of handwriting, fingerprints, or blood. [Citations.] Disclosure of name and address is an essentially neutral act.\u201d (402 U.S. at pp. 431-432 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1539-1540].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">The four-member plurality needed Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence to resolve the case. Justice Harlan did not agree with the plurality\u2019s conclusion in part I. In Justice Harlan\u2019s view even the limited requirements at issue, even in a property damage case, created a substantial risk of inculpation. He acknowledged the holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>388 U.S. 218, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>a person could be compelled to stand in a lineup. He distinguished <em>Wade, </em>however, by noting that in such a situation the compulsion operated after the state had independently focused on a defendant. <em>(Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at p. 436 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1541-1542] (cone. opn. of Harlan J.).) In Justice Harlan\u2019s view the <em>Byers </em>requirements, even without the gloss the majority would add here, impermissibly compelled a motorist to focus the investigation on himself. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Justice Harlan reviewed the extant Supreme Court jurisprudence and acknowledged that the cases hold the presence of a substantial risk of self-incrimination triggers Fifth Amendment protections. <em>(Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at pp. 437-439 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1542-1544] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) He went on to suggest a modification of that standard. Without the concurrence of any other justice, he took the position that the presence of a substantial incriminatory risk should not be a sufficient basis, standing alone, to support a Fifth Amendment invocation. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 453 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1550-1551] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) Instead, Justice Harlan proposed a balancing test which would take into account the purpose of the regulatory statute, the necessity for self-reporting to effectuate the regulatory purpose, and the nature of the disclosures compelled. Applying his test to the <em>Byers </em>facts, Justice Harlan concluded that the Fifth Amendment did not require use immunity to justify the compelled disclosures. Again, it is important to note that no other member of the court joined Justice Harlan in his suggestion that the court retreat from its previous rulings. The rule remains; a statute compelling an admission that creates an appreciable risk of self-incrimination violates the Fifth Amendment, regardless of the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">The Supreme Court was very clear on what \u201cnarrow question\u201d it was deciding. <em>Byers </em>stands for the proposition that a driver involved in an accident that causes property damage can be compelled to stop and provide identification to another driver. It did not address whether a driver could be compelled to make any disclosures to a law enforcement agent. It did not consider whether the rule would be different if death or injury were involved, rather than property damage. It decidedly did not contemplate the admission the majority imposes here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">The majority ignores the limited nature of the plurality\u2019s inquiry. They seek to expand the \u201ccentral reasoning\u201d of <em>Byers </em>beyond the circumscriptions both the plurality and concurrence carefully note. (See, maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1550). It is a fundamental rule of precedential analysis that a case decides that which it decides. Attempts to expand a case\u2019s precedential authority beyond its facts are dangerous expeditions, particularly in the absence of the explicit pronouncement of a broader rule. The expedition proves fatal when the court takes care to affirmatively limit its holding, as is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>There is an even more fundamental problem with the majority\u2019s attempt to rely on <em>Byers. </em>In arguing that \u201cthe central teaching of <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>is that [the disclosure statutes do not violate the Fifth Amendment because] \u2018disclosures with respect to automobile accidents simply do not entail the kind of substantial risk of self-incrimination involved in [other cases]\u2019 . . . .\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1553), the majority makes a crucial error. Justice Harlan, the necessary fifth vote, did not join in that conclusion. Only the four-justice plurality held that view, based on the narrow facts. Because the conclusion did not command a majority, it cannot be the \u201ccentral teaching\u201d of the case and cannot stand as precedent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If <em>Byers </em>teaches anything, it instructs that the majority\u2019s conclusion is legally unsound because it was rejected by five of the nine justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\"><em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424, explicitly dealt with the language of the statute. The plurality opinion is replete with references to \u201cthe statute.\u201d Likewise, Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence is limited in its scope. Justice Harlan discusses at length the need to balance legitimate governmental interests with the constitutional protections of the Fifth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 435-455 [91 S.Ct. at pp. 1541-1552] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) He concludes: \u201c[W]e must deal in degrees in this troublesome area.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 454 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1551] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) He notes that courts must \u201ctake cognizance of the level of detail required in the reporting program.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 456 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1552] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).) He ends by saying that considering, among other factors, \u201cthe nature of the disclosures involved,\u201d he cannot conclude the Fifth Amendment requires the use restriction articulated by the California Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 458 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1553] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">A fair reading of the plurality opinion and the Harlan concurrence reveals the justices were aware of the delicate balance they sought to strike. A more expansive reading is not justified by the text. The majority\u2019s conclusion that the Supreme Court would have upheld a statute such as the one the majority crafts is a prognostication in which I cannot join. Worse than being merely an unsupported assertion it is definitively inconsistent with the carefully drafted and limited opinions of the plurality and Justice Harlan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>The majority also seeks to separate part I of the <em>Byers </em>opinion, dealing with risk of incrimination, from part II, addressing the testimonial question. By this analytical device the majority seeks to avoid discussion of the concept of testimonial communications in Fifth Amendment jurisprudence. Part I of the plurality opinion does not discuss the concept in any way. This omission is not surprising because of the limited nature of the court\u2019s inquiry: whether a statute can compel a motorist to stop and provide identifying information. Because both requirements are nontestimonial part one of the opinion omits such a discussion. It is this very point that part II makes clear. A reading of the entire opinion is necessary to understand the extent, and limitation, of the high court\u2019s ruling. Further, as noted above, part one of the opinion cannot stand alone, because its reasoning did not command a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">The testimonial nature of the majority\u2019s compelled admission and the risk of incrimination it presents are the factors which place it at odds with the Fifth Amendment. The majority seeks to avoid this conclusion by defining the issue differently. They conclude \u201c[i]t is the context in which the disclosure is required and the underlying purpose of the disclosure\u201d that are determinative. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1553.) The Supreme Court, however, has held that the \u201cavailability of the privilege does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its protection is invoked, but upon the <em>nature </em>of the statement or admission and the <em>exposure </em>which it invites.\u201d <em>(In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 49 [87 S.Ct. 1428, 1455, 18 L.Ed.2d 527], italics added.) Indeed, as noted, the concurrence by Justice Harlan in <em>Byers </em>explicitly refers to the \u201cnature of the disclosures involved.\u201d (402 U.S. at p. 458 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1553] (cone. opn. of Harlan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">The majority interprets <em>Byers </em>to say that context and purpose are the primary focus of a Fifth Amendment analysis, rather than substance or effect. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1553.) Such a conclusion flows from a fundamental misreading of <em>Byers. </em>The <em>Byers </em>plurality directly considered whether the statutory requirements presented a risk of incrimination. That is, they first considered the <em>effect </em>of the disclosure. The plurality then analyzed whether a testimonial assertion was required. In doing so they evaluated the <em>substance </em>of the requirements. Because they decided that neither the effect nor the substance of the requirements implicated the Fifth Amendment, the <em>Byers </em>plurality was free to focus on context. Here, the majority tosses aside both substance and effect to claim that context and purpose are all. Not only do the majority put the cart before the horse, they disengage the cart and run the horse from the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>The <em>Byers </em>court dealt with a statute designed to ensure identification would be provided, as Justice Burger phrased it, \u201c[a] name, linked with a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>(Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at <em>pp. </em>433-434 [91 S.Ct. at p. 1540].) The majority\u2019s new statute changes the aim, from a statute designed to insure identification to one which facilitates an investigation. Under the majority\u2019s statute, we now achieve \u201ca name, linked with a motor vehicle, linked with a compelled admission of involvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">The majority defends their expansion of the statute by asserting: \u201cThe Fifth Amendment was never intended to be a refuge for those facing civil liability. It was not intended to force investigating agencies, or citizens, to invest time and energy puzzling out who was driving when injury accidents occur . . . .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1557.) What the majority fails to acknowledge is that those who kill or injure others while driving will frequently face both civil <em>and </em>criminal liability. The \u201cinvestigating agencies\u201d to which they refer are law enforcement agencies investigating crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">The logical conclusion of the majority\u2019s assertion is that the Fifth Amendment must yield when to honor it would be inconvenient. To make such a point is to simultaneously refute it. The Fifth Amendment does not exist to facilitate law enforcement, it exists to protect citizens from governmental demands that they incriminate themselves. The majority does not point to another state in America that imposes an obligation such as theirs on its citizens. California should not lead this expedition. It takes us away from the hearthstone of the Fifth Amendment and into uncharted territory where the fundamental relationship between the people and their government can be altered without legislation to suit the convenience of the sovereign. This is not the arrangement the framers of the Constitution had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">Appellant here has relied on <em>People </em>v. <em>Bammes </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 626 [71 Cal.Rptr. 415] <em>{Bammes) </em>for the proposition that admission of involvement is not required. The majority rejects <em>Bammes </em>by citing <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1039. The reliance on <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>is somewhat problematic in that its judgment was vacated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">As the majority notes, Justice Peters, in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>did observe: \u201cFirst, although it is true that neither section 20001 nor section 20002 explicitly requires drivers involved in accidents to identify themselves <em>as </em>involved drivers, neither can fairly be read to require only that an involved driver identify himself as merely having been \u2018at or near the scene of the accident when it occurred.\u2019 \u201d (71 Cal.2d. at p 1045, italics in original.) What the majority fails to point out is the very next sentence: \u201cEven if these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>statutes could be so read, it seems clear that <em>in almost all circumstances </em>it would be obvious to the person to whom the identification was made that the person supplying identification was a driver involved in the accident.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">Three things then, are apparent. First, <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>did <em>not </em>hold an explicit admission is required by the statute. It merely criticized <em>Bammes </em>for concluding that a driver could say something false, i.e., that he was merely at or near the scene, rather than the driver. Second, <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>assumed the usual circumstance in which involvement is \u201cobvious,\u201d rather than the unusual circumstance we deal with here, in which involvement is not apparent. Third, the majority cannot have it both ways. They cannot fairly cite <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>to support their interpretation of the statute without acknowledging that the case also concluded that their interpretation required the extension of immunity because it otherwise violated the Fifth Amendment. \u201cWe are satisfied that the privilege is applicable when a driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident is confronted with a statutory requirement to stop and divulge his identity and reasonably believes that compliance with the statute will result in self-incrimination.\u201d (71 Cal.2d at p. 1047.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">The majority\u2019s further reliance on <em>Baltimore Dept. of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Bouknight </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 549 [110 S.Ct. 900, 107 L.Ed.2d 992], is also unavailing. In <em>Bouknight, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor concluded that a mother could not resist a court order to turn her young son over to child welfare authorities by relying on the Fifth Amendment. The analysis was based, however, on the fact that Ms. Bouknight had accepted a return of the child to her custody subject to a number of conditions to which she had agreed after the court had lawfully extended jurisdiction over the youngster. By resuming custody under conditions, she agreed to relinquish custody if the conditions were not met. She could not assert the privilege to avoid an agreement she had made. The <em>Bouknight </em>court went on to state that the \u201ctestimonial aspects\u201d that might be involved in Bouknight\u2019s production of the child, might well require a limitation on the use of those testimonial aspects in a subsequent criminal proceeding. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 561-562 [110 S.Ct. at pp. 908-909].) This is the kind of . limitation articulated by our Supreme Court in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1039 and which the majority agrees they might deem necessary were they writing on a clean slate. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">The majority asserts: \u201cSimilarly [to the court in Bouknight] we are not called upon to define the precise limitations on the state\u2019s ability to <em>use </em>the \u2018testimonial\u2019 aspect of the required disclosures.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1554). In fact the majority is called upon to address the use question. If their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>interpretation of the statute is to stand they must decide whether it violates the Fifth Amendment or requires the use immunity extended in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, </em>and suggested by <em>Bouknight. </em>The procedural posture of <em>Bouknight </em>allowed the court to defer this later consideration in a way that our case does not permit. All <em>Bouknight </em>resolved was that Ms. Bouknight had to release her son to authorities to protect his safety. If there was a future prosecution, the issue of immunity could be dealt with. Our case is different. Here, the majority seeks to punish the defendant for a completed course of conduct. There is no opportunity to extend immunity to him. He will be punished for not anticipating the majority\u2019s statutory amendment regardless of the incriminating risk. The extension of immunity to some future litigant will be of cold comfort to him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> My learned colleagues rely on what they conclude is the law announced in <em>Byers. </em>They simply read <em>Byers </em>too broadly and extend its holding to encompass matters which both the plurality and Justice Harlan clearly exclude from the sweep of their ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">We cannot lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with a constitutional protection. Even well-intentioned limitations on such an essential guarantee are to be closely scrutinized. As Justice Bradley observed in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>116 U.S. 616: \u201cIt may be that it is [a limitation] in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. . . . It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 635 [6 S.Ct. at p. 535].) This view was echoed by Justice Brand\u00e9is, dissenting in <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1928) 277 U.S. 438 [48 S.Ct. 564, 72 L.Ed. 944, 66 A.L.R. 376]: \u201cThe greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 479 [48 S.Ct. at p. 573] (dis. opn. of Brand\u00e9is, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">Likewise, Justice Harlan noted the same danger in his <em>Byers </em>concurrence. \u201cIf the technique of self-reporting as a means of achieving regulatory goals unrelated to deterrence of antisocial behavior through criminal sanctions is carried to an extreme, the \u2018accusatorial\u2019 system which the Fifth Amendment is supposed to secure can be reduced to mere ritual. And the risk that such a situation will materialize is not merely a function of the willingness of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>ill-disposed officialdom to exploit the protective screen of ostensible legislative purpose to bypass the procedural limitations on governmental collection of information in the criminal process. The sweep of modem governmental regulation \u2014 and the dynamic growth of techniques for gathering and using information culled from individuals by force of criminal sanctions\u2014 could of course be thought to present a significant threat to the values considered to underpin the Fifth Amendment, quite apart from any supposed illegitimate motives that might not be cognizable under ordinary canons of judicial review.\u201d (402 U.S. atpp. 453-454 [91 S.Ct. atpp. 1550-1551] (cone, opn. of Harlan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">By reaching out to impose an obligation not adopted by the Legislature, the majority commits three errors. First, they judicially legislate criminal conduct, which we are not empowered to do. Second, they judicially enact a statute which violates the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Third, they create a substantial anomaly in the law. Under the majority\u2019s statute, if a man drives recklessly and accidentally kills another, he must confess his involvement. If the same man brandishes a gun and recklessly kills another, he may remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">Commission of these errors is neither necessary nor constitutionally permissible. I would reverse the felony conviction. I would affirm the misdemeanor conviction and join in the majority\u2019s analysis of the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 15, 1999. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">Another provision, that the driver render aid to the injured, is not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">The majority mentions a number of cases in support of their expansive construction. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1546-1547.) Several of them are civil cases and are distinguishable on that basis. The two criminal cases which they cite do not support the conclusion they would draw. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Berry </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 778 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 416] the court interpreted a statute to exclude a defense claimed by Berry. It did not add a new criminal element, and does not stand for the proposition that courts may do so. The defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jimenez </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1611 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 268] intentionally rammed another car, inflicting substantial injury on a passenger in the rammed vehicle. Among other charges, he was accused of violating Vehicle Code section 20001 because he did not stop at the scene and identify himself. Jimenez urged that he was not required to do so because he intentionally rammed the other car. Thus, he argued, the event was not an \u201caccident\u201d falling within the statute. The <em>Jimenez </em>court rejected this novel claim, concluding the term \u201caccident\u201d encompassed defendant\u2019s behavior. Again, <em>Jimenez </em>did not add a new criminal element to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>statute. Indeed, the court quoted the settled rule for interpretation of criminal statutes: \u201cIf a penal statute is susceptible of more than one meaning, the statute must be construed in a defendant\u2019s favor unless such a construction would be unreasonable, absurd or contrary to the legislative intent underlying the statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jimenez, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 1626.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">Indeed, that is what happened here. Because they had his name and address, investigators later interviewed Kroncke, who ultimately admitted his involvement. It is true that Kroncke originally lied to investigators. That act was a crime for which he has properly been convicted. The law can punish someone who lies during an investigation. What it cannot do is force him to incriminate himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1267-8\">\u201cOne cannot ignore the implication of such conduct and disclosure by a driver, however. By leaving his name and address, the person depositing the information implicitly discloses he <em>was </em>the driver of a vehicle involved in the accident, the one who caused the damage.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1551.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">The majority\u2019s reference to Justice Harlan\u2019s conclusion that a driver who complies with the statute as written admits involvement in the accident (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1552-1553), suffers from the same analytical flaw. No other justice, including those in the plurality accepted that conclusion. It was Justice Harlan\u2019s view alone, thus lacking precedential force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">The majority claims to \u201cfind further support\u201d for their conclusion in the opinions of two cases from Virginia and New York.

Their reliance is as misplaced as their reliance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number><em>Byers. </em>These foreign cases both involve drivers who did not stop or provide identification as statutorily required.
