Code, \u00a7 12020, subds. (a), (c)(24)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The information also alleged that, under California\u2019s \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)), appellant had one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>\u201cstrike\u201d prior felony conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a bifurcated trial, the jury found appellant guilty as charged and found true the allegations about the prior \u201cstrike.\u201d Appellant filed a motion for a new trial on the ground that defense counsel was ineffective for conceding that the objects in appellant\u2019s possession met the statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d After an evidentiary hearing was held with new counsel for appellant, the motion was denied. The trial court sentenced appellant to state prison for the midterm of two years (\u00a7 18), doubled pursuant to sections 667, subdivision (d), and 1170.12, subdivisions (b) and (c), for a total term of four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">On appeal, Aubrey contends that his trial counsel was ineffective, that the instructions were erroneous, and that presentence conduct credits should have been awarded. We affirm, but remand for calculation of presentence credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A. <em>Trial Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">On March 18, 1997, Ben Guidotti worked the night shift at Flying J, Inc., a gas station and convenience store. At approximately 2:00 a.m., appellant entered the store and asked Guidotti to call the police to arrest appellant. At first Guidotti declined, but he made the call when appellant attempted to steal a package of cigarettes. During the 30 to 45 minutes between the call and the arrival of the police, Guidotti observed appellant from all angles. At no time did Guidotti see a knife. Appellant appeared to be intoxicated, but not \u201cstumbling drunk.\u201d Guidotti noticed that James R. Bingham, a customer, had fallen to the floor of the store, and it appeared to Guidotti that appellant had caused the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">Police Sergeant James D. Manos was dispatched to the Flying J at approximately 2:05 a.m. on March 18, 1997, on the basis of a disturbing the peace call. No mention was made of a knife or other weapon. Throughout the evening, the police had received calls stating that appellant was acting aggressively and was in several fights.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Upon reaching a well-illuminated parking lot, Manos observed appellant confronting Bingham. Appellant\u2019s hands were in a \u201cfighting stance\u201d and he was intoxicated, but \u201cnot falling down drunk.\u201d No knife or other weapon was visible. Manos ordered appellant to \u201cknock it off\u2019 and \u201ccalm down.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>Initially, appellant acted aggressively toward the officer. Eventually, he reluctantly complied with the orders and was handcuffed without physical resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">As Manos started putting the handcuffs on appellant, Bingham said, \u201cWatch out. He\u2019s got some knives on him.\u201d After completing the handcuffing process, Manos lifted up appellant\u2019s sweatshirt and removed two knives from his person. The knives were in a single sheath which was attached to appellant\u2019s belt and placed inside appellant\u2019s pocket. Appellant\u2019s sweatshirt covered the handles of the knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">At trial, Manos described the knives as follows: \u201cA little bit scratched, not too bad. They\u2019re not rusted, not real sharp on the edges like for skinning or anything. Appear to be more for a stabbing instrument or throwing.\u201d According to Manos, the knives could be legally purchased and used to practice knife throwing.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">We have examined the knives and the sheath. The knives are flat, nine inches long, approximately one inch wide, and approximately one-eighth of an inch thick. They are all metallic and well balanced, with a \u201cblade\u201d that is symmetrically tapered to a point on one end. There is no separate \u201chandle\u201d as such, but the nonblade end of the knife has curved edges in which the thumb and index finger nest comfortably when the knife lies in the palm of the hand. The tapered \u201cblade\u201d is sharpened over a length of approximately three inches on both edges. Each knife has imprinted on one side a small emblem in the shape of a knife with the words \u201cOn Target\u201d and a small target symbol within the outline of the emblem. The knives fit neatly into a nine-and-a-half-inch sheath, which has a two-and-a-half-inch slot through which a belt could easily pass. The sheath appears to have been designed with slots to hold three knives of the size and shape of those that were in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The centerpiece of the defense was that the knives were not \u201cpurposely concealed.\u201d Bingham testified for the defense that he saw the handle and the top part of the blade of a knife on appellant\u2019s person when Manos handcuffed appellant, and that the knife was either in a sheath or attached to appellant\u2019s belt. Also, defense counsel arranged for the jury to view appellant wearing the sweatshirt and moving his arms and body.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">B. <em>Closing Argument and Jury Instructions. .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">During closing argument, Deputy Public Defender James Steinberg laid out the defense theory of the case as follows: \u201cThere are two substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>issues which you need to deal with in this case: One is the issue of concealment, and the other is the issue of purpose or purposefulness, [f] Now, I think it would be difficult and unpersuasive to suggest that these ugly things couldn\u2019t stab somebody. ... Of course, they\u2019re something that could stab somebody and inflict great bodily injury. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they were designed for. Sergeant Manos described them as throwing knives. I guess that\u2019s what people buy them for. I know that some of you are sensitive to the verbal nature of a \u2014 of a weapon of a type like that, which you don\u2019t really use it for hunting, you don\u2019t really use it for whittling, it\u2019s just for essentially a martial arts or something which could, in fact, be used aggressively. It has that potential. ftj] Sure, I don\u2019t expect any of you are going to look at that and say \u2018Oh, that\u2019s just a little something or other.\u2019 But the fact of the matter is that the character of the weapon, once you get over the fact that it is technipally a dirk or dagger, really doesn\u2019t make any difference. . . . ffl] . . . Okay. So what I am going to ask you to do is try not to be hung up on the fact that these aren\u2019t weapons that most people necessarily would ordinarily carry. The fact is they\u2019re legal. The fact is you can carry them. flO What we\u2019re dealing with here is the law, so I do want you to remember these weapons are legal, and overcome any bad feelings or revulsion you might have about the fact that these aren\u2019t the kinds of weapons you might have in your house, or the kind of weapons that you or your relatives might employ. That is absolutely irrelevant. It is irrelevant, because as long as it can be used for stabbing, it\u2019s considered to be a dirk or dagger.\u201d Defense counsel continued, \u201cNo matter how reprehensible his behavior was that night, no matter how ugly these knives are, if he doesn\u2019t purposefully conceal them, if you have a reasonable doubt as to that, he, by law, is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">At the request of defense counsel, the jury was instructed with CALJIC No. 4.45,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which describes the defense of \u201caccident\u201d; CALJIC No. 12.41,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which sets forth the elements of the offense of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger and provides the statutory definition of the latter terms; and a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>instruction<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stating that the prosecution has the burden of proof as to concealment and the other elements of the charged offense. Defense counsel did not request CALJIC No. 12.42,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> regarding \u201cintended use\u201d as determinative of the character of the concealed instrument as a \u201cweapon,\u201d or any comparable special instruction. On the issue of \u201ccriminal intent,\u201d the court apparently rejected the prosecutor\u2019s request for the definition of \u201cspecific intent\u201d set forth in CALJIC No. 3.31, and instead gave CALJIC No. 3.30, which defines the concept of \u201cgeneral intent.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">On June 3, 1997, appellant was found guilty of a violation of section 12020(a). After a further hearing on June 4, 1997, the jury found true the allegation that on or about May 18, 1987, appellant was convicted of a violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1), assault with a deadly weapon, with great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">C. <em>Motion for New Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">On July 9, 1997, the court appointed Conflict Counsel Glenn Brown to investigate a possible motion for new trial. On October 8, 1997, conflict counsel filed a motion for new trial, claiming that trial counsel had failed to present a potentially meritorious defense and that appellant was thus denied effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">At a hearing on appellant\u2019s new trial motion on October 31, 1997, Steinberg testified as follows: He had served as a public defender for 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>years. After reviewing the applicable statute, statutory history, case law, knives and all the other evidence, he made a tactical decision that no reasonable jury would decide the knives were not \u201cdirks\u201d or \u201cdaggers\u201d under the statute. The best defense was that they were not purposely concealed. Steinberg thought it would ruin the credibility of the defense to argue that the knives were not the type of stabbing weapons outlawed by. the current statute. He believed that the defense was best served by minimizing the amount of time the knives were viewed by the jury. Steinberg said appellant had never mentioned using the knives for target practice and did not supply any helpful information regarding his use of the knives or his activities on the day of the crimes. Steinberg believed that any sharp, fixed-blade knife met the statutory definition. In accordance with this tactical choice, and to stay away from the issue of appellant\u2019s intent because of \u201c[Evidence Code section] 1101-type concerns,\u201d Steinberg did not request CALJIC No. 12.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Knife salesman Louis E. Watt testified that the knives found in appellant\u2019s possession are throwing knives, which do not have sharp edges. Watt further testified that the knives were manufactured by a company called \u201cOn Target,\u201d bear an emblem of a throwing knife with a target on it, and are openly sold to members of the public for target practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Appellant testified that he told Steinberg the knives were purchased on the day before the arrest for target practice; that he used them earlier in the day for target practice with his brother-in-law; and that they were in his possession at the time of the arrest because he had not yet returned home. Appellant claimed that he had purchased three knives, along with a sheath to hold them, but that he lost one of the knives in the bushes at his sister\u2019s house. Appellant further testified that he bought the knives to try to learn how. to throw them, and never intended to use them for stabbing. On cross-examination, appellant was forced to admit that his 1987 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon was for \u201cstabbing somebody with a knife,\u201d and that the jury had rejected his claim of self-defense in connection with that incident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Both in his motion for new trial and during oral argument on that motion, Brown pointed out that Steinberg had conceded the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d issue at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>the preliminary hearing, even though Sergeant Manos said he had confiscated \u201ctwo silver what I would call throwing knives.\u201d Steinberg explained this concession, saying that under the case law, any knife qualifies as a dirk or dagger. Brown claimed the concession was improper at the preliminary hearing, but all the more so at trial given that the magistrate had refused to bind appellant over for trial on a charge under section 12024, for possession of a deadly weapon with intent to assault. In that regard, the magistrate had specifically stated: \u201cI did not find any intent to use this weapon to assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The trial court denied the motion for a new trial. It ruled that although \u201cunder the new statutory definition, the circumstances of possession may be relevant to the trier of fact in determining whether the statute has been violated[,] ... the Court does not believe that the objects possessed by [appellant], which were obviously knives, could reasonably be argued to fall outside the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">n. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">A. <em>Definition of \u201cDirk or Dagger\u201d Under 1995 Version of Section 12020(c)(24).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">As both of appellant\u2019s primary contentions involve interpretation of the 1995 amendment to the statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d found in section 12020(c)(24), we shall begin our discussion there. Section 12020(a) makes it illegal for any person to carry \u201cconcealed upon his or her person any dirk or dagger.\u201d The statute itself did not attempt to define the terms \u201cdirk\u201d or \u201cdagger\u201d until its amendment in 1993 and up to that time courts tended to apply a broad definition indicating, for example, that the terms are used interchangeably and may include any weapon fitted primarily for stabbing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mowatt </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 713, 717 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 722] <em>(Mowatt).)</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em> Whether an instrument found on the defendant\u2019s person is a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d has long been deemed to be an element of the offense defined by section 12020(a) (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettway </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1067, 1072 [285 Cal.Rptr. 147]) and, thus, a question of fact for the jury <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bain </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 839, 850-851 [97 Cal.Rptr. 684, 489 P.2d 564]; <em>In re Quintus W. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 640, 643 [175 Cal.Rptr. 30]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pruett </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 77, 84 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 750] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>[while a knife is not an inherently dangerous or deadly instrument as a matter of law, it may assume such characteristics, depending upon the manner in which it is used, and there arises a mixed question of law and fact which the jury must determine under proper instructions from the trial court]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">In 1993, the Legislature set forth the first statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger,\u201d one more restrictive than that developed in earlier case law: \u201c[A] \u2018dirk\u2019 or \u2018dagger\u2019 means a knife or other instrument with or without a handguard <em>that is primarily designed, constructed, or altered to be a stabbing instrument designed to inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d </em>(Former \u00a7 12020(c)(24), as enacted by Stats. 1993, ch. 357, \u00a7 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In 1995, this statutory definition was altered to read as follows: \u201cAs used in this section, a \u2018dirk\u2019 or \u2018dagger\u2019 means <em>a knife </em>or other instrument with or without a handguard <em>that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 12020(c)(24), as amended by Stats. 1995, ch. 128, \u00a7 2, italics added.) Appellant contends that this latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>version of the statute, applicable in the present case, must be interpreted to include an element of intent to use the instrument as a weapon, in order to not to be found to be unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">As the <em>Mowatt </em>court noted, section 12020(a) has long been held to proscribe possession of some instruments which are inherently dangerous and others which can be used as weapons despite their innocent purpose or design. (56 Cal.App.4th at p. 718.) \u201c \u2018In pure usage the dagger, always a weapon, should have a symmetrical tapering blade with two, three, or even four edges and a sharp point. It is primarily designed for thrusting or stabbing. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 719.) However, by enacting section 12020(a), the <em>Mowatt </em>court noted, the Legislature \u201c \u2018sought to outlaw the classic instruments of violence and their homemade equivalents; the Legislature sought likewise to outlaw possession of the sometimes-useful object when the attendant circumstances, including the time, place, destination of the possessor, the alteration of the object from standard form, and other relevant facts indicated that the possessor would use the object for a dangerous, not harmless, purpose. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mowatt, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 718, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 620-621 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100] <em>(Grubb).) </em>Despite this guidance from our Supreme Court, there was a split of authority about the relevance of the defendant\u2019s subjective intent in cases decided under the judicial definition of \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 401, 404-405 [169 Cal.Rptr. 354] [applying <em>Grubb </em>analysis to hold that jury could consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s subjective intent and surrounding circumstances to determine whether an icepick was a dirk or dagger]); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 13, 19-20 [86 Cal.Rptr. 383] [same with respect to butcher knife with an eight-inch blade, a point, and one cutting edge]; but cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrios </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 501, 504-506 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 666] [distinguishing <em>Grubb, </em>and holding that \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d refers to a stabbing instrument without regard to circumstances of use]; <em>Bills </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 855, 861-862 [150 Cal.Rptr. 582] [defendant\u2019s intent to use unaltered barber scissors as a weapon for his protection was immaterial, and could not convert such an instrument into a dirk or dagger].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">As further noted in <em>Mowatt, </em>the application of judicially derived definitions of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d was somewhat inconsistent, leading to the suggestion in appellate cases that the Legislature take on the task of providing such definition. <em>(Mowatt, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 717.) The 1993 version of section 12020(c)(24) was held in <em>Mowatt </em>to track the technical definition of a \u201cdirk or dagger,\u201d making illegal only those instruments <em>designed </em>as stabbing weapons and thus rendering the intended use or purpose of possession irrelevant. (56 Cal.App.4th at pp. 718-719.) However, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>subsequently reconsidered the question and substituted a much broader definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d in the 1995 statute. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 719.) The question now before us is the relevance of intended use, or purpose of possession, under this latest version.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Only a few cases have interpreted the 1995 version of section 12020(c)(24). <em>People </em>v. <em>Sisneros </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1454 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 782], held that a device which requires some degree of assembly does not meet the 1995 statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d because it is not \u201c \u2018capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1455.) Regarding intent, the court held: \u201cBecause of the facts before us, we will not get into the question of whether intent is ordinarily relevant under the 1995 amendment, with reference to other scenarios or other devices. We find intent irrelevant here.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1458, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\"><em>In re George W. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1208 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 868] involved the 1998 version of section 12020(c)(24),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and a folding knife found in defendant\u2019s pocket in a closed position with the blade retracted into the handle. <em>(In re George W., supra, </em>at pp. 1214-1215.) At trial, defense counsel argued that the juvenile\u2019s \u201cintended use of the knife was relevant to the determination whether it met the definition of \u2018dirk or dagger.\u2019 \u201d Although there was evidence the juvenile used the knife in his work, the juvenile court \u201cexamined the knife and expressed the opinion the knife was \u2018a deadly-looking knife just on its appearance to the average lay person.\u2019 The \u00a1juvenile] court concluded the knife was intended to stab someone [and] was a \u2018dirk or dagger\u2019 within the meaning of the law . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1211.) The Court of Appeal in <em>George W. </em>reversed, and held: \u201cNo reported decision has yet had occasion to apply [the 1998] definition to a given state of facts. Nevertheless, we believe its terms are to be literally applied and \u2018strictly construed.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1214, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Bain, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 850.) Therefore, since the \u201cfolding knife\" was found in a closed position, as a matter of law it was not a dirk or dagger. <em>(In re George W., supra, </em>at p. 1215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In dicta in <em>Mowatt, </em>the court stated: \u201cWe note the [1995] version of section 12020, subdivision (c)(24), which turns on whether a knife or other instrument \u2018is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon,\u2019 casts the issue of intent in a different light. A persuasive argument could be made that by shifting from the design of the weapon to its capability for dangerous use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>the Legislature opened the door for both the prosecution and the defense to introduce evidence of intended use when the implement at issue has innocent uses but may be considered dangerous under the circumstances of its possession. [Citations.] In <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>[(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153]], a prosecution for robbery while 1 \u201carmed with a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u201d \u2019 the court held that when \u2018the defendant employs an instrumentality which in the strict sense of the word does not constitute a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u2019 the jury must determine \u2018whether the perpetrator intended to use it as a weapon.\u2019 (71 Cal.2d at pp. 328-329.)\u201d <em>(Mowatt, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 721, fn. 7.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, the weapon in <em>Mowatt </em>was \u201can ordinary hunting knife.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 715.) Because it was \u201cprimarily designed for use as a cutting implement in various recreational activities, not as a stabbing weapon meant to inflict great bodily injury or death (though it [was] certainly capable of such use),\u201d the <em>Mowatt </em>court held that \u201cthe [1993] statutory definition simply does not include instruments primarily designed for lawful uses but subject to criminal misuse.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 720, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Most recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Oskins </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 126 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 383] <em>(Oskins), </em>which involved the 1995 statute, the trial court informed the jury that defendant\u2019s intent with regard to use of the object in question \u2014 a knife with a two-and-one-half-inch blade, which was sharpened on one side with serrations on the other \u2014 was irrelevant, and excluded available evidence that defendant intended to use the knife in his work as a mechanic. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 129-130.) The court of appeal in <em>Oskins </em>reversed, interpreting the 1995 statute as follows: \u201cIn a literal sense, section 12020, subdivisions (a) and (c)(24) could be construed as imposing liability on anyone who conceals, on his or her person a device that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon, whether or not the device is designed for another, innocent purpose, and possessed for that purpose. That reading would be so broad as to criminalize a large range of heretofore innocent conduct, acts that were never before regarded as criminal. The tailor who places a pair of scissors in his jacket and the carpenter who puts an awl in his pocket, each for the completely innocent purpose of using the instrument in his or her craft, would be felons. Unless the Legislature makes it clear that it intends so bizarre a result, we will not infer such a meaning.\u201d <em>(Oskins, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 138.) Furthermore, based on the foregoing interpretation, and a concession by the Attorney General that section 12020(a) is not a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>liability offense, the <em>Oskins </em>court concluded that the statute contains an implied mens rea of \u201cintent to use the instrument as a weapon\u201d which is an \u201celement of the offense to be proven by the People.\u201d (69 Cal.App.4th at p. 138, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 481.) More fully stated, the <em>Oskins </em>court held that the prosecution must prove the defendant \u201cknew that he or she possessed a device \u2018capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death\u2019 <em>and carried it for use as a </em>weapon.\u201d <em>(Oskins, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 139, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">After thus defining the essential elements of a violation of section 12020(a), the <em>Oskins </em>court turned to the issue of prejudice to the defendant from the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow evidence of innocent purpose and its failure to instruct on this \u201cmaterial element,\u201d and held: \u201cThe court\u2019s failure to have the jury determine appellant\u2019s mens rea was a violation of his right to due process under the California and federal constitutions. <em>[(People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 482.)] Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, or that it is improbable that appellant would not have suffered the same result if the error had not been made.\u201d <em>(Oskins, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">We find merit in much of the reasoning and holding of <em>Oskins.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That is, we agree that section 12020(a), and the 1995 version of section 12020(c)(24), must be interpreted to include an element of intent or purpose to use the concealed instrument as a stabbing weapon. To hold otherwise would render the statute overbroad as it would criminalize otherwise wholly innocent conduct. <em>(Oskins, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 138.) Like the <em>Oskins </em>court, we are concerned that the Legislature has enacted a statute that on its face, makes a felon out of \u201cthe tailor who places a pair of scissors in his jacket and the carpenter who puts an awl in his pocket\u201d <em>(Oskins, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 138), or the auto mechanic who absentmindedly slips a utility knife in his back pocket before going out to lunch <em>(id. </em>at pp. 129-130), but also out of the shopper who walks out of a kitchen-supply store with a recently purchased steak knife \u201cconcealed\u201d in his or her pocket, or the parent who wraps a sharp pointed knife in a paper towel and places it in his coat to carry into a PTA potluck dinner, or even \u2014 as appellant claims \u2014 the recreational user who tucks his \u201cthrowing knives\u201d into a pocket as he heads home after target practice or a game of mumblety-peg. Such instruments are undoubtedly <em>knives </em>\u201ccapable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death\u201d (\u00a7\u2022 12020(c)(24)), but we doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>Legislature meant to criminalize the conduct of those who would innocently carry such instruments upon their persons, even if \u201cconcealed\u201d (\u00a7 12020(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Nevertheless, as we will discuss, our assessment of the \u201cprejudice\u201d to appellant from the failure to have the jury determine appellant\u2019s mens rea is considerably different than that analyzed by the <em>Oskins </em>court. With this caveat, we turn to the specific claims raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">B. <em>Defense Counsel\u2019s Decision to Concede the \u201cDirk or Dagger\u201d Issue Was a Reasonable Tactic in the Circumstances of This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that his counsel provided ineffective representation by conceding that the knives fell within the statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d found in the 1995 version of section 12020(c) (24), and by failing to request CALJIC No. 12.42 regarding \u201cintended use\u201d as determinative of the character of the concealed instrument as a \u201cweapon.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">In order to establish ineffective assistance, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient when measured against the standard of a reasonably competent attorney, and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>(In re Sixto </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1247, 1257 [259 Cal.Rptr. 491, 774 P.2d 164].) A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">\u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. [Citation.] A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. . . . Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 689-690 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065-2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674].) \u201c[A] defendant, while entitled to reasonably competent representation, is not guaranteed a successful defense or even a letter-perfect defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallin </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 479, 484-485 [177 Cal.Rptr. 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Moreover, \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 690-691 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2066].) \u201cThe trial judge is the one best situated to determine the competency of defendant\u2019s trial counsel. Where, as here, defendant is represented by different counsel at the motion for a new trial and the issue is called to the trial court\u2019s attention, the trial judge\u2019s decision is especially entitled to great weight and we defer to his fact finding power. Absent a showing of clear and unmistakable abuse, we will not disturb his decision.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wallin, supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In the instant case, the trial court could and presumably did believe Steinberg when he testified that he had reviewed the statute, the statutory history, the case law, the knives and the other available evidence, and had made a tactical decision that no reasonable jury would decide the knives were not dirks or daggers under the applicable provision. As detailed above, section 12020(a) provides that carrying a concealed \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d is a criminal offense. The 1995 version of section 12020(c)(24), which covers the instant case, defined \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d as \u201ca knife or other instrument with or without a handguard that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d There is no dispute that the instruments found in the sheath attached to appellant\u2019s belt were \u201cknives.\u201d Given the shape and design of the knives, moreover, it was entirely reasonable for trial counsel to conclude it was extremely unlikely that a rational trier of fact would find the knives were not \u201ccapable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death.\u201d (\u00a7 12020(c)(24).) At a minimum, it was reasonable for defense counsel to conclude that minimizing the jury\u2019s viewing and handling of the \u201cthrowing knives\u201d \u2014 and consideration of the hazard posed thereby \u2014 was in the best interests of his client, and that conceding the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d issue, while focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the thin evidence of purposeful \u201cconcealment,\u201d was the best way to accomplish that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">It is, moreover, quite likely that the trial court disbelieved appellant\u2019s claim that he told Steinberg about his \u201cinnocent use\u201d of the knives on the afternoon preceding his arrest. The trial court also could and presumably did believe Steinberg when he said he made a tactical decision <em>not </em>to raise the issue of appellant\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d because he was concerned that would allow the prosecutor to present devastating evidence of the misconduct underlying appellant\u2019s prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, which involved what appellant admitted was a \u201cstabbing.\u201d (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 402 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kipp </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 349, 371 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>716, 956 P.2d 1169].) Thus, the record contains substantial evidence that the defense as conceived by Steinberg was based on: (1) a thorough evaluation of the applicable statute and relevant cases defining the term \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d; (2) an adequate investigation of the facts, and the absence of information about \u201cinnocent use\u201d; and (3) a reasonable professional judgment that it would be too risky to open the door to evidence of appellant\u2019s prior conviction by explicitly arguing and requesting instruction on a theory of \u201cinnocent use\u201d of the throwing knives.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, Defense Counsel Steinberg made a valid choice of tactics, his representation was not deficient in any material way, and appellant\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">C. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Failure to Give CALJIC No. 12.42 Was Not Reversible Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Appellant next contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury sua sponte with CALJIC No. 12.42 was prejudicial error. We reject this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">As we have previously noted, the 1995 statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d must be interpreted to include a \u201cmens rea\u201d element of intent to use a concealed instrument as a \u201cstabbing weapon.\u201d <em>(Oskins, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 139.) Furthermore, at the time of trial, CALJIC No. 12.42, if given, would have provided appropriate focus on such an element by instructing: \u201cIn determining if the instrument or object in this case was a weapon of the kind within the law as stated, you may consider the circumstances attending any possession of the instrument or object by the defendant, such as the time and place of its possession; the destination of the possessor; any alteration of the object from its standard form; and evidence, if any, indicating its intended use by the possessor for a dangerous rather than a harmless purpose.\u201d (CALJIC No. 12.42 (6th ed. 1996 bound vol.) p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>86.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is, moreover, well settled that the due process clause of the California and federal Constitutions includes the right to have the jury determine every material issue presented by the evidence, and requires the trial court \u2014 at least in the ordinary case \u2014 to instruct the jury upon every material element of an offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 480-482, 490-491; <em>Oskins, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at p. 139; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1311 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1].) Thus we find that there is generally a duty to instruct sua sponte on the mens rea element of intent to use a concealed instrument as a \u201cstabbing weapon\u201d under the 1995 statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">In this case, however, the trial court\u2019s failure to do so, though erroneous, was harmless.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the trial court ordinarily has a sua sponte duty to instruct upon every material element of an offense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 480), instructional error removing an element of the crime from the jury\u2019s consideration has been deemed harmless under both the state and federal due process guarantees where the defendant concedes or admits the element. <em>(People </em>v. Flood, supra, 18 Cal.4th at pp. 504-505, citing <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 73, 87 [103 S.Ct. 969, 977-978, 74 L.Ed.2d 823]; see also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1993) 508 U.S. 275, 281 [113 S.Ct. 2078, 2082-2083, 124 L.Ed.2d 182]; <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 263, 270 [109 S.Ct. 2419, 2423, 105 L.Ed.2d 218] (cone. opn. of Scalia, J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Richie </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1347, 1359-1360 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 200].) During his closing argument, appellant\u2019s trial counsel clearly conceded that the knives found upon appellant\u2019s person met the statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d This concession placed the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d element outside the scope of matters the trier of fact had to decide. In such a situation, we can be quite certain there is no possibility the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct affected the result. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">As we have noted, defense counsel\u2019s decision to defend appellant in this manner was a valid tactical choice, well within the range of reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>professional judgment. Moreover, although appellant had ultimate authority as to \u201cfundamental\u201d decisions about his case (see <em>Shephard </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 23, 29-30 [225 Cal.Rptr. 328]; <em>In re Horton </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 82, 94-95 [284 Cal.Rptr. 305, 813 P.2d 1335]), there is nothing in the record on appeal to indicate the decision to concede the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d issue was made without appellant\u2019s informed consent. Of course, appellant testified at the hearing on his motion for new trial that he told Steinberg he had purchased and used the knives for an innocent recreational purpose. Appellant further claimed he had identified witnesses \u2014 presumably his sister and brother-in-law \u2014 who could so testify. But even if appellant did tell Steinberg that his family members could vouch for him on the \u201cinnocent use\u201d issue, there is no showing that appellant timely objected (i.e., before the jury returned its verdict) to Steinberg\u2019s decision not to go down that dangerous path. Indeed, there is nothing in this record even to suggest any friction or conflict in the attorney-client relationship until a month after the jury made findings on the prior conviction allegations. There being no showing that Steinberg\u2019s decision to concede the \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d issue was not authorized, appellant is bound by his counsel\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The only remaining issue is whether the concession in this case was broad enough to include an admission on, or a decision not to contest, the issue of \u201cintent\u201d to use the knife as a weapon. We readily conclude it was. A defendant\u2019s subjective intent or purpose of possession has long been treated as an aspect of the definition of \u201cdirk or dagger,\u201d or as an implied limitation on the category of instruments encompassed by those terms. <em>(Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 620-621; <em>In re Robert L., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 404-405; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson, supra, 7 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 19-20; see also <em>In re Quintus W., supra, </em>120 Cal.App.3d at pp. 644-645.) It was clear from Steinberg\u2019s testimony at the hearing on the motion for new trial that he considered \u2014 but rejected \u2014 the notion of arguing that the \u201cthrowing knives\u201d were harmless sporting goods, possessed for innocent purposes. As we have noted, however, Steinberg believed this was a hopeless and dangerous argument given the \u201cugly\u201d appearance of the knives, the circumstances of possession, and appellant\u2019s history of using a knife in a stabbing in 1987. Thus, it is quite clear that Steinberg intended to concede both that the throwing knives fell within the statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger,\u201d and that there was no viable factual basis for claiming \u201cinnocent\u201d possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In sum then, appellant \u2014 through counsel \u2014 made a valid concession that the throwing knives found on his person fell within the 1995 statutory definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d and that any attempt to prove otherwise, or to contest the issue of intent to use the knives as a weapon would, at best, fall on deaf ears and, at worst, backfire with the jury and increase the likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>of conviction. In these circumstances, even though it removed an element of the crime from the jury\u2019s consideration, any error in the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct was plainly harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 504-505; <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>460 U.S. at p. 87 [103 S.Ct. at p. 977]; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra, </em>508 U.S. at p. 281 [113 S.Ct. at pp. 2082-2083]; <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 270 [109 S.Ct. at p. 2423] (cone. opn. of Scalia, J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Richie, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1359-1360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">D., E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">III.

When a person intentionally does that which the law declares to be a crime, he is acting with general criminal intent, even though he may not know that his act or conduct is unlawful.\u201d (Brackets omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">On the first day of trial, the prosecutor made a motion, apparently pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], seeking permission to use appellant\u2019s prior conviction for impeachment purposes should appellant decide to testify. At Steinberg\u2019s request, however, fhe court reserved ruling on the prosecutor\u2019s motion until after the close of the People\u2019s case. Before the prosecutor began his case-in-chief, however, Steinberg objected that the moral turpitude associated with the prior conviction was not clear, and that admitting it for impeachment would be more prejudicial than probative because appellant was \u201caccused of possessing knives, even though there is no evidence to show he was attempting to use the knives.\u201d After the prosecutor completed presentation of his case-in-chief, the trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The most common formulation of the case law definition was stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruiz </em>(1928) 88 Cal.App. 502 [263 P. 836], as follows: \u201cA dagger has been defined as any straight knife to be worn on the person which is capable of inflicting death except what is commonly known as a \u2018pocket-knife.\u2019 Dirk and dagger are used synonymously and consist of any straight stabbing weapon, as a dirk, stiletto, etc. (Century Diet.) They may consist of any weapon fitted primarily for stabbing.\u201d <em>(Ruiz, supra, </em>at p. 504; see also <em>Mowatt, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 717.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">A few cases decided before the 1993 implementation of a statutory definition observed that \u201cDepending on its characteristics, an instrument may be a dagger <em>as a matter of law </em>or it may be a dagger as a matter of fact for the trier to find.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pettway, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1070, italics added; <em>In re Quintus W., supra, </em>120 Cal.App.3d at pp. 644-645; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cabral </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 707, 711-712 [124 Cal.Rptr. 418] [pounded bedspring with a pointed tip fashioned by county jail inmate was held to be a dirk or dagger as a matter of law because it was designed and was in fact used to stab fellow inmate]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McClure </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d Supp. 31, 32-33 [160 Cal.Rptr. 83] [belt buckle knife was, as a matter of law, a dirk or dagger for purposes of section 12020 because its \u201conly practical use is for stabbing\u201d].) However valid that observation might be in a probation revocation case such as <em>Pettway, </em>or in a juvenile proceeding under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code as in <em>Quintus W., </em>it is problematic where, as here, the defendant has a constitutional right to have a jury determine, under proper instructions, each element of the offense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 470, 480-482 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 180, 957 P.2d 869].) We further note that, in each of the above cited cases, the courts\u2019 statements about the instrument being a dirk or dagger \u201cas a matter of law\u201d were either entirely gratuitous, or went well beyond what was necessary to decision of the issues presented. <em>(Pettway, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1069 [issue presented was whether there was substantial evidence to support trial court finding that a particular type of knife was a dirk or dagger]; <em>In re Quintus W., supra, </em>120 Cal.App.3d at pp. 644-645 [challenge to trial court finding of fact on issue whether steak knife carried by juvenile in his back pocket \u201cfor protection\u201d was a dirk or dagger under definition of those terms as developed in the case law]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cabral, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.3d at pp. 711-712, 719-720 [issue was whether defendants were prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on the definition of \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d where it was undisputed that flattened, sharpened piece of bedspring, with a handle made by wrapping a shoelace around the top three inches was, in fact, used to stab a fellow inmate]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McClure, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 32-33 [issue was whether municipal court abused its discretion in ruling after preliminary hearing that belt buckle knife, which had a fixed blade of two and a half to three inches in length and a handle doubling as the belt buckle, <em>was not, </em>as a matter of law, a dirk or dagger for purposes of section 12020].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\">In 1998, the Legislature amended section 12020(c)(24) by adding: \u201cA nonlocking folding knife, a folding knife that is not prohibited by Section 653k, or a pocketknife is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death <em>only if the blade of the knife is exposed and locked into position.\u201d </em>(See Stats. 1997, ch. 158, \u00a7 1, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">It is noteworthy that the opinion in <em>Mowatt, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 713, was filed on July 22, 1997, after the jury returned its verdicts on the current and prior offenses, and after conflict counsel was appointed to investigate the possibility of a new trial motion. The dicta found in footnote 7, at page 721 of <em>Mowatt </em>formed the centerpiece of appellant\u2019s new trial motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">We are mindful of the warning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Barrios, supra, 7 </em>Cal.App.4th 501, where the Court of Appeal noted: \u201cBy allowing the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s intent in possessing the knife, the [trial] court permitted a common bread knife to be transformed into a dirk or dagger.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 506, fn. omitted.) Intent can be a double-edged sword, so to speak.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b879-9\">In his motion for new trial, appellant made much of the fact that, at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the magistrate found no evidence of \u201cintent to use th[e] weapon[s] to assault\u201d and, thus, declined to bind him over for trial on a misdemeanor violation of section 12024. He claimed this should have \u201craised a red flag\u201d in the defense camp and should have precipitated a section 995 motion. It is, however, quite clear that Steinberg had already determined that raising and arguing a claim of \u201cinnocent intent\u201d was too dangerous in that the prosecutor might then be able to present evidence of appellant\u2019s prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, a knife, in a stabbing that resulted in great bodily injury. Steinberg did what he could to keep the jury from hearing that evidence \u2014 by seeking and obtaining bifurcation of the hearing on the prior conviction, and by objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s proposed use of the prior for impeachment purposes. It was clear from this latter skirmish that the trial court would not exclude the prior conviction on Evidence Code section 352 grounds. Thus, it was reasonable for Steinberg to avoid the subject of appellant\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d and focus his defense on issues he thought would sway the jury to acquit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">CALJIC No. 12.42 was revised in 1998 to provide: \u201cA deadly [or dangerous] weapon is any weapon, instrument or object that is capable of being used to inflict death or great bodily injury[.] [, and it can be inferred from the evidence, including the attendant circumstances, the time, place, destination of the possessor, [the alteration, if any, of the object from its standard form,] and any other relevant facts, that the possessor intended on that [or those] occasions] to use it as a weapon should the circumstances require.] [^] [It is not necessary that the weapon in fact be used or be visible.]\u201d (CALJIC No. 12.42 (1998 rev.) (6th ed. pocket pt.).) While not quite accurate, at least insofar as a \u201cdirk or dagger\u201d is not the precise equivalent of a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d the 1998 version of CALJIC No. 12.42 captures the essence of the <em>Oskins </em>holding.
