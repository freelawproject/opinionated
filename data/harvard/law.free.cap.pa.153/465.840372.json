This notice was not given until April 22, 1891, one day after the end of one year from the date of the contract. The defendants did not by this letter, April 22, 1891, request of and were not granted by the plaintiff an extension of time for making such payment. On the contrary the only agreement in regard to an extension was signed by the plaintiff in December, 1890, and at the time said paper was so signed there was no agreement nor understanding made in regard to the time when the plaintiff should have the right to exercise the option aforesaid. The said agreement of extension of which a copy is hereto annexed, ended on the first day of January, 1892, and no other notice of a desire to exercise the option to resell the said stocks and bonds was given by the plaintiff until January 2, 1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-13\">\u201c Your deponent is informed and believes that said notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>of April 22, 1891, and January 2,1892, were both too late, and that the plaintiff has no right of action growing out of the refusal of the defendants to buy in pursuance of said notices.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-4\">\u201c Your deponent avers on information and belief that there is a good general custom in New York, Boston and Philadelphia, known to dealers in bonds and stocks, that an option to sell at the end of any given period from a given date expires on the last day of said given period; that said custom is a part of the agreement set out in statement in this suit made between the plaintiff and defendants, and the defendants were under no obligation to^mrcha'se on either April 22, 1891, or January 2, 1892.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The court discharged a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>.were, (1) in refusing to enter judgment against defendants ; (2) in discharging the rule as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-7\"><em>Richard P. </em>White, <em>Joseph P.

The end of one year from April 21, 1890, at the earliest, marked the beginning of April 22,1892, the day on which the plaintiff made his first tender. In Lysle v. Williams, 15 S. &amp; R. 135, it is said that where the computation of time is from an act done, the day on which the act was done is to be included, but where the computation is from the day itself, the day is excluded: Marys v. Anderson, 2 Grant, Pa. 446; Taylor v. Jacoby, 2 Pa. 497; Bigelow v. Willson, 1 Pick. 485; Jacobs v. Graham, 1 Blackf. 392; Rand v. Rand, 4 N.

In cases where the language used by the parties to the contract is indefinite or ambiguous, and hence of doubtful construction, the practical interpretation of the parties themselves is entitled <em>to great </em>if not controlling influence: Chicago v.

Ap. 443.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\">A custom will not be permitted to alter the express terms of a contract, nor to trample upon a rule of law, and it is futile to contend that it can be set up in opposition to the intentions of the parties as to tbe meaning of the contract as evidenced by their own acts in construing it: Wigglesworth v. Dallison, 1 Sm. L. Cas., p. 928; Allen v. Dykers &amp; Alstyne, 3 Hill, 593; Frith v. Barker, 2 Johns. 327; Woodruff v. Bank, 25 Wend. 673; Coxe v. Heisley, 19 Pa. 248; Globe Milling Co. v.

In Parshall\u2019s Ap., 65 Pa. 224, the contract stipulated that if payment was not made on or before a day certain the contract should be void. Cleveland v. Sterrett, 70 Pa. 204, was an executory contract to deliver oil on a day certain \u2014 there was no delivery and no readiness to deliver. Of course time would be of the essence of such contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-7\">As to the time for performance, the three cases cited judged by the extracts given would seem to support the contention of the other side, but a very slight examination will show that they were of no weight: (1) The point as to the precise day of performance, whether the day before or the day after the limit, did not arise. (2) In each of these cases the decision was made on the ground that the requirement was that the act was to be done on or before the expiration of the limit given.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Aic\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">By the agreement between the parties the bonds were \u201c to be held for one year, and not to be sold .... without the consent \u201d of defendants. Plaintiff bound himself \u201c to hold said bonds during the above period of one year,\u201d and defendants bound themselves to repurchase the bonds at the option of plaintiff \u201c at the end of one year from the date of this contract.\u201d These mutual undertakings must be read together. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>By the general rule the \u201c one year from the date of the contract \u201d is to be computed by excluding the day of the date, and there is nothing on the face of the contract to show a different intent of the parties. But the first year to be considered was that during which plaintiff was to hold the bonds and not sell without defendant\u2019s consent. Excluding the day of the date, that year began April 22,1890, and ended April 21,1891. It included the whole of the latter day, and defendants might insist on full compliance. A sale by plaintiff on that day would therefore have been a breach of the agreement. But it was at the end of that year, after he had performed his covenant in full, that plaintiff\u2019s option became exercisable, and this clearly was not until April 22, 1891, when the demand was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We do not attach much importance to the acknowledgment of the demand by defendants\u2019 assignee, though its terms do specify that it is \u201c in accordance with the provisions of said recited agreement.\u201d It would scarcely be sufficient to prove a waiver as to time, if in fact the demand was too late. But it is some evidence that the parties themselves, defendants as well as plaintiff, then looked at the question of time in the same light that we construe it now, under the general principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Nor do we think the general rule can be modified by the averment of custom. The affidavit avers such custom \u201c on information and belief.\u201d Defendants are bankers and brokers, and presumably know the customs of such business, but they do not say of their own knowledge that there is such a custom, nor aver their expectation of ability to prove it. Moreover the custom as alleged is said to be one \u201c known to dealers in bonds and stocks,\u201d without saying that plaintiff is such a dealer. But waiving these formal defects, the custom as set up is as to an option to sell at the end of any given period, which does not, prima facie, at all touch the present case of an option to. demand a rescission of a sale after a year of obligatory retention by the purchaser, of the articles sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The second demand on January 2, 1892, was unnecessary, and what took place is immaterial. The agreement of December 8, 1890, is merely an extension of time within which defendants were to pay. It does not in terms refer to this claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>at all, for it is limited to debts due, and this was not a debt but a contract which might or might not become a debt at the option of plaintiff. But even if the agreement applies to this claim it contains no waiver of the effect of the demand. The plaintiff\u2019s option was not extended by it, for its purpose was in relief not in enlargement of defendants\u2019 obligations. It did not make them liable for a longer period to the chances of the market value of the bonds, and the plaintiff\u2019s option thereon, but gave them additional time to pay, if the obligation to pay should arise under the contract. The plaintiff, therefore, having given notice, in the manner and at the time stipulated in the contract, of his intention to exercise his option to have the bonds repurchased, his only further obligation, under the agreement of extension, was to wait the agreed time before proceeding to enforce his rights by suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The affidavit discloses no valid defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Judgment reversed, and record remitted for the entry of judgment for plaintiff unless other legal cause be shown to the contrary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
