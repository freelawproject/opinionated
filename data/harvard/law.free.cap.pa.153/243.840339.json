J., of the 36th judicial district, specially presiding, the evidence for the contestants tended to show that the testator George Van Dyke, for a few days before his death on Jan. 13, 1888, was in a weak and depressed condition of body and mind, and that he was induced by the urgent request and persistent importunities of the proponent to make the will in dispute, which he executed a few hours before his death. It was also alleged that proponent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>procured the services of John Graham, a justice of the peace, to draw the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 points were among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\">\u201c 1. If the jury are satisfied from the evidence that Hiram Van Dyke was present at the making of the will, and wrote the will; or assisted in making it, these are suspicious circumstances which are to have weight as the quantum of the legacy therein given to Hiram bears to the amount of the whole estate. <em>Answer: </em>Gentlemen, if Hiram assisted in the making of this will under which he undoubtedly tabes a devise of very considerable value, or if he volunteered to assist in writing the will,, either of these circumstances would be a matter of some suspicion in itself. It would not necessarily set the will aside, but might be considered in connection with the other evidence, undoubtedly, when you are looking at the case. If he merely copied the will at the instance of \u2019Squire Graham, if he penned it under these circumstances, and there is nothing else in the case to excite suspicion, I cannot see that that, in itself, would be a suspicious circumstance. Thus qualified, this point is affirmed.\u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">\u201c 4. If the jury are satisfied from the evidence that Hiram Van Dyke occupied a confidential relation to the testator, who was a member of the family, living with him at the time of his sickness and death; that Hiram insisted upon the making of a will, giving to him a large and valuable proportion of the testator\u2019s estate ; importuned the testator to make a will, procured the services of \u2019Squire Graham to write the will; that when Graham came he importuned the testator to make the will ,\u2022 that the testator was in great pain and bodily infirmity; pleaded to be let alone, and asked Hiram to go away and not bother him; that if he (Hiram) knew in how great misery he was, he would do so; that he said that Hiram and John might fix it; that he told Hiram and John if they would make his will he would sign it if it was anywhere near right; that he did not request \u2019Squire Graham to write his will; that he did not mention the subject only when Hiram or \u2019Squire Graham put questions to him; that a will was finally procured by Hiram Van Dyke through his persistent importunities to be executed by the testator in which great inequality of division exists in favor of Hiram, and was signed by the testator, within a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>hours of his death; if these facts are believed by the jury it is sufficient to warrant them in finding that undue influence was exercised over the testator by Hiram, and their verdict ought to be for the plaintiff in this issue. <em>Answer: </em>This point, gentlemen, is affirmed, provided you find also from the evidence that Hiram by his importunities and insistence mentioned or suggested in this point, succeeded in subjugating the mind of the testator, and in controlling him and taking away his free agency.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-3\">Defendants\u2019 points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-4\">\u201c1. That a man has a right by fair argument or persuasion to induce another to make a will and even to make it in his own favor, and a will procured by honest means, by acts of kindness, attention and by persuasion, which delicate minds would shrink from, would not be set aside on this ground alone.\u201d Affirmed. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">\u201c 2. If the jury believe that after the consultation of the physicians, Dr. McKee told George Van Dyke that his would be fatal, and that if he had any worldly business to attend to, he had better do so at once, and that all persons then retired from the room and left George Van Dyke and John Graham, the scrivener, alone, that George Van Dyke freely and voluntarily told Mr. Graham what disposition he wanted made of his property in his will, and that Graham reduced the same to writing and read it over to George Van Dyke, who was satisfied with it, save with some corrections, that these corrections were made in the will now probated and that he then executed the will, and requested his physician, Dr. McKee, and A. V. Gardner to act as witnesses, and that said will truly expressed the disposition he (George Van Dyke) wished made of his property, then such will must be sustained, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d Affirmed. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">\u201c3. That undue influence of the kind that will affect the provisions of a will must be such as subjugates the mind of the testator to the will of the person operating upon it and before the jury would be justified in finding a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs they must be satisfied that there was some fraud practiced on George Van Dyke by Hiram or John Van Dyke, some threats or misrepresentations made, some undue flattery, or some moral coercion employed so as to destroy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>free agency on the part of George Van Dyke, and unless they so find their verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d Affirmed.

Plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, (1) admission of the evidence referred to in the opinion of the Supreme Court; (2-6)^ instructions, quoting them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-6\"><em>M.

L. Smith. The object of this testimony, as it appears by the offer, was to prove that in May, 1884, he had a talk with George Van Dyke, the testator; that in that conversation the said testator talked about the disposition of his property, and said that he had made his home for a long time with Hiram Van Dyke and his wife; that they had been as kind to him as parents could be to a child, and that they deserved the greater portion of his estate; that these words were used when speaking of how he would dispose of his property by will. The testimony offered in support of it sustained the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">While the offer was somewhat remote, yet in view of the fact that the issue was, whether Hiram Van Dyke had procured the execution of this will by the exertion of undue influence, we think it was some evidence, although slight, to rebut that inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">The remaining assignments allege error in the answers to points. The plaintiff\u2019s first and fourth points were affirmed with a proper qualification. The defendant\u2019s second and third points were affirmed. We find no error in the answer to any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
