The interlineation was a short method to conform the debt represented by the note to usual obligations in which interest is treated separately from principal during the progress towards maturity: Bank v. Chester, 11 Pa. 282; Moyer v. Garrett, 96 Pa. 376.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-5\"><em>John Gr. </em>Johnson, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH3\">If any new idea was meant to be conveyed by the insertion of the words \u201c interest payar ble semi-annually,\u201d it was subordinated to the original idea that such payment should be \u201c subject to agreements.\u201d If, at the time of the maturity of the principal, the security should not be sufficient to pay it, the appellant was to have no claim against the appellee, although the note promised that at maturity the latter would pay the former the designated amount. In like manner, if, at the maturity of the semiannual interest payment, there were no proceeds in the shape of dividends or otherwise out of which it could be paid, the appellant was without remedy against the appellee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AaA\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">No question arises as to the legal propriety of the interlineation, and the addition to the original form of the obligation in question, and it must therefore be read as an entirety, and as all made at the time of execution. Read in this way, every kind of liability created by the instrument became subject to the operation of the agreements of July 24th, and August 8,1872. The principal sum of the note was to be paid, with interest, on the 24th day of July, 1876. But this payment was to be subject to the two agreements mentioned. The entire principal and all the interest for the whole term of the obligation were, therefore, to be paid subject to the agreements. By the addition, \u201cinterest payable semi-annually,\u201d the times of payment of the interest were changed so that the interest was to be paid at intervals of six months, instead of at the maturity of the note, but that was the whole of the effect of the added words. The time, only, of the payment of interest was changed. The duty to pay interest was still the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>same. The interest was to be paid in either event, distinctively as interest, but in any event it was only interest, and the legal duty of the maker was payment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">But the whole duty of payment under the contract of July 24, 1872, was qualified. It was subject to the condition that if actual payment was not made, the obligee was to look only to the security of the stock which had been transferred to the obligor. And the obligee expressly waived, \u201c all right to proceed at law or otherwise against any other property or properties whatsoever of any description, belonging, or which may belong, to the maker of said note remaining unpaid, for the satisfaction of the same.\u201d The plain meaning of this agreement undoubtedly is that whatever remained unpaid of the note at its maturity was to be collected exclusively out of the transferred stock. The obligee expressly waived all right to proceed against any other property \u201cwhatsoever\u201d of the obligor, to enforce the payment of any money due under the obligation. The waiver was co-extensive with every duty of payment arising from the instrument. How could we possibly say otherwise when the contract of the parties does not say so ? There is no distinction in the agreement in this respect between interest accruing every six months and interest accruing during the whole period. If the obligee did not collect his semiannual payments, they simply remained unpaid, and were a constituent part of the entire sum of principal and interest due at the maturity of the paper. As such, the interest was simply a part of the gross sum due, and was to be collected in the same way as the principal. We are clearly of opinion that the case was correctly decided by the learned court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
