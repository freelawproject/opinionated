If the jury find from the evidence that the stock transactions out of which the note in suit grew began January 19, 1878, continued actively until August 25,1880, being a period of two years and seven months, and during that time twenty-one hundred shares of stock of various kinds were purchased for the account of H. K. Bennett, and they also find that none of said shares of stock were actually delivered to the said Bennett, but that in rendering the accounts there was only a striking of balances and an ascertainment of differences, it is evidence from which the jury may presume that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>intention by the parties to actually deliver or receive the stocks.\u201d Affirmed.

Some of them are very long, and I do not think you will recollect much of them. It all narrows down to the simple question of the intention of the plaintiffs. If the intention of the plaintiffs was to purchase and sell the stock, and their intention was not merely to hold Bennett responsible for the profits and losses, then your verdict must bo for the plaintiffs. If, however, the intention was otherwise, that their intention was simply to settle with him on the profits and losses, then your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d [15]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

It has never been sought to prove the illegality of the contract simply by showing that there had been purchases and sales of stock by the broker on behalf of the customer: Brua\u2019s Ap., 55 Pa. 294; Smith v. Bouvier, 70 Pa. 325; Maxton v. Gheen, 75 Pa. 166; Fareira v. Gabell, 89 Pa. 89; North v. Phillips, 89 Pa. 250; Ruchizky v. De Haven, 97 Pa. 202; Dickson v. Thomas, 97 Pa. 278; Waugh v.

N. 177.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-11\">No case can be shown in which, in defending a note purporting to be for an adequate consideration, the defendant, who gave the note, has been permitted to escape payment merely by showing that his broker had bought and sold stocks on his account, and had accounted to him for such purchases and sales. In Pennsylvania it is legal to speculate in stocks. It is open to any person to buy stocks on time with the intent to sell them again to third persons, either when the purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>stocks are called, or at a later time. So long as the transaction is real and not pretended, it is legal, and all those who take part in it, either by making the purchase, or by negotiating the purchase and sale, or by advancing in and about the' same, may recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">Whenever we find a case in which the broker has made actual purchases, has taken actual deliveries, and has made actual sales of stocks, on behalf of the principal, we have one in which the broker is entitled to recover for his advances, unless the principal shall establish an agreement different from that evidenced by the account of purchases and sales, and not to be inferred from the account itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">The construction of a written instrument is for the court: Duffield v.

There is no reason, if the transaction be a real one, for payment by vendee to vendor merely of a difference in price. It might be, in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>or two instances, though the transaction was really one of purchase or sale, that a settlement would be in difference. If, however, there was a course of dealing directly between vendor and vendee, in which there was always the payment of a difference, and never a delivery or payment of purchase money, an inference of gambling might well be drawn: Fareira v. Gabell, 89 Pa. 89; Mohr v. Miesen, 49 N. W. R. 863; Rumsey v. Berry, 65 Me. 570; Harvey v. Merrill, 22 N. E. R. 50; Lester v. Buel, 30 N. E. R. 821; Phelps v. Holderness, 19 S. W. R. 921.

It appears to have been given for balance of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>counts, between the maker and the payees, covering a period of nearly three and a half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The note, given in evidence by plaintiffs, made a prima facie case, entitling them to a verdict, unless the testimony introduced by defendant was sufficient to justify the court in submitting to the jury, as was done, questions of fact suggested in his points, for charge, recited in the second to fourteenth specifications of error inclusive. As legal propositions, those points, as well as that part of the learned judge\u2019s charge recited in the fifteenth and last specification, appear to be correct. The sole question is whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding the facts of which said points are predicated. This was frankly conceded by the learned counsel for plaintiffs. Having admitted in his printed argument that \u201c the learned judge stated, with thorough understanding, the law applicable to the case,\u201d he virtually abandoned all his specifications of error, except the first, which alleges the court erred in refusing to charge as requested by plaintiffs in their sixth point, viz.: \u201c Under all the facts in the case, the verdict must be for the plaintiffs, if the note in suit was executed by defendant\u2019s intestate.\u201d He thus rested his case solely on the proposition that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a verdict in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We quite agree that this is the only debatable question in the case. As to the principles of law enunciated by the learned judge in his charge, and in his affirmance of points presented by both parties, the instructions were, if anything, more favorable to the plaintiffs.than they should have been. In view of the testimony on which the defendant relied, plaintiffs presented eight points for charge, all of which, except the one above quoted, were affirmed without qualification. The jury were thus instructed, inter alia, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">1. If plaintiffs bought and sold stock for defendant\u2019s intestate, paying for and receiving the same in each instance and settling and receiving the money therefor in good faith, then they must find for the plaintiffs, even if they believe said deceased had no intention of ever taking the stocks so purchased or delivering those sold; the fact that he intended to gamble cannot prejudice their case, unless they intended to gamble also.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">2. The putting up of margins, retaining possession of stocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>and settling of differences are not enough to stamp the transactions as wagers; there must be facts to show that the actual intent of the parties was to wager merely on the prospective price.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">3. If the jury do not find from the evidence an intention to wager by both the plaintiffs and the defendant\u2019s intestate, their verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">4. The burden of proof is upon the defendant; it is for him to show, by the weight of evidence, that plaintiffs and decedent were gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">These points, as well as those of the defendants above referred to, sufficiently indicate the nature of the defence to the note in suit. For the purpose of showing that the transactions referred to in said points were in fact wagering contracts, on the rise and fall of stocks, known as stock gambling, the defendant gave in evidence accounts rendered his intestate from time to time by the plaintiffs, and also their books containing accounts of their stock transactions with defendant\u2019s intestate during several years, and finally culminating in the balance for which the note in suit was given. He also called plaintiffs\u2019 bookkeeper and examined him at considerable length in relation to said accounts rendered and book entries, and also introduced witnesses to prove the financial standing of his intestate, the business in which he was engaged, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">It is not our intention, nor do we deem it necessary here to review the testimony. The result of the consideration we have given it will be quite sufficient. An examination of the accounts given in evidence, in connection with the oral testimony relating thereto, etc., has failed to convince us that there was any error in submitting the case to the jury for their consideration and determination. Without usurping their appropriate function of considering and weighing testimony and drawing therefrom such reasonable inferences of fact as maybe warranted, the court could not have ruled, as matter of law, that the alleged purchases and sales of stocks by plaintiffs for account of defendant\u2019s intestate were bona fide business transactions, in which there was an actual receipt or delivery of, and payment for the stocks alleged to have been so purchased or sold, or even any intention of either party that said stocks should be delivered or received and paid for, as the case might be. On the contrary, we think the testimony tended to prove that the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>both parties was merely to wager upon the prospective price of said stocks, settle the difference and pay the gain or loss; in other words, their transactions, throughout, were in fact repeated acts of gambling in the stocks referred to in said accounts, and the jury were warranted by the evidence in so finding. In determining what the intention of the parties was, in that regard, the jury had a right to consider the nature and character of the accounts, the acts of the parties, and all the circumstances surrounding their 'transactions, so far as the same are disclosed by the testimony. They had a right even to go behind the mere form given to their transactions, and ascertain from all the evidence the real purpose of the parties and the actual character of their dealings with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In this state, the law relating to gambling contracts has been firmly settled in a long line of cases, among which are the following : Brua\u2019s Ap., 55 Pa. 294; Smith v. Bouvier, 70 Id. 325, 328; Kirkpatrick v. Bonsall, 72 Id. 155; Fareira v. Gabell, 89 Id. 89; North v. Phillips, Id. 255; Dickson\u2019s Ex\u2019rs v. Thomas, 97 Id. 278; Waugh v. Beck, 114 Id. 422; Harper v. Young, 112 Id. 419; Griffiths v. Sears, Id. 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In Fareira v. Gabell, supra, the judgment of common pleas No. 2 Philadelphia was affirmed on the principles clearly enunciated in the charge of the learned president of that court. It was there held, among other things, that a wagering contract is one in which the parties in effect stipulated that they shall gain or lose upon the happening of an uncertain event in which they have no interest, except that arising from the possibility of such gain or loss; and whether the contract is a wagering one or not is a question for the jury, unless the entire contract, unexplained by oral testimony, is in writing. Also, that notes given to a broker to cover losses incurred in stock gambling operations are void; that money, advanced by a broker to pay such losses, cannot be recovered, nor can the broker\u2019s commissions be recovered, because the whole transaction is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The testimony in this case was clearly sufficient to warrant its submission to the jury. There was no error in refusing to charge as requested in plaintiffs\u2019 sixth point; nor do we find anything in the record that requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-9\">Me.
