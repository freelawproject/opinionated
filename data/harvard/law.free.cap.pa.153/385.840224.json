Karcb died intestate, May 22, 1886, leaving a widow; and a daughter, the appellant. Letters of administration on his estate were granted to his widow. She filed two accounts in the orphans\u2019 court, which were referred to auditors on exceptions, whose reports have been confirmed absolutely, the last on Jan. 3, 1890. By these proceedings all the debts of the intestate were paid except a balance of $337.11 due the widow, a creditor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u2022estate, and a mortgage debt of $1,503.78, created by the intestate. . The assignee of the mortgage instituted proceedings, recovered judgment, and caused the mortgaged premises to be sold by the sheriff on May 19, 1888, at which sale the administratrix became the purchaser for the sum of $8,150. She paid ten per cent of the purchase money, and on June 9, following, received her deed for the property from the sheriff. On the same day the sheriff took a judgment bond from her for $7,335, payable July 9, expressed as follows: \u201cbeing balance of purchase money of real estate, the distribution of which is to be determined by the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">On June 10,1890, she paid an additional $1,000 on the bond to the sheriff. On Oct. 4, 1890, the counsel of the sheriff, and for the estate of Joseph J. Karch, deceased, as well as the attorney for the guardian of the daughter, Rebecca Karch, who was then a minor, being all the parties in interest, agreed in writing that \u201c the amount due the sheriff on judgment entered in the court of common pleas of Lebanon county to No. 388, June term, 1890, together with such interest as may be due and owing thereon, if any is legally due thereon, is hereby considered in court, and A. Frank Seltzer, Esq., is hereby appointed auditor by consent to make distribution thereof.\u201d Same day the court of common pleas appointed said auditor. When the auditor met the parties to distribute the fund, the attorney for the administratrix offered proof to establish two claims which the administratrix alleged were due her by the estate; these claims were <em>disputed; </em>and an issue was applied for in the same court which was granted, in which the widow Amelia S. Karch was made plaintiff, and herself as administratrix of said estate defendant. This issue was entered to No. 22, March T., 1891, and upon trial resulted in a verdict in favor of defendant, Dec. 7,1891. A new trial was granted. The case was again tried and resulted a second time in a verdict for defendant, upon which judgment was entered Oct. 27, 1892. After the issue was determined, the auditor met again and took additional evidence, after which the case was argued. The auditor made his report, exceptions to which were filed by Amelia S. Karch, and on behalf of Rebecca E. Shugar. The only contested question before the auditor was the liability of the administratrix to pay interest on the unpaid portion of the purchase money due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>by her for the real estate which she purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale. This the auditor decided against her for the whole amount claimed tobe due, except such interest as accrued on the money due on the mortgage upon which the property was sold from the day after the sale (when the fund ceased to bear interest for the mortgagee), up to the time it was actually paid by her. After the case had been fully argued, the court, in an opinion by McPherson, J., determined the amount of money in the sheriff\u2019s hands; deducted therefrom the sheriff\u2019s costs; costs of audit; amount due the mortgagee and another small claim of $8.76, and then decreed the balance of the money ($6,283.46) to Amelia S. Karch, administratrix of Joseph J. Karch, deceased, upon her giving bond in the sum of $12,500, conditional for the legal distribution of the money. The court also struck off the judgment and all proceedings in the issue above referred to, entered to No. 22, March T., 1891, on the ground that the court of common pleas had no jurisdiction, under the act of Feb. 24, 1834, \u00a7 33, P. L. 77, to distribute the fund, except to lien creditors; and consent could not give jurisdiction. Rebecca E. Shugar, the daughter, took this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were, inter alia, (2) setting aside auditor\u2019s report because proceedings were conducted in common pleas instead of orphans\u2019 court; and (5) striking off judgment and all proceedings in issue entered to No. 22, March T., 1891.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>Josiah Funek, P. 8.

L. 77, which provides that: \u201c In all cases where property, real or personal, of a decedent, is sold upon an execution, and more money raised than is sufficient to pay off liens of record, the balance shall be paid over to the executor or administrator for distribution; but before any such payment shall be made such executor or administrator shall give bond to the satisfaction of the court, conditioned for the legal distribution of such money, provided always that such money shall be distributed as the real estate, of which it is the proceeds, would have been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">It is manifest that much money has been wasted, and labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>incurred in vain, in this attempt to distribute a dead man\u2019s estate in the common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">As the proceedings below were invalid lor want of jurisdiction, it is unnecessary to discuss any of the details. When the case gets into the orphans\u2019 court, where it properly belongs, it is possible that some of the proceedings of the common pleas may be utilized by the former court for the saving of time and expense. There appears to have been a feigned issue in the common pleas which has been twice tried. As the object of tbis issue was merely to inform tbe conscience of the court, we see no reason why it may not be used in the orphans\u2019 court for that purpose with the same force and effect as if that court had originally directed the issue and sent it to the common pleas for trial, especially in view of the fact that eaeh court is held by the same judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We are aware that some of the earlier cases would seem to give countenance to the doctrine that in certain exceptional cases a proceeding like this might be sustained, but those were the days when the orphans\u2019 court was in its swaddling clothes, and its jurisdiction limited. It is not so now. It has grown to the full stature and dignity of a court of exclusive jurisdiction in all that concerns its business. It was said by tbe late Chief Justice Black, in Whiteside v. Whiteside, 20 Pa. 473 : \u201c The exclusiveness of its jurisdiction, and the conelusiveness of its decrees, have been placed by the acts of assembly and the decisions of this court upon a foundation which cannot be shaken. If there be anything besides death which is not to bo doubted, it is, that the orphans\u2019 court alone has authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent\u2019s property and order its distribution among those entitled to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">To the same point, and equally emphatic, is the language of this court in Hammett\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 392. And in Phillip\u2019s Administra tors v. Railroad Company, 107 Pa. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Much as we regret the delay, confusion and expense caused by this mistake, we do not see our way clear to override an act of assembly in order to enable the parties to avoid the consequences of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
