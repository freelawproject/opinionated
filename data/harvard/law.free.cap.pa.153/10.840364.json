The subscriptions were based upon the condition that defendant would lease five acres of his land to the proposed company for the period of five years for oil and gas purposes. Defendant was to furnish boiler, engine and fuel, and to give his personal attention to the drilling of the first well. The consideration to defendant was that the company should pay him one third of all profits realized from oil or gas found on the said five acres. The company was organized, and on Nov. 1, 1890, defendant leased to the company the said five acres of land for the term of five years for the annual rental of one dollar and other considerations, with a covenant in the lease entitling the lessor, for a breach of any of the covenants therein contained, to immediately re-enter and repossess the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">A well was drilled upon the premises, and a good supply of gas obtained, which gas was marketed by the company. On Jan. 2, 1892, defendant, alleging that he had not been paid the one third of the profits of the gas from the well, re-entered and repossessed himself of the land and disconnected the well from a pipe line by which plaintiff was supplying a customer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">Plaintiffs averred in their bill and affidavits that they had purchased rights of defendant to the profits in the well for the sum of $2,500, and had tendered to him the purchase money, and were ready and willing to complete the purchase by paying the money agreed upon. Defendant in his answer and affidavits denied that any such agreement was ever made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-9\">Plaintiffs also claimed that no profits had been realized, that the profits were not rent for the nonpayment of which the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>could be forfeited, and that defendant owed tbe company for gas furnished to himself.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AX_\">January 3, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">The court, on hearing, entered a decree, dissolving the preliminary injunction, in an opinion by Rayburn, P.

Easton, 133 Pa. 505.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">The profits were not rent, the only rent reserved being one dollar, as shown by the lease. The lease contains no covenant for payment of rent at any stated time, nor method for ascertaining the profits and adjusting accounts with defendant, who is company\u2019s debtor for a large amount of gas, and it could not be known who was indebted to the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">The only evidence in the matter showed no profits'realized, and defendant did not attempt to show there had been; at best, there was an unsettled account between them as to profits and the amount due for gas furnished defendant, and in no event could there be other than the balance of this account due from one of them to the other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-9\"><em>A.
