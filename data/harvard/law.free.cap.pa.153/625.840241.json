R. 437.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-5\">From the case stated it appeared that defendant is a wholesale dealer in oleomargarine, licensed by the United States government ; that on Nov. 3d he sold to one Noyes a package containing twenty pounds of oleomargarine, which said package was manufactured in Rhode Island, imported to Pennsylvania, and sold and delivered to Noyes in its original unbroken condition. It did not appear from the case stated that the oleomargarine was sold as an article of food. A reservation of a right of appeal or certiorari was by leave filed at bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-6\">Judgment was entered for defendant by the court below in an oral opinion in part as follows, by Biddle, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-7\">' \u201c The law is a highly penal one, and therefore to be construed, as all penal laws, strictly. The first section enacts \u2018 that no person, firm or corporate body shall manufacture out of any oleaginous substance, or any compound of the same, other than that produced from unadulterated milk, or of cream from the same, any article designed to take the place of butter or cheese produced from pure unadulterated milk or cream from the same, or of any imitation or adulterated butter or cheese, nor shall sell or offer for sale, or have in his, her or their possession with intent to sell the same as an article of food.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-9\">\u201c The offence, therefore, it will be perceived, is confined to the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine \u2018 as an article of food,\u2019 the whole purpose of the law being, as appears by its title and this section, to protect the health of the public. If then it was sold and used as wagon grease, to which purpose its enemies consider it eminently fitted, it would clearly not be a violation of the law. Now there is nothing in the case stated to show that it was sold or used as an article of food. As, therefore, no law of the state would seem to have been violated, we give judgment for the defendant on the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-10\">\u201c The 3d section, although not reiterating the exact words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>of the first, must be read in connection with it; the intent to sell or the offer to sell must be as an article of food.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMi\">January 30, 1893:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was entering judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-4\"><em>Charles F.
