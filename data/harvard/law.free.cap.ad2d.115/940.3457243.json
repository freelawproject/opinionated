Memorandum: The court correctly determined that a declaratory judgment action was the proper vehicle to test the constitutionality of legislation <em>(Matter of Merced v Fisher, 38 </em>NY2d 557, 559). However, the court erred in declaring unconstitutional those sections of Real Property Tax Law article 7, title 1-A (\u00a7\u00a7 729-738) which permit the use of residential assessment ratios and residential comparables in the small claims assessment review procedure. The use of residential assessment ratios or residential comparables does not create a separate assessment class. Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection rights</p>\n<p id=\"AZTm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>are not violated by a legislative determination that owner-occupants of one-, two- or three-family homes in a small claims assessment review procedure may show inequality by evidence not admissible in a proceeding under Real Property Tax Law article 7, title 1 <em>(see, Colt Indus. v Finance Administrator of City of N. Y, </em>54 NY2d 533). (Appeals from judgment of Supreme Court, Erie County, Wolf, J.\u2014declaratory judgment.) Present\u2014Callahan, J.
