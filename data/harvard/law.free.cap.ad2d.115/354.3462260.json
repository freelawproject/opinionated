Sullivan, J.), rendered on May 15, 1984, convicting defendant of robbery in the first degree, robbery in the second degree, and grand larceny in the third degree and sentencing defendant to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of 3 to 9 years for each robbery charge and <em>2Vs </em>to 7 years for the grand larceny charge, unanimously modified, on the law, to reduce the grand larceny sentence to li\u00f3 to 4 years\u2019 imprisonment, and otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On April 13, 1984 defendant pleaded guilty to charges of first and second degree robbery and third degree grand larceny in satisfaction of all the counts of his indictment. Defendant was sentenced as a class D felon to a 2V\u00e1 to 7-year term of imprisonment for his third degree grand larceny conviction. Third degree grand larceny (Penal Law \u00a7 155.30 [5]), however, is a class E felony carrying a maximum prison term of <em>lVs </em>to 4 years. Defendant\u2019s sentence for third degree grand larceny is accordingly reduced to a term of 1 VS to 4 years\u2019 imprisonment, the maximum sentence for a class E felony. Concur\u2014Murphy, P.
