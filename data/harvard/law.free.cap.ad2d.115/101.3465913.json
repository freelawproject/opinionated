Petitioner\u2019s service of the notice of petition and petition by mail upon respondents was insufficient to confer jurisdiction over them (CPLR 403 [c]). In addition, CPLR 7804 (c) requires that the notice of petition must also be served upon the Attorney-General. It is also noted that the extraordinary remedy of prohibition does not lie if there is available an adequate remedy at law <em>(Matter of State of New York v </em>King, 36 NY2d 59, 62). Mahoney, P. J., Mikoll, Yesawich, Jr., Levine and Harvey, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
