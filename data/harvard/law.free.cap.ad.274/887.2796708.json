The findings of fact implicit in the verdict are affirmed. The injured plaintiff was at most a bare licensee at the place where she fell. Under the circumstances, plaintiffs failed to establish actionable negligence on the part of defendants. <em>(Gillen </em>v. <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp., </em>287 N.
