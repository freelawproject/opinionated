In any event their application for a variance was made under that section. It is clear that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the board of standards and appeals in denying a variance on the facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">The orders appealed from should be reversed and the petition dismissed, with costs and disbursements to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Peck, P. J., Glennon, Dore, Callahan and Van Voorhis, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Orders unanimously reversed and the petition dismissed, with $20 costs and disbursements to the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
