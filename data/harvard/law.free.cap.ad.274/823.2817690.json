The claimed negligence arose through altering the course of the stream which caused it to overflow and wash away claimant\u2019s house and to otherwise injure his premises at the time of a heavy rain.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-21\">The claim by the partnership Leonard Diener and Louis Liebman, doing business as The Long Eddy Chemical and Charcoal Company, also appellants, is for comparable damages to a manufacturing plant located upon lands in the vicinity of those owned by Kenney.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-22\">The facts upon which claimants rely are that in 1934 and 1935, the State constructed about six miles of improved highway through Pea Brook Yalley and in connection therewith made eleven changes in the channel of the brook. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The valley is narrow, varying in width from 110 to 200 feet. The plans of the State, it is asserted, provided for too steep a slope adjacent to the highway and an inadequate amount of riprap, so that the rise in the creek level due to the heavy but not unprecedented rain in May, 1942, uprooted trees and displaced rocks and earth, cutting off the stream and diverting its course into other channels, causing the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The damages are stipulated as to one claimant and not seriously litigated as to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Judgment dismissing on the merits the claim of John P.
