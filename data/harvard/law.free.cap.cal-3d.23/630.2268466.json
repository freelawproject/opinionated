Section 351 provides that the time of a defendant\u2019s absence from the state after a cause of action has accrued against him \u201cis not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (la) As we shall explain, we have concluded that defendant\u2019s amenability to process is irrelevant under the tolling provision, and that the statute of limitations applicable to plaintiff\u2019s tort action was tolled during the period of defendant\u2019s absence from the state. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for defendant and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The essential facts are few. On September 23, 1973,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plaintiff Gloria Dew fell and was injured on defendant Kim Appleberiy\u2019s premises in San Francisco. On September 24, 1974, plaintiff instituted the underlying action against defendant, seeking damages for her personal injuries which she alleged were directly and proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligent maintenance of his premises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 5, 1975, defendant answered plaintiff\u2019s complaint by generally denying each of plaintiff\u2019s allegations and by alleging, inter alia, that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>barred by the one-year statute of limitations prescribed under section 340, subdivision 3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On September 23, 1976, defendant noticed a motion for summary judgment \u201con the grounds that the action is barred by the one year statute of limitations.\u201d Defendant admitted that he had been absent from California for five weeks during the one year following plaintiff\u2019s accident. Defendant argued, however, that \u201cduring the entire year subsequent to the accident he was amenable to process and at all times a personal judgment could have been obtained against him. Under such circumstances, there is no tolling of the statute of limitation pursuant to Section 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Defendant\u2019s position foresakes a literal reading of section 351, which declares in relevant portion that \u201cif, after the cause of action accrues [against a person], he departs from the state, the time of his absence is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d Since the statute\u2019s enactment over 100 years ago, decisions of this court and of the Court of Appeal have uniformly interpreted section 351 to give effect to its clear and unambiguous meaning. Thus in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(1872) 44 Cal. 280, 283, this court held that if, when a cause of action accrues, the defendant resides in California and afterward departs from California, his \u201csuccessive absences . .. from the State are to be aggregated,\u201d and are deducted from the whole time which has elapsed since the cause of action accrued. Similarly, the court in <em>Fielding </em>v. <em>Iler </em>(1919) 39 Cal.App. 559 [179 P. 519] upheld the trial court\u2019s aggregation of defendant\u2019s successive absences from the state to toll the statute of limitations pursuant to section 351.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Defendant contends, however, that section 351 does not apply to the present case. As defendant argues, the Legislature in enacting the statute in 1872 sought to prevent a claim from being barred simply because the defendant, being outside the state, could not be served with a summons and complaint in an in personam action. <em>(Schneider </em>v. <em>Schneider, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.2d 860, 862.). Defendant points out that subsequent legislation has provided for alternate methods of service adequate to confer upon the court jurisdiction to enter a personal judgment against an absent defendant. In lieu of personal delivery, a summons and complaint may now be served by leaving a copy at the office, dwelling house, usual place of abode or usual place of business of the person to be served (\u00a7 415.20); by mailing a copy to the party within or without the state (\u00a7\u00a7 415.30, 415.40); or by publication \u201cin a named newspaper, published in this state, that is most likely to give actual notice to the party to be served\u201d (\u00a7 415.50, subd. (b)). Thus, defendant claims, a plaintiff has no need for the protection of the tolling provision when the absent party is still amenable to process. Because plaintiff could have served defendant despite his absence from California during the statutory period, defendant asks us to hold plaintiff\u2019s action barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We note that the absence of a prospective defendant from the jurisdiction of the forum was originally rejected as a ground for judicial suspension of the statutory period. <em>(Developments in the Law\u2014Statutes of Limitations </em>(1950) 63 Harv.L.Rev. 1177, 1224.) In 1705 the English statute of limitations was first amended to provide that the time the defendant spends \u201c \u2018beyond the seas\u2019 \u201d should not be used in computing the limitations period; the colonial legislatures shortly thereafter adopted similar provisions, and today many states exclude the time during which the defendant is outside the state. The exception to the statute of limitations is thus \u201cwholly a creature of legislation.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Although the California statute itself remains unchanged from the date of enactment, the Legislature is clearly aware of the statute\u2019s broad ramifications, and has modified the reach of the rule in appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>circumstances. Thus when substituted or constructive service of process upon a defendant resident motorist is available in \u201ca cause of action arising in this state out of his operation of a motor vehicle anywhere within this state\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 17460), \u201c[notwithstanding any provision of Section 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the contrary . . . , the time of his absence from this State is part of the time limited for the commencement of the action . . .\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 17463).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">These provisions evidence the Legislature\u2019s recognition that the availability of personal jurisdiction <em>may </em>remove the necessity for suspending the statute of limitations. If the Legislature intends that the tolling provision not extend the limitations period <em>whenever </em>the defendant is amenable to jurisdiction, it can easily so state. In this regard Illinois has recently amended its saving statute so that \u201cno person shall be considered to be out of the State . . . when he is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State with respect to th[e] cause of action pursuant to . . . any . . . statute authorizing service of process which would subject that person to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State. . . .\u201d (Ill.Rev.Stat. 1973, ch. 83, par. 19.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the Court of Appeal recently held in <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 705, 709, however, \u201cSection 351 does not make its tolling provision depend on the availability of service on a defendant, but on his physical presence in California.\u201d We believe that we should leave to the Legislature the decision whether the policy of expediting litigation that underlies the alternate service statutes should prevail over the policies underlying section 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>As we have held heretofore, \u201c \u2018Repeals by implication are not favored and are recognized only when there is a conflict between two or more legislative enactments.\u2019. . . They are recognized only where there is no rational basis for harmonizing the two potentially conflicting statutes . . . and the statutes are \u2018irreconcilable, clearly repugnant, and so inconsistent that the two cannot have concurrent operation. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>(In re White </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 207, 212 [81 Cal.Rptr. 780, 460 P.2d 980].)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">We find no irreconcilable conflict between section 351 and the statutes governing substituted service. The Legislature may justifiably have concluded that a defendant\u2019s physical absence impedes his availability for suit, and that it would be inequitable to force a claimant to pursue the defendant out of state in order effectively to commence an action within the limitations period. At the same time, by providing alternate forms of service the Legislature simply encourages a plaintiff to adjudicate his claim expeditiously if possibly; by using substituted service a plaintiff may now obtain a binding judgment even in the defendant\u2019s absence. While the alternate service provisions may lessen the need for section 351, we do not believe that they repeal section 351 <em>pro tanto.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Finally, contrary to defendant\u2019s suggestion, section 351 does not unconstitutionally infringe upon defendant\u2019s right to travel freely. In <em>Scherling </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 493 [149 Cal.Rptr. 597, 585 P.2d 219] we rejected an identical attack upon Penal Code section 802, which commands that if a criminal defendant is out of state when or after an offense is committed, the time during which he is absent is not to be computed as part of the limitations period. As we held, \u201cThe Legislature could have rationally determined that the likelihood of detection of the crime and identification of the criminal is greater if the accused remains within the jurisdiction, and that because the result\u2014even if not the intent\u2014of his departure from the state is to render discovery of the crime or the criminal more difficult, the statute of limitations should be tolled in his absence.\u201d (22 Cal.3d at p. 500.) Inasmuch as we found that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>effected no substantial impairment of the defendant\u2019s right to travel\u2014\u201cdefendant is not subjected to greater penalty because he left the state; rather, he is faced with a tolled statutory period of limitations\u201d\u2014we held that the provision did not violate defendant\u2019s right to travel. <em>(Id, </em>at p. 5020</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">As we have explained above, section 351 likewise rationally alleviates any hardship that would result by compelling plaintiff to pursue defendant out of state. Since the statute does not penalize the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right, and in view of the statute\u2019s rational relation to a valid governmental interest, we reject defendant\u2019s claim that section 351 violates his right to travel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">If plaintiff in the present case relied on the literal terms of section 351 in filing the underlying action, she did so reasonably. The meaning of the statute is not ambiguous: defendant\u2019s admitted five-week absence from California during the year after plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued \u201cis not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d If it is advisable that the statute be changed to accommodate more modem concepts of service of process, the Legislature has it within its power to effect such amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., Manuel, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Section 351 provides in full: \u201cIf, when the cause of action accrues against a person, he is out of the state, the action may be commenced within the term herein limited, after his return to the state, and if, after the cause of action accrues, he departs from the state, the time of h'is absence is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\">While'plaintiff\u2019s complaint for damages alleged that the accident occurred \u201c[o]n or about the 24th day of September, 1973\u201d plaintiff subsequently conceded that the accident occurred on September 23, 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s appellate counsel did not represent plaintiff at the trial level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Section 340, subdivision 3, provides in part that the period for the commencement of \u201c[a]n action for . . . injury to . . . one caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another\u201d is one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Defendant\u2019s declaration in support of his motion stated: \u201cAt the time of the alleged accident, I resided at 1461 - 9th Avenue, San Francisco, California.

[H] I have been a permanent resident of the State of California for the one year following the date of the alleged occurrence. In May of 1974, for a period of one month, I visited the State of Ohio to visit my parents. Furthermore, for approximately five days in the fall of 1974, I visited the State of Oregon to visit some personal friends. Those are the only times that I have been outside of the State of California during the one year following the alleged accident.
