Director contends the juvenile court erred in redetermining a ward\u2019s rehabilitative needs, CYA having properly determined the ward\u2019s application for parole be denied in his best interests. We agree with the director and reverse the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Understanding of the posture of the cause before us is essential to our resolution of the issues. Owen was properly committed to a CYA facility in August 1974.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For 18 months he participated in an educational program, making normal progress towards rehabilitation. In fall 1976 CYA denied Owen\u2019s application for parole because in its view he had not yet accepted responsibility for his actions resulting in his commitment and did not fully appreciate his obligations to society. Shortly thereafter and without pursuing an administrative appeal from the denial, Owen\u2019s mother petitioned the juvenile court to vacate the 1974 commitment. (\u00a7 778.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The juvenile court, considering the same matters deemed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>CYA to necessitate a continuation of Owen\u2019s participation in its program, concluded his rehabilitative needs would best be satisfied if he were released from custody. It set aside its original order of commitment and placed Owen on probation in the custody of his mother and ordered continuing therapy in an outpatient program.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">This is not a case wherein Owen challenges the propriety of the order finding him a ward of the court or of the order of commitment in the first instance. Nor is any claim made that because of the availability of new facts or information the order of commitment should be reconsidered as having been improvidently made. Nor does Owen seek relief on any ground for which the writ of habeas corpus might lie. He does not complain that the length of his confinement is disproportionate to the gravity of his misconduct or to his rehabilitative needs. He does not complain that conditions of his confinement are so onerous as to deny him any protected right\u2014in fact, both Owen and CYA agree Owen has adapted well to its program.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Owen\u2019s sole complaint is simply that CYA has abused its discretion in denying him immediate relief from commitment. He seeks in effect to establish the juvenile court\u2019s superior authority to reconsider and overrule a discretionary determination made by CYA pursuant to authority vested in CYA by the Legislature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Factual Basis for Granting Parole or Vacating Commitment</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">At the juvenile court hearing on the motion to vacate his commitment, Owen claimed CYA could no longer serve his rehabilitative needs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Owen testified he was entered in a college program at a CYA facility and had completed 39 units,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but had been denied permission to attend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>off-grounds college courses. He further testified he wished to pursue a professional baseball career, but baseball (hardball) facilities were not available at the facility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">A psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist intern, a social worker and parole agent, and a program administrator, all CYA staff members who had worked with Owen, testified he had continuing rehabilitative needs best served by the CYA program. They testified to CYA concern for Owen\u2019s lack of insight into the criminal nature of his conduct, his failure to acknowledge his role as a wrongdoer, and a tendency to excuse or justify his conduct. In their views Owen\u2019s continued confinement to an environment which required him to recognize and conform to standards approved by society would be beneficial to him and would foster further rehabilitation. On the other hand, an early release as on parole would tend to give support to his attitude of having committed an excusable or justifiable act.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">There was also testimony that, after the possibility arose Owen would be transferred to another facility when found to have possession of marijuana during the pendency of the instant petition, he stated the school program had been of benefit to him and he wished to remain there. *</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Owen contends the juvenile court is vested with final authority to determine his rehabilitative needs. He asserts the juvenile court\u2019s authority to vacate his commitment to CYA derives from section 779.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That portion of section 779 limiting the court\u2019s authority to \u201cchange, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>modify, or set aside\u201d an order of commitment by requiring that it give \u201cdue consideration to the effect\u201d of such an order \u201con the discipline and parole system of the Youth Authority,\u201d is critical to our resolutions herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Director claims the juvenile court may preempt CYA only when the court can identify a clear abuse of discretion. Owen, on the other hand, maintains the juvenile court judge, before exercising authority conferred by section 779, need only take CYA determinations into account, and that it had\" a right to \u201csecond guess\u201d CYA. When reminded that section 779 required it to consider the effect of its order on CYA parole and discipline, the court in this case commented \u201cI assure you that I have considered that and I have given it some thought, because I don\u2019t think that I should close my mind to the possibilities of my action, I think at the beginning of this hearing I should be aware of what possibilities might occur, what the effect of a court\u2019s order might be. [U] Now, certainly I would agree that a Court should not step in in case after case with the Youth Authority unless there is a serious reason for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It is manifest that when the juvenile court grants relief pursuant to sections 778 and 779, and places a ward on probation, it necessarily makes a judgment which CYA is charged with making, based on the same evidence. Such action by the court is tantamount to the granting of parole, again on the basis of the same matters considered by CYA. When as here such court action is taken in response to CYA\u2019s refusal to grant parole, it is inescapable the court has substituted its judgment for that of CYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The Legislature has not clearly defined the circumstances under which a juvenile court may intervene in a matter concerning the rehabilitative needs of a ward it has committed to CYA. The only express direction is contained in section 779 that the court \u201cshall give due consideration to the effects [of setting aside an order of commitment] upon the discipline and parole system of\u2019 CYA, and that the authority to set aside an order of commitment \u201cshall not be deemed to interfere with the system of parole and discharge now or hereafter established by law, or by rule of\u2019 CYA. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>CYA thus argues section 779 authorizes a juvenile court to intervene only when to do so does not interfere with CYA\u2019s proper administration of paroles and discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Although dealing with revocation rather than granting of parole, support for CYA\u2019s position is found in <em>In re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>315 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684]. In that case a juvenile, already a ward of the court committed to CYA, engaged in other criminal activity while on parole. After making initial findings on charges under supplemental petitions (\u00a7 707), but without issuing a dispositional order, the juvenile court referred the matter to CYA \u201cfor final disposition.\u201d CYA then relied on juvenile court findings in considering the question of parole revocations. We held the juvenile court proceedings were inappropriate to initiate revocation of CYA parole. \u201cExamination of the statutes governing Youth Authority parole and revocation procedure indicates that the juvenile court should play no part in the parole revocation process. The Youth Authority Act provides that the board has the power to grant and revoke parole. (\u00a7 1711.3.). . . [H] No role is specified for the juvenile court with respect to revocation of parole. The reason is clear: the Youth Authority Act contemplates that the board or its representative is to conduct the parole revocation hearing, and then itself determine whether a parole violation in fact occurred and take appropriate action with respect to revocation or continuation of parole. The juvenile court is not authorized to act essentially in the role of a Youth Authority parole revocation hearing officer, as it did in this case.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 327.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">While <em>Ronald E. </em>deals only with parole revocation, our courts have also held the juvenile court is without jurisdiction to release a ward on parole from CYA. <em>(Breed </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 773, 778 [134 Cal.Rptr. 228].) In so holding the court particularly relied on that provision of section 779 precluding a juvenile court from interfering with the CYA\u2019s \u201csystem of parole and discharge now or hereafter established by law, or by rule of\u2019 CYA. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 787-788.) The court also stated the \u201cLegislature has properly delegated to the Youth Authority the discretion to determine whether its faculties will be or are of benefit to the ward.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 784-785.) <em>Breed </em>is consistent with our expression in <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345] that commitment to CYA \u201cremoves the ward from the direct supervision of the juvenile court\u201d and that it was the function of CYA to determine the proper length of its jurisdiction over a ward. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 237-238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In the related field of jurisdiction to determine the rehabilitative needs of persons convicted of crimes, we have concluded the Adult Authority had the exclusive power to determine questions of rehabilitation. \u201cIf. . . the court were empowered ... to recall the sentence and grant probation if the court found that the defendant had become rehabilitated after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>incarceration, there manifestly would be two bodies (one judicial and one administrative) determining the matter of rehabilitation, and it is unreasonable to believe that the Legislature intended such a result.\u201d <em>(Holder </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 779, 782 [83 Cal.Rptr. 353, 463 P.2d 705]; see also <em>Alanis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 784, 786-787 [83 Cal.Rptr. 355, 463 P.2d 707].) While different statutes\u2014even different codes\u2014regulate the division of responsibility between the concerned administrative agency and court, it appears to be as unreasonable to assume the Legislature intended that both the juvenile court and CYA are to regulate juvenile rehabilitation as it is to assume that both the superior court and Adult Authority are to regulate criminal rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In view of the foregoing it appears section 779 does not constitute authority for a juvenile court to set aside an order committing a ward to CYA merely because the court\u2019s view of the rehabilitative progress and continuing needs of the ward differ from CYA determinations on such matters arrived at in accordance with law. The critical question is thus whether CYA acted within the discretion conferred upon it in rejecting Owen\u2019s application for parole. If so, there is no basis for judicial intervention by the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Owen\u2019s petition is supported by little more than a showing that after 18 months of confinement he had made good progress toward parole or outright release, that he had legitimate ambitions which he claimed could best be achieved if not confined, and a lone expert opinion that rehabilitation could best be accomplished in some other environment. But even that expert recognized Owen\u2019s need for continued psychiatric treatment and acknowledged release might have a detrimental effect upon the therapeutic benefit derived from working toward a regular grant of parole. He also gave conflicting testimony as to whether Owen would continue to benefit by treatment in CYA facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Witnesses for CYA raised serious questions whether Owen had assumed a proper degree of responsibility for his grievous misconduct. They were unanimously of the opinion his early release would tend to be viewed by Owen as approval of such misconduct, thereby damaging rehabilitative efforts. They were also of the view that while Owen had made a good adjustment during his 18 months of commitment, he would continue to benefit by other adjustments, particularly through recognition of the anti-social nature of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>It fairly appears the record in the instant case discloses a debatable question whether Owen\u2019s rehabilitative needs could best be served by his continued commitment to CYA.  CYA acted well within law and discretion vested in it by the Legislature in denying Owen\u2019s application for parole in 1976.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   In enacting section 779 in context with the Youth Authority Act the Legislature did not intend to authorize the juvenile court to substitute its judgment for that of CYA in such circumstances. The fact the question of release is debatable does not invoke judicial intervention\u2014such circumstance tends instead to give conclusive effect to CYA\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Giving meaning to the intendment of section 779 together with policies set forth in the balance of the Youth Authority Act, we hold a juvenile court may not act to vacate a proper commitment to CYA unless it appears CYA has failed to comply with law or has abused its discretion in dealing with a ward in its custody. Section 779 does not authorize judicial intervention into the routine parole function of CYA, as was done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Mosk, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\">In August 1974 Owen, then 17 years of age, intentionally shot and killed his father after an argument at the family home. Owen first denied then several days later admitted the killing. Following hearing and stipulation to the facts he was declared a ward of the juvenile court. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602.) He was committed to CYA in March 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Unless otherwise specified, all following statutory references are to sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Section 778 provides; \u201cAny parent or other person having an interest in a child who is a ward or dependent child of the juvenile court or the child himself through a properly appointed guardian may, upon grounds of change of circumstances or new evidence, petition the court in the same action in which the child was found to be a ward or dependent child of the juvenile court for a hearing to change, modify, or set aside any order of court previously made or to terminate the jurisdiction of the court.

(\u00a7\u00a7 1700, 1765; see <em>In re Martinez </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 641, 650 [83 Cal.Rptr. 382, 463 P.2d 734].) Here Owen stipulated to having fired a rifle bullet from a bedroom window into his father\u2019s head at a distance of 35 feet. CYA\u2019s program was designed not only for Owen\u2019s needs, but also to insure the public\u2019s safety upon his release, and Owen\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct was a factor which was a legitimate concern to CYA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b398-7\">BIRD, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7C\">I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The majority today strip juvenile courts of their statutory power to vacate Youth Authority commitments when, in the court\u2019s judgment, such action would be in a ward\u2019s best interests. In so holding, the majority override the legislative mandate of Welfare and Institutions Code sections 775, 778 and 779. Adherence to these statutes requires this court to affirm the juvenile court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The Legislature has vested in juvenile courts broad powers to amend dispositional orders. Welfare and Institutions Code section 775, ignored by the majority, provides that <em>\u201c[djny </em>order made by the [juvenile] court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the case of any person subject to its jurisdiction may at any time be changed, modified, or set aside, <em>as the judge deems meet and proper . . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Further, section 778 allows the ward, a parent, or an interested party to petition the juvenile court to amend or set aside a previous order on the grounds of \u201cnew evidence\u201d or \u201cchange of circumstance.\u201d1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That same statute provides that the court shall hold a hearing on the petition if it appears that the proposed change may promote the ward\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d Finally, section 779 specifically empowers the juvenile court to \u201cchange, modify, or set aside\u201d a previous order committing a minor to the Youth Authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226, 238, fn. 15 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345].) These three sections authorize a juvenile court to vacate a Youth Authority commitment whenever changed circumstances convince the court that a different disposition would be in a ward\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The majority reject this clear grant of authority by focusing on two cautionary statements in section 779. The first requires juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>judges who amend or vacate a commitment order to \u201cgive due consideration to the effect thereof upon the discipline and parole system of the Youth Authority . . . However, the absence of prohibitory language in the sentence underscores the fact that the Legislature did not intend to prevent juvenile courts from setting aside commitment orders. Rather, the Legislature merely sought to have the court deliberate upon the effect of vacating a commitment, to insure that the court does not hastily or unnecessarily interfere with parole determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The majority also focus on the fourth sentence of section 779. There, after having given juvenile courts the power to set aside Youth Authority commitments, the Legislature states: <em>\u201cExcept as in this section provided, </em>nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to interfere with the [Youth Authority\u2019s] system of parole and discharge . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) It is curious that in describing this provision, the majority omit reference to the italicized introductory clause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 403.) That clause plainly signifies a legislative recognition that by authorizing juvenile courts to set aside commitment orders, the Legislature was creating an exception to the Youth Authority\u2019s exclusive discretion in parole matters. If the Legislature had not intended to allow the exercise of judicial discretion in this area, it would not have written the introductory clause. In omitting that clause from their analysis, the majority are less than faithful to the plain language and meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">To reach their result, the majority also take great liberty with the case law. The majority quote <em>In re Arthur </em>TV., <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pages 237-238 for the proposition that commitment to the Youth Authority \u201cremoves the ward from the direct supervision of the juvenile court.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 404.) However, the majority ignore the footnote qualifying that statement: \u201cThe court may, however, set aside the commitment on notice and hearing and return the minor to the former wardship status. (\u00a7 779.)\u201d (16 Cal.3d at p. 238, fn. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Further, the majority\u2019s summary description of <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 773 [134 Cal.Rptr. 228], on which they heavily rely, is misleading. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 404.) In <em>Breed, </em>the Youth Authority returned a difficult ward to the juvenile court. After the court declined to set aside the original order committing the ward to the Youth Authority, the Youth Authority refused to accept his return. The juvenile court then released the ward from his interim custody until the Youth Authority agreed to accept his return.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On these facts, the Court of Appeal held that the juvenile court\u2019s temporary release of the minor was \u201ca technical error\u201d since section 779 prohibits juvenile courts from interfering with the Youth Authority\u2019s system of discharge <em>except </em>where the court changes, modifies or sets aside the original order of commitment. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 781, 788.) The ward\u2019s release in <em>Breed </em>did not result from a change, modification, or setting aside of the original commitment. Indeed, the judge expressly declined to do so. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 782, 785.) Thus, <em>Breed </em>differs critically from this case and in no way limits the power of juvenile courts to discharge wards from the Youth Authority under the first sentence of section 779.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Again, in citing <em>In re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 315 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684], the majority rely on a case which is inapposite. <em>Ronald E. </em>holds that in the absence of authorizing legislation, parole revocation proceedings may not be initiated in juvenile court. <em>(Id, </em>at p. 326.) This holding is entirely consistent with the juvenile courts\u2019 power to set aside Youth Authority commitments since section 779 expressly authorizes such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Finally, the majority seek support in <em>Holder </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) I Cal.3d 779 [83 Cal.Rptr. 353, 463 P.2d 705] and <em>Alanis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 784 [83 Cal.Rptr. 355, 463 P.2d 707]. <em>Holder </em>and <em>Alanis </em>are readily distinguished from the present case since they both involve interpretation of the adult sentencing law as opposed to the Juvenile Court Law. The adult law includes no provisions comparable to sections 775, 778 and 779. The courts\u2019 broad powers to change <em>juvenile </em>disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>tions under these sections are in keeping with the special concern of the Juvenile Court Law with the welfare and rehabilitation of young people under its jurisdiction. (\u00a7 202; see, e.g., <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767, 775 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Clearly, the case law does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature did not mean what it plainly stated in sections 775, 778 and 779. These statutes give juvenile courts the authority to set aside Youth Authority commitments to promote a ward\u2019s best interests. Nothing in these statutes purports to limit this power to situations where the Youth Authority \u201chas failed to comply with law or has abused its discretion.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 406.) To the contrary, the <em>court </em>is accorded great discretion in determining whether the circumstances justify a change in disposition or total termination of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See fn. 1, <em>ante; In re W.R.W. </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1037 [95 Cal.Rptr. 354].) \u201c[I]n the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion, an appellate court is not free to interfere with the trial court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>(In re Corey </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 813, 831-832 [41 Cal.Rptr. 379].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In the present case, a review of the evidence establishes that the juvenile court did not abuse its broad discretion in finding \u201ca very great change of circumstances\u201d and in setting aside Owen\u2019s Youth Authority commitment. The annual review made by Owen\u2019s immediate supervisors at the Youth Authority indicated that Owen had made \u201csuperior progress\u201d in achieving the goals set in his rehabilitation program, and that his schoolwork was \u201coutstanding.\u201d The report also stated that Owen \u201cpossessed leadership qualities,\u201d avoided negative influences, and was a \u201cself-starter.\u201d The report concluded that \u201che should have no problem whatsoever maintaining any job he should happen to have.\u201d Owen\u2019s evaluators recommended his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In addition, a psychiatrist testifying on Owen\u2019s behalf stated that Owen had arrived at a philosophical understanding of his role in his father\u2019s death and that the chance of a recurrence of such violence was remote. The Youth Authority\u2019s experts agreed that the killing was an isolated incident and that Owen was not a hazard to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Further, the evidence was uncontradicted that Owen had the potential ability to play professional baseball. However, the Youth Authority facilities where he was confined were inadequate to develop this talent.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>On this record, it is clear that substantial evidence supported the trial judge\u2019s determination in this case. The evidence showed that Owen had made significant progress in the Youth Authority, that he was not a threat to the safety of the public, and that his educational and professional opportunities would be enhanced by his release. Experts for both Owen and the Youth Authority testified that denial of release could impede his progress. The trial court\u2019s decision to set aside the Youth Authority commitment and to order outpatient psychiatric care for Owen was well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The trial court\u2019s order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Tobriner, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied March 29, 1979. Bird, C. J., and Tobriner, J. were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">From the italicized language, it is evident that the Legislature intended to give juvenile court judges wide discretion to amend or vacate their previous orders, including dispositional orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Section 778: \u201cAny parent or other person having an interest in a child who is a ward of the juvenile court or the child himself through a properly appointed guardian may, upon grounds of change of circumstance or new evidence, petition the court in the same action in which the child was found to be a ward of the juvenile court for a hearing to change, modify, or set aside any order of court previously made or to terminate the jurisdiction of the court. The petition shall be verified and, if made by a person other than the child, shall state the petitioner\u2019s relationship to or interest in the child and shall set forth in concise language any change of circumstance or new evidence which are alleged to require such change of order or termination of jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">\u201cIf it appears that the best interests of the child may be promoted by the proposed change of order or termination of jurisdiction, the court shall order that a hearing be held and shall give prior notice, or cause prior notice to be given, to such persons and by such means as prescribed by Sections 776 and 779, and, in such instances as the means of giving notice is not prescribed by such sections, then by such means as the court prescribes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Section 779 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe court committing a ward to the Youth Authority may thereafter change, modify, or set aside the order of commitment. Ten days\u2019 notice of the hearing of the application therefor shall be served by United States mail upon the Director of the Youth Authority. In changing, modifying, or setting aside such order of commitment, the court shall give due consideration to the effect thereof upon the discipline and parole system of the Youth Authority or of the correctional school in which the ward may have been placed by the Youth Authority. Except as in this section provided, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to interfere with the system of parole and discharge now or hereafter established by law, or by rule of the Youth Authority, for the parole and discharge of wards of the juvenile court committed to the Youth Authority, or with the management of any school, institution, or facility under the jurisdiction of the Youth Authority. Except as in this section provided, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to interfere with the system of transfer between institutions and facilities under the jurisdiction of the Youth Authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In this case, the judge expressly considered the effect of his order. He acknowledged that \u201ca court should not step in in case after case with the Youth Authority unless there is a serious reason for it.\u201d He concluded that under the proper circumstances, vacating an earlier commitment would not intrude on the Youth Authority\u2019s parole system or treatment plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\">It is also curious that the majority overlook section 1704, which provides that \u201c[n]othing in [the Youth Authority Act] shall be deemed to interfere with or limit the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d Under this provision, the Legislature\u2019s grant of discretion in parole matters to the Youth Authority (\u00a7\u00a7 1711.3, 1765, 1766) cannot be deemed to interfere with or limit the juvenile court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction over wards committed to the Youth Authority (\u00a7 607). Yet this is precisely what the majority do in holding that the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction to set aside a commitment order is limited to situations where the Youth Authority has abused its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The majority also quote out of context <em>Breed\u2019s </em>statement that \u201c[t]he Legislature has properly delegated to the Youth Authority the discretion to determine whether its facilities will be or are of benefit to the ward.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 785; maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 404.) The majority omit the statutory authority <em>Breed </em>cites for this proposition: sections 736 and 780. These statutes respectively describe (1) the kinds of persons whom the Youth Authority shall accept (\u00a7 736), and (2) the kinds of persons whom the Youth Authority may return to the committing court (\u00a7 780). Neither provision is involved in this case. Neither provision in any way limits section 779\u2019s grant of authority to juvenile courts to set aside an original order committing a minor to the Youth Authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Indeed, the court has a <em>duty </em>to terminate its jurisdiction when it becomes convinced on the evidence that the ward no longer requires the court\u2019s supervision. (See, e.g., <em>In re Francecisco </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 310, 314 [94 Cal.Rptr. 186].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
