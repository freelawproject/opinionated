We conclude that he may.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Preliminarily, we review certain provisions of sections 6500-6512 governing the commitment proceedings in issue. Section 6502 authorizes the verified petition for commitment be filed by the following: a parent, guardian, or other person charged with the support of the mentally retarded person, any district attorney or probation officer, the Youth Authority, any person so designated by the superior court in the county of the persons\u2019s residence, or by the Director of Corrections. Mentally retarded persons are defined as those nonpsychotic persons \u201cwho are so mentally retarded from infancy or before reaching maturity that they are incapable of managing themselves and their affairs, independently, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ordinary prudence, or of being taught to do so, and who require supervision, control, and care, for their own welfare or the welfare of others, or for the welfare of the community\u201d (\u00a7 6500). Only those mentally retarded persons who constitute a danger to themselves or others can be committed to the Department of Health and the commitment is for one year\u2019s duration subject to renewal by the same petition process (\u00a7 6500.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Upon the filing of such petition the matter is set for hearing. The alleged mentally retarded person must be notified of the hearing, and, if the petition is filed by a probation officer, district attorney, the Youth Authority, or the Director of Corrections, the person\u2019s parent or guardian also must be given such notice as is deemed proper by the court (\u00a7 6504). Counsel must be furnished unless the person has his own attorney (\u00a7 6500.1). At the hearing section 6507 directs the court to inquire into the \u201ccondition or status\u201d of the alleged mentally retarded person and authorizes the court to invoke its subpoena power to require the attendance of medical specialists who have \u201cmade a special study of mental retardation,\u201d a clinical psychologist and such other persons \u201cas it deems advisable, to give evidence.\u201d Finally, section 6509 governs placement procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Against this statutory background we trace appellant\u2019s history. Tyars was bom on February 12, 1957. At the time of the commitment proceedings under consideration he was almost 20 years old. Before 1965 he had lived with his mother in the Los Angeles area, and from 1965 to 1971 he was in a residential center in Ontario, California. In January 1971 Tyars was placed in the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County because of assaultive behavior against his family. Appellant has resided at Patton since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">On April 12, 1976, the District Attorney of San Bernardino County filed in the superior court of that county a petition for the commitment of appellant as a mentally retarded person pursuant to section 6502. The petition duly alleged the fact of Tyars\u2019 mental retardation and that he was a danger to himself or others. The court appointed a public defender to represent appellant and the matter was set for hearing. The court also granted appellant\u2019s request for trial by jury, required that any verdict be unanimous, allowed 13 peremptory challenges, and instmcted the jury that it must find in favor of Tyars unless convinced of the tmth of the essential allegations of the petition beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Two medical examiners at the hearing diagnosed Tyars\u2019 condition as mental retardation encephalopathy caused by a postnatal injury. The experts described further medical findings: that he suffered from seizures which were controlled by use of drugs such as dilantin, phenobarbital, and mysoline; that, depending on the measuring test used, Tyars\u2019 I.Q. \u2713 was between 48 and 57, well below the average range of 90-110; and that he was incapable of functioning in a community without supervision. The examiners concluded that his mental defect is permanent and that he is a danger to himself or others. Evidence further adduced at the hearing established that appellant lacks communication skills and has a physical \u2713problem, a speech impediment diagnosed as \u201cdysarthria,\u201d in which the muscles controlling speech do not permit the affected person to enunciate words clearly. A psychiatric technician at Patton State Hospital, describv\" ing appellant\u2019s assaultive behavior, testified that Tyars had often attacked other residents and staff members of the hospital, including the technician, using his fists, tables, cue balls, or cue sticks, causing personal injuries and property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">At the hearing and over the objections of his counsel appellant was called as a witness pursuant to Evidence Code section 776 which provides for the examination of an adverse party in any civil action. The \u2713 customary oath was not administered to him (he sat wherever it was comfortable for him in the courtroom) but the trial judge elicited a promise from him that he would tell the truth. The court expressly found <em>y </em>that Tyars, while incapable of understanding the oath, did understand the obligation to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Because of his speech handicap Tyars had difficulty in making himself understood. The trial court thereupon caused an \u201cinterpreter\u201d who was familiar with appellant\u2019s speech to be sworn to \u201ctranslate English into English,\u201d i.e., to make his answers intelligible. The court\u2019s questions posed to Tyars were not restated by the interpreter; moreover, Tyars\u2019 understandable words were not always the same as those repeated by the interpreter who would either summarize Tyars\u2019 answer or simply answer the court directly. In substance, Tyars admitted several acts of violence including the throwing of chairs, \u201cbreaking someone\u2019s head wide open,\u201d and striking a hospital technician; he also named victims of other assaults and batteries and illustrated his testimony by swinging his arms in descriptive punching motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">After 38 minutes of deliberations the jury returhed its verdict finding that appellant was a mentally retarded person who is a danger to himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>and others. The court thereafter ordered that he be committed to the Department of Health for placement in a state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Availability as a Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The principle issue raised by appellant is the propriety of calling him, over objections, as a witness in his own commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We stress, preliminarily, the two separate and distinct testimonial privileges here involved. In a <em>criminal </em>matter a defendant has an absolute right not to be called as a witness and not to testify. (Amend. V of the U.S. Const, and art. I, \u00a7 15, of the Cal. Const, as codified in Evid. Code, \u00a7 930.) Further, in any proceeding, <em>civil or criminal, </em>a witness has the right to decline to answer questions which may tend to incriminate him in criminal activity (Evid. Code, .\u00a7 940). However, as we shall develop more fully, notwithstanding these privileges, no witness has a privilege to refuse to reveal to the trier of fact his physical or mental characteristics where they are relevant to the issues under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Several features of the applicable statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 6500-6512) persuade us that commitment of mentally retarded persons must be deemed essentially civil in nature. The commitment is not initiated in response, or necessarily related, to any criminal acts; it is of limited duration, expiring at the end of one year and any new petition is subject to the same procedures as an original commitment (\u00a7 6500.1); the petitioner need not be a public prosecutor, but may be any parent or other person designated by the court (\u00a7 6502). The sole state interest, legislatively expressed, is the custodial care, diagnosis, treatment, and protection of persons who are unable to take care of themselves and who for their own well being and the safety of others cannot be left adrift in the community. The commitment may not reasonably be deemed punishment either in its design or purpose. It is not analogous to criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The predominantly civil character of the proceedings created by sections 6500-6512 establishes that appellant did not have an absolute right, as does a defendant in a criminal action, not to be called as a witness and not to testify. <em>(Black </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 676, 685 [103 Cal.Rptr. 288, 499 P.2d 968]; <em>In re Vaughan </em>(1922) 189 Cal. 491, 495-497 [209 P. 353, 24 A.L.R. 858]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whelchel </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 455, 460 [63 Cal.Rptr. 258].) As expressed by the highest authority, the historic purpose of the privilege against being called as a witness has been to assure that the <em>criminal </em>justice system remains accusatorial, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>inquisitorial. <em>(Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 1, 11 [12 L.Ed.2d 653, 661-662, 84 S.Ct. 1489]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Waterfront Comm\u2019n. </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 52, 55 [12 L.Ed.2d 678, 681-682, 84 S.Ct. 1594]; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1951) 341 U.S. 479, 485-486 [95 L.Ed. 1118, 1123-1124, 71 S.Ct. 814].) The extension of the privilege to an area outside the criminal justice system, in our view, would contravene both the language and purpose of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">It follows from the foregoing that while appellant could properly be called as a witness at his commitment proceeding, like any other individual in any proceeding, civil or criminal, he could not be required to give evidence which would tend to incriminate him in any criminal activity and which could subject him to criminal prosecution.  Referring to the sweeping nature of the privilege against self-incrimination, the United States Supreme Court has said: \u201c The privilege can be claimed in <em>any proceeding, </em>be it criminal or civil, administrative or judicial, investigatoiy or adjudicatory ... it protects <em>any disclosures </em>which the witness may reasonably apprehend <em>could be used in a criminal prosecution or which could lead to other evidence that might be so </em>used\u2019 [Fn. omitted.] (Italics added.)\u201d <em>(In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 47-48 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 557, 87 S.Ct. 1428], from conc. opn. by Justice White in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Waterfront Comm\u2019n., supra, </em>378 U.S. 52, 94 [12 L.Ed.2d 678, 704].) As we have noted previously, no mentally retarded person may be committed unless such person is a danger to himself or others (\u00a7 6500.1).  To the extent that the necessaiy elements of mental retardation and dangerousness may be established by evidence of criminal conduct, such evidence must, in its entirety, be elicited from sources other than the individual who is the subject of the commitment proceeding. In the matter before us the trial court, referring to Tyars, observed that \u201cThis is not a proceeding in which he could refuse to testify on the grounds that his testimony might tend to incriminate him.\u201d This was erron/Xs we have explained, appellant could clearly have refused to testify regarding any <em>criminal </em>conduct in which he might have engaged or about any other matter which would tend to implicate him in <em>criminal </em>activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Because appellant\u2019s counsel initially objected to Tyars testifying, we infer no waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination by counsel\u2019s failure to renew his initial self-incrimination objection in response to subsequent specific questions. In the light of the trial judge\u2019s clear expression of his position on the issue such repeated objections would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We are of the view, however, that the foregoing error does not require a reversal under these circumstances. There was overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s severe and irreversible mental retardation from both medical experts. The testimony of these two witnesses in conjunction with that of the psychiatric technician who, along with others, had been the object of appellant\u2019s repeated assaultive behavior established beyond question that he was a danger to himself and others. No contrary evidence was introduced. Given the weight and nature of the uncontradicted evidence supporting the allegations of the petition it is clear that any erroneous questioning of the appellant was harmless beyond all reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1966) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We conclude that, while appellant could not be questioned about matters that would tend to incriminate him, he was subject to call as a witness and could be required to respond to nonincriminatoiy questioning which may have revealed his mental condition to the jury, whose duty it was to determine whether he was mentally retarded. Reason and common sense suggest that it is appropriate under such circumstances that a jury be permitted fully to observe the person sought to be committed, and to hear him speak and respond in order that it may make an informed judgment as to the level of his mental and intellectual functioning. The receipt of such evidence may be analogized to the disclosure of physical as opposed to testimonial evidence and may in fact be the most reliable proof and probative indicator of the person\u2019s present mental condition. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ellis </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 529, 533-534 [55 Cal.Rptr. 385, 421 P.2d 393] [voice identification not within the privilege against self-incrimination]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 510 [52 Cal.Rptr. 475] [handwriting identification not within the privilege against self-incrimination].) Similarly, a defendant even in a criminal proceeding may be required to give \u201creal or physical\u201d evidence in contrast to \u201ccommunications or testimony\u201d in the sense of disclosing knowledge. Thus the criminal defendant may be asked to stand, wear clothing, hold items, or speak words. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra, </em>at pp. 533-534; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 544, 552 [134 Cal.Rptr. 566].) It was proper for the jury to have the benefit of its own observations of Tyars\u2019 responses, both in manner and content, to the court\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Appellant Tyars\u2019 remaining contentions necessitate only brief comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Capacity as a Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Appellant now argues that he was incompetent to be a witness because of mental incapacity. His counsel, however, made no objection as to his competency as a witness at any time during the hearing and the objection must therefore be deemed waived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berry </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 649, 652-653 [67 Cal.Rptr. 312].)  Nor do we find merit in appellant\u2019s claim that his speech handicap necessarily made him an incompetent witness. As previously noted, a ward attendant who was very familiar with appellant\u2019s speech served as an \u201cinterpreter\u201d and there was no contention made at the hearing that this arrangement was unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Appellant challenges the jurisdiction of the San Bernardino County Superior Court on the basis that, although Tyars has been hospitalized at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County since 1971, his parents \u201creside\u201d in Los Angeles County. The controlling section, 6502, provides that \u201cA petition for the commitment of a mentally retarded person to the State Department of Health . . . may be filed in the superior court of the county in which such person resides . . . .\u201d The term \u201cresides\u201d has received differing interpretations depending on the context and purpose of the statute in which it appears. (See <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 430, 434-435 [78 Cal.Rptr. 260].) The inquiry into the degree of mental retardation and dangerousness mandated by section 6507 strongly suggests that periodically, perhaps annually, treating physicians and other witnesses must be produced in court in order to testify as to the present mental condition and potential danger from the subject, who also should be present during such inquiry. Under such circumstances, to define \u201cthe county in which such person resides\u201d as other than that .in which he is hospitalized would seem to be both untenable and impractical. Furthermore, the interpretation which we herein indulge seems consistent with legislative intent, recently expressed in Health and Safety Code section 38450, that a habeas corpus hearing be held in the county of hospitalization for review and release of all admitted or committed developmental^ disabled. In this connection, similar considerations of convenience and economy suggest a like result for those who may be mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Placement Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Appellant contends that immediately following the jury\u2019s finding that he was mentally retarded and a danger to himself or others the court should have held a hearing to determine the least restrictive placement facility in which appellant could be placed. Such a hearing is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Section 6509 provides that \u201c[i]f the court finds that the person is mentally retarded . . . the court may make an order that the person be committed to the State Department of Health for hospitalization.\u201d Appellant contends that use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in section 6509 renders the provisions of that section permissive, thus requiring that the availability of alternate placements be considered by the court. This interpretation is incorrect. No statutory power is given to the court to do other than to commit the dangerous mentally retarded person to the Department of Health for hospitalization. Such an interpretation is consistent with section 6502 which requires that the petition filed under section 6500 shall seek a commitment to \u201cstate hospital.\u201d The Legislature did not vest the courts with the power to determine the precise institutional placement that should be made. Courts are ill-suited for this task which is more properly the function of an appropriate medical administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Appellant nonetheless contends that because former Health and Safety Code section 38009.2, now Welfare and Institutions Code section 6513, provides for placement in the least restrictive residential facility in the case of <em>developmentally disabled </em>persons who are subjects of civil commitment proceedings, equal protection principles therefore mandate that we read into section 6509 such a provision for \u201cleast restrictive\u201d placement in the case of a dangerous mentally retarded person.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We conclude, however, that there is a rational basis for the distinction made by the Legislature between the placement procedures to be followed in regard to these two classes of individuals. The Legislature has determined that in the case of the <em>dangerous </em>mentally retarded person the only suitable treatment is confinement in a state hospital. A similar result does not necessarily follow in the case of the developmentally disabled person because no finding of dangerousness is required for commitment of the latter. Assuming, for purposes of discussion, that a strict scrutiny test is the proper equal protection standard to be applied in the instant case because of the liberty interest involved, there exists a clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>compelling state interest in the classification in issue. By very definition, in the case of the dangerous mentally retarded person, the state has a strong interest in protecting the general public, other patients, and the institutional personnel, from physical harm. Hospitalization in a state hospital serves to guarantee such protection, providing as it does the requisite trained assistants to restrain those who may become violent. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s equal protection argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Dangerousness as Affected by Medication</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the jury should have been allowed to consider his condition under medication in making its determination whether he was dangerous and that an instruction to the jury to this effect was improperly refused. The proposed instruction read, \u201cIn determining whether Luther Tyars is a danger to himself or others you may take into account improvement due to medication if it is likely that in the foreseeable future Luther Tyars would be provided with and take needed medication.\u201d In seeking such an instruction, appellant\u2019s counsel exceeded review of appellant\u2019s current mental condition and potential for dangerous behavior and invited consideration of possible future behavior under hypothetical conditions. The pertinent issue under section 6507 is the present \u201ccondition or status\u201d of the alleged mentally retarded person. The Legislature has not elected to authorize consideration of the factors of medication, or future changes in the patient\u2019s condition. The proposed instruction was, accordingly, properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Tobriner, J., Mosic, J., Clark, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b134-8\">BIRD, C J\u201e5 Dissenting.\u2014The</author>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">authors of the Bill of Rights understood that the common law privilege against self-incrimination was the product of an historic struggle to free individuals from the oppression of government and the secret interrogations of the Star Chamber. Recognizing the privilege\u2019s central place in our system of liberty, the framers secured it in the firm constitutional footing of the Fifth Amendment. Since that time, the privilege has been accorded a broad and generous construction in keeping with its station as \u201cthe mainstay of our adversary system.\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 460, 461 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 715-716, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]; see, e.g., <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 50 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 558-559, 87 S.Ct. 1428]; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1886) 116 U.S. 616, 633-635 [29 L.Ed. 746, 752-753, 6 S.Ct. 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Today\u2019s decision departs from that established principle by applying the privilege in a rigid and grudging way. The majority treat the privilege as an historical relic, not as a living legacy capable of adjusting its scope to the demands of modern experience. In the process, the majority revert to a mode of analysis which has been repeatedly rejected as a method of determining the safeguards which must apply in commitment proceedings. I respectfully dissent from this reasoning and from a result which degrades the constitutional rights of mentally retarded persons threatened with a loss of their liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">A brief elaboration of the pertinent facts is in order. Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 6500.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district attorney of San Bernardino County initiated commitment proceedings against appellant who was alleged to be a dangerous mentally retarded person. Over appellant\u2019s objections, the judge ruled that appellant could not refuse either (1) to be a witness in the proceeding or (2) to give testimony which might incriminate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Appellant was called as a witness and the judge asked him whether he had been involved in any fights. Apparently unaware of the consequences to himself, appellant dramatized his affirmative reply by swinging his fists like a fighter and by uttering emphatic \u201cpows\u201d in a child-like effort to simulate the sound of his fists making contact. All of this occurred in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">As the majority note, because of a speech defect, appellant\u2019s testimony was \u201cinterpreted\u201d by a hospital attendant. However, the majority fail to point out that this \u201cinterpreter\u201d was also the prosecutor\u2019s main witness <em>against </em>appellant on the issue of his dangerousness. Thus, an adverse witness was allowed to \u201cinterpret\u201d appellant\u2019s testimony, even though the \u201cinterpretations\u201d sometimes differed from appellant\u2019s understandable words and the \u201cinterpreter\u201d sometimes answered the court\u2019s questions directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The prosecutor presented three witnesses. One was a physician who had interviewed appellant for one-half hour. Another was a clinical psychologist whose personal contact with appellant was limited to the administration of intelligence quotient tests. Only the hospital attendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>who had served as appellant\u2019s \u201cinterpreter\u201d could testify from personal knowledge to any aggressive conduct by appellant. All of the acts which the attendant described occurred while appellant was confined in a state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">After a brief deliberation, the juiy returned a verdict finding appellant to be a dangerous mentally retarded person.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The Fifth Amendment declares unequivocally that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d The same guarantee is enshrined in article I, section 15 of the California Constitution. These provisions confer to <em>any witness </em>the privilege not to give answers which might incriminate him. (E.g., <em>Black </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 676, 685 [103 Cal.Rptr. 288, 499 P.2d 968].) They also accord <em>the defendant </em>in a \u201ccriminal case\u201d the right not to testify at all. (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">This right not to testily serves at least two important functions. It protects the defendant, who is often unschooled in the law, from being called to the witness stand where he might inadvertently waive his privilege against self-incrimination by giving testimony which bears on an element of the crime. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Schader </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 761, 770 [80 Cal.Rptr. 1, 457 P.2d 841].) Further, by granting this broad right to silence, our system acknowledges the prejudicial inference of guilt -commonly drawn from an assertion of Fifth Amendment rights. It is fundamentally unfair to require a person to become a witness and be forced to invoke his right to silence in front of the jury in whose hands his liberty lies. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Talle </em>(1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 650, 661-662, 667-668 [245 P.2d 633].)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">It has long been established that the right not to be called as a witness is not limited to defendants in ordinary criminal prosecutions. <em>(In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at pp. 49-50 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 558-559]; <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1895) 107 Cal. 285, 288-290 [40 P. 435]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>U.S. Coin &amp; Currency </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 715, 718 [28 L.Ed.2d 434, 437, 91 S.Ct. 1041].) The right also extends to proceedings which, though civil in name, threaten a person with the loss of his liberty. <em>(In re Gault, supra; </em>see <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Director, Patuxent Institution </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 245, 257 [32 L.Ed.2d 719, 727, 92 S.Ct. 2083] (cone. opn. of Douglas, J.); cf. <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 365-366, 368 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375-376, 377-378, 90 S.Ct. 1068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In <em>Gault, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that a juvenile court judge may not elicit incriminating testimony from a minor without first advising him of his right not to testify. (387 U.S. at pp. 43-44, 49-50 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 554-556, 558-559].) The court\u2019s rationale was explicit: \u201c[Commitment] is incarceration against one\u2019s will, whether it is called \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 And our Constitution guarantees that no person shall be \u2018compelled\u2019 to be a witness against himself <em>when he is threatened with deprivation of his liberty </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 50 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 558-559], italics added; see also McCormick on Evidence (Cleary ed. 1972) \u00a7 121, p. 259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Thus, <em>Gault </em>teaches that the <em>actual consequences, </em>not the label, of a proceeding determine whether fundamental rights are constitutionally mandated in that proceeding. Three years after <em>Gault, </em>this lesson was reaffirmed when the Supreme Court held that juveniles in delinquency hearings are constitutionally entitled to be judged by the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 368 [25 L.Ed.2d at pp. 377-378].) \u201cWe made clear in <em>[Gault] </em>that civil labels and good intentions do not themselves obviate the need for criminal due process safeguards . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 365-366 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 376].) The court decided that such safeguards <em>were </em>needed because an adverse determination could deprive a minor of both his liberty and his good name. <em>(Id, </em>at p. 367 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">This court has also held that persons subject to involuntary commitment proceedings have a right to the protections afforded to ordinary criminal defendants. Thus, individuals whom the state seeks to confine as mentally disordered sex offenders (\u00a7 6300 et seq.) or as narcotics addicts (\u00a7 3000 et seq.) are constitutionally entitled to the safeguards of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous jury verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnick </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 306, 322 [121 Cal.Rptr. 488, 535 P.2d 352]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 351-352 [121 Cal.Rptr. 509, 535 P.2d 373]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 641, 644 [139 Cal.Rptr. 594, 566 P.2d 228].) These holdings flowed from the logic of <em>Winship: </em>the protections afforded to the usual criminal defendant were required in commitment proceedings because these defendants also stood to lose their liberty and their good names. <em>(Burnick, supra, </em>at pp. 318-322; <em>Feagley, supra, </em>atp. 347; <em>Thomas, supra, </em>atpp. 638-641, 644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The reasoning of <em>Burnick, Feagley </em>and <em>Thomas </em>applies equally to the present case because appellant faces equivalent consequences. Commitment to a mental hospital entails a \u201cmassive curtailment of liberty\u201d and a comparable loss of reputation. <em>(Humphrey </em>v. <em>Cady </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 504, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>509 [31 L.Ed.2d 394, 402-403, 92 S.Ct. 1048]; <em>In re Roger S. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 921, 928-929 [141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 569 P.2d 1286].) Indeed, the threat of losing one\u2019s freedom is far more certain for individuals in appellant\u2019s position than for the minors in <em>Gault </em>and <em>Winship. </em>A juvenile found to be a delinquent may or may not be committed to an institution. (\u00a7\u00a7 727, 731.) In contrast, a dangerous mentally retarded person <em>must </em>be committed to a state hospital. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 141.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Similarly, an adjudication that one is dangerous and mentally retarded creates a greater stigma than an adjudication of delinquency. As this court pointed out in <em>Burnick, </em>juvenile offenses are often discounted or forgiven as the product of a passing phase of youth. (14 Cal.3d at p. 322.) The same cannot be said for individuals found to be dangerous and mentally retarded. This court\u2019s frank recognition in <em>Burnick </em>of the social disgrace that often attaches to mental illness is equally applicable to the mentally retarded. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 321.) When an official determination of dangerousness is added, \u201cthe shame is complete.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Thus, appellant faced the same consequences as those at stake in <em>Burnick, Feagley </em>and Thomas\u2014incarceration and social stigma. The logic of those cases compels the conclusion that defendants in section 6500 proceedings are also entitled to the protections of criminal due process. The right not to testify is at least as fundamental a safeguard as proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous jury verdict. (Compare <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at pp. 43-50 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 554-559] with <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 368 [25 L.Ed.2d at pp. 377-378] and <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 528, 545 [29 L.Ed.2d 647, 660-661, 91 S.Ct. 1976].) It follows that appellant should not have been called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The majority\u2019s analysis of the consequences to appellant of an adverse determination is wholly inadequate. The majority find it significant that confinement under section 6500.1 is only for one year. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 137.) However, it would be startling to assert that defendants in misdemeanor cases may be compelled to testify because their potential incarceration is also \u201cof limited duration,\u201d in most cases a maximum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>only six months. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 19.) In addition, the majority fail to properly emphasize that commitments under section 6500.1 may be renewed. Thus, to characterize the confinement as \u201cof limited duration\u201d ignores this court\u2019s description of renewable commitments in an analogous context: \u201cThe theoretical maximum period of detention is <em>life </em>as successive petitions may be filed . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Gary W. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 296, 300 [96 Cal.Rptr. 1, 486 P.2d 1201], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Further, the majority identify the aims of confinement in this case as treatment and protection, not punishment. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 137.) However, benevolent objectives\u2014which may or may not reflect reality in our state hospitals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2014will not substitute for criminal safeguards in proceedings where liberty is at stake. <em>(In re </em>Winship, <em>supra, </em>397 U.S. at p. 365 [25 L.Ed.2d at pp. 375-376]; <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. at pp. 27-28 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 545-547].) The critical fact is the potential for involuntary confinement. It does not matter that the confinement \u201cis designed not so much as retribution as it is to keep individuals from inflicting future harm.\u201d <em>(Specht </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 605, 608-609 [18 L.Ed.2d 326, 329-330, 87 S.Ct. 1209]; see Note (1970) 83 Harv.L.Rev. 648, 663.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The majority\u2019s failure to confront the actual consequences of section 6500 proceedings is evident in their reliance on attorney discipline cases as authority for the unavailability of the \u201cdefendant\u2019s privilege\u201d here. (E.g., <em>Black </em>v. <em>State Bar, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 676.) In <em>Black, </em>this court carefully distinguished <em>Gault. </em>\u201cDisciplinary proceedings, however, unlike juvenile proceedings, <em>cannot result in incarceration </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 688, italics added.) In contrast, commitment proceedings <em>do </em>result in incarceration. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 638.) Attorney discipline cases are not sound authority for the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Whelchel </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 455, 460 [63 Cal.Rptr. 258], is equally unsatisfactory. In <em>Whelchel, </em>the Court of Appeal reasoned that proceedings to commit narcotics addicts are \u201ccivil in nature\u201d and do not result in \u201cpenal\u201d confinement. <em>(Id, </em>at pp. 460-461.) That analysis was categorically rejected by this court in <em>Thomas. </em>(19 Cal.3d at pp. 637-638.) The majority fail to explain the contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Instead, they summarily assert that application of the \u201cdefendant\u2019s privilege\u201d to commitment proceedings would contravene the language and purpose of the privilege. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 138.) In support, the majority state that the traditional purpose of the right not to testify \u201chas been to assure that the <em>criminal </em>justice system remains accusatorial. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 137, italics original.) That statement simply begs the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The values and policies underlying the guarantee against testimonial compulsion are as operative in a commitment proceeding as in an ordinary criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cNot only is the \u2018public interest\u2019 present and aligned against the subject, but it actively participates in the imposition of liability. This creates the veiy situation in which the privilege was designed to operate.\u201d (McCormick on Evidence, <em>supra, </em>pp. 258-259.) It is curious that the court\u2019s respect for \u201cthe inviolability of the human personality\u201d is not offended by a proceeding in which the state is excused from having to produce the evidence against a retarded person by its own labors, and is allowed to employ \u201cthe cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 460 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 715].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The majority argue that it is permissible to compel evidence from appellant\u2019s mouth for the \u201cnontestimonial\u201d purpose of showing his mental state, just as it is permissible to compel voice exemplars. This analogy fails.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Today\u2019s holding exposes defendants in section 6500 proceedings to potentially incriminating questions. When such questions arise, these defendants will be forced either to invoke their privilege against self-incrimination in front of the juiy which is judging them, or to make incriminating admissions, deliberately or unwittingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">No one familiar with the popular meaning of the term \u201ctaking the Fifth\u201d can doubt the prejudicial impact of the first alternative. No one familiar with the mentally retarded can doubt that the risk of inadvertent admissions is greater for them than for other defendants. Thus, today\u2019s decision places persons subject to potentially lifelong commitment under section 6500 in a dilemma even more cruel than that in which we refuse to place mentally competent defendants in ordinary prosecutions for crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">There is no compelling reason to subject persons like appellant to the serious dilemma which the \u201cdefendant\u2019s privilege\u201d was meant to avoid. Requiring defendants to testify in these proceedings is unnecessary either to insure their treatment or to protect the public. To be committed under section 6500, a person must have been \u201cmentally retarded from infancy or before reaching maturity . . . .\u201d For persons who fit this description, there are sure to be numerous witnesses available to testify on the issue of retardation. Reliance on such witnesses is a perfectly sufficient and less intrusive means of fulfilling the statutory purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Appellant should not have been compelled to be a witness against himself at a proceeding designed to deprive him of his freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">While holding that appellant could not refuse to testify altogether, the majority recognize that he did have a right not to incriminate himself, once he was called as a witness. The trial judge violated this right by requiring appellant to answer all questions. Yet the majority dismiss this error, which led to appellant's dramatic <em>and </em>damaging <em>testimony, as </em>\u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The actual standard for measuring the harm caused by federal constitutional error is whether the benefiting party can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 23-24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McClary </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 218, 230 [142 Cal.Rptr. 163, 571 P.2d 620].) In <em>Chapman, </em>the Supreme Court expressed concern that in finding constitutional errors harmless, California courts might be giving too much emphasis to what they considered \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d in support of the verdict. (386 U.S. at p. 23 [17 L.Ed.2d at p. 710].) The Supreme Court sought to correct this problem by focusing the inquiry on whether the error may have contributed to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In the present case, respondent simply cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in compelling appellant\u2019s incriminating testimony did not contribute to his being found a dangerous mentally retarded person. It is difficult to imagine an error leading to <em>more </em>harmful testimony. The assaults which appellant said he had committed showed his dangerousness. His child-like dramatizations of those assaults, complete with sound effects, demonstrated his retardation. In effect, appellant was compelled to give testimony which proved both elements of the district attorney\u2019s case. It simply cannot be said to a moral certainty that appellant\u2019s performance did not contribute to the verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Unless otherwise specified, all statutory references hereinafter are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Today\u2019s decision holds that under section 6509, a trial judge has no choice but to commit dangerous mentally retarded persons to state hospitals. This ruling is contrary to legislative intent. Section 6509 provides that the trial court \u201cmay\u201d commit these persons to a state hospital. It is an extraordinary construction which transforms the permissive \u201cmay\u201d into the mandatory \u201cshall.\u201d The fact that the commitment petition under section 6502 seeks placement in a state hospital does not justify the removal from the trial court of all discretion to order a more suitable disposition if one is available in a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\"> \u201cAll too often the \u2018promise of treatment has served only to bring an illusion of benevolence to what is essentially a warehousing operation for social misfits.\u2019 [Citation.]\u2019\u2019 <em>(United States </em>ex rel. <em>Stachulak </em>v. <em>Coughlin </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 520 F.2d 931, 936; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at pp. 319-320.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In addition to the \u201climited duration\u201d and \u201cnonpunitive\u201d nature of confinement under section 6509, the majority cite two other features as evidence of the noncriminal character of these proceedings for Fifth Amendment purposes. The majority emphasize that commitment is not <em>necessarily </em>related to criminal acts or initiated by a public prosecutor. In this case, commitment <em>was </em>in fact related to criminal acts and initiated by a prosecutor. Although the majority\u2019s statement is theoretically accurate, it is not dispositive of appellant\u2019s right not to testify. In <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>107 Cal. 285, a <em>private individual </em>brought a statutory action to remove a public official from office. Under the statute, removal was not necessarily related to criminal acts, since neglect of duty (as well as ordinary criminal conduct) was actionable. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 287.) Yet neither of these features of the action deterred the court from holding that defendant Clark had been improperly required to be a witness in the removal action against him. Thus, the majority\u2019s analysis of the \u201ccivil\u201d nature of section 6500 proceedings, premised on four \u201ccivil\u201d features of the action, fails on its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"A6l\">The majority also fail to emphasize that the state itself has recognized the serious consequences of these proceedings by affording indigent defendants a right to appointed counsel. (\u00a7 6500.1.) Indigent civil defendants ordinarily have no such right. <em>(Hunt </em>v. <em>Hackett </em>(1973) 36 CaI.App.3d 134, 138 [111 Cal.Rptr. 456].) In addition, the trial court properly held that appellant was entitled to be proven dangerous and mentally retarded by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of a unanimous jury. Finally, appellant received a free transcript on appeal, a right ordinarily reserved for criminal defendants. (See <em>Gordiana </em>v. <em>Small Claims Court </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 412, 424 [130 CaLRptr. 675].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">It is well known, after all, that some governments have resorted to civil commitment as a means of silencing individuals who dissent, in the same way the criminal justice system was used in Lilburne\u2019s day to accomplish the same end. The Fifth Amendment is directly traceable to such abuses. (See generally, Levy, Origins of the Fifth Amendment (1971) ch. 9.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\">I agree with the courts which have rejected the view that statements elicited from a defendant to determine his mental state are analogous to blood tests or voice identifications. (E.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pomponi </em>(1971) 447 Pa. 154, 159 [284 A.2d 708, 710]; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>County Court of Erie County </em>(1970) 27 N.Y.2d 432, 439 [318 N.Y.S.2d 705, 267 N.E.2d 452,456].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Further, today\u2019s ruling creates a substantial risk that unreliable testimony will be placed before the jury. If the defendant is in fact retarded, he is unlikely to comprehend either the nature of the proceedings or the consequences to himself. Such a person lacks a self-protective sense that would keep him from exaggerating his actions in order to convey an image of being \u201ctough.\u201d Thus, in determining the defendant\u2019s dangerousness, a jury might be easily misled by unsolicited statements made more out of false bravado than out of an obligation to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">The present case illustrates the potential dangers since the jury may well have been influenced by appellant\u2019s courtroom effort to demonstrate his prowess as a fighter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b142-8\">NEWMAN, X, Dissenting.\u2014I</author>\n<p id=\"AzP\">concur in the dissent of the Chief Justice except to the extent it may imply that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege is identical to that set forth in article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.
