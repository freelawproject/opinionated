J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">Appellant, Joseph Glenn Pope, appeals from his conviction for second degree robbery. His sole contention is that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Late in the evening of February 24, 1976, Herman E. Brower was robbed in a parking lot outside a bar in Cotati. Brower had just left the Trade Winds bar where he had been drinking. Brower testified that he had paid for a drink with a $20 bill and that a black man, with whom Brower had been chatting, had picked up the change and put it in his pocket. This man suggested that they go out for dinner and started to leave. Brower followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Once outside the bar, Brower heard footsteps behind him. The black man said to Brower, \u201cHe\u2019s coming with us.\u201d The next thing Brower remembered was being shoved to the ground by the black man, who then held Brower\u2019s legs for a white man, who removed Brower\u2019s wallet. Although intoxicated at the time of the robbery, Brower later identified appellant from a photographic lineup as his black assailant. Brower could not identify appellant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The day after the robbery, Cotati police arrested appellant and seized a wallet which contained $56.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the stationhouse, appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, with an additional admonition by the police: \u201cFurther, you have the right to make any statement you wish which might clarify or explain your position in this matter.\u201d Appellant stated that he understood his rights and signed a waiver form.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">After initially denying that he had even spoken to Brower at the Trade Winds bar, appellant changed his story several times, each time admitting a greater degree of involvement as the police confronted him with additional pieces of information. Ultimately, after tying to \u201cmake a deal,\u201d appellant told police he had witnessed the robbery which he said was committed by two white men and a black. Although the two white men, Harbin and Stoker, became police suspects in the robbeiy, it appears that only appellant was charged with the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Two and one-half months before trial, the Sonoma County Public Defender was appointed to represent appellant. However, it was not until four working days before trial that the ofiice assigned a deputy public defender to try the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Before trial, the court appointed a psychiatrist to assist in appellant\u2019s defense. Although the augmented record on appeal does not include the psychiatrist\u2019s report, the record does contain two previous psychological evaluations which showed that appellant\u2019s mental capabilities were limited. These reports, written in 1973 and 1975, placed appellant\u2019s intelligence in the \u201cborderline defective\u201d category of retardation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>doctors who examined appellant stated that he \u201cfunction[ed] intellectually like a child\u201d; that he could not make change or drive a car; that he was gullible and suggestible; that instructions to him must be couched in \u201csimple, concrete terms\u201d; and that he had a \u201cpoor tolerance for ambiguity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">No evidence as to appellant\u2019s limited intelligence was introduced at trial or used before trial to challenge the admissibility of appellant\u2019s out-of-court statements to police. The sole defense presented by appellant\u2019s counsel was that the robbery was committed by the two other suspects, Harbin and Stoker. There was testimony that the two men were troublemakers and that they had followed appellant and the victim out of the bar on the night of the robbery. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not seek to subpoena Harbin and Stoker before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In cross-examining a police officer, appellant\u2019s counsel sought to elicit extrajudicial statements made by one suspect to the other. The officer had overheard Harbin tell Stoker that \u201cwe were seen leaving the Trade Winds [but the police] haven\u2019t got any evidence and we don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d The prosecutor objected on the grounds that such hearsay could not be admitted unless counsel made a showing that the declarant was unavailable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Trial was adjourned to give defense counsel an opportunity to subpoena Harbin and Stoker.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">On the following day, the deputy public defender produced Harbin and called him as a witness. On advice of a newly appointed private counsel, Harbin invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stoker, on the other hand, was not located and the prosecution questioned whether the public defender\u2019s office had exercised \u201creasonable diligence\u201d in seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>to procure Stoker\u2019s attendance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel acknowledged that the only efforts to obtain Stoker\u2019s presence at trial had been made by telephone. When the court asked if counsel had reached Stoker, counsel responded: \u201cNo, your Honor, we were unable to. We did attempt to contact him last week. This case was actually assigned to an attorney on Tuesday. That particular attorney, being myself, was in hearing on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, so the calls were made in the late afternoon, when he was apparently still at work, but those messages were not returned.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Counsel also offered an explanation as to why the calls were not returned: \u201cUnfortunately, you see, Harbin\u2019s a client of ours, and he knows we are representing Pope, and he is not answering the phone calls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The court accepted the deputy public defender\u2019s explanation and held that there had been due diligence in seeking to secure Stoker\u2019s presence. Later, Harbin\u2019s extrajudicial statement to Stoker was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In closing argument, defense counsel argued that the only direct evidence of appellant\u2019s participation in the robbery was the identification by the victim, who had been drinking on the night of the incident. At one point, counsel sought to minimize the significance of appellant\u2019s inconsistent statements to the police, suggesting that the inconsistency resulted from appellant\u2019s limited mental capacity. However, the court ordered her to discontinue that line of argument since no evidence had been introduced on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The jury found appellant guilty of second degree robbery. Following a diagnostic study and recommendation by the Department of Corrections, appellant was sentenced to state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">This court must determine whether appellant\u2019s legal representation at trial was inadequate. Two basic grounds are advanced by appellant: (1) the failure by counsel to make use of the record of appellant\u2019s limited intelligence; and (2) her failure to interview or subpoena the two other suspects, Harbin and Stoker, before trial commenced. In order to assess the adequacy of the legal assistance appellant received, this court must determine the proper standard by which trial counsel\u2019s performance is to be measured.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487], this court articulated a strict standard to measure the constitutional right to \u201c \u2018effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case.\u2019 <em>(Powell </em>v. <em>State of Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 71 [53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 157, 171-172, 84 A.L.R. 527, 541].)\u201d In order to obtain relief on appeal, \u201c[i]t must appear that counsel\u2019s lack of diligence or competence reduced the trial to a \u2018farce or a sham.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d at p. 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In several cases, this court has moved away from the \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard. For example, some decisions of this court have held that a defendant is entitled to counsel \u201c \u2018reasonably likely to render, <em>and rendering </em>reasonably effective assistance.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Saunders </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1033, 1041 [88 Cal.Rptr. 633, 472 P.2d 921], original italics; <em>In re Williams </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 168, 176 [81 Cal.Rptr. 784, 460 P.2d 984].) Other decisions employ the alternative test of whether counsel \u201ceffectively supplied] to a defendant those skills and legal knowledge which we can reasonably expect from any member of the bar.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 663, 672-673 [119 Cal.Rptr. 500, 532 P.2d 148]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Steger </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 539, 551 [128 Cal.Rptr. 161, 546 P.2d 665, 83 A.L.R.3d 1206]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Camden </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 808, 815 [129 Cal.Rptr. 438, 548 P.2d 1110].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Insofar as it survives, the \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard (or its alter ego, the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d. standard) has been widely criticized by legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>scholars. (See generally, e.g., Bazelon, <em>The Defective Assistance of Counsel </em>(1973) 42 U.Cin. L.Rev. 1, 28; Finer, <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel </em>(1973) 58 Cornell L.Rev. 1077, 1078-1081; Note, <em>Ineffective Representation as a Basis for Relieffrom Conviction: Principles for Appellate Review </em>(1977) 13 Colum. J. L. &amp; Soc. Prob. 1, 32-37.) A growing number of other jurisdictions have repudiated it outright. (E.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>United States </em>(3d Cir. 1970) 432 F.2d 730, 737 (en banc); <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Twomey </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 510 F.2d 634, 641; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harper </em>(1973) 57 Wis.2d 543, 552, 557 [205 N.W.2d 1, 6, 9]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1976) 398 Mich. 250, 266 [247 N.W.2d 547, 553].) Significant among these jurisdictions is the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the very court which enunciated the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d rule in the first instance. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeCoster </em>(D.C. Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 1197, 1201-1202; <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>United States </em>(6th Cir. 1974) 491 F.2d 687, 693-694.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The reasons set forth by these courts and commentators for replacing the \u201cfarce or sham\u201d standard are compelling. The standard originated in decisions which held that the right to competent representation derived solely from the due process clause of the Constitution and not from the provision guaranteeing the right to the assistance of counsel. <em>(Diggs </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(D.C. Cir. 1945) 148 F.2d 667, 668-669; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Huff </em>(D.C. Cir. 1945) 152 F.2d 14, 15.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\n                   This view has been thoroughly discredited, for courts now recognize that the right to competent representation at trial is grounded in the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. (See <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 759, 771, fn. 14 [25 L.Ed.2d 763, 773, 90 S.Ct. 1443].) Accordingly, constitutionally adequate assistance can no longer be measured by the due process standard of <em>Ibarra, </em>but instead must be determined by a standard bottomed on the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See generally, Comment, <em>The Right to Competent Defense Counsel: Emergence of a Sixth Amendment Standard of Review on Appeal and the Persistence of the \u201cSham and Farce\u201d Rule in California, supra, </em>15 Santa Clara Law. 355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The constitutional right to the adequate assistance of counsel suggests a focus on the quality of the representation provided the accused, while due process concerns itself with the fairness of the trial as a whole. \u201cOne may receive ineffective assistance of counsel even though the proceedings have not been a farce or mockery. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Herring </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1974) 491 F.2d 125, 128.) Indeed, a substantial portion of the obligation counsel owes is not directly connected with the trial but involves investigation and advice at pretrial and posttrial stages. (See generally, ABA Project on Standards for Crim. Justice, Stds. Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function (Approved Draft 1971) pp. 147-148, 225-228.) Thus, neither the Sixth Amendment nor article I, section 15 is satisfied by a standard which requires the trial to have been reduced to a farce or sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Further, the <em>Ibarra </em>standard is vague and subjective. As described by one federal court of appeals, \u201cThe phrase \u2018farce and mockery\u2019 has no obvious intrinsic meaning. What may appear a \u2018farce\u2019 to one court may seem a humdrum proceeding to another. The meaning of the Sixth Amendment does not, of course, vary with the sensibilities and subjective judgments of various courts. The law demands objective explanation, so as to ensure the even dispensation of justice.\u201d <em>(Beasley </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>491 F.2d at p. 692.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>397 U.S. at page 771 [25 L.Ed.2d at p. 773], the United States Supreme Court set forth a more objective standard for testing the adequacy of counsel\u2019s representation. The court stated that defense counsel\u2019s pretrial advice must be \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d (Accord, <em>Tollett </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 258, 264 [36 L.Ed.2d 235, 241-242, 93 S.Ct. 1602],) Following <em>McMann, </em>the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that <em>\u201ca defendant is entitled to the reasonably competent assistance of an attorney acting as his diligent conscientious advocate.\u201d (United States </em>v. <em>DeCoster, supra, </em>487 F.2d at p. 1202, italics original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The <em>DeCoster </em>rule expresses counsel\u2019s duty to act as \u201can active advocate in behalf of his client\u201d <em>(Anders </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 738, 744 [18 L.Ed.2d 493, 498, 87 S.Ct. 1396]), while testing counsel\u2019s actions by the familiar and objective standard of the ordinarily prudent lawyer. (Cf. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 349, 358-359 [118 Cal.Rptr. 621, 530 P.2d 589, 78 A.L.R.3d 231] [attorney\u2019s civil liability for malpractice measured by standard of reasonableness].) The chief virtue of this standard lies in its ability to uphold the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment and article I, section 15. Since the state is constitutionally required to provide indigent defendants with counsel <em>(Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 335 [9 L.Ed.2d 799, 83 S.Ct. 792, 93 A.L.R.2d 733]; see <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 323, 332 [115 Cal.Rptr. 632, 525 P.2d 72, 71 A.L.R.3d 551]), a conviction may not be upheld if the state has furnished an indigent with representation of lower quality than that of a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent, conscientious advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In addition, the standard of reasonably competent representation affords a measurable guide for evaluating the quality of trial counsel\u2019s decisionmaking.  \u201cDefense strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law would not consider competent deny a criminal defendant the effective assistance of counsel, if some other action would have better protected a defendant and was reasonably foreseeable as such before trial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Beasley </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>491 F.2d at p. 696.) Reviewing courts should avoid second-guessing counsel\u2019s informed choice among tactical alternatives, but a defense attorney\u2019s freedom to make such decisions is not without limits. Every person accused of a criminal offense is entitled to constitutionally adequate legal assistance. (E.g., <em>In re Saunders, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 1041.) That right is denied if trial counsel makes a critical tactical decision which would not be made by diligent, ordinarily prudent lawyers in criminal cases. This is true even if the decision were not made from ignorance of the law or a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">To render reasonably competent assistance, an attorney in a criminal case must perform certain basic duties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See generally, ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Stds. Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function, <em>supra, </em>p. 141 et seq.) Generally, the Sixth Amendment and article I, section 15 require counsel\u2019s \u201cdiligence and active participation in the full and effective preparation of his client\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vest </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 728, 736 [118 Cal.Rptr. 84].) Criminal defense attorneys have a \u201c \u2018duty to investigate carefully all defenses of fact and of law that may be available to the defendant ....\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Williams, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 175.) This obligation includes conferring with the client \u201cwithout undue delay and as often as necessary ... to elicit matters of defense . . . .\u201d <em>(Coles </em>v. <em>Peyton </em>(4th Cir. 1968) 389 F.2d 224, 226.) \u201cCounsel should promptly advise his client of his rights, and take all actions necessary to preserve them. . . . Counsel should also be concerned with the accused\u2019s right to be released from custody pending trial, and be prepared, where appropriate, to make motions for a pretrial psychiatric examination or for the suppression of evidence. [Fns. omitted.]\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>DeCoster, supra, </em>487 F.2d at p. 1203; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whittington </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 806, 818-819, fn. 6 [141 Cal.Rptr. 742].)  If counsel\u2019s failure to perform these obligations results in the withdrawal of a crucial or potentially meritorious defense,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018the defendant has not had the assistance to which he is entitled.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Saunders, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 1042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Of course, the burden of proving a claim of inadequate trial assistance is on the appellant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Camden, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 816.) Thus, appellant must show that trial counsel failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates. In addition, appellant must establish that counsel\u2019s acts or omissions resulted in the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Once an appellant has met these burdens, the appellate court must look to see if the record contains any explanation for the challenged aspect of representation. If it does, the court must inquire whether the explanation demonstrates that counsel was reasonably competent and acting as a conscientious, diligent advocate. For example, where the record shows that counsel\u2019s omissions resulted from an informed tactical choice within the range of reasonable competence, the conviction must be affirmed. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Fain </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 588, 600 [95 Cal.Rptr. 562].) In contrast, where the record shows that counsel has failed to research the law or investigate the facts in the manner of a diligent and conscientious advocate, the conviction should .be reversed since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>defendant has been deprived of adequate assistance of counsel. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>McDowell </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 737 [73 Cal.Rptr. 1, 447 P.2d 97].)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In some cases, however, the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged. In such circumstances, unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide one, or unless there simply could be no satisfactory explanation, these cases are affirmed on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 562, 572-574 [102 Cal.Rptr. 841, 498 P.2d 1089].) Otherwise, appellate courts would become engaged \u201cin the perilous process of second-guessing.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 573.) Reversals would be ordered unnecessarily in cases where there were, in fact, good reasons for the aspect of counsel\u2019s representation under attack. Indeed, such reasons might lead a new defense counsel on retrial to do exactly what the original counsel did, making manifest the waste of judicial resources caused by reversal on an incomplete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Where the record does not illuminate the basis for the challenged acts or omissions, a claim of ineffective assistance is more appropriately made in a petition for habeas corpus. In habeas corpus proceedings, there is an opportunity in an evidentiary hearing to have trial counsel fully describe his or her reasons for acting or failing to act in the manner complained of. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1483 and 1484; e.g., <em>In re Williams, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 168.) For example, counsel may explain why certain defenses were or were not presented. Having afforded the trial attorney an opportunity to explain, courts are in a position to intelligently evaluate whether counsel\u2019s acts or omissions were within the range of reasonable competence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">With these principles in mind, this court must determine whether appellant received the kind of legal assistance to be expected of a reasonably competent attorney acting as a conscientious, diligent advocate.  Appellant contends that his trial counsel\u2019s representation was inadequate because she failed to use significant evidence of his mental deficiency. He asserts that given this evidence, a reasonably competent counsel would have taken one or more of the following steps: (1) sought a pretrial hearing to determine appellant\u2019s competence to stand trial (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1368); (2) moved to suppress appellant\u2019s postarrest statements to police on the ground that appellant was mentally incapable of knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights; (3) introduced evidence of appellant\u2019s mental deficiency at trial\u2014once having lost the pretrial suppression motion\u2014in order to argue the insignificance of the inconsistent statements; and (4) developed and presented a defense of diminished capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">It is difficult to understand why the deputy public defender took none of these steps. Given the substantial record of appellant\u2019s mental retardation, these defenses were certainly crucial in the sense that they had potential merit. Particularly troublesome is counsel\u2019s failure to seek suppression of appellant\u2019s inconsistent statements to the police. Following a standard <em>Miranda </em>warning, the officer suggested to appellant that he \u201cha[d] a right to . . . clarify or explain [his] position in this matter.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>invitation to speak and appellant\u2019s \u201csuggestibility\u201d formed a strong basis for urging exclusion of the damaging statements. A reasonably competent and diligent counsel would ordinarily be expected to make such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Nonetheless, appellant\u2019s claim of inadequate assistance cannot be resolved on appeal. The record includes neither an explanation as to why counsel did not raise any of the potential mental defenses nor an indication that she was asked for an explanation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This is not a case where this court can conceive of no satisfactory explanation for counsel\u2019s omissions. For example, the report of the appointed defense psychiatrist, which is not part of the record on appeal, may have included information upon which a diligent, conscientious and reasonably competent attorney would have chosen to forego any mental defense. In addition, appellant may have instructed trial counsel that he did not want records of his mental retardation introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In view of the silence of the record on the reasons why no mental defense was presented, appellant\u2019s claim would be more appropriately made in a petition for habeas corpus. Indeed, if presented in a verified petition, appellant\u2019s allegations concerning the substantial mental defenses which were not offered would undoubtedly present a colorable claim entitling appellant to an evidentiary hearing. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1483 and 1484; <em>In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 873-874, fn. 2 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1].) At such a hearing, appellant would be able to produce evidence on matters merely alleged before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Appellant next contends that he was denied competent representation because counsel did not interview or subpoena before trial the two other suspects, Harbin and Stoker. Appellant points out that the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of counsel\u2019s diligence in seeking to subpoena the two suspects was raised in the trial when counsel sought to introduce extrajudicial statements by the two men who were not'present in court. At that time, counsel had an opportunity to describe fully her efforts to contact Harbin and Stoker, and she stated that her only attempts to reach them were by telephone. Appellant claims that such limited efforts precluded his obtaining potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">There is no doubt from the record that appellant\u2019s case was hastily prepared under intense time pressure. Trial counsel was assigned to the case only four working days before trial. During each of those days, she was occupied with hearings in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">While it is clear that defense preparation was less than exemplary, appellant has not demonstrated constitutionally inadequate preparation on the limited facts available to this court. The trial judge found that the public defender\u2019s office had exercised due diligence in seeking to produce Stoker at trial. The record also indicates that the office had been tiying to contact Harbin up until the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Further, defense counsel\u2019s statements about trying to telephone Harbin and Stoker were made in response to questions concerning her efforts to secure the two men as witnesses. Her statements in this regard do not preclude the possibility that she or some other member of the office made more substantial efforts to interview them as part of a pretrial investigation. Indeed, it is possible that another attorney or investigator actually interviewed one or both of the other suspects before trial and found that their testimony would not be favorable to appellant.  Since the appellate record is ambiguous on this issue, the court cannot conclude that appellant has established that defense counsel conducted an inadequate investigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The record reveals one other disturbing suggestion regarding the public defender\u2019s representation in this case. To explain her lack of success in tiying to reach Harbin by telephone, counsel told the trial judge, \u201cHarbin\u2019s a client of ours, and he knows we are representing Pope, and he is not answering our phone calls.\u201d From this statement an inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>arises that the public defender\u2019s office may have undertaken simultaneous representation of clients with conflicting interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Nonetheless, there are two compelling reasons for not resolving this issue at present. First, appellant\u2019s appointed counsel on appeal, who has vigorously challenged the other aspects of trial counsel\u2019s representation, has made no claim of any inadequacy based on a. conflict of interest. Second, as already suggested, an evidentiary hearing is highly appropriate in this case if a verified petition for habeas corpus is filed. (See <em>ante, </em>p. 428.) In view of the likelihood of such a petition and the absence of any claim of conflict at trial or on appeal, this court is persuaded that resolution of this potential issue should await an evidentiary hearing in which all claims of inadequate assistance may be fully explored in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Tobriner, J., Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The police later showed the wallet to Brower who could not identify it.

The reason for such disparity .is evident. \u201cThe use of a short negative statement mandating what a trial should not be offers no guidance to an appellate court trying to decide what constitutes effective representation.\u201d (Note, <em>Ineffective Representation as a Basis for Relief from Conviction: Principles for Appellate Review, supra, </em>13 Colum. J. L. &amp; Soc. Prob. 1, 37.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The duties described herein are not meant as an exhaustive list of a lawyer\u2019s constitutional obligations in a criminal case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\">A crucial defense is not necessarily one which, if presented, \u201cwould result inexorably in a defendant\u2019s acquittal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 1023, 1028 [141 Cal.Rptr. 118]; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Shells </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 626, 631 [94 Cal.Rptr. 275, 483 P.2d 1227].) <em>Ibarra </em>itself teaches that by failing to obtain an adjudication of the stronger of two potential defenses, trial counsel deprived his client of constitutionally adequate assistance. (60 Cal.2d at pp. 465-466.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It has been said that an appellant must prove inadequate assistance as \u201ca demonstrable reality and not a speculative matter.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 652, 661 [111 Cal.Rptr. 556, 517 P.2d 820].) This formulation of the heavy burden on a party alleging inadequate assistance was intended to summarize, in concise fashion, the rules just described; in the absence of an explanation in the record, appellate courts should not speculate that trial counsel\u2019s failure to present a particular defense resulted from incompetence. To justify relief, appellant must be able to point to something in the record showing that counsel had no satisfactory rationale for what was done or not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Although concise, the <em>Stephenson </em>formulation is subject to misinterpretation. The language demanding proof of incompetence as \u201ca demonstrable reality and not a speculative matter\u201d may be misunderstood to require inadequate assistance throughout the proceeding, when in fact, a single inexcusable error which withdraws a potentially meritorious defense is sufficient. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Shells, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 626.) To avoid such confusion, the <em>Stephenson </em>formulation should be replaced with the analysis of appellant\u2019s burden set forth in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">To promote judicial economy in direct appeals where the record contains no explanation, appellate counsel who wish to raise the issue of inadequate trial representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tion should join a verified petition for habeas corpus. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Apodaca </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 479,489, fn. 3 [142 Cal.Rptr. 830].)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The dissent argues that resolution of claims of ineffective representation is preferable on direct appeal rather than in habeas corpus proceedings because the latter are both potentially duplicative and potentially harmful to the convicted defendant\u2019s claim. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>p. 440.) As indicated above, however, where the record does not illuminate the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions, reversal on appeal may often result in unwarranted retrials, a result serving neither justice nor economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">As for the dissent\u2019s second rationale, the fact that a habeas proceeding \u201cis not without its potential pitfalls\u201d for convicted defendants does not lead to the conclusion that such proceedings should be avoided. The claim of ineffective assistance does not exist as a tool for reversing validly obtained convictions, but as a means of assuring that criminal defendants receive the legal assistance to which they are constitutionally entitled. Convictions should not be reversed on appeal because it might be discovered in a habeas proceeding that, to use the dissent\u2019s examples, the reason counsel did not call certain witnesses was either to avoid producing false testimony or to protect his client. Nonmeritorious claims of incompetent representation will be discouraged to the extent that there is an opportunity to determine the actual, as opposed to hypothesized, reasons for counsel\u2019s acts or omissions. That habeas corpus may be \u201ca double-edged sword\u201d is no reason why direct appeal should be made available as a shield for defendants with nonmeritorious claims of inadequate representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">This conclusion does not make \u201cobiter dictum\u201d of today\u2019s holding that an indigent criminal defendant is entitled to the assistance of a reasonably competent attorney acting as his diligent, conscientious advocate. (Dis. Opn., <em>post, </em>p. 431.) As set forth above, an analysis of a claim of inadequate trial representation necessarily begins by measuring counsel\u2019s performance against the applicable standard. Only where appellant identifies acts or omissions falling below that standard does an appellate court examine whether the record includes an explanation for the apparently inadequate representation. Thus, definition of the standard is a necessary element of today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Moreover, Justice Mosk apparently approves of the standard which this opinion has derived from <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeCoster, supra, </em>487 F.2d 1197. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>p. 438.) Interestingly, after enunciating the standard in <em>DeCoster, </em>Judge Bazelon did not reverse the conviction but remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing where proof could be adduced as to counsel\u2019s explanations for his apparent inadequacy. <em>(DeCoster, supra, </em>at pp. 1204-1205.) Nonetheless, the dissent itself properly characterizes the <em>DeCoster </em>standard as the <em>holding </em>of that case. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>p. 438.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Appellant also asserts that counsel should have sought to suppress the wallet and $56 which were seized from appellant at the time of his arrest. He contends that the wallet was (1) the fruit of an illegal search and (2) irrelevant since the victim could not identify it. However, since the victim could not identify the wallet at trial, the \u201c[failure to object to admission of the items seized may have been ... a strategic judgment that the items were not particularly damaging.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Steger, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 552.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b422-7\">CLARK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJy\">I concur in the judgment and in the opinion of the court insofar as it reaffirms the principle that a judgment of conviction may not be set aside on the basis of speculation, and that the claim of incompetence of trial counsel must be rejected on appeal when, as in this case, the record does not reveal counsel\u2019s reasons for acting or failing to act in the manner complained of. I concur in the dissenting opinion insofar as it contends that the discussion in the majority opinion as to the appropriate standard for resolving claims of incompetence of trial counsel is dictum. Therefore, I consider it neither necessary nor appropriate to address that issue at this time.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b422-8\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADvf\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The majority, despite obvious misgivings, appear to believe they have no choice on the present record but to affirm the judgment of conviction. I conclude, to the contrary, that our only rational choice is to declare that the patent inadequacy of counsel was the equivalent of denial of counsel and to reverse the conviction of this borderline mentally defective defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">While I have no quarrel with the majority analysis of counsel incompetency problems, unfortunately their views have no binding effect. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Defendant Pope, found guilty of second degree robbery, appeals to this court for a reversal of his conviction. The majority, declaring the record inadequate to reveal incompetency of trial counsel, affirm the conviction. That is the only rule of law in this case. Any additional discussion of tests to weigh competency of counsel <em>if </em>the record had been adequate does not rise above mere obiter dictum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">I am convinced that the record demonstrates the legal inadequacy of trial counsel under virtually any known test, that the lack of constitutionally adequate representation requires reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction and that we can devise and apply in the case before us a revised standard that will have precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Repetition of the facts surrounding the crime and the arrest contained in the record, some of which are recited in the majority opinion, is unnecessary, although they reveal to any alert counsel the potential defenses of <em>Miranda </em>violations and defendant\u2019s limited mental capacity. At the threshold the record discloses that this defendant received only superficial pretrial attention from his counsel, a fact that explains the obviously casual defense, including failure to attempt to subpoena the prime witnesses until after the trial was under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Two and one-half months before trial\u2014ample time for preparation\u2014the Sonoma County Public Defender was appointed to represent defendant. In multiple proceedings before the trial, the defendant was represented by four separate attorneys from that office, only one of whom appeared with him in any two different proceedings. Four working days before trial, a fifth attorney, a deputy public defender, was assigned to try the case. On each of those four days the deputy was involved in other hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Before trial, the court appointed a psychiatrist to assist the defense. Although the augmented record on appeal does not include this psychiatrist\u2019s report, the record does contain the expert opinions of several psychologists and psychiatrists embodied in four separate reports made in 1973, 1975 and 1976, all being received post trial. These reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>uniformly characterize defendant as a borderline mental defective with a fourth or fifth grade intellectual achievement level. His probation report filed on June 15, 1976, indicates he has an I.Q. of 72; this places him in the third percentile range when compared to I.Q. test standardization norms.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The reports, available to us on this appeal, note that defendant last attended school at the age of 17 when he was in the 9th grade. He was enrolled in \u201cSpecial Education Classes for the mentally retarded throughout most of the period of his junior high school and high school attendance.\u201d The reports state that he \u201cfunctioned intellectually like a child\u201d; that he could not make change or drive a car; that he was gullible and suggestible; that he could not manage his own finances; that communication with him had to be couched in the \u201cmost elementary . . . vocabulary and sentence structure ... if there is to be any expectation that he [will] understand\u201d; and that he had a poor tolerance for ambiguity. Defendant was also characterized as having a \u201cpenchant for naive fabrications,\u201d and \u201ca blanket denial mechanism\u201d\u2014a psychological, defense technique he used to justify himself. The evaluations also note his impaired memory, disoriented temporal sense, and limited attention span. In addition/ they state he is easily manipulated by his age group peers, and that he displays the impaired judgment, immaturity, and impulsivity of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The trial judge read and considered these evaluations after trial but before he ordered defendant committed for diagnosis. The record does not reveal whether the public defender, Ms. Young, obtained copies of the 1973 and 1975 evaluations before trial, or whether she knew of their existence at that time. There can be no doubt, however, that she was aware of the defendant\u2019s mental limitations because in her opening statement at trial she described him as having borderline intelligence. Nevertheless no evidence of defendant\u2019s limited intelligence was introduced at trial or used before trial to challenge the admissibility of his out-of-court statements to police or for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">During the trial, the only defense presented was that the robbery was committed by the two other suspects, Harbin and Stoker. There was evidence that one of these two or both of them might have been involved in the robbery or that they were percipient witnesses with testimony of potentially enormous significance to the case: they were both in the bar at the same time as Brower, the victim; Harbin may have been sitting next to Brower in the bar and might have talked with him for 30 to 40 minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>prior to the robbery; Harbin may have had ample opportunity to notice the money in Brower\u2019s wallet; both-Harbin and Stoker followed Brower and defendant out of the bar; an investigating officer testified that both Brower and defendant had identified Harbin from a photographic lineup; Harbin had inadvertently made an inculpatory admission in the presence of another investigating officer; and both of them were listed in a police report as additional suspects. Defendant\u2019s counsel knew, or should have known, of the foregoing evidence. Nevertheless prior to trial she failed to subpoena either Harbin or Stoker.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">During the trial, in cross-examining the police officer who had talked to Harbin and Stoker, defense counsel asked about the inculpatory statement Harbin was heard to make. When the prosecution successfully objected on the ground that such hearsay could not be admitted unless counsel made a showing that the declarant was unavailable, only then, at that late date, did Ms. Young ask that the trial recess to give her an opportunity to subpoena Harbin and Stoker. The next day, counsel produced Harbin and called him as a witness, but he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and Stoker was not located on such short notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The prosecution offered into evidence a statement defendant made, after he had purportedly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, containing certain inculpatory and inconsistent statements. No objection was made to the admissibility of these statements. In fact, during the trial, defense counsel made no substantial objections, called no significant witness on his behalf, and made no helpful motions for him either before, during or after trial. It is difficult to detect what role defense counsel played at the trial other than that of a casual observer.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In her opening statement, Ms. Young declared \u201c. . . Mr. Pope has a borderline intelligence, <em>he does not understand a large percentage of what you are going to tell him </em>and he\u2019s very agreeable to go along with just about anything the police tell him. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus the record discloses defense counsel\u2019s knowledge of defendant\u2019s mental capacity existed from the very beginning of the trial. In closing argument, counsel argued that the only direct evidence that defendant participated in the robbery was the identification by Brower, who had been drinking before the crime occurred. She attempted to minimize Pope\u2019s inconsistent statements to the police by suggesting that they resulted from defendant\u2019s limited mental capacity. Thus, on the trial record, it is clear that counsel was aware of her client\u2019s mental limitations, although she had failed to present any evidence on the subject during the trial. As a result the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>curtailed the closing argument when the prosecution objected on the ground that no evidence had been introduced as to defendant\u2019s mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The jury found' defendant guilty of second degree robbery. Upon receiving the probation report, the trial judge ordered defendant committed for diagnosis pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.03. The court wrote the Director of Corrections in order to relate his concern for a defendant with a marginal mental capacity \u201cwho appears to be responsible for his actions in a purely legal sense, but that\u2019s about all.\u201d Following receipt of the diagnostic study and recommendation by the Department of Corrections, defendant was sentenced to state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">After sentencing, the court wrote the Director of Corrections again, this time to express concern over the conclusion of the diagnostic report that defendant\u2019s incarceration would be only a \u201ctemporary expedient\u201d and that there was no reason to believe he would be more adaptive after it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Thus it is clear that the defendant\u2019s mental condition was apparent even to the trial judge. Yet defense counsel made no motion in opposition to the sentence or the verdict, and made no comment on defendant\u2019s behalf at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">To suggest that the foregoing\u2014all in the record before us\u2014does not reveal inadequacy of trial counsel is to trifle with reality. The majority term the defense preparation \u201cless than exemplary.\u201d I deem it, beyond any doubt, less than adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The record reveals another ground, glossed over by the majority, for finding defense counsel\u2019s representation not only inadequate but improper. In explaining reasons for difficulty in obtaining Harbin\u2019s appearance, Ms. Young told the court: \u201cUnfortunately, you see, <em>Harbin\u2019s a client of ours, </em>and he knows we are representing Pope, and he is not answering the phone calls.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Since the defendant intended to, and did, attempt to blame Harbin and Stoker for the robbery, it should have been clear to members of the public defender\u2019s office that, a conflict of interest existed. Manifestly the public defenders could not effectively represent a client who was implicating another client of their office in a serious felony. (Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>5-102(B), Rules of Professional Conduct.) Indeed the court ultimately\u2014though perforce late\u2014recognized the conflict. After the public defender\u2019s investigator brought Harbin into court in an office automobile, the court appointed independent counsel \u201cto represent Mr. Harbin and advise him regarding his testifying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">As a result, when defense counsel called their client, Harbin, to the stand, upon the advice of his new temporary court-designated attorney Harbin, asserted his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">It is difficult, on this record, to see how defense counsel could adequately represent defendant, who desired to implicate Harbin, when up to the moment Harbin appeared in court he was represented by the same office. The patent conflict necessarily resulted in inadequate representation. (See <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 60, 76 [86 L.Ed. 680, 702, 62 S.Ct. 457] [\u201cThe right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.\u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also see <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 475, 489 [55 L.Ed.2d 426, 438, 98 S.Ct. 1173] [\u201cJoint representation of conflicting interests is suspect because of what it tends to prevent the attorney from doing.\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Assuming, as we are permitted no alternative from the record, that defense counsel was well aware of defendant\u2019s mental limitations, we must consider whether some strategic purpose could have induced counsel to forego presentation of any testimony on the subject. It is difficult\u2014indeed, I find it impossible\u2014to conjure up any theory for the abandonment of what appears to be a ready-made defense: that the defendant did not have the mental capacity to form the intent to commit the offense with which he was charged, or to understand the nature of the acts which he admitted to the police, or to understand the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>consequence of his admissions. (But see Arenella, <em>The Diminished Capacity and Diminished Responsibility Defenses: Two Children of a Doomed Marriage </em>(1977) 77 Colum.L.Rev. 827.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Nevertheless, if we assume arguendo that counsel had some shrewd, if well-concealed, tactical purpose in mind, still another problem emerges. Should counsel alone be permitted to abandon her client\u2019s clearly available and potentially effective defense, or should defendant be required, on the record, to waive that defense personally? A jury trial may be waived only by consent \u201cexpressed in open court by the defendant\u201d <em>and </em>his counsel (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16). To enter a guilty plea we require recitation of a litany to demonstrate defendant is aware of, and personally waives, his several constitutional rights. Even in the less exacting civil context we have held that an attorney may bind his client in procedural matters \u201cbut he may not impair the client\u2019s substantial rights . . . .\u201d <em>(Linsk </em>v. <em>Linsk </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 272, 276 [74 Cal.Rptr. 544, 449 P.2d 760].) He clearly may not eliminate an essential defense. <em>(Fresno City High School Dist. </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1939) 34 Cal.App.2d 636, 644 [94 P.2d 86].) Justice Traynor in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487], declared that withdrawal of a crucial defense denies defendant \u201cthe assistance to which he is entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">I suggest that in the circumstances at hand, if counsel had a legitimate purpose in waiving defenses based on defendant\u2019s mental limitations, she had a duty to spread on the record her abandonment of the defenses and to obtain defendant\u2019s personal acquiescence in the waiver. Failure to do so is further indication of counsel\u2019s inadequate representation of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The farce, sham or mockeiy test, if it still exists intact, is due for revision. The expression\u2014usually only two of the three terms are employed in any one case\u2014is vague, uncertain, enigmatic, and results in denial of defendants\u2019 grievances in all but the most egregious circumstances, as, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Corona </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 684 (hg. den.). As stated in <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1970) 427 F.2d 609, 610, \u201cThat standard is no longer valid as such but exists in the law only as a metaphor that the defendant has a heavy burden to show requisite unfairness.\u201d The difficulty is in devising an alternative test.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Parenthetically, we need not decide in this case whether different standards apply to defendants who have retained counsel, as distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>guished from those for whom the state has provided counsel. (Compare <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1975) 505 F.2d 1334 (cert. den. (1975) 422 U.S. 1011 [45 L.Ed.2d 675, 95 S.Ct. 2636]) with <em>Moore </em>v. <em>United States </em>(3d Cir. 1970) 432 F.2d 730, 736; also see Note (1976) 89 Harv.L.Rev. 593.) Here counsel was court-appointed, which directly involves state action; thus we have no problem with prerequisites for considering questions of due process and right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The United States Supreme Court has never relied on a sham or farce test, nor on any of that genre. In <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 759 [25 L.Ed.2d 763, 90 S.Ct. 1441], a case involving effective assistance of counsel on a guilty plea, the court spoke of \u201cthe range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases\u201d <em>(id., </em>p. 771 [25 L.Ed.2d, p. 773]), but it did not define more precisely the acceptable range of competence demanded. Other federal courts\u2014e.g., <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1967) 379 F.2d 113, 117\u2014recognized that \u201cIt would not be fruitful to attempt further delineation of the applicable standard by reference to generalities, . . .\u201d The applicable standard applied in <em>Bruce </em>was \u201cgross incompetence of counsel and that this has in effect blotted out the essence of a substantial defense either in the [trial] Court or on appeal.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 116-117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Analysis of cases reveals that most attempts to define a standard with precision result in a frustrating tautology. For example, the so-called Maryland rule holds an accused has received incompetent counsel when, under all the circumstances of the case, the accused has not been afforded genuine and effective representation. <em>(Slater </em>v. <em>Warden, Maryland Penitentiary </em>(1966) 241 Md. 668 [217 A.2d 344, 346]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>State </em>(Del. 1973) 305 A.2d 318, 319.) Other illustrations abound. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Camden </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 808, 815 [129 Cal.Rptr. 438, 548 P.2d 1110] [\u201c\u2018\u201can extreme case must be disclosed\u201d [citations]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487]) in which counsel \u2018did not effectively supply to a defendant those skills and legal knowledge which we can reasonably expect from any member of the bar.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 663, 672-673 [119 Cal.Rptr. 500, 532 P.2d 148].)\u201d]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reincke </em>(2d Cir. 1967) 383 F.2d 129, 132 [\u201cso \u2018horribly inept\u2019 as to amount to a \u2018breach of his legal duty faithfully to represent his client\u2019s interests\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Dillane </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1965) 350 F.2d 732, 733 [\u201cextraordinary inattention to a client\u2019s interests\u201d]; <em>Hickock </em>v. <em>Crouse </em>(10th Cir. 1964) 334 F.2d 95, 100-101, cert. den.

[whether, in the total picture, defendant was \u201cdeprived of rudimentary legal assistance\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Given the proliferation of standards, a serious question can be raised as to whether any precise standard is pragmatically helpful. No test yet proposed is self-determinative; all are deliberately vague and dependent upon subjective interpretation. It is inevitable that each will be applied in an ad hoc manner, with ad hoc results.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The American Bar Association has defined the lawyer\u2019s obligation in this manner: \u201cThe basic duty the lawyer for the accused owes to the administration of justice is to serve as the accused\u2019s counselor and advocate, with courage, devotion and to the utmost of his learning and ability, and according to law.\u201d (ABA Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function (1971) p. 153.) The flaw in that definition is that the utmost of the attorney\u2019s learning and ability may still fall short of providing the defendant with the defense he needs and deserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In the final analysis, a readily adaptable standard for determining an unacceptable performance in a particular case should be stated in terms of reasonable competence. In rejecting a requirement of showing \u201cgross incompetence,\u201d the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeCoster </em>(D.C.Cir. 1973) 487 F.2d 1197, 1202, on appeal remanded the case to the trial court, holding that \u201ca defendant is entitled to the reasonably competent assistance of an attorney acting as his diligent conscientious advocate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The foregoing, though imprecise, is probably sufficient for guidance of the courts. Professor Strazzella explains the result: \u201cThe courts continue to reach for appropriate standards. There is a transition from the older standards to articulation of stricter but equally vague standards of performance. However, ... the standards articulated for measuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ineffective counsel may be necessarily and intentionally vague. This is probably one of those areas of the law, so rich in variables, in which the courts wish to avoid imposing rigid rules and probably could not devise a rigid list if they attempted to do so. The result leaves maneuvering room for the courts as they seek, in applying the standards, to assess each claim in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d (Strazzella, <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims: New Uses, New Problems </em>(1977) 19 Ariz.L.Rev. 443, 454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">With application to the case at hand, we need only to turn to <em>People </em>v. <em>McDowell </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 737 [73 Cal.Rptr. 1, 447 P.2d 97], Our observations on that case fit the instant circumstances with remarkable relevance: \u201cA defendant who pleads not guilty manifests his desire to contest the issue by every means lawfully at his disposal, and it is the duty of his counsel to assist him in this endeavor by the preparation and presentation of his defense. Under our adversary system, of course, the choice of strategy and tactics remains committed to counsel\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, in appropriate cases counsel may justifiably decide to offer no affirmative defense and stand instead upon the presumption of innocence; or counsel may, as here, offer a defense on one count only of a multiple charge, standing on the presumption as to the remainder. But either of these courses of action presupposes that counsel is fully informed of the defenses that could actually be interposed on behalf of his client. \u2018It is counsel\u2019s duty to investigate carefully all defenses of fact and of law that may be available to the defendant, and if his failure to do so results in withdrawing a crucial defense from the case, the defendant has not had the assistance to which he is entitled.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u201cIt is settled in this state that on the trial of the issues raised by a plea of not guilty to a charge of a crime which requires proof of a specific mental state, competent evidence is admissible to show that because of mental abnormality not amounting to legal insanity the defendant did not possess that mental state at the time he committed the act. As we said of the search and seizure principle involved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ibarra </em>(1963) <em>supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 465, \u2018This rule should be a commonplace to any attorney engaged in criminal trials.\u2019 It was established almost two decades ago: \u2018the defense, generally, has been well recognized since <em>People </em>v. <em>Wells </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 330 [202 P.2d 53].\u2019 <em>(In re Hawley </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 824, 829 fn. 4 [63 Cal.Rptr. 831, 433 P.2d 919].) It was further developed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorshen </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 716 [336 P.2d 492], and has frequently been discussed in appellate opinions, in law review articles, and in the standard works of reference. \u2018It can no longer be doubted that the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of mental illness not amounting to legal insanity is a \u201csignificant issue\u201d in any case in which it is raised by substantial evidence. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 746-747.) To the same effect see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Browner </em>(D.C.Cir. 1972)471 F.2d 969, 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The claim of ineffective trial counsel is preferably to be litigated on direct appeal in all cases in which the record includes sufficient information to do so. (Brody &amp; Albert, <em>Ineffective Representation as a Basis for Relief from Conviction: Principles for Appellate Review </em>(1977) 13 Colum. J. L. &amp; Soc. Prob. 1, 87 [\u201cEvery effort should be made to deal with the claim on direct appeal rather than in a collateral proceeding . . . .\u201d]; Bines, <em>Remedying Ineffective Representation in Criminal Cases: Departures from Habeas Corpus </em>(1973) 59 Va.L.Rev. 927, 939-940 fn. 66; see also Strazzella, <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims: New Uses, New Problems </em>(1977) 19 Ariz.L.Rev. 443, 460.) This avoids the necessity of a second proceeding, with potentially duplicative hearings and appeals, and with the resultant burden on the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">There is an additional reason why resort to the trial record is preferred to institution of separate habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">A petitioner for habeas corpus may learn, to his sorrow, that by opening up the issue of his trial attorney\u2019s ability in a new proceeding he waives much of the attorney-client privilege. A trial attorney whose competence is assailed by his former client must be able to adequately defend his professional reputation, even if by doing so he relates confidences revealed to him by the client. For example, the attorney who is criticized for failing to call alibi witnesses to the stand should be permitted to explain that the client admitted to him he was at the scene of the crime and that the alibi was fabricated. Counsel should also be allowed to explain that other witnesses not produced might, under cross-examination, have implicated the client in other uncharged criminal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In short, those who exercise 20/20 hindsight and instigate separate proceedings to assail the performance of trial attorneys must realize that the procedure is not without its potential pitfalls. The sword may be double-edged, both of them blunt. Resort to such proceedings should consequently not be judicially required in cases such as the one before us, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>because the record clearly reveals that counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective and therefore makes it possible to avoid these pitfalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons I reject the majority\u2019s invitation for a whole new round of duplicative litigation. On the present record I would reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial in which the defendant would have adequate representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied March 28, 1979, and the opinions were modified to read as printed above. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Dictum, however well-motivated at the time, frequently receives imperious treatment in subsequent decisions. See, e.g., disparaging references to an earlier opinion in <em>Hollister Convalescent Hosp. Inc. </em>v. <em>Rico </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 670, 671-674 [125 Cal.Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349], using such expressions as \u201cpanoramic dicta,\u201d \u201cerroneous dicta,\u201d \u201cill-considered dicta,\u201d \u201cpersistent dicta\u201d and \u201cunnecessary and overbroad dicta.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\">With respect to conflicts of interest, it is clear that a public defender\u2019s office must be treated the same as a law firm. Thus, as one commentator has observed, \u201cThe reason for viewing the office of the public defender as a firm for purposes of ethical regulation is a sound one. . . . [T]he close association of the attorneys in the public defender\u2019s office makes it possible that confidential information will be inadvertently circulated. The necessity of utilizing the services of the same investigator, the inevitable discussions occurring in the office among the attorneys, and the overlapping sources of information from identical witnesses all contribute to this possibility. Furthermore, public confidence in the public defender and the Bar as a whole must be maintained. In order to do this, lawyers must \u2018not only avoid evil, but also the appearance of evil.\u2019 ... By appointing separate attorneys for individual defendants where there is alleged conflict, the courts uphold not only the individual\u2019s constitutional rights and protections, but also the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)
