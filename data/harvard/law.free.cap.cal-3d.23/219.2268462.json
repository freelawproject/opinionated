J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">In this case, the court must decide if proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous jury verdict are the proper standards to apply before a conservator can be appointed under the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act\u2019s (LPS Act) grave disability provisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the power to involuntarily commit a conservatee to a state mental institution for up to a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In December 1974, respondent, the Public Guardian of the County of Santa Barbara, was named conservator of the person and estate of appellant, Mabel Roulet. Respondent was given the power to confine appellant in a mental institution. Pursuant to respondent\u2019s instructions, appellant was placed in Camarillo State Hospital. In November 1975, respondent petitioned under sections 5350 and 5361 to reestablish the conservatorship over appellant for an additional year because of appellant\u2019s alleged continuing grave disability due to a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">At the time of the recommitment proceeding, appellant was 59 years old. According to the conservatorship reevaluation form filled out by physicians at Camarillo State Hospital, appellant could not provide for her basic needs because \u201c[s]he is so confused, and disorganized that she is unable to make daily living plans. If she has some funds she will waste [sic] on cigarettes and drinking.\u201d The form indicated that appellant was unwilling to accept treatment voluntarily because \u201c. . . she feels she is not mentally ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Pursuant to subdivision (d) of section 5350, appellant demanded a jury trial on the issue of whether she was gravely disabled. At trial appellant requested that the jury be instructed that a conservator could be appointed for her only if the jury unanimously agreed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant was gravely disabled as the result of mental disorder. The trial judge refused this instruction. Instead he instructed the jury they need only apply the preponderance of the evidence standard and that only 9 of the 12 jurors must agree in order to reach a verdict. Subsequently the jury found appellant to be a gravely disabled person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The trial court entered an order reestablishing the conservatorship and granted respondent numerous powers including the power to institutionalize appellant (i.e., to continue her commitment), and to require her to receive treatment related specifically to remedying her \u201cgrave disability.\u201d (\u00a7 5358.) The court further ordered that appellant lose the privilege of possessing a driver\u2019s license and the right to enter into contracts without the consent and approval of the conservator. (\u00a7 5357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>This appeal followed. The Court of Appeal reversed the order reestablishing the conservatorship, unanimously holding that the reasonable doubt standard must be applied. Thereafter, this court granted the conservator\u2019s petition for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In criminal trials, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is an obstacle the state places in its own way, in order to lessen the possibility of convicting an innocent person. This procedural constraint is eloquent testimony to the high stakes involved\u2014a defendant\u2019s freedom and reputation hinge on the verdict. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 306, 319-322 [121 Cal.Rptr. 488, 535 P.2d 352], this court explicitly recognized that civil commitment to a mental hospital, despite its civil label, threatens a person\u2019s liberty and dignity on as massive a scale as that traditionally associated with criminal prosecutions. One has only to imagine the horror experienced by a competent person falsely committed as mentally disturbed in order to appreciate that freedom is openly on trial at a civil commitment proceeding. Therefore, the <em>Burnick </em>court ruled that proof beyond a reasonable doubt applies to mentally disordered sex offender proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The logic of <em>Burnick </em>is equally applicable here. The appointment of a conservator for appellant and her subsequent confinement in a mental hospital against her will deprived appellant of freedom in its most basic aspects and placed a lasting stigma on her reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">A. Deprivation of Liberty</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The extent to which liberty is at stake can be ascertained by reviewing exactly what awaits an individual subjected to a grave disability proceeding. When the establishment of a conservatorship is recommended, the court may appoint a temporary conservator who has the power to keep the individual in a treatment facility for up to six months pending the outcome of a trial on the issue of grave disability. (\u00a7\u00a7 5352.1, 5353.) If the individual is found to be \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d the court then appoints a conservator and specifies the powers which the conservator will possess. (\u00a7\u00a7 5357, 5358.) One of the principal powers which the court may grant a conservator is the right to place a conservatee in an institution. Unlike a person who is found to be imminently dangerous to others and can be confined for a maximum of 90 days before a new court order must issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(\u00a7\u00a7 5300-5306),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the person who is found to be gravely disabled can be involuntarily confined in a mental hospital for up to a year by his or her conservator, with the possibility of additional year-long extensions. (\u00a7\u00a7 5358, 5361.) The period of temporary conservatorship is not included in the one-year period. (\u00a7 5361.) If the conservator petitions to reestablish an expiring conservatorship, the court may order the conservatee confined past the termination date until renewal proceedings are completed. (\u00a7 5361.) In effect, these statutes assure in many cases an unbroken and indefinite period of state-sanctioned confinement. \u201cThe theoretical maximum period of detention is <em>life </em>as successive petitions may be filed . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Gary W. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 296, 300 [96 Cal.Rptr. 1, 486 P.2d 1201], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This court has previously recognized that inmates of state mental hospitals face serious restrictions on their freedom. In <em>In re Roger S. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 921, 929 [141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 569 P.2d 1286], the court noted that involuntary confinement is a direct form of physical restraint. And \u201c[i]t is beyond dispute that a principal ingredient of personal liberty is \u2018freedom from bodily restraint\u2019 [citation]. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 927.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 323, a federal court of appeals opinion was cited to emphasize \u201c \u2018the indisputable fact that civil commitment entails a \u201cmassive curtailment of liberty\u201d in the constitutional sense. [Citation.] The destruction of an individual\u2019s personal freedoms effected by civil commitment is scarcely less total than that effected by confinement in a penitentiaiy.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Again, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 244-245 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375], this court stated, \u201cWhile wards confined in institutions of the Youth Authority may often experience greater freedom within the institution than individuals confined in state prisons or <em>mental hospitals </em>[citation], they are nevertheless incarcerated against their will, a most basic form of personal liberty deprivation.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Respondent fails to distinguish these previous decisions of this court. Instead, respondent takes false comfort in the fact that appellant\u2019s commitment is only a \u201ccivil\u201d confinement for remedial purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>However, these are mere labels. Appellant\u2019s stay in Camarillo State Hospital was not any less involuntaiy because the state called her incarceration by one name rather than another. As the United States Supreme Court has authoritatively written, \u201ccommitment is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one\u2019s will, whether it is called \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 50 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 558, 87 S.Ct. 1428].) In a subsequent opinion, the Supreme Court reiterated that \u201ccivil labels and good intentions do not themselves obviate the need for criminal due process safeguards . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 365-366 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 376, 90 S.Ct. 1068].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">This court has also rejected reliance on a civil label. \u201c[B]ecause involuntary commitment is incarceration against one\u2019s will regardless of whether it is called \u2018civil\u2019 or \u2018criminal\u2019 [citation], the choice of standard of proof implicates due process considerations which must be resolved by focusing not on the theoretical nature of the proceedings but rather on the actual consequences of commitment to the individual.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 638 [139 Cal.Rptr. 594, 566 P.2d 228]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 315-316; <em>In re Gary W., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 296, 307 [\u201cthe California Legislature has recognized that the interests involved in civil commitment proceedings are no less fundamental than those in criminal proceedings . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Nor can this court be swayed by the fact that appellant had her liberty taken away, allegedly for her own good. \u201c \u2018Regardless of the purposes for which the incarceration is imposed, the fact remains that it is incarceration. The rehabilitative goals of the system are admirable, but they do not change the drastic nature of the action taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Breed </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 519, 530, fn. 12 [44 L.Ed.2d 346, 356, 95 S.Ct. 1779].) The law must still strive to make certain that only those truly unable to take care of themselves are being assigned conservators under the LPS Act and committed to mental hospitals against their will. As Justice Brand\u00e9is cautioned a half-century ago, \u201cExperience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government\u2019s purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of / their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\u201d <em>(Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1928) 277 U.S. 438, 479 [72 L.Ed. 944, 957, 48 S.Ct. 564, 66 A.L.R. 376] (dis. opn. of Brandeis, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Therefore, appellant\u2019s protection ultimately must rest on requiring the state to match its good intentions with proof beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that appellant is in need of the state\u2019s care. If a person is in fact incapable of providing for the daily necessities of life, this should not prove an insurmountable burden for the petitioner to cany.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The concurring and dissenting opinion today relies on the argument that confinement of an allegedly gravely disabled person is \u201c. . . never in a jail, prison, or an institutional environment designed for the punishment of persons convicted of crimes.\u201d (Conc. and dis. <em>opn., post, </em>at p. 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">However, recent statistics from the California Department of Health (Ann. Rep., State Hospitals for the Mentally Disordered (1975-1976) Center for Health Statistics (Apr. 1977) table 23, p. 40, hereafter cited as Ann. Rep.) indicate that conservatees under the LPS Act are frequently placed at Atascadero and Patton State Hospitals. As of June 30, 1976, these institutions contained approximately 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of those persons convicted of crimes and determined to be mentally disordered sexual offenders (see \u00a7 6300 et seq.). Hence, conservatees do often find themselves confined in the same place as those convicted of crimes. During fiscal year 1975-1976, for example, out of the 1,325 conservatees admitted to state hospitals under sections 5358 and 5353, 23 were admitted to Atascadero and 140 to Patton. (Ann. Rep., <em>supra, </em>table 22, p. 39.) Of the 1,956 total inpatient conservatees in the state hospitals on June 30, 1976, 102 were at Atascadero and 126 were at Patton. <em>(Id., </em>table 23, p. 40.) The 102 conservatees at Atascadero comprised almost 10 percent of the total population of that institution (1,045), and the 126 at Patton comprised more than 15 percent of the total population of that hospital (823). <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In <em>Burnick, </em>this court soberly recognized the resemblance in reality between Atascadero State Hospital and a conventional prison. \u201cLet us not deceive ourselves as to the nature of that institution. (Cf. <em>In re Gault, supra, </em>387 U.S. 1, 27 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 545-546].) It was frankly described as follows by a distinguished body of the medical profession. \u2018In its physical appearance, this is much more like a prison than a hospital. In its architectural planning, it disregards the modern psychiatric concept of the therapeutic community. There are bare corridors, bars, iron gates, rows of cells\u2014all the stigmata of punishment rather than treatment. Patients who occupy individual rooms are locked out of them during the day and have no opportunity to withdraw for privacy. Patients in wards have a reasonable amount of mobility from one area of the hospital to another, although security precautions are in evidence everywhere. . . . [If] Externally, the plant has a misleadingly attractive appearance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Internally, despite its dehumanizing attributes, it is well-maintained and well-equipped and might be characterized as a sanitary dungeon.\u2019 Other observers have confirmed this description.\u201d (Fns. omitted.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 319-320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Therefore, the mere fact that appellant found herself confined in a hospital rather than a prison does not eliminate the need to protect her against <em>false </em>confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The gravely disabled person for whom a conservatorship has been established faces the loss of many other liberties in addition to the loss of his or her freedom from physical restraint. For example, the conservator<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is also given the powers granted to the guardian of an incompetent in chapters 7, 8 and 9 of division 4 of the Probate Code. (\u00a7 5357; Prob. Code, \u00a7 1852.) These include: payment of the conservatee\u2019s debts and collection or discharge of debts owed the conservatee (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1501); management of the conservatee\u2019s estate, including sale or encumbrance of the conservatee\u2019s property (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1502, 1530); commencement, prosecution, and defense of actions for partition of the conservatee\u2019s property interests (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1506-1508); disposition of the conservatee\u2019s money or other property for court-approved compromises or judgments (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1510, 1530a); deposit of the conservatee\u2019s money in a bank, savings and loan institution, or credit union (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1513); the giving of proxies to vote shares of the conservatee\u2019s corporate stocks (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1517); and the borrowing of money when it will benefit the conservatee (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1533). In addition, the court may grant the conservator any or all of the powers specified in Probate Code section 1853.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See \u00a7 5357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Further an individual found to be \u201cgravely disabled\u201d may suffer numerous statutory disabilities, including possible loss of the following rights:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to remain licensed to practice a profession (e.g., law (Bus. &amp; Prof Code, \u00a7 6007, subd. (a)); medicine (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2416, 2417); to continue to hold certain public offices (Gov. Code, \u00a7 1770, subd. (b)); to remain employed as a teacher (Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 44932, 87732); to establish or maintain certain relationships (e.g., custody of children (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(6)); marriage (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4201, 4506); to object to sterilization (\u00a7 7254); to refuse certain types of medical treatment (\u00a7\u00a7 5357, subds. (c), (d), 5358); to possess a driver\u2019s license (\u00a7 5357, subd: (a)); to own or possess firearms (\u00a7\u00a7 8100, 8102, 8103); to ^remain registered to vote (Elec. Code, \u00a7 701); and to enter into contracts (\u00a7 5357, subd. (b))).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">As this review illustrates, there can be no question that a finding of grave disability may result in serious deprivation of personal liberty. Indeed, a conservatee may be subjected to greater control of his or her life than one convicted of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">B. Stigma</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The second issue which must be resolved is whether any \u201cstigma\u201d attaches when an individual is found to be gravely disabled due to a mental disorder. Respondent argues that the public attitude toward a gravely disabled person is one of \u201csympathy.\u201d Unfortunately, this is not completely accurate. There is compelling evidence, which this court acknowledged in <em>Burnick, </em>that society still views the mentally ill with suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201cIn the ideal society, the mentally ill would be the subjects of understanding and compassion rather than ignorance and aversion. But that enlightened view, unfortunately, does not yet prevail. The stigma borne by the mentally ill has frequently been identified in the literature: \u2018a former mental patient may suffer from the social opprobrium which attaches to treatment for mental illness!<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>! and which may have more severe consequences than do the formally imposed disabilities. Many people have an \u201cirrational fear of the mentally ill.\u201d The former mental patient is likely to be treated with distrust and even loathing; he may be socially ostracized and victimized by employment and educational discrimination. Finally, the individual\u2019s hospitalization and posthospitalization experience may cause him to lose self-confidence and self-esteem. [11] The legal and social consequences of commitment constitute the stigma of mental illness, a stigma that could be as socially debilitating as that of a criminal conviction.\u2019 (Fns. omitted.) <em>(Developments in the Law\u2014Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill </em>(1974) 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1190, 1200-1201; accord, Rosenhan, <em>On Being Sane in Insane Places </em>(1973) 13 Santa Clara Law. 379, 385, and authorities cited in fn. 11.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Recently this court recognized the stigma which attaches to an individual who is found to be mentally ill. \u201cNot only is there physical restraint [when an individual is confined in a mental hospital], but there is injury to protected interests in reputation [citations], an interest in not being improperly or unfairly <em>stigmatized </em>as mentally ill or disordered.\u201d <em>(In re Roger S., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 921, 929, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Moreover, grave disability proceedings carry special threats to reputation. A finding of grave disability is equivalent to a finding that a person is unable to feed, clothe or house himself because of a mental disorder (\u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(1)). It is implausible that a person labelled by the state as so totally ill could go about, after his release, seeking employment, applying to schools, or meeting old acquaintances with his reputation fully intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A consistent line of cases decided by the United States Supreme Court and by this court require us to reject respondent\u2019s reliance on \u201ccivil\u201d labels and to hold that since grave disability proceedings \u201cseriously put at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>risk both the personal liberty and the good name of the individual, the safeguard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 630, 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The civil nature of grave disability proceedings is likewise an insufficient excuse for allowing a person to lose his liberty and good name at the hands of less than a unanimous jury. Under the trial judge\u2019s ruling, appellant theoretically could have been certified as gravely disabled and committed to a mental hospital, even though 3 of the 12 jurors found her perfectly sane. No defendant in a criminal case in California goes to prison after such a split jury vote. Yet, we have already seen that commitment equals imprisonment in its impact on a person\u2019s freedom. The inescapable conclusion is that the right to a unanimous juiy verdict applies to conservatorship proceedings under the LPS Act. Any other result would mock the care our legal system has historically taken to guard against incarcerating the wrong person.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The need for unanimous jury verdicts is all the more apparent when one considers the uncertainties that still surround psychiatric diagnoses. This court has recently noted that \u201cthe divergence of expert views . . . render[s] the possibility of mistake significantly greater [in the diagnosis of mental illness] than in diagnosis of physical illness.\u201d <em>(In re Roger S., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 921, 929.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Against this background of expert fallibility, the law must require, at a minimum, the jurors to agree among themselves that a diagnosis of grave disability was accurately made in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 351 [121 Cal.Rptr. 509, 535 P.2d 373], this court noted that a defendant in a mentally disordered sex offender proceeding was entitled to a unanimous jury verdict for \u201cthe same reasons\u201d that he was entitled to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 630, 644, this court again noted that a person threatened with civil commitment was entitled to a unanimous jury verdict for \u201cidentical reasons\u201d to those which entitled him to have his alleged narcotics addiction proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Thus, this court has twice explicitly recognized that jury unanimity and the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt are slices of the same due process pie. It would be curious indeed to grant appellant one without the other. Therefore, this court concludes that appellant is entitled to a unanimous jury verdict for reasons identical to those which entitle her to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Moreover, any interpretation of section 5350, subdivision (d) as <em>not </em>requiring a unanimous jury verdict would render that section unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection clauses of the California and federal Constitutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 5303 explicitly extends the protection of unanimous jury verdicts to commitment proceedings for imminently dangerous persons. Were gravely disabled persons facing possible commitment not entitled to the same protection, they would have just cause to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">This court has previously characterized the right to a unanimous jury verdict as \u201cfundamental.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 356.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Accordingly, the state must show the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d which would justify distinguishing between the rights of imminently dangerous and gravely disabled persons. <em>(In re Gary W., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 296, 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Respondent fails to demonstrate any such compelling interest. At most, respondent argues that there is a rational basis for distinguishing between the two classes of mentally ill persons. The alleged basis is that in grave disability proceedings, the state\u2019s interest is solely one of benevolence toward the individual. In imminently dangerous proceedings, on the other hand, the government has the additional adversary interest of protecting others from that individual. Respondent concludes that there is less danger of governmental abuse in grave disability proceedings given the benevolent state motives. Therefore, there is supposedly less need for heightened due process protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">This argument is spurious. History is haunted by the accusing cries of those locked away \u201cfor their own good.\u201d It would be small solace to a person wrongly judged mentally incompetent that his road to commitment was paved with good intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Moreover, this court has previously questioned whether the reality of commitment conforms to its benign purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 319-320.) In many cases the \u201cpromise of treatment has served only to bring an illusion of benevolence to what is essentially a warehousing operation for social misfits.\u201d <em>(Cross </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(D.C.Cir. 1969) 418 F.2d 1095, 1107.) For -these reasons, respondent\u2019s rational basis argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Common sense alone dictates that, if anything, grave disability proceedings should be hemmed in by more procedural safeguards than those surrounding imminently dangerous proceedings. This is because the LPS Act makes it <em>easier </em>to commit gravely disabled persons than imminently dangerous persons. In grave disability proceedings, the trier of fact need only be presented with a general showing that the individual cannot provide for his or her basic personal needs due to a mental disorder. (\u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(1).) However, a much more exact showing must be made in imminently dangerous proceedings, which require the demonstration of a threatened, attempted, or actually inflicted physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>harm on another person, as well as an imminent threat of substantial physical harm to others by reason of a mental disorder. (\u00a7 5304.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The easier the path to commitment, the more likely becomes the possibility of mistake. As the possibility of reaching a wrong decision increases, the number of juror votes required to commit a person certainly should not decrease. To allow a person to be certified as gravely disabled by 9 of 12 jurors, while requiring a jury to agree unanimously before a person can be found imminently dangerous, would be to stand the doctrine of equal protection on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 358, this court reached a parallel conclusion regarding the unanimous juiy verdict rights of mentally disordered sex offenders. The court noted that it was easier to commit mentally disordered sex offenders than those accused of being dangerous to others. The court concluded, as we do today, that surrounding the <em>easier </em>path to commitment with <em>less </em>procedural safeguards was nonsensical. \u201cThis is common sense turned upside down, a discrimination without semblance of rational basis\u2014let alone a compelling state interest, and a wholesale denial of equal protection of the laws under both the California and federal Constitutions.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">There is an additional consideration involved in the case before this court. Since a major function of standards of proof is to ensure the correctness of the eventual verdict<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an examination of the extent to which LPS Act conservatorship procedures are subject to factual distortions is helpful in showing why a high standard of proof is necessary to offset the effect of those distortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">A proposed conservatee\u2019s only opportunity to prove his mental competency is at trial on the issue of grave disability. In the typical case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>(including the case at bar), the potential conservatee is placed at an initial disadvantage because he. or she is likely to be confined prior to the trial\u2014either pursuant to a temporary conservatorship (\u00a7 5353) or the conservatorship which is to be reestablished (\u00a7 5358). These constraints limit the individual\u2019s ability to communicate freely with counsel, witnesses, and others in preparation for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Moreover, the individual\u2019s pretrial behavior during confinement can be and normally is introduced at the grave disability hearing to help justify predictions that the individual is and will continue to be gravely disabled. However, an individual\u2019s frantic or desperate reactions to involuntary commitment in a mental hospital do not, in themselves, prove that he is mentally ill. (See, e.g., Kesey, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest (1962).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cMental illness\u201d is generally acknowledged to be a vague and uncertain concept. Categories of mental diseases are notoriously unclear, often overlap, and frequently change.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The experts themselves often disagree on what is an appropriate diagnosis. (See p. 230, <em>ante.) </em>In addition, the literature reveals that some appointed counsel, regardless of how experienced they may be, tend to play a paternalistic rather than an advocacy role in commitment proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A recent empirical study of practice under the LPS Act confirms this observation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The combined effect of these factors\u2014the difficulty of defining mental illness, the factfinder\u2019s deference to psychiatric testimony, and the paternalistic attitude of some appointed counsel<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\u2014lends strong support to the conclusion that proof beyond a reasonable doubt and jury unanimity are constitutionally mandated standards necessary to assure that LPS Act conservatorships are accurately established.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The due process clause of the California Constitution requires that proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous jury verdict be applied to conservatorship proceedings under the LPS Act. This court\u2019s decisions in <em>Burnick, Feagley </em>and <em>Thomas </em>have already held as much in regard to other civil commitment proceedings. There is no logical reason to diverge from that path in this case. To turn back toward the repudiated criterion of the civil-criminal label serves only to exalt form over constitutional substance. Logic and law, as well as regard for the value of liberty, compel this court to follow those decisions today.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-12\">See Welfare and Institutions Code section 5350 et seq.

The majority see the issues to be essentially the same, and thus require the same standard of proof\u2014beyond reasonable doubt\u2014by an unanimous jury. But the issues are different in at least one essential ingredient. A criminal\u2019s removal from the general environment is deemed a punishment and also serves to protect the general public. The removal is not for the purpose of affording direct benefits to the defendant, although it is hoped that some rehabilitative purpose will be served.

The primaiy purpose for such removal is to benefit and protect that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Today\u2019s majority decision will make it more difficult to take action when the need for action is indicated.

As the seriousness of the consequences resulting from an erroneous judgment increase, a stricter standard is required to mitigate against the possibility of error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, 310.) In the context of the present case, the applicable standard should be determined in light of the nature and purpose of the proceedings, the potential deprivation of liberty, and the stigma incurred. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 315, 319, 321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Whether a proceeding is denominated civil or criminal, its nature and 1 purpose must be ascertained by examining its true character. <em>(In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, 365-366 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375-377]; <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 49-50 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 558-559, 87 S.Ct. 1428]; <em>Specht </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 605, 608-609 [18 L.Ed.2d 326, 329-330, 87 S.Ct. 1209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Grave disability is unrelated to criminal conduct.

The state\u2019s purpose is solely one of remedial treatment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 895, 904 [67 Cal.Rptr. 583]); it seeks neither retribution nor protection of society\u2014the government\u2019s primary interests in criminal prosecutions. <em>(Specht </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>386 U.S. at pp. 608-609 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 329-330]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 361-373 [121 Cal.Rptr. 509, 535 P.2d 373].) The Act serves to protect the person from the consequence of his own infirmity rather than to protect society from the person. When and if the conservatee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>confined, confinement occurs either in the private residence of a relative or in the hospital nearest the conservatee\u2019s home. Accordingly, it must be concluded the purpose of proceedings pursuant to the Act are remedial only, containing no element of either criminal or civil liability.

Such person may be confined in a hospital for up to one year. (\u00a7 5361.) However, potential confinement is controlled by extensive statutory safeguards. Confinement does not necessarily follow establishment of the conservatorship. (\u00a7 5358.) If it occurs at all, confinement is never in a jail, prison, or an institutional environment designed for the punishment of persons convicted of crimes. (\u00a7 5358.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, the conservatee is entitled to two hearings during the one-year period in addition to initial judicial determination. (\u00a7 5364.) The conservatee may also be released within one year if the conservator gives requisite notice. (\u00a7 6000.) At the end of one year, the conservatee has a right to immediate release. (\u00a7 5361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Some degree of stigma may attach to a person judicially determined to have been gravely disabled. However, the stigma is different both in degree and kind from that following criminal conviction or involuntary commitment as a mentally disordered sex offender. Criminal convictions carry society\u2019s approbrium based on fear and distrust. A gravely disabled person is far more likely to be viewed by society with compassion instead of fear. A prior criminal conviction may impose continuing legal impairment. The Act, on the other hand, prohibits even a presumption of incompetence. (\u00a7 5368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 306, is misplaced. Unlike the situation presented in the instant case, those cases involved criminal proceedings. In both cases the consequence of an adverse decision subjected the individual to the possibility of confinement in a penal institution. The state\u2019s asserted interest was primarily the protection of society. Both cases concerned much greater deprivation of liberty , than is here at issue. In <em>Burnick </em>the defendant was confined for an indeterminate period. In <em>Winship </em>the defendant was subject to potential confinement for six years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Further, the proceedings reviewed in <em>Winship </em>carried the greater stigma of a criminal conviction and in <em>Burnick </em>the additional burden of mentally disordered sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Balancing the benefit and purpose of the Act against adverse consequences to the individual clearly suggests the proper standard is clear and convincing proof. (See, <em>Woodby </em>v. <em>Immigration Service </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 276 [17 L.Ed.2d 362, 87 S.Ct. 483]; <em>Chaunt </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1960) 364 U.S. 350 [5 L.Ed.2d 120, 81 S.Ct. 147]; <em>Nishikawa </em>v. <em>Dulles </em>(1958) 356 U.S. 129 [2 L.Ed.2d 659, 78 S.Ct. 612].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The less demanding standard of preponderating evidence would be improper. While this standard would allow full and efficient implementation of the statutory purpose, it would fail to adequately safeguard the individual\u2019s rights. The consequences of a determination of grave disability may result in confinement for one year. This potential deprivation of liberty dictates a higher standard of proof be used to minimize risk of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Conversely, requiring the stricter standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inappropriate. While insulating the individual from the possibility of erroneous decision, this standard may also prevent individuals from receiving sorely needed aid. It must be remembered that while the consequences of an erroneous judgment finding a person gravely disabled are substantial, the consequences of an erroneous judgment finding a person not to be gravely disabled may well be more severe. In the latter case, an individual may quite literally be left to languish in the streets. Application of the criminal standard would threaten the beneficial statutory purpose while increasing the stigma.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The majority also err in concluding that grave disability can be found only by unanimous jury verdict. While the Act guarantees potential conservatees the right to a jury trial, it is silent as to whether the jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous. (\u00a7 5350, subd. (d).) As noted, however, the Act incorporates by reference Probate Code procedures for conservator-ships. (\u00a7 5350.) The Probate Code provides for factual determinations by a three-fourths majority when the factfinder is a jury. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1702, 1230, 1233; see Prob. Code, \u00a7 1755.) Thus, the Legislature has provided for less than unanimous jury verdicts in grave disability cases. Accordingly, the issue is whether the Legislature\u2019s direction is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>While the Constitution mandates unanimous verdicts in criminal proceedings, it permits a three-fourths jury verdict in other cases. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 352; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Thomas) </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 929, 932 [64 Cal.Rptr. 327, 434 P.2d 623].) Grave disability proceedings under the Act being civil in nature, the legislative decision does not violate the basic constitutional provision concerning the right to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In contrast, the Act provides for unanimous jury verdicts in imminently dangerous proceedings. (\u00a7 5303.) The majority appear to hold there to be a violation of equal protection clauses of the state and federal Constitutions in denying persons subject to grave disability proceedings the right to a unanimous jury verdict while granting such a right to persons subject to imminently dangerous proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The equal protection clauses (U. S. Const., Amend. XIV; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (b)) require that persons similarly situated receive like treatment under the law. (E.g., <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 71, 75-76 [30 L.Ed.2d 225, 229-230, 92 S.Ct. 251]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Merlo </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 855, 861 [106 Cal.Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212, 66 A.L.R.3d 505]; <em>Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 566, 578 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645, 38 A.L.R.3d 1194].) Classifications must be reasonable in light of the purpose to be served. (E.g., <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 305, 308-309 [16 L.Ed.2d 577, 579-580, 86 S.Ct. 1497]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Merlo, supra, </em>at p. 861; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 216, 223 [98 Cal.Rptr. 449, 490 P.2d 1137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The verdict disparity between an imminent danger proceeding and a grave disability proceeding is justified because the persons subject to the different procedures are not similarly situated. Unlike a gravely disabled person, an imminently dangerous person poses a threat of harm to others. This danger gives rise to a governmental interest, analogous to the governmental interest in criminal proceedings. When the government\u2019s actions are motivated not only by benevolence towards the individual, but also by an interest in protecting others from the individual\u2019s behavior, potential for abuse exists. The proceedings may be misused as a substitute for criminal prosecution, justifying the additional safeguard of jury unanimity to protect the individual against the risk of error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 361 et seq.) This additional governmental interest is reflected by the fact that commitment of those found to be imminently dangerous is mandatory. (\u00a7 5304.) Because this interest is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>present in grave disability proceedings, imminently dangerous and gravely disabled persons are not similarly situated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The purpose of the Act\u2019s grave disability provisions is to provide prompt, short term treatment and care to those unable to feed, clothe, and shelter themselves. Obviously, the Legislature\u2019s classification in light of this purpose is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The majority gratuitously conclude, based on materials not part of <em>the </em>record herein, that because of \u201cthe difficulty of defining mental illness, the factfinder\u2019s deference to psychiatric testimony, and the paternalistic attitude of some appointed counsel\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p. 235), proof beyond a reasonable doubt and jury unanimity are \u201cconstitutionally mandated.\u201d There is no showing that any of the nebulous factors played any part in the instant factual determination that the conservatee is a gravely disabled person within the meaning' of the act, yet these factors are now held to constitutionally mandate the majority\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">While the majority seek out reasons supporting the strictest test for determining grave disability\u2014even straying far from the record to do so\u2014they pay little or no heed to reasons for rejecting their conclusions. In determining the standard of proof and the jury requirement we are concerned with the possibility of error in judicial proceedings. In the event of such error there is the possibility that some persons not mentally ill may be confined, but there is also the risk that persons who\u2014due to mental illness\u2014are unable to take care of themselves will not receive care and treatment. The latter persons are faced with release without the ability to survive. Consideration of the right to freedom by persons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>may be erroneously committed requires rejection of the standard of proof by a mere preponderance of the evidence; humanitarian considerations for persons who may be erroneously released require rejection of the criminal standard\u2014proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014and the unanimous verdict requirement. I am satisfied that such humanitarian considerations for the mentally ill require us to opt in favor of a clear and convincing proof test and the three-fourths jury verdict. The Legislature\u2019s decision to provide for less than an unanimous jury verdict to support a finding of grave disability is consistent with constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">I concur that the judgment must be reversed, but only for the reason that the jury was instructed to find on the question of grave disability by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by clear and convincing evidence. In all other respects I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Richardson, J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied March 29, 1979, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Clark, J., and Richardson, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\">All references herein to the Act are to the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5350 et seq.) and unless otherwise specified all other statutory references are to the designated sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The majority appear to argue that because persons convicted of crimes who are determined to be mentally disordered are often confined in state hospitals\u2014as may be a mentally disordered person not convicted of a crime\u2014confinement in a state hospital is tantamount to confinement in prison. <em>(Ante, </em>p. 226.) The logic of such argument escapes me.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The majority improperly rely on <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 356 <em>(ante, </em>pp. 229-233) for the theory that because a fundamental interest is involved\u2014the right to a unanimous jury verdict\u2014the state must demonstrate a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d justifying the distinction between grave disability and imminent danger proceedings. The majority err first in assuming the very thing at issue. They state that this \u201ccourt has previously characterized the right to a unanimous jury verdict as \u2018fundamental,\u2019 \u201d citing <em>Feagley. (Ante, </em>pp. 231-232.) The issue, of course, is whether the right to a jury verdict in grave disability proceedings is \u201cfundamental.\u201d <em>Feagley </em>dealt with mentally disordered sex offender proceedings. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6300 et seq.) Thus the proceedings in <em>Feagley </em>were of an entirely different character. The defendant there had been charged with and convicted of a criminal offense as a precondition to proceedings to determine his status as a mentally disordered sex offender. He was exposed in such proceedings to commitment in an institutional unit within a state prison\u2014not a state hospital as in the instant case. This court noted in <em>Feagley </em>the more severe circumstances of confinement in such a unit when compared to confinement in a state hospital, contrary to the argument elsewhere urged by the majority in this case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Feagley, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 338, 346-347.) The majority thus improperly rely on <em>Feagley </em>as they fail to demonstrate the same or similar fundamental right at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
