Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 15065, subd. (c).) Because the Port was the first to act on the Sohio project, it became the lead agency and hence was required to defend the adequacy of the entire EIR under Public Resources Code section ,21167; the PUC thereby became a \u201cresponsible\u201d agency <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 21069), whose actions are governed by section 21167.3. Accordingly, although the PUC could not properly be made a party because its joinder would \u201cdeprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389, subd. (a)), the court should have permitted the action to proceed against the Port alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">For the foregoing reasons, it is ordered that the above-entitled cause be transferred to the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Bird, C.
