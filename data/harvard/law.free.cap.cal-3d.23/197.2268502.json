J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-A\">The California Department of Corrections petitions for review of a decision by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (hereafter WCAB) awarding death benefits to respondent Deanna Antrim. This court must decide whether the WCAB had the authority to award death benefits under Labor Code section 4701 et seq. to a deceased\u2019s minor child of a prior marriage when the deceased\u2019s surviving spouse had elected to receive special death benefits under Government Code section 21363.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">This case involves two distinct statutory schemes for benefits on the death of a qualified employee. The workers\u2019 compensation law provides \u201cdeath benefits\u201d under Labor Code section 4701 et seq. \u201cSpecial death benefits\u201d are payable on the death of certain classes of public employees under Government Code section 21360 et seq. The Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (hereafter PERS), which is controlled by a board of administration, provides these benefits. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 20100 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">When an employee suffers an injuiy which results in death and arises out of his employment, the workers\u2019 compensation law provides that the employer is liable to pay a death benefit to the deceased employee\u2019s dependents. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4701.) The value of the benefit is set by statute and does not vary with the deceased employee\u2019s income. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4702.) The extent of an individual\u2019s dependency on the deceased employee (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3500 et seq.) usually determines the amount of the death benefit awarded to that person. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4703 .)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Labor Code section 4707 imposes certain restrictions when one or more surviving dependents are eligible for special death benefits from PERS. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cNo benefits . . . shall be awarded under this division . . . unless it shall be determined that a special death benefit, as defined in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law, . . . will not be paid ... to the widow or children under 18 years of age, of the deceased . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This section nevertheless assures that when special death benefits are awarded, the total benefits will not be less than the death benefits payable under the workers\u2019 compensation law. Further, the WCAB has been granted broad powers in Labor Code section 4704 to reassign or reapportion any death benefit \u201cin a just and equitable manner.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">When the deceased in the present case died, special death benefits were payable under PERS \u201cif the deceased was a patrol, prison, state safety, state industrial or local safety member,\u201d the death was industrial, and the deceased\u2019s widow or child qualified under Government Code section 21364. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 21363.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Government Code section 21364 specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the method for calculating the amount of the special death benefit and the order of distribution. If there were a surviving spouse, the entire benefit was payable to her. If there were no surviving spouse, or if the spouse died or remarried before any of the deceased\u2019s children attained age 18, these children were collectively entitled to the benefit. However, no child could receive any part of the allowance after marrying or reaching age 18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">There are significant differences between these two systems of death benefits. If special death benefits are payable, the total benefits will at least equal those payable under the Labor Code, and may be substantially greater. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 4707; compare Lab. Code, \u00a7 4702 with Gov. Code, \u00a7 21364.) In addition, eligibility for any benefit is markedly different. An individual must have been dependent on the deceased in order to collect any death benefit under the Labor Code. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4701, subd. (b).) There is no such requirement for entitlement to a special death benefit. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 21363.) Further, while death benefits payable under the Labor Code are shared among those equally entitled (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4703), special death benefits are payable exclusively to the deceased\u2019s spouse. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 21364, subd. (b).) Only if the spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>has died or remarried does the statute permit an award to the deceased\u2019s children. It is the disparate treatment provided by these two systems of compensation that led to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Dale Wesley Antrim was employed as a correctional officer by petitioner, Department of Corrections. On May 23, 1975, he suffered a cardiac arrest due to a myocardial infarction and died. His widow, Lorene Antrim, filed a claim with the WCAB for special death benefits under Government Code section 21363, a provision of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 20000 et seq.) As a result, PERS was made a party to that proceeding. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4708.) A second claim for death benefits was filed with the WCAB by the deceased\u2019s minor daughter from a prior marriage, Deanna Antrim. Deanna was 16 years old and living with her mother at the time of her father\u2019s death. The two claims were consolidated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The parties stipulated that the injury to the deceased\u2019s heart arose out of and occurred in the course of his employment and proximately caused his death. That stipulation entitled the deceased\u2019s widow to special death benefits from PERS. However, in accordance with the provisions of Government Code section 21364, subdivision (b), PERS stated that the deceased\u2019s minor daughter was not entitled to any special death benefits. Eligibility for such benefits would occur only if the deceased\u2019s widow died or remarried and Deanna had neither married nor attained age 18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge held that since the deceased\u2019s widow had elected to receive special death benefits from PERS, Labor Code section 4707 precluded Deanna from receiving any death benefit under the workers\u2019 compensation law. However, he found that this construction of section 4707 would deny equal protection of the law to an employee\u2019s dependents who were not protected under Government Code section 21364. Nevertheless, the judge denied any death benefit to Deanna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>because he believed he lacked the power to rule on a statute\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On reconsideration, the WCAB awarded a death benefit to Deanna on the theory that Labor Code section 4707 guaranteed that \u201cthe children as well as the widow are at least entitled to the Death Benefit in the Labor Code. Thus, since the child in the instant case has not received any funds from the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, said child is entitled to the difference of what she should have received. In this case [the child is awarded] one-half of $45,000.00 as per Labor Code section 4701.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The Department of Corrections petitioned for review on the ground that Labor Code section 4707 precluded the WCAB from awarding any death benefit to the deceased\u2019s minor child and further argued that this interpretation of section 4707 did not deny Deanna equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Article XIV, section 4, of the California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to create and enforce \u201ca complete system of workers\u2019 compensation ... to compensate any or all . . . workers for injuiy or disability, and their dependents for death incurred or sustained by the said workers in the course of their employment.... A complete system of workers\u2019 compensation includes adequate provisions for the comfort, health and safety and general welfare of any and all workers and those dependent upon them for support . . . .\u201d The workers\u2019 compensation laws codified in Labor Code section 3200 et seq. are intended to implement that objective and provide \u201ca complete system of [workers\u2019] compensation . . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The Legislature has mandated that those statutes be \u201cliberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.)  Accordingly, \u201c[w]here provisions of [the workers\u2019 compensation] laws are susceptible of an interpretation either beneficial or detrimental to injured employees or an ambiguity appears, they must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>be construed favorably to the employees.\u201d <em>(Granado </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 399, 404 [71 Cal.Rptr. 678, 445 P.2d 294]; see <em>Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 668 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564]; <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1950) 34 Cal.2d 772, 776 [215 P.2d 16].) That statutory presumption unquestionably applies to the construction of statutes governing death benefits. (E.g., <em>L. B. Price Mercantile Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 13, 14-15 [313 P.2d 860]; see <em>Arndt </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 139, 147 [128 Cal.Rptr. 250].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">However, Labor Code section 4707 provides that no death benefits shall be paid if special death benefits from PERS are paid \u201cto the widow <em>or </em>children under 18 years of age, of the deceased . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In this case, the deceased\u2019s widow was awarded the entire special death benefit under Government Code sections 21363 and 21364. Therefore, the workers\u2019 compensation judge correctly found that Labor Code section 4707 did not permit an award to the deceased\u2019s minor child. In light of the statute\u2019s clear language, the WCAB\u2019s construction to the contrary to justify an award to the child is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Nevertheless, our inquiry does not end here since the Legislature also expressly granted the WCAB discretion in awarding death benefits. \u201cThe appeals board may set apart or reassign the death benefit to any one or more of the dependents in accordance with their respective needs and in a just and equitable manner, and <em>may order payment to a dependent subsequent in right, or not otherwise entitled thereto, upon good cause being shown therefor. . . </em>.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 4704, italics added.) The expansive authority vested in the WCAB by section 4704 has long been recognized by our courts. (E.g., <em>California C.I. Exch. </em>v. <em>Indus. Acc. Com. </em>(1930) 211 Cal. 218, 220-222 [295 P. 34]; see also 1 Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Handbook (2d ed. 1978) \u00a7 9.18, p. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The seemingly apparent conflict between the prohibition in Labor Code section 4707 and the authorization in Labor Code section 4704 to award death benefits even to dependents \u201cnot otherwise entitled thereto\u201d is readily resolved.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   The objective of the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>provisions regarding death benefits is to provide compensation to a deceased employee\u2019s dependents. (See <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 219, 222-223 [14 Cal.Rptr. 548, 363 P.2d 596]; <em>Van Horn </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 457, 466-467 [33 Cal.Rptr. 169].)  The special benefits provided under PERS were intended to provide compensation beyond that payable under the workers\u2019 compensation law in recognition of the special hazards involved in certain categories of public employment. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 21202.)  Thus, it would be improper to read these statutes narrowly to strip death benefits from a minor child who would be entitled to benefits under the provisions governing dependents of most other workers. Rather, Labor Code section 4704 is properly construed liberally (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202) to authorize the WCAB to award death benefits even to dependents denied death benefits under Labor Code section 4707 and Government Code section 21364, if \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In the past, this court has upheld eligibility for compensatory benefits in analogous circumstances. In <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Indus. Acc. Com. </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 189 [93 P.2d 131] (hereafter <em>DMV), </em>this court was asked to determine whether a state highway patrol officer could receive a permanent partial disability award after he had returned to work at full salary. As is true in the present case, the officer was subject to special statutory rules. Specifically, Labor Code section 4804 provided that \u201c[n]o disability indemnity shall be paid . . . concurrently with wages or salary payments. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">A unanimous court reasoned that \u201c[i]nasmuch as state employees generally or employees in industrial life are not deprived of compensation for permanent injuries under the circumstances here existing,\u201d the court should adopt a construction which would allow this employee to be similarly compensated, absent an express statutory prohibition. <em>(DMV, supra, </em>14 Cal.2d at p. 192.) The court rejected the assertion that the officer was not entitled to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law since he was \u201camply provided for under the Retirement Act,\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ground that the provisions of the latter did not control the construction of the former. <em>(DMV, supra, </em>14 Cal.2d at p. 195.) Therefore, in light of the mandate in Labor Code section 3202 for a liberal construction, the court narrowly interpreted the limitation in section 4804 to permit the employee to collect both his salary and disability payments. <em>(DMV, supra, </em>14 Cal.2d at pp. 193-194.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Hoover </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 145 [258 P.2d 4], a widow\u2019s pension <em>for the </em>death <em>of her </em>fireman-husband was reduced by the amount of the death benefits awarded to her and her minor children under the workers\u2019 compensation law. The city charter provided that any pension paid by the city because of the retirement or death of an employee shall be reduced \u201cby the amount of any benefits payable to or on account of such person, under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation [Act]. ... It is the express intent . . . that double payments, in whole or in part, at the expense of the taxpayers, shall not be permitted.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 148.) The city argued that this provision authorized deductions from the widow\u2019s pension in the amount of the death benefits paid to her and her children. However, this court found the provision could also be interpreted to authorize deductions only for benefits paid to her. Since the court was bound to adopt a construction consistent with the beneficial purposes of the pension provisions, the court unanimously held the pension could riot be reduced by any benefits payable to others, including the minor children. <em>(Id, </em>at p. 149.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The lesson of these decisions is clear. If a provision in a compensatoiy scheme may be reasonably construed to provide coverage or payments, that construction should usually be adopted even if another reasonable construction is possible. In this way, the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing the workers\u2019 compensation law, as evident in Labor Code section 3202, is given its full recognition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>To construe Labor Code sections 4704 and 4707 as denying the WCAB authority to award death benefits to Deanna would raise the serious constitutional question whether the deceased\u2019s minor child would be denied equal protection of the law. That construction would make Deanna ineligible for the death benefits provided by statute to all other surviving dependent minor children. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4701, 4703.) No legislative purpose has yet been offered which would \u201crationally justify] the disparate treatment\u201d to which dependent minor children of PERS safety employees would thereby be subjected. (See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Bray </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 841, 851 [148 Cal.Rptr. 148, 582 P.2d 604]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Merlo </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 855, 861 [106 Cal.Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212, 66 A.L.R.3d 505].)  By interpreting section 4704 to authorize an award of death benefits to Deanna, this court adheres to the maxim that \u201clegislation should be construed, if reasonably possible, to preserve its constitutionality . . .\u201d and thus avoids the constitutional issue inherent in a contrary construction. <em>(Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 294, 305 [138 Cal.Rptr. 53, 562 P.2d 1302]; <em>Palmero </em>v. <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 60 [195 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The award by the WCAB to respondent Deanna Antrim is annulled since it was based on an erroneous interpretation of Labor Code section 4707.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The matter is remanded to the WCAB to determine if there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for granting benefits in conformity with Labor Code section 4704.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., Manuel, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\u201cBasic death benefits\u201d are also payable under PERS, but such benefits are not relevant to this case.

Code, \u00a7 4703.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\">This court is not persuaded by petitioner\u2019s contention that section 4707 should take precedence because it is a more specific statute. In section 4704, the Legislature authorized the WCAB to deviate from the specific pattern of benefit distribution prescribed in other sections. In so doing, the Legislature made section 4704 an exception to the other sections. There is nothing in either section 4704 or section 4707 which expressly provides that the authority granted under section 4704 is inapplicable when section 4707 applies. Therefore, the fact that section 4707 is more narrowly focused does not mean that section 4707 controls when both' sections are applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">This conclusion does not nullify section 4707. When section 4707 applies, that section precludes the routine award of death benefits under Labor Code sections 4701-4703. That prohibition is lifted only upon a showing of good cause in accordance with the provisions of Labor Code section 4704.</p>\n<p id=\"Axn\">In reviewing applications by dependents for death benefits when section 4707 applies, the WCAB is free to consider, as in other circumstances, any factor which would be relevant in determining the existence of \u201cgood cause.\u201d This would include any statutory duty of support owed by the recipient of the special death benefit to the applicant. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 196,206, 242.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">See also <em>City of Palo Alto </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc.

In <em>Seagrave, </em>an award of death benefits to a deceased public employee\u2019s minor son was challenged. The Court of Appeal held that Labor Code section 4707 prohibited such an award since the deceased\u2019s widow'had received special death benefits under Government Code section 21363. However, that decision failed to consider the significance of Labor Code section 4704. No mention of that provision appears. Accordingly, that court did not rule on the question presented in this case\u2014the effect of Labor Code section 4704 on section 4707.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Labor Code section 3501 provides that a minor child under the age of 18 is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased parent if the child were living with the parent, or the parent were legally liable for the child\u2019s maintenance, at the time of the parent\u2019s injury. Dependency may also be established in accordance with Labor Code sections 3502 and 3503. This court need not decide at this time whether there was substantial evidence to support the WCAB\u2019s implicit finding that respondent Deanna Antrim was wholly dependent upon her deceased father since the matter is remanded to the WCAB.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
