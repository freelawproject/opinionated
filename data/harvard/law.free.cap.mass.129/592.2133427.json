The case was submitted to the Suoerior Court, and, after judgment for the plaintiff, to this court on appeal, on an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>On February 27, 1879, the plaintiff, with his schooner, was in the waters of Charles River below Warren Bridge, loaded with coal to be landed at a wharf above the bridge, and had a tugboat with him engaged to tow his schooner to the wharf. He applied to the superintendent of the bridge, having charge of the draw, to have the draw opened for him to pass with his schooner. The superintendent refused to open the draw, oi the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s schooner was too wide to pas: through the draw. The schooner was detained one day, during which time the draw was widened to thirty-six feet in the clear and the schooner then passed through the draw. Before this widening, the draw was thirty-five feet and eight inches in width. The plaintiff\u2019s schooner was thirty-five feet and eight inches wide, and had, with a cargo of railroad iron on board, been up and down through the draw in January 1878, and up in July 1878, without difficulty, but stuck therein when coming down in July 1878, and was got through with difficulty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">The care and management of Warren Bridge and draw were, by the St. of 1870, <em>c. </em>303, \u00a7 5, vested in a board of commissioners, consisting of one person from the city of Boston and one person from the city of Charlestown, before which time the Commonwealth had assumed control of the bridge and draw, and had at different times collected tolls. The width of the draw is fixed by the St. of 1870, <em>e. </em>401, at thirty-six feet. In pursuance of the provisions of these statutes, the court appointed commissioners, who awarded that the expense of maintaining the bridge be borne by the two cities equally, and their award was accepted and confirmed by the court on April 18, 1871. During the latter part of the year 1872, this board of commissioners entirely reconstructed the draw. In January 1874, Charlestown was annexed to Boston, and the care, management and maintenance of the bridge was imposed upon the city of Boston by the St. of 1874, <em>c. </em>259, and, in the same year, a superintendent of the bridge was elected by the city council of Boston, whose duties are prescribed by certain city ordinances. The draw was, on Febi\u2019uary 27, 1879, of the same width as it was when the St. of 1874 went into effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-5\">If the plaintiff was entitled to recover, judgment was to be entered for him in the sum of $89.75; otherwise, for the defendant</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>G.

It is well settled in this Commonwealth, that no private action can be maintained against a city for the neglect to perform such a duty, unless it is expressly authorized by statute. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>122 Mass. 344, and cases cited. ' By statute, the city is liable to a traveller thereon for any defect in the highway of which the bridge is a part, but there is no statute which makes it liable to a private action for a failure to provide a draw of proper width, or for the carelessness of the superintendent of the bridge in delaying vessels which seek to pass through the draw. It follows that the plaintiff cannot maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
