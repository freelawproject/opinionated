On April 20, 1880, judgment was rendered in the Superior Court for the plaintiff against the defendant; but no judgment was entered as to the trustee, and no execution issued against the defendant. On May 8,1880, the defendant applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws; the first publication of notice of issuing the warrant was made on May 10; and the assignment in insolvency was made on June 11. On October 16, the assignee in insolvency was admitted a\u00bb a claimant of the funds in the hands of the <em>trustee; </em>and the question arose whether the plaintiff was entitled to the fund under the St. of 1880, <em>e. </em>246, \u00a7 7, (which took effect on May 24, 1880,) or the claimant under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>118, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 44. Baeon, J. allowed the claim of the claimant, and discharged the trustee; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-10\"><em>H. A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq-d\">An assignment in insolvency relates back to the date of the first publication of notice of the issuing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>warrant, and has effect as of that time. <em>Clarke </em>v. Minot, 4 Met. 846. <em>Andrews </em>v. Southwich, 13 Met. 535. <em>Gallup </em>v. Robinson, 11 Gray, 20. <em>Butler </em>v. Mullen, 100 Mass. 453. But the extent of its operation depends on the law in force when the assignment is made. Attachments of the debtor\u2019s property are dissolved, not by the publication of notice, but by the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">An assignment in insolvency, under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>118, \u00a7 44, dissolved all attachments existing at the time of the first publication of notice, without regard to the length of time they had been in force. But no assignment of this defendant\u2019s estate was ever made under those statutes, nor until after the St. of 1880, <em>c. </em>246, \u00a7 7, had taken effect, which saves all attachments made more than four months before the commencement of the proceedings. l\u00edo right to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s attachment had vested before the passage of this statute, and the effect of any assignment made since its passage is limited by its provisions. It was therefore erroneously ruled in the Superior Court that the plaintiff\u2019s attachment was dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
