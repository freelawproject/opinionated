Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Dewey, </em>J., who reported the case for the determination of this court in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">No notice of the injury was given to the defendant until February 13, 1879, when it was given by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The defendant contended that the plaintiff could not maintain this action, because she had not given the notice required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>statute. The judge ruled that, when notice is not given until after thirty days from the time of the accident, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the omission to give the notice was on account of physical or mental incapacity to give it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-4\">Evidence was introduced as to the plaintiff\u2019s physical and mental capacity during and after said thirty days. The judge ruled that if the jury found that the plaintiff was not so incapacitated either physically or mentally but that she might have given the notice required by statute, through some other person, within the thirty days after the accident, though she was not able to go personally and give it, on account of physical inability, and she did not give nor cause any notice to be given until after the thirty days, she could not maintain this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. If the rulings were erroneous, the verdict was to be set aside and a new trial ordered; otherwise, judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-6\"><em>W. A. Gile, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-7\"><em>F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhT\">The rulings at the trial were correct. The notice required by the St. of 1877, <em>c. </em>234, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, before bringing an action for an injury occasioned by a defect in a highway, may be given by the person injured, or by any other person in his behalf; and, if the person injured is neither physically nor mentally incapacitated to give such notice himself or through another person, is a condition precedent to the right of action. <em>Kenady </em>v. Lawrence, 128 Mass. 318. <em>Gay </em>v. Cambridge, 128 Mass. 387. <em>Larkin </em>v. Boston, 128 Mass. 521. The case at bar does not present the question what might be the effect if the person injured continued to be so incapacitated for two years after the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
