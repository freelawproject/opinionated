Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Brigham, C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\">On July 3, 1876, the plaintiff executed and delivered to the Cambridge Savings Bank a mortgage deed of certain premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>in Cambridge, to secure Ms note of $1300, with interest; and, on August 22, 1876, he executed and delivered to the defendant a quitclaim deed of the same premises, containing the following clause: \u201c This conveyance is subject to a mortgage to the Cambridge Savings Bank for thirteen hundred dollars, with interest, wMch the grantee is to assume and pay, also the taxes of 1876.\u201d The defendant paid interest on the mortgage note due in January and July 1877, and January 1878, and taxes on the premises. The defendant not having paid the mortgage note of $1300, the plaintiff voluntarily paid the same, and, on December 18, 1877, the bank assigned to him the mortgage and the note of $1300 secured thereby. The last payment of interest on the note by the defendant was made to the plaintiff on January 10, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\">The defendant offered to prove that, at the time the plaintiff made the mortgage deed, the plaintiff held the legal title to the mortgaged premises for the benefit of the defendant and others, heirs at law of the defendant\u2019s father; and that the mortgage was given to take up the defendant\u2019s share of a previous mortgage of said premises given by his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-5\">The judge rejected this evidence as incompetent; and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for $1427.50. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-6\"><em>D.

Tolman, 124 Mass. 254, and the cases there cited. This defendant accepted such a deed, and has failed to pay the mortgage which he thereby assumed and agreed to pay. The plaintiff thereupon paid the mortgage debt, and has brought this action to recover the amount so paid. It is true that, instead of cancelling the note and mortgage, he has had them assigned to himself, but, in such a state of facts, such an assignment to the promisor of his own note and mortgage can have no other effect than as.a discharge of the debt. <em>Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>v. <em>Lapham, </em>3 Cush. 551. The transaction was in substance and effect a payment of the debt. <em>Carlton </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>121 Mass. 592. The facts which the defendant offered to prove, as to the trust under which the plaintiff held the land at the time of the mortgage, do not appear to us to furnish any ground for relieving the defendant of his legal obligation, and the evidence was therefore properly excluded. Even if the evidence as to the trust had been received, the payment was still for the defendant\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled\u25a0.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
