Writ dated October 12, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Colburn, J., the plaintiff put in the note, and rested his case. The note exhibited at the trial corresponded with the copy in the declaration, except that there was a memorandum at the bottom of the note at the left of the signature, as follows: \u201c Due Oct. 12, Oct. 11,\u201d in ink.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">The defendant requested the judge to nonsuit the plaintiff for the variance between the note exhibited and the copy in the declaration. But the judge ruled that the memorandum was immaterial, and no part of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\">The defendant then offered to prove that the memorandum had been altered since the execution and delivery of the note, it having been originally as follows: \u201cDue Oct. 11, Oct. 12,\u201d in pencil; that the parties had intended to date the note September</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">14, and discovered the error simultaneously with the signing, and after the first part of the memorandum, \u201c Due Oct. 11,\u201d had been written; and that the plaintiff, before the delivery of the note, at his own suggestion and with the assent of the defendant, wrote after the words \u201c Due Oct. 11 \u201d the words \u201c Oct. 12,\" for the purpose of correcting the error in the date, and of signifying the agreement of the parties that the note should not become due and payable until October 12.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-12\">The judge ruled that this evidence was incompetent; and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-13\"><em>F.

Freeman, </em>13 Pick. 165. Thus it was held in <em>Heywood </em>v. Perrin, 10 Pick. 228, that a note purporting on its face to be payable on demand was changed into a note payable in one year, by the addition of a memorandum below the promisor\u2019s signature, by consent of parties, and before the delivery of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The defendant says that the memorandum which was added to this note was originally written \u201c Due Oct. 11,\u201d and that, for the purpose of correcting an error in the date of the note, it was altered by adding the words \u201c Oct. 12.\u201d That is to say, his claim is that the memorandum should read, \u201c Due Oct. 11, Oct. 12.\u201d But it is obvious that such a memorandum is repugnant and self-contradictory, and, for that reason, it is not to be considered as a part of the contract, or sufficient to contradict the terms used in the body of the note. Parol evidence as to what the parties meant by it would be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
