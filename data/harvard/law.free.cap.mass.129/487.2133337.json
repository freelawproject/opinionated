J. Elwell, a deputy sheriff, who testified that he seized, on March 8, 1880, a quantity of beer in a cask in the defendant\u2019s place of business, which was a grocery and saloon in Westborough, in which place was a beer-pump, bar and other saloon fixtures; and also the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>a chemist, who analyzed the sample of beer seized by Elwell, that the beer contained six per cent of alcohol and was lager beer. J. W. Fairbanks, a witness for the government, testified that the defendant, on May 24, 1880, testified in court that he had some intoxicating liquor at his store some six weeks or two months before, and that he then conveyed the same to his house. This evidence was admitted against the defendant\u2019s exception. The district attorney, against the defendant\u2019s objection, was then allowed to ask the witness if the defendant at this time said anything about having the liquor in question in connection with the trial of this case before the magistrate, on or about March 15, 1880; to which the witness, against the defendant\u2019s objection, answered that the defendant said he had it when he went out of business, which was a week or ten days after the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-5\"><em>W. A. Gile, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-6\"><em>G.

We see no ground on which the defendant could object to proof that on the 24th day of May last, in court, he testified that he had intoxicating liquor at his shop some six weeks or two months before that date, and that he then conveyed it to his house. The prosecuting officer then inquired in substance, \u201c Did he then say anything about having the liquor in question, in connection with the trial before the magistrate who issued the warrant ? \u201d which trial was on the 15th day of March last. To this question the witness answered that the defendant testified that he had the liquor when he went out of business, which was a week or ten days after the complaint. To this evidence the defendant excepted. We think, however, that where there is evidence of a continuous business, such as the keeping of a saloon, it is allowable to show the general course of business, such as the fitting up and furnishing of the place, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>keeping of goods or liquors, apparently for sale, at and about the time charged in the complaint. Upon the question of intent, in such a case, the acts of the defendant soon after, as well as shortly before, the act complained of, may have a bearing. There were circumstances from which the keeping with intent to sell might well be inferred, and the government might prove a continuous keeping, even to a period a week or ten days later than the date charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
