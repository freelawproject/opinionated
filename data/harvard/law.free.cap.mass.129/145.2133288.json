The defendant called an expert; and offered to prove by him that at other times he had made experiments with such \u201cspirals\u201d in boilers, and that they were not capable under any circumstances of making any saving whatever.

The question whether they would do so was agreed to be left to be decided upon actual experiment by the defendant\u2019s engineer. \u25a0 It is reported as a fact found by the court, sitting without a jury, that the experiment was tried by the engineer, and showed a saving exceeding twelve per cent. His decision was rendered accordingly, and is to be considered as the award of a referee under a submission to arbitration. In the absence of any suggestion of fraud, this award cannot be impeached on the ground of any error in judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>his part, in drawing conclusions from the evidence before him. The case falls within the rule laid down in <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>106 Mass. 873, 389, and <em>Flint </em>v.
