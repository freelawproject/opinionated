Howarth, in which suit a general attachment was made, on December 21, 1874, of the real estate of Elizabeth B. Howarth in Suffolk County. The sheriff\u2019s deed to the plaintiff bears date June 3, 1876, and was duly recorded the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The tenant at the date of the demandant\u2019s writ in this action, was the owner of a mortgage upon the demanded premises, dated May 10, 1875, acknowledged May 17, 1875, and recorded August 9,1875, from \u201c Charles O. Manny and Elizabeth B. Manny, (formerly Elizabeth B. Howarth), his wife in her right.\u201d By the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgagors were to pay $1400 in three years from date, and interest semiannually on June 1 and December 1 in each year. The usual clause, that until breach of condition the grantee should have no right to enter and take possession of the premises, was omitted. No actual possession of the premises under the mortgage, or otherwise, had been taken by the tenant. The interest on the mortgage debt was paid only to December 1, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">Elizabeth B. Manny, whose former name was Elizabeth B. Howarth, was married to Charles O. Manny at some time prior to November 12, 1874, and took the name of Elizabeth B. Manny; and the premises were conveyed to her, and the deed recorded some years before her said marriage, when her name was Elizabeth B. Howarth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">A conveyance of other real estate in Suffolk County was made and recorded in the registry of deeds on November 14, 1874, by and in the name of Charles O. Manny and said Elizabeth B. Manny, his wife, in her right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">The plaintiff did not know or hear of the marriage of Elizabeth B. Howarth until after the entry of his writ in January 1875, and knew her only by'her maiden name; and the cause of action upon which he obtained judgment against her was a contract, dated November 7,1874, signed \u201cElizabeth B. Howarth by C. O. Manny.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-8\">On these facts the court was to enter such judgment as the case might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>C.

F. </em>Kittredge, for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_p\">The attachment of December 14, 1874, was not valid against this tenant, who took the mortgage without notice of any attachment. Although the defendant in the former suit did not plead the misnomer, yet the mortgagee was not a party to that suit, and can in no way be affected by anything she did or failed to do. It is immaterial to the issue in this case whether or not the demandant knew that Miss Howarth had become Mrs. Manny, or that his contract with her was in her former name. He was bound to know her correct name when he brought his suit, or take the consequences of bringing a suit and making an attachment which was of no effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-4\">The defendant in the first suit, in her legal name of Manny, made a conveyance of other real estate in Suffolk County, and the deed was recorded on November 14, 1874, a month and ten days before the plaintiff\u2019s attachment was made in the name of Howarth. The plaintiff now attempts to make the savings bank suffer for his ignorance of the defendant\u2019s name in the first suit. The savings bank had no notice and no means of knowing whether the real estate was under attachment except from the records and copies of writs filed in the registry of deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">At the time the mortgage was taken and recorded, there was no copy of a writ or record of any kind showing an attachment upon the real estate of Elizabeth B. Manny; and neither at the time when the mortgage was taken nor at the time when the attachment was made was there in existence any person by the name of Elizabeth B. Howarth. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>123, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 52. St. 1873, <em>c. </em>297, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">As the tenant was never in possession of the demanded premises, under its mortgage or otherwise, the demandant cannot recover possession of the premises in this action; his writ should have been brought against the party in actual possession. The fact that the semiannual instalment of interest on the mortgage note due June 1, 1877, had not been paid on June 2, 1877, when the writ in this action was brought, is immaterial. If there was default in the condition of the mortgage on June 2, 1877, it only gave the mortgagee the right to take possession, and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>right of possession. Some act remained to be done by the mort gagee before it had any right of possession. <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>125 Mass. 1.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b50-4\">Endicott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">The demandant in this writ of entry brought an action, in December 1874, against Elizabeth B. Howarth on a written contract dated November 7, 1874, signed \u201c Elizabeth B. Howarth by C. O. Manny;\u201d and .the demanded premises, the title to which then stood in the name of Elizabeth B. Howarth, were duly attached under a general attachment of all her real estate in the county of Suffolk. After the date of this contract, and before the action upon it was brought, she was married to Charles O. Manny;. but of this fact the demandant had no knowledge until after the entry of his action against her. The case was prosecuted to judgment, execution issued thereon in March 1876, and, under a sheriff\u2019s sale, as provided in the St. of 1874, <em>c. </em>188, the demanded premises were duly conveyed to the demand-ant in June 1876. She did not plead the misnomer, and, as the action proceeded to judgment and execution, it was a waiver of the error, and the execution could properly be enforced against her, and her property taken to satisfy it. <em>Trull </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>10 Cush. 109. <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Salentine, </em>10 Met. 436. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>11 Gray, 485. <em>Langmaid </em>v. <em>Puffer, </em>7 Gray, 378. No question is made of her identity, and, as against her, the title of the demandant is complete. In <em>Scanlan </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>13 Pick. 523, it was held that a deed to a married woman by her maiden name vested a title in her; she being known to the grantor only by her maiden name, and it appearing that she was the person to whom the conveyance was intended to be made, and that there was no other person claiming to bear the name used in the deed, or dlaiming title under it. Chief Justice Shaw said, \u201c As to the deed being made to the female petitioner, we think it is the common case of a person known by different names.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The tenant sets up title under a mortgage deed of the demanded premises, signed and executed by Charles O. Manny and Elizabeth B. Manny in her own right, and dated and acknowledged in May 1875; and it is contended that the tenant had no means of knowing whether the demanded premises were under attachment, except from the records and copies of writs on file in the registry of deeds, as provided in the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>123, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 51,52; St. 1873, <em>c. </em>297, \u00a7 1; that, at the time the mortgage was taken, there was no record or copies showing an attachment of the estate of Elizabeth B. Mamiy; and that the attachment actually recorded is invalid as against the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">But we are of opinion that this position is untenable. The attachment of the demanded premises, which stood in the name of Elizabeth B. Howarth, having been conveyed to her some years before her marriage, was duly made, and copies of the original writ and of the officer\u2019s return, as provided by law, were deposited in the registry of deeds, as required in the St. of 1874, <em>c. </em>293. The demandant at that time did not know that she had been married and bore another name, but he brought his action against the right person, and the property attached was her property. Nothing seems to have been omitted intentionally, which the law requires, on the part of the demandant or the officer, to make the attachment on the writ effectual. It was not the case of'-the use of the name of another person, or of the fraudulent use of a fictitious name, or of a fraudulent attempt to conceal the fact that an attachment had been made. <em>Ouimet </em>v. <em>Sirois, </em>124 Mass. 162. And it would seem also that, when the officer had deposited the copies in the registry, he had done all that the law required of him to do, in order to make a valid attachment, even if the record did not distinctly disclose that the attachment had been made. <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>118 Mass. 517. But the record here did distinctly disclose that this property had been attached in the name of the person in whom the record title stood. The tenant had the means of ascertaining the attachment, and from the recitals of the mortgage deed had such knowledge of Elizabeth B. Howarth\u2019s marriage, and of the fact that the demanded premises were conveyed to her before marriage, by a deed recorded in her maiden name, as to put it upon inquiry and search of the records after as well as before her marriage. An examination of the records for conveyances by Elizabeth B. Howarth of this property, recorded before her marriage, would not have been sufficient, for she may have made a deed while unmarried, but recorded after marriage and before the mortgage. So proper precaution required the tenant to examine the records for attachments in suits against her before marriage in her maiden name, and for attachments against her in that name after as well as before her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>marriage. An attachment of these premises made before her marriage, on a writ against her in the name of Elizabeth B. Howarth, would not necessarily be recorded till after her marriage; for if the sheriff deposit\u00e9 the copies of his writ and attachment in the registry \u201c within three days after the day on which the attachment is made, the attachment shall take effect from the time it is made; otherwise, from the time the writ or copy is so deposited.\u201d Gen. Sts. c. 128, \u00a7 54. This section is amended by the St. of 1860, <em>a. </em>70, which provides that the attachment shall not take effect against purchasers for a valuable consideration and in good faith, until the writ or copy has been deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">A search, therefore, of the registry must have disclosed this attachment, although it was made on a writ dated some time after the marriage. The tenant was put upon inquiry, had the means of ascertaining the attachment, and, if it had exercised proper caution, would have known it. The tenant thus' took its mortgage subject to the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The fact that Elizabeth B. Manny made a conveyance, after her marriage and before the attachment, of other real estate in the county of Suffolk standing in her maiden name, was not constructive notice to the demandant of her marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The fact that the tenant was not in possession is not decisive. The pleadings put in issue only the demandant\u2019s title; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>6 Allen, 28; and, the case being submitted on an agreed statement of facts, it may be decided on the merits, and the only question open is whether the demandant can recover against the tenant in any form of action. <em>Esty </em>v. <em>Currier, </em>98 Mass, 500. <em>West Roxbury </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>114 Mass. 546, and cases cited, As the attachment, upon the facts before us, took precedence of the mortgage, there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
