Appellant Polychemicals claims that DNPT should be classified under the \u201cbasket provision\u201d for \u201cother\u201d nitrogenous compounds, TSUS Item 425.52. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-16\">DNPT is a nitrogenous compound used commercially as a blowing agent, or \u201cgas generator,\u201d to expand rubber or plastics into sponge or foam forms.

width=\"768\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-24\">It will be seen to contain two fused rings of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms, each ripg consisting of three carbon atoms, one of which is shared by both rings, and three nitrogen atoms, two of which are shared by both rings. It is to be particularly noted, since it is. highly relevant to the arguments on this appeal, that each atom in each ring is connected to the adjoining atoms in the ring by <em>single </em>bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-25\">What is disputed is whether the rings contained in DNPT<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are \u201ctriazine\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>rings. Polychemicals contends that they are not because they do not contain three <em>double </em>bonds in each ring, which it contends is a necessary condition for a ring containing three carbon and three nitrogen atoms to be correctly denominated a triazine ring. The Government and Gavin, the party-in-interest, contend that all rings consisting of three carbon atoms and three nitrogen atoms are triazine rings regardless of whether there are three, two, one, or no double bonds connecting the ring atoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">Before discussing these contentions, however, it will aid understanding to define a number of overlapping terms frequently used in the record, briefs, and the opinion below. The rings in DNPT are simultaneously saturated (or fully saturated), hydrogenated (or fully hydrogenated), reduced (or fully reduced), and nonaromatic, all because they are internally connected entirely by single bonds. Similarly, rings containing three double bonds, of the sort which Polychemicals contends are uniquely entitled to the appellation \u201ctriazine,\u201d are unsaturated, non-hydrogenated, unreduced, and aromatic. In the process of hydrogenation, double bonds are replaced with single bonds, the addition of two peripheral hydrogen atoms making up for the loss of each double bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">The court below adopted the Government\u2019s and Gavin\u2019s definition of a triazine ring as \u201cany six-membered hetero-cyclic ring system containing, as does the compound at bar, three nitrogen and three carbon atoms,\u201d holding specifically that \u201cthe state of hydrogenation of the ring system is not relevant to its identification or classification as a triazine ring.\u201d In its summary, the court purports to base its conclusion (1) solely on \u201cthe record,\u201d which contained conflicting statements from various eminently qualified experts, but it is clear from its opinion that it also gave weight (2) to legislative history in the form of a footnote in the Fifth Supplemental Report, Tariff Classification Study, which flatly states that \u201citem 425.10 covers a variety of chemicals containing a triazine ring such as dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine,\u201d and (3) to a rule of statutory construction favoring a finding that the Tariff Classification Act of 1962 applied the same duty to DNPT as did the Tariff Act of 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">We will consider these three bases for the lower court\u2019s decision sequentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">(1) <em>Experts' Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">The witnesses put forward by all three litigants were unusually well qualified as experts. One of Polychemicals\u2019 witnesses was the Director of the Nomenclature Section of the Chemical Abstract Service of the American Chemical Society, while the other was a chemical consultant to industry who had held a series of high-level research and development positions in the chemical field and who had over 120 United States patents to his credit. The Government\u2019s witness was the author of one of the two extended published treatments of triazine technology, and Gavin\u2019s witness was a college chemistry professor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">Polychemieals argues that the testimony of the Director of the Nomenclature Section of the Chemical Abstract Service, Dr. Kurt L. Loening, \u201cshould be given great evidentiary weight in matters of nomenclature,\u201d first, because the United States Tariff Commission\u2019s Tariff Classification Study (November 15, 1960) states, at page 2 of the \u201cExplanatory and Background Materials\u201d on Schedule 4,. Chemicals and Related Products, that, \u201cIn proposed schedule 4, wherever possible the products have been described in technical, chemical terminology,\u201d and second, because the same study, at page 59, as part of the \u201cExplanatory Notes\u201d to Subpart D, Organic Chemical Compounds (in which subpart both items here contended for are found), of Part 2, Schedule 4, specifically mentions <em>\u201cChemical Abstracts, </em>a publication of the American Chemical Society\u201d as an authority for the arrangement of chemical compounds in the Tariff Schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">The first point is well taken; certainly Dr. Loening\u2019s credentials established him as an authority on \u201ctechnical, chem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>ical terminology.\u201d However, the reference to Chemical Abstracts does not give that publication quite the authority in matters of detail for which Polychemicals contends. The headnote to Subpart D, Part 2, Schedule 4, reads in pertinent part, now as when the Tariff Classification Study was published:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-5\">Organic compounds in this subpart are arranged according to functional group. Any organic compound which is described in more than one functional group is classifiable in the first group in which it is described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">Expanding on this, the \u201cExplanatory Notes\u201d to the subpart in question state, at page 59 of the Tariff Classification Study, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-7\">The existing tariff act provides for many organic chemical compounds of \u201cnonbenzenoid\u201d structure classified by functional groups such as acids, alcohols, and esters. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-8\">* * * * * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-9\">Because many organic chemical compounds are embraced within two or more different functional groups, these groups are arranged so that a compound described in two or more groups would be classifiable in the first group in which it is described. <em>The order of precedence of these functional groups </em>is generally that used in naming and indexing chemical compounds by <em>Chemical Abstracts, </em>a publication of the American Chemical Society. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-12\">Thus, it was the order of precedence of the functional groups in nonbenzenoid organic compounds which was adopted (\u201cgenerally\u201d) from <em>Chemical Abstracts, </em>not the names of individual compounds or compound components, and the functional group to which DNPT belongs (nitrogenous compounds) is not in issue between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-13\">However, there is no doubt that <em>Chemical Abstracts </em>is <em>\u201can </em>authoritative reference,\u201d Aldrich Chemical Co. v. United States, 62 Cust.Ct. 333, 339, C.D. 3758 (1969) (emphasis ours), in determining \u201ctechnical, chemical terminology,\u201d and Dr. Loening, who \u201cauthored most of * * * [the <em>Chemical Abstracts </em>rules for systematic nomenclature of chemical compounds] with the help of colleagues, of course\u201d (R. 21), was entitled' to respectful attention when he replied in the negative to Polyehemieals\u2019 counsel\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-15\">Q. Merely because a ring compound contains three carbons, three carbon atoms, and three nitrogen atoms, does that chemical compound then contain a triazine ring in accordance with the official Chemical Abstract System of nomenclature? [R. 33.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-16\">Similarly, the testimony given in the following exchange between counsel for Polychemicals and its other witness, Mr. ter Horst, an industrial chemist with impressive credentials, was entitled to respectful attention:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-17\">Q. In your opinion and based upon your experience and knowledge, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>are the primary and essential characteristics of a chemical compound which contains a triazine ring, in accordance with industry practice? A. It has to be a six-membered ring containing three nitrogen atoms, three carbon atoms, and three double bonds. The nitrogen atoms do not have to be symmetrical. They can be 1, 3, 5 or 1, 2, 4, or 1,2, 5. [R. 56.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">But the Government and the party-in-interest did not rest at the conclusion of Polychemicals\u2019 case. The Government called Dr. Edward Modest, author of <em>\u201ca </em>chapter of approximately 100 pages covering all phases and areas of triazine chemistry\u201d (R. 65-66) in Volume 7 of a series entitled <em>Heterocyclic Compounds, </em>edited by Dr. Robert Elderfield. Dr. Modest testified that there were only two systematic treatments of triazine chemistry in recent years, his and <em>\u201ca </em>book that was written by Smolin and Rapoport, published in 1959 by Interseience\u201d (R. 66), and that both in his chapter and in Smolin and Rapoport\u2019s book compounds containing unsaturated, partially saturated, <em>and fully saturated </em>rings were all treated as compounds containing triazine rings. Furthermore, Dr. Modest testified that <em>Chemical Abstracts </em>itself had adopted, for a compound he had first disclosed and for a series of related compounds, nomenclature containing the word \u201ctriazine\u201d although the compounds contained a partially reduced ring consisting of three nitrogen atoms and three carbon atoms linked by four single bonds and only two double bonds. (R. 74-75.) When it came Gavin\u2019s turn to offer testimony, the party-in-interest called Dr. Francis E. Condon, a professor of chemistry at the City College of New York, who corroborated Dr. Modest\u2019s testimony generally and testified specifically that the ring in DNPT \u201cIs * * * a triazine ring as the term is used among chemists\u201d even though it is in the saturated form. (R. 96-97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">We are an appellate court, not a trier of facts, and our review of a determination of fact by the Customs Court is limited to deciding whether +\u2019 ^ is evidence to support its determination and whether its determination is clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence. United States v. F. W. Myers &amp; Co., 45 CCPA 48, 52, C.A.D. 671 (1958). In this ease there was direct conflict in \u201cexpert\u201d testimony directed to the fundamental fact in issue, and the Customs Court\u2019s resolution of that conflict cannot be said to be unsupported by evidence or clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">(2) <em>Legislative \u201cHistory\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">The second basis of the lower court\u2019s decision was the statement on page 25 of the United States Tariff Commission\u2019s Fifth Supplemental Report, Tariff Classification Study, in an \u201cExplanation\u201d accompanying a revision of the items covering nitrogenous compounds, that \u201citem 425.10 covers a variety of chemicals containing a triazine ring such as dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine\u201d (DNPT), which statement the court accepted as part 'of the \u201clegislative history of item 425.10 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States * * Polychemicals contends that the statement in the Supplemental Report should be given little or no weight for two reasons: First, \u201csince there was no change in duty involved in the classification of DNPT at that time [because DNPT had been being dutied at the same rate under a paragraph of the Tariff Act of 1930 imposing the same rate as Item 425.10 by virtue of an administrative ruling of the Bureau of Customs], no investigation or hearing was held or required by the Tariff Commission and the Tariff Commission record is accordingly devoid of comments or basis for the footnote referring to the classification of DNPT * * \u25a0*.\u201d Second, \u201cCongress, in fact, never had before it the classification of DNPT\u201d because the Fifth Supplemental Report was published after the passage of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, and it therefore cannot be used as \u201clegislative history\u201d of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">These points are, we think, well taken. In view of the fact that the Tariff Commission never publicly considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>classification of DNPT, the statement in question should be accorded less weight than if the classification of DNPT had been publicly debated. Similarly, it appears logically true that the fact of the Fifth Supplemental Report\u2019s post-passage publication detracts from its force as an indicator of congressional intent at the time of the passage of the Tariff Classification Act. However, as Polychemicals is forced to concede, .we have previously accepted such a publication as part of the legislative history of this act, Rifkin Textile Corp. v. United States, 54 CCPA 138, 141, C.A.D. 925 (1967), and we are not disposed to overrule that decision now. We do not wish to allow a too-zealous regard for the sequence of events to deprive us of the aid in interpreting statutes of such authoritative, if belated, exegeses published by the very agency which was responsible for the drafting of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">Nevertheless, conceding that both objections raised by Poly chemicals have some merit, we disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cany congressional intent implied from the record should not be given any significant evidentiary weight.\u201d Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the court below in fact gave it undue evidentiary weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">(3) <em>Continuance of Duty Rate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">The third and final basis of the lower court\u2019s decision was \u201cthe continuance by Congress of the same rate of duty * * in the aforesaid item [Item 425.10] of the tariff schedules as had been applied to chemical compounds [i. e., to DNPT] under paragraph 5 of the tariff act prior to the adoption of the tariff schedules,\u201d which the court denominated \u201ca significant factor in our present determination * * Polychemicals\u2019 attack on this basis of the lower court\u2019s decision is twofold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">First, it contends that \u201cthe giving of significant weight to maintenance of the same duty is reversible error\u201d because the United States Tariff Commission\u2019s Tariff Classification Study (November 15, 1960) states, at page 59, as a part of the \u201cExplanatory Notes\u201d to Subpart D, Organic Chemical Compounds, of Part 2, Schedule 4, that-:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-11\">Most of the existing provisions for organic compounds have been assimilated into part 2D without change in rate of duty. Any new \u201cbasket\u201d class made up of compounds in different existing overlapping \u201cbaskets\u201d at different rates of duty is given the rate which has been applied to most of the imports in recent years. This consolidation has resulted in some changes in the rates of duty. However, such changes, which are incidental to desirable clarification, <em>are believed to be insignificant. </em>[Emphasis in quotation at page 36 of Polychemicals\u2019 brief.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">Polychemicals\u2019 argument, which seems to be based on the use of the word \u201cinsignificant\u201d in the above quotation, in contrast to the use of the word \u201csignificant\u201d in the sentence from the opinion of the lower court which is under attack, is that \u201cthere is an absence of any declaration that continuation of the same duty should be or is a <em>significant </em>factor in the classification\u201d (emphasis in original) and that therefore it is error to hold that continuance of the same rate of duty as previously applied is a significant factor in arriving at classification under the new statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-13\">We think this argument is without merit. What the Tariff Commission clearly meant by the quoted sentence was that what few changes in rates were wrought by the new \u201cbasket\u201d classes were commercially insignificant. These sentences were plainly meant to allay any possible congressional fears that the new \u201cbasket\u201d classes would alter radically then-existing tariff treatment of imported chemical compounds. They cannot be contorted into a congressional direction that a judicial determination that a particular classification under the new statute would or would not continue the rate previously applied should be an insignifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>cant factor in determining under which TSUS item imported goods should be classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">As far as the logic of the lower court\u2019s action is concerned, we note that the sentence attacked by appellant on this branch of its case follows the sentence \u201cThese changes made in the provisions of Part 2D with respect to nitrogenous compounds will, to the extent practicable, continue the existing rate treatment,\u201d quoted from page 25 of the United States Tariff Commission\u2019s Fifth Supplemental Report, Tariff Classification Study (May 16, 1963). Both this sentence and the first sentence in the above-quoted passage from the original Tariff Classification Study make it quite clear that the intent of the drafters of the Tariff Schedules was that the tariff rates on most nitrogenous compounds prevailing before the promulgation of the new Tariff Schedules would continue to prevail after their promulgation. Accordingly, a finding of rate continuance in this subsection <em>may </em>be \u201ca significant factor\u201d in classifying the imported goods\u2014 although far from a dispositive factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">The second prong of Polychemicals' attack on the third basis of the decision below is that, \u201cAssuming arguendo that the maintenance of the correct duty [same duty?] is a significant factor\u201d the administrative classification by the Bureau of Customs which placed DNPT in a category taxed at the same rate as is now levied by Item 425.10 was wrong, and a correct interpretation of the Tariff Act of 1930 would place DNPT in a category taxed at the same rate as is now levied by Item 425.52, the item under which Polychemicals contends DNPT should now be dutied. This argument fails because it is the <em>fact </em>of the previous classification which is \u201csignificant,\u201d not whether the previous classification was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">Finding no error in the judgment of the lower court, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1381-26\">. Polyehemicals has not attempted to argue that DNPT does not come under TSUS Item 425.10 because that item calls for <em>a </em>(triazine) ring whereas DNPT contains two rings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">. However, it should be noted that it was Mr. ter Horst\u2019s qualifications as a chemist rather than his qualifications as one familiar with industrial terminology which entitled his words to respect. We have already quoted the sentence \u201cIn proposed schedule 4, wherever possible the products have been described in technical, chemical terminology\u201d from page 2 of the \u201cExplanatory and Background Materials\u201d on Schedule 4 in the United States Tariff Commission\u2019s Tariff Classification Study (November 15, 1960L The paragraph from which that sentence was taken continues, \u201cThe use of such terminology imparts greater eertainty to the tariff descriptions. Persons trading in chemicals are generally familiar with technical descriptions no matter how they may otherwise describe their goods.\u201d From the above it is clear that Congress intended to classify chemicals by their generally accepted technical nomenclature, in contradistinction to the usual rule that \u201ctariff terms are not to be classified according to their scientific meaning, where that meaning differs from the common or commercial understanding of the term.\u201d United States v. Sandoz Chemical Works, Inc., 46 CCPA 115, 118, C.A.D. 711 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
