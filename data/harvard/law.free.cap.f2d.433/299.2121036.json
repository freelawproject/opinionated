Citizens Casualty Co. of New York, et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Plaintiff brought this action against seven named officials of the U. S. Internal Revenue Service for damages arising out of alleged tortious conduct, jin the sale of his Mansfield, Ohio, real property to satisfy a federal tax lien. He appeals from the decree of the District Judge dismissing his action against all defendants, with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">It is undisputed that, at the time of the seizure and sale of plaintiff\u2019s property, assessments were pending against plaintiff for unpaid federal income taxes in the amount of $3,386.93. Sections 6331 through 6335 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6331-35 (1967)) prescribe procedures to be followed by the Internal Revenue Service in seizing and selling the real property of delinquent taxpayers. Affidavits were filed on behalf of the defendants, accompanied by supporting documentation from Internal Revenue Service files, indicating that those defendants who took direct part in the disposition of Bridges\u2019 property complied with the prescribed procedures in all material respects. Bridges filed no counter-affidavits, but rested on his pleadings broadly alleging fraud, conspiracy, and deprivation of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The question on appeal is whether, from the pleadings and affidavits on file, the District Judge should have concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that defendants were entitled to dismissal of the suit as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ. P., Rule 56. Executive officers are immune from suit for monetary recovery based on allegedly wrongful conduct if, in engaging in the conduct complained of, they acted within the scope of their authority or in the discharge of their duties. Norton v. McShane, 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 855, 857, cert. denied, 380 U.S. 981, 85 S.Ct. 1345, 14 L.Ed.2d 274 (1965); <em>see </em>Barr v. Mateo, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959). Defendant officers may not rely, of course, on bare conclusory allegations on this issue, for this will not sustain a summary judgment in their favor. Fowler v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 150. However, in the face of affidavits by such defendants tending to show that immunity is properly invoked, \u201cplaintiffs cannot rest upon the mere allegations of their complaints unsupported by sworn testimony.\u201d Norton v. McShane, <em>supra, </em>332 F.2d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">It is not necessary to our decision here that we determine the limits to the scope of immunity of federal officials based on the exercise of their powers, for in the record before him, the District Judge was fully justified in granting judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
