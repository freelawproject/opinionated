We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">Appellant\u2019s petition is predicated on its ownership of the trademark \u201cKitty\u201d for cat food, registered on the Principal Register Aug. 9, 1960, Reg. No. 702,658. Appellant\u2019s filing date, Jan. 30, 1956, antedates appellee\u2019s date of first use, Aug. 19, 1959. Priority is therefore not an issue. The goods must legally be regarded as identical and the sole question for decision is likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception. 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">The decision of the board herein was rendered Jan. 12, 1968, prior to our decision in Food Specialty Co. v. Standard Products Co., 406 F.2d 1397, 56 CCPA 1005 (Mar. 13, 1969). In that case we reversed the board and sustained an opposition by appellant here, based on the same registration relied on here, to registration of the trademark \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d for cat food. Appellant deems that precedent controlling here. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-16\">In the \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d case we rejected the argument that \u201cKitty\u201d is merely descriptive and generic as applied to cat food while recognizing the obvious fact that it is \u201cnot entirely arbitrary,\u201d as appellee contends. We held that confusion would nevertheless be likely to result from the concurrent use of \u201cKitty\u201d and \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d on cat food. We have nearly the same issue here regarding the likelihood of confusion between \u201cKitty\u201d and \u201cHERE, KITTY!\u201d and we are of the same opinion : confusion or mistake would be likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-17\">The only new argument here, as compared with the prior case, is that this is a cancellation whereas the prior case was an opposition. We are unable to see that that difference is significant. Appellee cites certain dictum from the opinion in In re Myers, 201 F.2d 379, 40 CCPA 747 (1953), in support of its thesis that the situation in a cancellation is quite different from that in an opposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>tion because, quoting from <em>Myers, </em>\u201cThe cancellation of one\u2019s trade-mark may prove destructive to the business built about it.\u201d <em>Myers </em>quoted no authority for that statement, which is not accurate. It is a <em>registration </em>which is can-celled, not a trademark. There is no way to cancel a trademark. <em>Myers </em>was otherwise in error, and we cannot accept its dictum. Furthermore, <em>Myers </em>was an ex parte appeal. Appellee took no testimony in this case and there is no evidence that it presently has <em>any </em>business under its registered mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">It is interesting to note that the board cited its own prior decision in the \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d case as a precedent for its decision herein. We reversed that precedent. In considering our prior \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d decision to be \u201ccontrolling\u201d herein, we do so in the sense that the <em>logic </em>underlying the prior decision compels the decision here, not that the <em>decision </em>as to another mark is binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b873-8\">BALDWIN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"APPM\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">I agree that the sole issue here is the question of likelihood of confusion under \u00a7 2(d) of the Lanham Act. I agree also that the legal tests and the logical inquiries to be used in resolving such a question cannot change depending on the type of proceeding in which the question arises. However, I think the majority opinion is clearly in error in holding that there is <em>no </em>significance in the fact that the proceeding before us is a cancellation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">The language used in the <em>Myers </em>opinion relied on by appellant is properly criticized by the majority. Nevertheless, I find the rationale behind that language to be correct. The difference between a cancellation proceeding and an opposition proceeding <em>is </em>significant. I feel that some consideration should be accorded this distinction, not in the legal standards to be applied \u2014 they are immutable \u2014 but in <em>considering the evidence </em>by which those standards are to be applied. In a cancellation proceeding we are dealing with the question of whether presently existing rights (those accruing from a federal registration) should be taken away. Appellee here stands to lose federal rights, significant rights, which loss may very well \u201cprove destructive to the business\u201d he has built around his trademark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whereas, in an opposition proceeding, the question involves a party\u2019s <em>right to a registration. </em>At the very least, the burden of proof carried by one who would have rights cancelled should be greater than the burden of one who\u2019s only purpose is to prevent a registration from issuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Assuming the existence of a greater burden of persuasion, I find that appellant did not satisfy that burden. Yet even aside from any additional burden arising from the fact that this is a cancellation proceeding, I think the board\u2019s decision here was correct and should be affirmed. The word \u201cKitty\u201d is not a strong trademark, evincive of a single definite source of goods. Conceding that it is no more than suggestive (in deference to the holding in the \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d case), I still find that it is only suggestive of kittens or cats and not of any quality or action connected with such animals. Adding to the dominant term the connotation of a quality (e. g., \u201cPretty Kitty\u201d) may not be sufficient to remove any likelihood of confusion. However, I submit that when appellee\u2019s mark (Here, Kitty!), connoting a call to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the animal, is viewed with the inherent weakness of the dominant portion taken into consideration, the two marks are sufficiently different so as to preclude any likelihood that consumers would be led to believe that appellee\u2019s cat food and appellant\u2019s cat food came from the same source.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-13\">. The majority opinion notes that no evidence is before us that appellee presently has any business under its mark. Such remark is meaningless. Federal trademark rights, as well as common law rights, are based on actual trademark usage, and trademark use by its very nature connotes business usage. In an inter partes proceeding it has long been settled that the registration itself constitutes prima facie evidence of continuing trademark use. See Gillette Co. v. Kempel, 254 F.2d 402, 45 CCPA 920 (1958). Appellee here was under no obligation to prove trademark use and its use of that trademark in an established business should not be questioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
