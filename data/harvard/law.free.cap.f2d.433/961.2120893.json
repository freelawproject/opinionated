Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1016-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">This appeal is taken from an order of the district court denying the petitions of a Florida state convict for the writ of habeas corpus and for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 due for alleged \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">Appellant alleged that he is being denied psychiatric care at the state prison, that instead he was sent to a road camp from which he twice escaped due to his mental condition, that in 1965 he was wrongly accused of participating in a riot and was placed in maximum security for thirty days. He also alleges that he filed in the state court a motion to vacate sentence on the ground of insanity, that two psychiatrists examined him and found that he was not insane, that the prison physician gave him medicine which had adverse physical reactions and caused him to set fire to his mattress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">The district court dismissed the petitions, finding no \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d alleged which merit the interference of federal courts in state prison administration. Granville v. Hunt, 5th Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">As we have consistently stated, federal courts will not inquire into the adequacy of medical care provided to inmates by state prisons unless there appears an abuse of the broad discretion which prison officials possess. Haskew v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 525; Weaver v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 505; Carswell v. Wainwright, 5th Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 1044. Appellant admits to being examined by two psychiatrists and that he was prescribed medication by the prison physician. Appellant has shown only that he disagrees with their medical conclusions. Nor do appellant\u2019s allegations concerning prison conditions show a violation of his constitutional rights. Granville v. Hunt, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
