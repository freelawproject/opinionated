Theriault appeals from the District Court's denial of his petition for habeas corpus and other relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-25\">Appellant has contended that officials in the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta have kept him in \u201cclose custody\u201d solely on the basis of certain prior convictions in the State of Mississippi, which he alleges were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-26\"> The District Court held that in the appellant\u2019s case, his \u201cclose custody\u201d was based on the large number of fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>eral sentences which he is serving and which are to be served, including at least two which resulted from convictions of escape. The matter is one which addresses itself to internal prison administration. <em>See </em>Quick v. Thompkins, 5 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 260; Brown v. Wainwright, 5 Cir., 1969, 419 F.2d 1308. The Court refused to entertain a collateral attack on the Mississippi state convictions. We agree. <em>See </em>Rodgers v. Louisiana, 5 Cir., 1969, 418 F.2d 237; Word v. North Carolina, 4 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 352. Appellant completed service of his Mississippi sentences several years ago. They were not used for enhancement of his present sentences. <em>Cf. </em>United States ex rel. Durocher v. LaVallee, 2 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 303, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 998, 84 S.Ct. 1921, 12 L.Ed.2d 1048 (1964). Theriault is not in custody under, nor otherwise restrained by, the Mississippi convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
