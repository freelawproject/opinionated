May 8, 1969, armed with a search warrant secured on the basis of iftfor-. mation supplied by an informer, federal narcotics agents entered the house,.of.v Alexander Stahl in San Antonio, Texas;. and discovered approximately 1\u00d3.26\u00d3 grams of heroin. An indictment charg- - ing violations of-21 U.S..C. \u00a7 174 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u2022 26 U,S.C. \u00a7 4704(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was returned against two of the occupants of ;\u2022 -the ( house, Joe M. and Carmen Mendoza. Joe Mendoza was tried separately before the..-,, court*without a jury, convicted on, two:;, counts, and sentenced to serve two concurrent ten-year terms in a federal penal institution. The Government then dismissed the indictment as to Carmen Menidoza.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">Mendoza now appeals his conviction to this Court. Finding no reversible error in the trial of the case, we affirm the .judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">First, Mendoza complains of the trial court\u2019s refusal to require the Gov- .; ernment to disclose the name of the informer. Mendoza alleges that the name of the informer was necessary to his defense because he had reason to believe that the informer was a man who had ^repeatedly threatened him and who could 'have planted the heroin in the Stahl house.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-20\">The Supreme Court on public policy grounds has recognized the privilege of the Government to withhold from disclosure the identity of the informer. Scher , -V: United States, 1938, 305 U.S. 251, 59 S.Ct. 174, 83 L.Ed. 151. Nevertheless, when the disclosure of an informer\u2019s -name is \u201crelevant and helpful to the defense of an accused,\u201d the Court will require the disclosure. Roviaro v. United \" Sfates, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 60-61, 77 S.Ct. 623, 628, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, 645; Miller v. ...United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 273 F.2d 279, 280. The Court established no fixed rule in the <em>Roviaro </em>case. On the contrary,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>[t]he problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628-629. The circumstance alleged to justify disclosure in the <em>Roviaro </em>case was the informer\u2019s active participation in the crime charged. <em>See also </em>Portomene v. United States, 5 Cir. 1955, 221 F.2d 582; United States v. Conforti, 7 Cir. 1952, 200 F.2d 365. This Court has since held that when \u201call the evidence discloses is that the informer was an informer and nothing more,\u201d the Government should not be required to identify the informer. Miller v. United States, 5 Cir. 1960, 273 F.2d 279, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Here the informer was merely an informer. Although he gave information to the narcotics agents that led to Mendoza\u2019s arrest, there is no evidence showing that the informer participated in any way in the offense charged. In the trial court Mendoza attempted to show that the informer had repeatedly threatened him and was in a position to have planted the heroin in the S.tahl house. In a hearing at the bench, however, the district judge specifically stated that Frederico Musquiz, the man whom Mendoza suspected of having informed the Government, was not the informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Mendoza contends further that he was entitled to the name of the informer for the purpose of attacking the validity of the search warrant. But the rule is well-established that the Government need not disclose the identity of an informer when the sole purpose to be served is to attack the probable cause supporting a search warrant. Lopez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1956, 370 F.2d 8, 11; United States v. Rugendorf, 7 Cir. 1963, 316 F.2d 589, 592-593, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>376 U.S. 528, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Applying the <em>Roviaro </em>test, we conclude that in these circumstances there was no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to compel the Government to identify its informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Second, Mendoza argues that the affidavit for the search warrant under which the narcotics agents entered the Stahl house and found the heroin fails to meet the test of Spinnelli v. United States, 1969, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637, and Aguilar v. Texas, 1964, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Under the two-pronged test of <em>Spinnelli </em>and <em>Aguilar, </em>to establish probable cause the affidavit must provide the magistrate with some of the underlying circumstances from which the informer concluded that the accused was committing a crime and some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informer was credible. We hold that the affidavit in this case satisfies both the above requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">The affidavit recites that the informer said he had seen heroin in Mendoza\u2019s possession on May 5, 6, and 7, at the Stahl house and further that Mendoza displayed the heroin to him and told him it was for sale. All that is required by <em>Spinnelli </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>is a sufficient statement of how the informer gathered his information. The affidavit in this case clearly demonstrates that the informer obtained his information through personal observations and conversations with Mendoza.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">The affidavit also recites that \u201c[t]he informant who apprised me of the above information has given information to me on several occasions in the past which has proven to be true and reliable.\u201d This Court has held that such a factual statement of past reliability provides sufficient basis for the magistrate to gauge independently the reliability of the informer. United States v. Vigo, 5 Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>1969, 413 F.2d 691, 692; United Stales v. Rich, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 934 937. Moreover, other recitations in the,.affidavit lend authenticity to the informers report. The affiant states that the, files ; of the Bureau of Narcotics &amp; Dangerous \u2022 Drugs list Mendoza as a suspected:' df\u00fag \u25a0user and seller; that listing is undoubt-. edly based upon the uncontradicted jfact that Mendoza had previously been r .eon- , victed for narcotics violations. The .in- \u25a0; former reported that many of Mendoza\u2019s. Customers were Latin Americans who reside on the west side of San Antonio. While maintaining surveillance, the/affi- \u2022 ant . saw several persons matching that description, including one known narnotics user, visit the S.tahl house, stay, a few minutes, and then leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In these circumstances we hold/that, the-information supplied by the inform-, ant, based on his personal observations^ and substantiated by instances of past reliability and additional supporting\u2018information gathered from surveillance-satisfied the <em>Spinnelli </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>test for probable cause. <em>See </em>United States v. Vigo, 5 Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 691, 692, 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">HL</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Third, Mendoza contends that the manner in which the narcotics agents - executed\" the search warrant violated the federal standards set out in 18 U.S.C. 3109.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no merit in that conten- \u2022 tion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The narcotics agents executed ; ,th\u00e9' search warrant in the following manner. On the afternoon of May 8, 1969, four agents drove up to the front of the Stahl house oh Ranmar Street; Stahl was Mendoza\u2019s father-in-law. They jumped, \u25a0 out of.their .ears and ran toward the house. Agent Vollmer immediately saw a man standing in the driveway at the/ rear of the house and shouted to him that; he was a federal agent with a search warrant. He then approached the man, who . happened to be Stahl, the owner of the house, and once again identified himself ;and announced his purpose. Together -'with another agent, the two men went to the back door and entered the house. Meanwhile, agent Billings, who actually carried the search warrant, had arrived at the front door of the S.tahl house. He knocked three or four times and then heard a voice say \u201cFederal agents with i. a search warrant.\u201d Recognizing the voice as agent Vollmer\u2019s and thinking that the search warrant had been executi ed, he opened the unlatched screen door \u2019 and entered the Stahl house. He pro- \u25a0. ceeded to the rear of the house and found \u2022Mendoza sitting at the kitchen table. Shortly thereafter, agent Vollmer and .Stahl entered the kitchen through the back door.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\"> An alleged violation of 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 3109 must be judged in light of the particular circumstances surrounding the execution of the warrant. Jones v. United States, 1960, 362 U.S. 257, 272, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697. The pur pose of the statute is to protect the householder from unlawful invasion of his house. To that end, Government agents are required to announce their ...authority and lawful purpose before entering the house. Miller v. United Slates, 1958, 357 U.S. 301, 313, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332, 1340-1341. This is not a case such as Sabbath v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 585, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828, in which there was no announcement of the agents\u2019 authority , and purpose. On the contrary, before peaceably entering the Stahl house and beginning their search, the agents here \u2022 had twice identified themselves and announced their purpose to the owner of the house. Moreover, the announcement '.was made loudly enough so that it is fair to infer that anyone inside the house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>also heard the agent\u2019s words. In these circumstances, we conclude that the manner in which the narcotics agents executed the search warrant did not violate any rights secured by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109. <em>See </em>Cognetta v. United States, 9 Cir. 1963, 313 F.2d 870; United States v. Viale, 2 Cir. 1963, 312 F.2d 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Finally, Mendoza contends that the Government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crimes charged. Specifically he alleges that the Government has not proved the facts necessary to invoke the statutory presumptions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Section 174 provides that \u201c[w]henever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d Mendoza argues that the Government has shown merely that he was present where heroin was found but not that he had possession of the drug. Possession within the meaning of the statute may be either actual or constructive. Possession need not be exclusive, but may be shared with others, and is susceptible of proof by circumstantial as well as direct evidence. Garza v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 899, 901; Smith v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 34, 38-39. The Government acknowledges that in this ease it relies on circumstantial proof of constructive possession \u2014 that is, dominion and control over the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The narcotics agents testified that when they entered the Stahl house and found Mendoza, his eyes were glassy and he seemed passive. Finding red needle marks in the crook of his arm, they concluded that he was under the influence of narcotics. They observed that no one else living in the house appeared to be under the influence of narcotics. Ind\u00e9ed, Stahl testified that neither he, his wife, nor his children used heroin and that they had never before had any heroin in their house. The agents found the heroin concealed in a cigarette package hidden in a dog box. Stahl testified that the dog and the dog box belonged to the Mendozas. He also said that the dog was vicious toward anyone coming near it, but that Mendoza could safely approach it. Upon the discovery of the heroin in the dog\u2019s box, Mendoza said nothing. We hold that the above testimony constituted a sufficient evidentiary basis for a finding of constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Mendoza\u2019s other arguments in connection with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 are without merit. It seems clear that a judge sitting without a jury is entitled to use the statutory presumption. <em>See </em>United States v. Santore, 2 Cir. 1960, 290 F.2d 51; United States v. Bailey, 7 Cir. 1960, 277 F.2d 560. The constitutionality of the statutory presumption with respect to heroin is no longer open to question. <em>See </em>Turner v. United States, 1970, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610. Moreover, the Government has not attempted to prove Mendoza\u2019s guilt by his \u201cmere presence\u201d where heroin was found. It has offered substantial evidence to prove Mendoza\u2019s dominion and control over the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Mendoza also attacks the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s evidence attempting to prove a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a). We must sustain that objection. The Government admits that it failed to prove that the heroin container did not have the required tax stamps on it. Without that proof, the Government is not entitled to rely on the statutory presumption. Harris v. United States, 1959, 359 U.S. 19, 79 S.Ct. 560, 3 L.Ed.2d 597. Nevertheless, the failure of proof as to the presence of the tax stamps is nonreversible error. The district court sentenced Mendoza to serve two concurrent ten-year terms for his violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a). Because we have found a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>valid conviction on the \u00a7 174 couni^.that. supports the ten-year sentence, \u00e1iiy er-. ror- in the trial of the \u00a7 4704(a) count is nonpre judicial. Muir v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 712, 713; Mishan v. United States, 5 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 790, 791. <em>See </em>Benton v. Maryland, 1969, 395 U.S. 784, 86 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\">. \u00a7 174': <em>IImportation of narcotic drugs </em>prohibited],\u2022 <em>penalty; evidenc</em>e</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-13\">Whoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings any narcotic drug into the United- States or any territory under its control or Jurisdiction, contrary to law, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, con-' cealment, or sale of any such narcotic drug after being imported or brought in, knowi\u00f1g'the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law, or conspires to commit any of sueh -acts in violation of the laws of the United States, shall be imprisoned not less -than five or more than twenty years.and, in,addition, may be fined not more than $20,000. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-14\">Whenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-22\">.\u2019 \u00a7 4704. <em>Packages</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACzr\">, ,.
