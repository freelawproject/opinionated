The importer claims the merchandise should be classified and dutied as \u201cother headwear\u201d under item 703.75, TSUS. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-12\">The pertinent TSUS provisions read:</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-13\">Headwear, of fur felt: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-14\">* * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-15\">For other persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-16\">* * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-17\">Item</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-18\">703.50 Valued over $24 but not over $30 per</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-19\">dozen........................... 40% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-20\">703.55 Valued over $30 per dozen.......... $6.80 per doz.+</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-21\">10.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-22\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-23\">703.75 Other headwear ....................... 17.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1454-24\">General Headnote 9(f) (i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1454-25\">(f) the terms \u201cof\u201d, \u201cwholly of\u201d, \u201calmost wholly of\u201d, \u201cin part of\u201d and \u201ccontaining\u201d, when used between the description of an article and a material (e. g., \u201cfurniture <em>of </em>wood\u201d, woven fab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>rics, <em>wholly of </em>cotton\u201d, etc.) have the following meanings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-4\">(i) \u201cof\u201d means that the article is wholly or in chief value of the named material;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">General Headnote 10 (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-6\">(a) the general, schedule, part, and subpart headnotes, and the provisions describing the classes of imported articles and specifying the rates of duty or other import restrictions to be imposed thereon <em>are subject to the rules of interpretation set forth herein and to such other rules of statutory interpretation, not inconsistent therewith, as have been </em>or may be <em>developed under </em>administrative or <em>judicial rulings; </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">The facts are not in dispute. It appears from the record that the imported merchandise is made from loose, blown rabbit fur which is allowed to fall over a rotating, perforated cone or dome having a suction fan underneath it. In combination with the suction, hot water is sprayed on the fur initially causing the fur fibers to compact and interlock. The resultant formed but fragile hood, illustrated by exhibit 6 in evidence of record, is next subjected to \u201cfulling\u201d operations carried out by various rollers in the presence of hot water and steam, for the purpose of further compacting and shrinking the fur fibers to interlock them. The thusly \u201chardened\u201d hood is subsequently subjected to certain other finishing operations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-13\">Appellant does not question that the principal processes to which the loose rabbit fur is subjected in the present circumstances \u2014 forming and fulling \u2014 yield a material which is properly termed fur \u201cfelt.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather it contends that, inasmuch as the hood and the felt were created simultaneously during the manufacturing operation, \u201cthe imported articles are not \u2018headwear of fur felt\u2019 because the felt did not have a separate, independent existence prior to the existence of the headwear.\u201d In support of its view, it relies- on the so-called \u201cpreexisting material\u201d doctrine, a judicial rule of construction to the effect that, before a given article can be said to be \u201cmade\u201d, \u201cmanufactured\u201d or \u201ccomposed\u201d wholly or in part \u201cof\u201d a given material, as those expressions have been employed in certain provisions of previous Tariff Acts, that material itself must first be in existence. United States v. Accurate Millinery Co., supra; Cohn &amp; Lewis v. United States, 25 CCPA 220, T.D. 49335 (1937), and cases cited therein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s position is that, by virtue of TSUS Headnotes 9(f) (i) and 10(a), heretofore quoted, the language \u201cheadwear, of fur felt\u201d is subject to the same rule of construction that was applied to language \u201cidentical\u201d in legislative meaning and legal significance by the courts in <em>Accurate Millinery Co. </em>and <em>Cohn &amp; Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-14\">The Customs Court did not agree with appellant\u2019s contentions, nor do we. The difficulty with appellant\u2019s position, as we see it, is that the language \u201cheadwear, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>fur felt\u201d is not in fact identical, much less identical in legislative meaning or legal significance, to the language before the courts in <em>Accurate Millinery Co. </em>or <em>Cohn &amp; Lewis. </em>In contrast to the phrases in issue in those cases, the expression \u201cheadwear, of fur felt\u201d contains no limitation pertaining to the manner in which the headwear was manufactured or composed. Unlike such expressions as \u201cmanufactured of\u201d, \u201cmade of\u201d or \u201ccomposed of\u201d, the word \u201cof\u201d, standing alone in the superior heading to items 703.50 and 703.55 or as particularly defined by Congress in General Headnote 9(f) (i), does not connote or imply preexistence of the named material \u2014 fur felt. The words \u201cmanufactured of\u201d, \u201cmade of\u201d or \u201ccomposed of\u201d are conspicuous by their absence as <em>sole </em>definitions in the definition of \u201cof\u201d appearing in Headnote 9(f) (i), although they do appear to be within the scope of the definition as formulated. Rather, it seems to us that the term \u201cof fur felt\u201d (or, in light of Headnote 9(f) (i), \u201cwholly of fur felt\u201d or \u201cin chief value of fur felt\u201d) is a term of description or identification employed to denote what the headwear actually is, irrespective of whether the felt from which it was made had an existence prior to fabrication of the head-wear or was simultaneously produced in connection with the making of the head-wear itself. Headwear may be \u201cof fur felt\u201d, in other words, without necessarily having to be made or manufactured from felt already in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">With respect to appellant\u2019s reliance on General Headnote 10(a), we need only again observe, as did the Customs Court, that Congress has not employed language in the superior heading to items 703.50 and 703.55 identical to that which this court previously has held necessitated the application of the particular rule of statutory interpretation known as the doctrine of preexisting materials. Conversely, appellant has not cited any judicial ruling in which the simple, unambiguous language \u201c[article] of [material]\u201d has been construed in accordance with that rule of statutory interpretation. Under the circumstances, we see no compelling reason to apply and extend the doctrine, illustrated by the cases heretofore noted, to a case where the language employed by Congress does not require it. See Alfred Kohlberg, Inc. v. United States, 27 CCPA 354, C.A.D. 111 (1940).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>In light of our conclusion, we need not discuss the items of legislative history-examined <em>in extenso </em>by the Customs Court and found by it to support the conclusion that Congress employed the present statutory language to avoid application of the preexisting material doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-26\">. Jacques Isler Corp. v. United States, 63 Cust.Ct. 283, C.D. 3909 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1454-27\">. It should be observed that the present merchandise was imported in 1964, prior to enactment of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965, Public Law 89-241, which changed the superi- or heading of items 703.20-703.55 from \u201cheadwear, of fur felt\u201d to \u201cheadwear, of fur not on the skin.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">. At trial, counsel for the importer anil the Government were in agreement that the present importations are similar to anil made in the same manner as the hat bodies in United States v. Accurate Millinery Co., 42 CCPA 229, C.A.D. 599 (1955), affirming Accurate Millinery Co. v. United States, 33 CustCt. 191, C.D. 1652 (1954). We refer to those opinions for further details as to the manufacture of the merchandise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">. As noted by the court below, one of appellant\u2019s witnesses testified that Exhibits 1 and 2, representative of the imported merchandise, were known in the trade as \u201cfelt hoods\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1455-15\">. In <em>Accurate Millinery Co., </em>for example, the merchandise was held not to be properly classified as hoods \u201ccomposed wholly or in chief value of fur felt\u201d because the felt did not have a prior, separate or independent existence before the manufacture of the hood. Similarly, in <em>Oohn \u00e9 Lewis, </em>which dealt with woolen hat shapes, the court held that the language \u201cmanufactured wholly or in part of wool felt\u201d presupposes that the material of which the article is made or manufactured exists before the article itself comes into existence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">. Interestingly enough, <em>Kohlberg </em>involved construction of the expression \u201claces * * <em>* </em>and articles wholly or in part thereof,\u201d appearing in paragraph 1529 of the 1930 Tariff Act, as applied to certain cotton gloves with lace cuffs, crocheted in one continuous operation. The importer argued that the importations were improperly classified under par. 1529 because the lace did not have a separate, independent existence prior to the manufacture of the gloves, citing Cohn <em>&amp; </em>Lewis v. United States, supra. Distinguishing that case and others cited therein, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-6\">* * * It is our view that Congress never intended that the provision \u201carticles * * * in part thereof\u201d should be given such an interpretation as to make it subject to the application of the said principle of a preexisting component material, * * *. Certainly, there is nothing in . the language used that even suggests that it should be given the construction which is here contended for by the importer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-12\">Neither the decision in the <em>Cohn &amp; Lewis </em>case, <em>supra, </em>nor that in any of the authorities cited therein (although several are cited and discussed) support the importer\u2019s contention. In the <em>Cohn &amp; Lewis </em>ease, this court felt compelled to follow a long line of decisions by it, of which Congress must have had knowledge at the time it used the controverted provision \u201cmanufactured * * * of felt.\u201d The words \u201cmanufactured * * * of\u201d necessarily imply or suggest that something that exists is taken and is manufactured into something else. The language at bar has no such connotation. To hold with appellant on this phase of the case would be more than an extension of the principle laid down in the <em>Cohn &amp; Lewis </em>case and the other well considered cases which it followed \u2014 it would be an unwarranted and unjustifiable application of a principle, which, in our view, should not have and does not have any place whatever in the case at bar.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
