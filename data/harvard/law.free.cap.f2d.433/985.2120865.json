After an evidentiary hearing conducted by a trial examiner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Board found that Conoco had violated section 8(a) (1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (5). It ordered the company to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice, to bargain collectively with the union<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the Board had certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of Conoeo\u2019s over-the-road truckdrivers, and to post appropriate notices. 177 N.L.R.B. No. 124. Considering the record as a whole, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s supplemental decision and bargaining order. <em>See </em>Home Town Foods, Inc. v. NLRB, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 392, 394; NLRB v. Golden Age Beverage Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 415 F.2d 26, 29, 32. Therefore, the Board\u2019s supplemental order is</p>\n<p id=\"AthH\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">. In a previous action, this Court set aside a Board order issued against Monroe Manufacturing Company (now Conoco Plastics), a division of Continental Oil Company, and remanded the case to the Board for a hearing on certain issues.

Subsequently the Board held a trial examiner\u2019s hearing on the merits and issued a supplemental decision and order.
