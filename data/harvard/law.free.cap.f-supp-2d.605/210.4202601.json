LEON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Counterclaim plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (or the \u201cULLICO parties\u201d) alleged that counterclaim defendants Joseph Carabillo, John K. Grelle, and James W. Luce breached their fiduciary duties to ULLICO Inc. (\u201cULLICO\u201d) and its various benefit plans, and that Carabillo engaged in legal malpractice. Counterclaim defendants (or \u201cCommittee Member defendants\u201d) filed for summary judgment, arguing that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to any of the six counts in the ULLICO parties\u2019 Consolidated Counterclaim. Counterclaim plaintiffs filed motions for partial summary judgment on two counts of the Consolidated Counterclaim: (1) breach of fiduciary duty to the Qualified Plan, and (2) professional negligence against counterclaim defendant Carabillo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, counterclaim defendants\u2019 motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and counterclaim plaintiffs\u2019 motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">ULLICO is a holding company created to raise capital for its various subsidiaries, which provide services to unions, union members, and their families. Consolidated Counterclaim (\u201cCountercl.\u201d) \u00b63. ULLICO sponsors several benefit plans, including the ULLICO Inc. Pension Plan and Trust (the \u201cQualified Plan\u201d), ULLICO Inc. Employees\u2019 Life and Health Welfare Plan (the \u201cWelfare Plan\u201d), and Union Labor Life Auxiliary Retirement Benefits Plan (the \u201cAuxiliary Plan\u201d). Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. ULLICO also established the ULLICO Inc. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the \u201cDeferred Compensation Plan\u201d). Countercl. \u00b68. Counterclaim defendants Carabillo, Grelle, and Luce<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> served as members of the Benefits Committee, which acted as plan administrator for the Qualified Plan, Welfare Plan, Auxiliary Plan, and Deferred Compensation Plan. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">In addition to their service on the Benefits Committee, Carabillo, Grelle, and Luce were officers of ULLICO. Carabillo served as the company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer from March 2, 1987 until he was terminated on May 30, 2003. Countercl. \u00b6 11. ULLICO employed Grelle as its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from January 2, 1996 until his resignation on February 25, 2003. Countercl. \u00b6 12. Luce was ULLICO\u2019s Executive Vice President from 1990 until his retirement-on June 1, 2003.

Facts\u201d) \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In early 2002, press reports began to appear concerning allegations of self-dealing by ULLICO corporate insiders. Countercl. \u00b6 85. The Board of Directors appointed former Illinois Governor James Thompson to investigate ULLICO\u2019s stock repurchase programs, stock purchase offers to directors and officers, and investment in the company Global Crossing, which produced a significant, but temporary, rise in ULLICO stock prices. Countercl. \u00b6 38, 85. ULLICO spent $6 million on the internal investigation of the stock transactions, including funds spent defending officers and directors in the investigation. Countercl. \u00b6 89. In the months and years following the issuance of the Thompson Report on November 26, 2002, Countercl. \u00b6 85, ULLICO became the target of multiple state and federal investigations, Countercl. \u00b6 90, and Carabillo, Grelle, and Luce left the company, Countercl. \u00b6 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Counterclaim defendants filed several suits in this Court for, among other things, recovery of their benefits under the various plans offered by ULLICO. The Court consolidated the eases for discovery purposes. Consolidation and Scheduling Order, June 1, 2005 [Dkt. # 115]. In its Consolidated Counterclaim, the ULLICO parties argued that Carabillo, Grelle, and Luce breached their fiduciary duties to the company and its benefit plans, and that Carabillo engaged in legal malpractice. Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 94-159. The plans at issue \u2014 and the largely undisputed facts surrounding the counterclaim defendants\u2019 conduct as to each of the plans \u2014 are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">A. Qualified Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Adopted in 1994, the Qualified Plan is a defined benefits plan; participants are entitled to a set amount of benefits each month, determined by a benefits formula set forth in the plan documents. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 13. The benefits are paid out of a trust established by ULLICO. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\n<em>1. Stock Repurchase Program</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">As plan administrator, the Benefits Committee was responsible for the management and investment of the Qualified Plan\u2019s assets, which included ULLICO stock. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 93. On November 3, 2000, ULLICO\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a stock repurchase program under which the company could repurchase up to $30 million of ULLICO stock at a \u201cbook value\u201d price of $146.04. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 105. This price was a substantial increase over recent years; in 1998, for example, the \u201cbook value\u201d of the stock was $28.70. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 106. This increase in the value of ULLICO stock was largely attributable to the company\u2019s investment in Global Crossing, Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 107, which had skyrocketed in value throughout 1998 and 1999, Countercl. \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Under the terms of the stock repurchase program, ULLICO had to receive tenders of all shares owned by shareholders holding more than 2% of the outstanding Class A and Class B shares of ULLICO stock. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 108. This rule could be waived by Chairman Robert Georgine if the waiver would not result in a \u201csignificant redistribution of equity.\u201d Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 110. The Qualified Plan was one of fifteen shareholders that held more than 2% of the outstanding shares of ULLICO stock, Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 111, and all fifteen shareholders tendered their stock as part of the repurchase plan, Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The stock repurchase program was fully subscribed, and ULLICO repurchased certain tendered shares on a prorated basis. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 129. The company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>repurchased all the tendered stock from those shareholders who held less than 10,-000 shares. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 104. Those shareholders with more than 10,000 shares were subject to proration. <em>Id. </em>The Qualified Plan held more than 10,000 shares and was able to redeem only 5,794 of the 263,233 shares it tendered. ULLICO\u2019s Response to Committee Member Defendants\u2019 Statement of Material Facts (\u201cCountercl. Pl. Facts\u201d) \u00b6 129. Counterclaim defendants also participated in the stock repurchase program, but each of them had less than 10,000 in ULLICO stock. Carabillo, Grelle, and Luce were therefore able to redeem their shares in full. Countercl. Pl. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 126,129.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Before the 2000 stock repurchase, the Qualified Plan owned 263,233 of ULLICO stock out of the 7,866,333 shares outstanding, or 3.3% of the stock. Countercl. Pl. Facts \u00b6 146. According to counterclaim plaintiffs\u2019 calculations, the Qualified Plan should have received 3.3% of the $30 million expended under the 2000 stock repurchase program, or $1,001,349. <em>Id. </em>The Qualified Plan only received $846,155.76. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The Board of Directors again authorized a stock repurchase in 2001, this time with a book value of $74.87 per share. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 131. The Benefits Committee tendered the Qualified Plan\u2019s stock during this repurchase program. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 134. The Qualified Plan\u2019s stock was again prorated, and it sold only 6,841 shares of ULLICO stock out of the 257,439 it tendered. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 142-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\n<em>2. Amendments to the Qualified Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Counterclaim defendants also twice amended the Qualified Plan in ways that inured to their personal benefit. The first amendment, adopted at the Benefits Committee\u2019s October 20, 1999 meeting, changed the definition of \u201cSponsoring Employee ULLICO Group Compensation\u201d in the Qualified Plan to include \u201cregularly established annual incentive compensation with no maximum, effective January 1, 2000.\u201d Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 73. This amendment effectively increased retirement benefits available to employees who were significantly compensated through incentive payments. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 73-74. Carabillo, Luce, and Grelle fell into this category; the amendment, therefore, significantly increased their retirement benefits. Statement of Material Facts in Support of ULLICO\u2019s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. on Plan Amendments (\u201cCountercl. Pl. Plan Amendment Facts\u201d) \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">On July 24, 2001, the Benefits Committee again amended the Qualified Plan. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b677. With this amendment to the accrual formula, the committee increased the percentage of an employee\u2019s average salary used to determine his normal retirement benefit. <em>Id. </em>Again, this change, which increased the percentage from 2% to 2.5%, directly benefited Carabillo, Luce, and Grelle. Countercl. Pl. Plan Amendment Facts \u00b620. Between the two amendments, the counterclaim defendants allegedly increased their benefit levels by nearly 100%. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Despite the passage of these amendments, counterclaim defendants may not have possessed the authority to amend the Qualified Plan at all. Section 11.1 of the plan provides that any amendment to the plan \u201cshall be made pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors[.]\u201d Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b625. On May 5, 1997, the Executive Committee, which possessed many of the powers of the Board of Directors, adopted a resolution creating the Benefits Committee. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. This resolution stated that the Benefits Committee would \u201cmeet regularly to administer, plan and <em>effect </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>changes </em>in the benefit plans.\u201d Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 38 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The counterclaim defendants believed the resolution creating the Benefits Committee gave the committee the power to amend the plan. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48-50. This belief was held by Carabillo, Chief Legal Officer of the company and a member of the committee, who advised his fellow members that they possessed amendment authority. Countercl. PI. Statement of Mat. Facts in Support of Its Mot. for Partial Summ. J. Against Joseph Carabillo for Legal Malpractice \u00b6 14. Counterclaim plaintiffs argue that the terms of the Qualified Plan unambiguously did not give counterclaim defendants such authority, and that counterclaim defendants\u2019 belief that it did is irrelevant. Countercl. PI. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">B. Auxiliary and Welfare Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In addition to the Qualified Plan, ULLICO sponsors two other benefit plans for many of its employees. The Welfare Plan maintains insurance policies that provide medical and life insurance coverage to participants. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 11. The Auxiliary Plan is a top hat plan; its purpose is to provide benefits that would be due under the Qualified Plan, but for Internal Revenue Code limits on the benefits that can be paid to an individual. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 20. Both the Welfare and Auxiliary plans are unfunded plans supported exclusively by the general assets of ULLICO. Countercl. PI. Facts \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">C. Deferred Compensation Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established the Deferred Compensation Plan, a top hat plan that covers only a select group of management or highly compensated employees, in August 1998. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 148-49. Counterclaim defendants participated in the plan. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 150. Under the terms of the plan, participants could defer up to 25% of their base salary and 100% of their bonuses and incentive awards. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 151. Participants could place their deferred compensation in \u201cdeemed investments,\u201d including ULLICO stock. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 152. The counterclaim defendants chose to move their entire account balances into \u201cdeemed investments\u201d in ULLICO stock. Countercl. PL Facts \u00b6 153. Carabillo, with the approval of Grelle, retrieved the entirety of his plan account under a financial hardship clause, which allows a participant to prematurely withdraw funds from the plan. Countercl. Pl. Facts \u00b6 155. Carabillo\u2019s reason for withdrawal \u2014 to help his mother with her medical expenses \u2014 is not one of the enumerated financial hardships that allows a participant to take advantage of this provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Counterclaim plaintiffs seek to disgorge or deny benefits otherwise owed to counterclaim defendants under each of these four plans. For the following reasons, counterclaim plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, succeed on all of their counterclaims, and counterclaim defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is therefore GRANTED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>party opposing a motion for summary judgment, however, \u201cmay not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must ... set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)(2). In deciding whether there is a genuine issue of material fact, the Court must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The majority of the Consolidated Counterclaim addresses breaches of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>ERISA requires a fiduciary to \u201cdischarge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1). To establish a breach of fiduciary duty to an ERISA benefit plan, a plaintiff must show, at a minimum, that (1) ERISA\u2019s fiduciary obligations apply to the plan, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a), and (2) the defendant acted as a fiduciary of the plan, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21). The allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty to the Auxiliary Plan, Welfare Plan, and Deferred Compensation Plan do not, for one reason or another, meet these basic requirements, and the Court therefore grants the motion for summary judgment, at least in part, on each of those claims. Disputed issues of fact as to other claims, such as the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty to the Qualified Plan, prevent the Court from entering judgment on those counts at this early stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">I. Breach of Fiduciary Duty to the Qualified Plan</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Counterclaim plaintiffs and counterclaim defendants both moved for summary judgment on the question of breach of fiduciary duty to the Qualified Plan (Count I). Counterclaim plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment in their favor only on the claim of breach of fiduciary duty as it relates to the allegedly unauthorized amendments. Counterclaim defendants argue that neither the amendments nor the stock repurchase program qualify as a breach of fiduciary duty to the Qualified Plan, and Count I should be dismissed in its entirety. Because both the amendment and the stock repurchase allegations rest on disputed issues of material fact, the motions for summary judgment are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\n<em>A. Plan Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">In every case charging a breach of ERISA fiduciary duty, the threshold question is \u201cwhether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to complaint.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Herdrich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 226, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000). A person acts as a fiduciary to the extent he \u201cexercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control -respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, ... or he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002(21)(A)(i),(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Not all actions taken by an ERISA fiduciary implicate these responsibilities because \u201cthe trustee under ERISA may wear different hats.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 225, 120 S.Ct. 2143. For example, an employer or plan sponsor does not act as an ERISA fiduciary when taking steps to modify or amend an employee benefit plan. <em>See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, </em>525 U.S. 432, 444, 119 S.Ct. 755, 142 L.Ed.2d 881 (1999) (\u201can employer\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>amend a pension plan ... does not implicate the employer\u2019s fiduciary duties\u201d); <em>Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, </em>517 U.S. 882, 891, 116 S.Ct. 1783, 135 L.Ed.2d 153 (1996) (\u201cthe act of amending a pension plan does not trigger ERISA\u2019s fiduciary provisions\u201d); <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, </em>514 U.S. 73, 78, 115 S.Ct. 1223, 131 L.Ed.2d 94 (1995) (\u201c[ejmployers or other plan sponsors are generally free under ERISA, for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate welfare plans\u201d); <em>Hartline v. Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l Pension Fund, </em>286 F.3d 598, 599 (D.C.Cir.2002) (\u201cemployers and plan sponsors do not act in a fiduciary capacity when they modify, adopt or amend plans\u201d). Rather than acting as fiduciaries, employers or plan sponsors amending a plan are \u201canalogous to the settlors of a trust[.]\u201d <em>Lockheed Corp., </em>517 U.S. at 890, 116 S.Ct. 1783.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The counterclaim defendants \u2014 plan administrators rather than employers or plan sponsors \u2014 argue that they, too, acted as settlors when they amended the Qualified Plan, and therefore they did not breach their fiduciary duty to the plan. The question here is whether plan administrators possibly <em>without </em>authority to amend the plan, such as the Committee Member defendants, can also act as settlors. The few cases cited by counterclaim defendants in support of their theory that any act of amendment by plan administrators \u2014 authorized or not \u2014 falls outside the scope of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary provisions all involved administrators who had been given authority to amend the plan. <em>See Campbell v. BankBoston, N.A., </em>327 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2003) (\u201cthe administrator had the power to amend, modify, or discontinue the plan for any reason at any time\u201d); <em>Siskind v. Sperry Ret. Program, </em>47 F.3d 498, 501 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201c[t]he plan documents also identified the Committee [the plan administrator] as the entity with power to amend the plan\u201d). There is little authority for the proposition that a plan administrator without power to amend the plan acts as a settlor if he modifies the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The analysis undergirding the legal distinction between settlor acts and fiduciary acts supports the conclusion that plan administrators cannot take refuge in the <em>Curtiss-Wright/Lockheed </em>line of cases unless they have amendment authority. <em>See Lockheed Corp., </em>517 U.S. at 890, 116 S.Ct. 1783; <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>514 U.S. at 78, 115 S.Ct. 1223. ERISA does not impose a fiduciary responsibility on employers or plan sponsors when they amend a plan because \u201cthe trustee under ERISA may wear different hats.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 225, 120 S.Ct. 2143. An employer can wear at least two hats: fiduciary when managing a plan and settlor when amending a plan. <em>See id. </em>But amending or terminating a plan is typically beyond the power of a plan administrator. <em>Varity Corp. v. Howe, </em>516 U.S. 489, 505, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). To call a plan administrator who usurps this authority a settlor, and thus beyond the reach of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary obligations, would allow any administrator to amend a plan in unauthorized, harmful ways without consequence. Such a holding would make a mockery of ERISA\u2019s command that a fiduciary \u201cdischarge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Thus, to determine whether the Committee Member defendants breached their fiduciary duty, the Court first must determine whether a valid delegation of amendment authority occurred. This is a factual issue in dispute. The ULLICO parties argue that, under the terms of the Qualified Plan, only the company\u2019s Board of Directors, by resolution, can amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>plan. Countercl. PI. Plan Amendments Reply at 4. The Committee Member defendants point to the resolution instituting the Benefits Committee, and the circumstances surrounding the creation of the committee, as support for their position that the Board delegated its amendment authority. Countercl. Def. Plan Amendments Opp. at 10-14. Because this issue of fact must be resolved before the Court can determine whether the Committee Member defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the plan, both counterclaim plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and the Committee Member defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this aspect of Count I must be DENIED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>B. Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Counterclaim defendants also argue that the claim relating to the October 20, 1999 amendment to the Qualified Plan is time-barred. The applicable statute of limitations for a breach of fiduciary duty claim under ERISA is six years from the date of the last action constituting a part of the breach, or three years from the date a plaintiff first had actual knowledge of the breach. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1113(l)-(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Counterclaim defendants contend that the three-year statute of limitations should apply because knowledge of the 1999 amendment was widespread throughout the company, and that Louis Hejl, Jr., ULLICO\u2019s director of corporate benefits, was present at the Benefits Committee meeting when the amendment was adopted. Countercl. Def. Mot. at 25-27. These facts do indicate that ULLICO had knowledge that the Benefits Committee had amended the Qualified Plan. But what the facts fail to establish is whether knowledge of the amendment also communicated the existence of a breach of fiduciary duty. <em>See Fink v. Nat\u2019l Sav. and Trust Co., </em>772 F.2d 951, 957 (D.C.Cir.1985); <em>Gluck v. Unisys Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1168, 1177 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Actual knowledge of a breach or violation requires that a plaintiff have actual knowledge of all material facts necessary to understand that some claim exists. <em>See Gluck, </em>960 F.2d at 1177. Hejl did not have that knowledge; he was unaware that the Benefits Committee may have lacked amendment authority until 2003. Countercl. PI. Facts \u00b6 75. Counterclaim defendants provide no basis for this Court to conclude that the other ULLICO employees aware of the amendment knew of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>alleged illegality. Therefore, because counterclaim plaintiffs brought their actions well before the six-year statute of limitations on these claims, the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action based on the 1999 amendment is not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>C. Stock Repurchases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Disputed issues of fact also preclude summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim rooted in the stock repurchases. Counterclaim defendants rest their argument on three foundations: (1) the decision to tender the Qualified Plan\u2019s stock was \u201cin the best interests of the Plan,\u201d Countercl. Def. Mot. at 29-37; (2) a decision not to tender the Qualified Plan\u2019s stock would not have prevented the stock repurchase plan from going forward, Countercl. Def. Mot. at 39-41; and (3) ULLICO repurchased the Qualified Plan\u2019s stock for well above its actual value, which constituted adequate consideration, Countercl. Def. Mot. at 37-38. All of these facts are disputed by the counterclaim plaintiffs. The ULLICO parties argue that (1) counterclaim defendants redeemed the Qualified Plan\u2019s shares, not because they were acting \u201cin the best interests of the Plan,\u201d but in order to ensure they could redeem their own shares, Countercl. PI. Opp. at 17-20; (2) it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that had the Qualified Plan not tendered its shares, the repurchase program would not have gone forward, Countercl. PI. Opp. at 21-22; and (3) the Qualified Plan\u2019s shares were subject to proration and, therefore, the plan did not receive adequate consideration, Countercl. PI. Opp. at 22. These are factual disputes that cannot be resolved on summary judgment. Therefore, counterclaim defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Count I as to the stock repurchase claim is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">II. Breach of Fiduciary Duty to the Welfare and Auxiliary Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Counterclaim plaintiffs argue that counterclaim defendants\u2019 alleged self-dealing, which resulted in internal and government investigations costing millions of dollars, harmed the Welfare and Auxiliary plans because ULLICO funded those plans out of its general treasury. However, despite whatever harm counterclaim defendants may have done to ULLICO, they cannot, as a matter of law, be liable under ERISA\u2019s fiduciary provisions for decisions they made as corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">As with the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty to the Qualified Plan, the threshold question with these claims is \u201cwhether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to complaint.\u201d <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 225, 120 S.Ct. 2143. An employee assumes fiduciary status \u201cwhen and to the extent that they function in their capacity as plan administrators, not when they conduct business that is not regulated by ERISA.\u201d <em>Sys. Council EM-3 v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>972 F.Supp. 21, 30 (D.D.C.1997) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also Barry v. Trustees of the Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n Full-Time Salaried Officers and Employees of Outside Local Unions, </em>404 F.Supp.2d 145, 151 (D.D.C. 2005) (\u201cthe ERISA statute recognizes that individuals may be both ERISA plan fiduciaries and officers or other employees in a corporation\u201d). The allegations with respect to the Welfare and Auxiliary plans clearly implicate the counterclaim defendants\u2019 roles as corporate officers rather than plan fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Counterclaim plaintiffs do not allege that the counterclaim defendants\u2019 actions harmed the Welfare and Auxiliary plans directly. Instead, they argue that counterclaim defendants harmed ULLICO, and, because the Welfare and Auxiliary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>plans were funded from the ULLICO general treasury, those plans were also harmed. Countercl. PI. Opp. at 23-25. Yet the investigations targeting the company, the alleged source of ULLICO\u2019s inability to fund the plans, focused on \u201cbusiness that is not regulated by ERISA,\u201d <em>Sys. Council EM-3, </em>972 F.Supp. at 30, such as the implementation of a stock repurchase program. An indirect link between these business decisions and the ability of the company to fund the plans does not constitute an exercise of management or authority over the plans. <em>See Barry, </em>404 F.Supp.2d at 153 (finding defendant\u2019s \u201cfiduciary obligations did not apply to his involvement in ULLICO\u2019s purchase and repurchase programs because he did not exercise management or authority over either the Plan or Plan assets when he took that action\u201d). The Committee Member defendants were therefore not acting in their ERISA fiduciary capacity and cannot be held liable for a breach of fiduciary duty to these plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Counterclaim plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis of a similar case is unavailing. In <em>United States v. Carson, </em>52 F.3d 1173, 1189-90 (2d Cir.1995), the court found that a fiduciary could be held liable under ERISA based on damage to the plan sponsor. But the Second Circuit did not analyze whether the defendant was acting in a fiduciary or corporate capacity at the time he harmed the plan sponsor. <em>Id. </em>And, to the extent that <em>Carson </em>stands for the proposition that an ERISA fiduciary can be held liable for his corporate acts when those acts harm the benefits plan, the Supreme Court overruled that holding in its later decision in <em>Pegram, </em>530 U.S. at 225-26, 120 S.Ct. 2143. Since <em>Pegram, </em>courts have consistently rejected attempts to hold corporate officers liable under ERISA for corporate activities that have an indirect effect on a company plan. <em>See, e.g., Holdeman v. Devine, </em>474 F.3d 770, 780 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Thus, for all of the above reasons, summary judgement is GRANTED for counterclaim defendants as to Counts II and III of the Consolidated Counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">III. Breach of Fiduciary Duty to the Auxiliary and Deferred Compensations Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The claim of breach of fiduciary duty to the Auxiliary Plan fails for a second reason: the Auxiliary Plan is a top hat plan that is exempt from ERISA\u2019s fiduciary requirements. The Deferred Compensation Plan also falls into this category. Countercl. Def. Facts \u00b6 149. Because neither of these plans is governed by ERISA\u2019s fiduciary provisions, the Committee Member defendants could not have breached their fiduciary duties to the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Top hat plans are unfunded plans \u201cmaintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051(2). These plans are wholly exempt from ERISA\u2019s fiduciary requirements. <em>See Carabillo v. ULLICO, Inc., </em>357 F.Supp.2d 249, 258 (D.D.C.2004) (ERISA \u201cexpressly exempts [top hat] plans from its fiduciary duty, vesting, and funding provisions.\u201d). There is \u201cno cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty involving a top hat plan[,]\u201d <em>Goldstein v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>251 F.3d 433, 443 (3d Cir.2001), and counterclaim defendants owed no fiduciary duty to either the Auxiliary Plan or the Deferred Compensation Plan. Counterclaim defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the breach of fiduciary duty to these plans, is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>GRANTED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Yet counterclaim plaintiffs do not restrict their breach of fiduciary duty claims solely to the Deferred Compensation Plan. They additionally argue that the counterclaim defendants breached their fiduciary duty to ULLICO, and that breach should serve as a basis to deny them benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Countercl. PL Opp. at 26 (\u201c[T]he duties breached by Counterclaim Defendants under Count VI stem not only from their positions as fiduciaries to the Deferred Compensation Plan, <em>but also from their duties owed to ULLICO Inc. under state corporate law[.T) </em>(emphasis added). Committee Member defendants counter that this fiduciary duty \u2014 which is rooted in state law \u2014 is preempted by ERISA. Countercl. Def. Mot. at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">This Court has squarely rejected counterclaim defendants\u2019 argument in the past, <em>Carabillo, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 259 n. 7, and they have provided no valid reason for the .Court to change its position. While ERISA preempts state law claims that \u201crelate to any [ERISA] employee benefit plan,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), \u201c\u2018run-of-the-mill\u2019 state law claims such as unpaid rent, failure to pay creditors, or even torts committed by an ERISA plan\u201d are not subject to ERISA preemption. <em>Carabillo, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 259 n. 7 (quoting <em>Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Serv., Inc., </em>486 U.S. 825, 833, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988)). This Court held that the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty to ULLICO were not preempted because they \u201cderive from the counterclaim defendants\u2019 obligations and responsibilities as officers of the corporation under state corporate law, rather than their relationship to the [Auxiliary and Deferred Compensation] plans as beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Mem. Op. and Order, March 29, 2005 [Dkt. # 101], at 6 n. 11. The claims here are no different, and they are not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Counterclaim defendants further assert that this state law claim is outside the scope of the Court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction. Once again, I disagree. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a), courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction \u201cover all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tion that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\u201d The \u201ccase or controversy\u201d analysis is significantly broader, and can conceivably capture more claims, than the preemption question. Indeed, I previously decided that a claim that the former corporate officers were not entitled to benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan because the plan \u201cwas administered in violation of the fiduciary duties owed to ULLICO\u201d fell within this Court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction and was not preempted by ERISA. <em>Carabillo, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 256, 259. In short, I found that there was a \u201cfactual nexus\u201d between counterclaim defendants\u2019 ERISA claims and the counterclaim plaintiffs\u2019 argument that benefits cannot be paid out under the Deferred Compensation Plan. <em>Carabillo, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 259. The same holds true here, and therefore Count VI falls within the Court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Thus, while the breach of fiduciary duty claims as to the Deferred Compensation and Auxiliary plans are dismissed, the claim that counterclaim defendants breached their fiduciary duty to ULLICO, and therefore their benefits from the Deferred Compensation Plan may be disgorged or denied, survives the counterclaim defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">IV. Professional Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In Count IV of its Consolidated Counterclaim, the sole claim unrelated to a breach of fiduciary duty, counterclaim plaintiffs allege that Carabillo committed professional negligence by providing erroneous legal advice to the Benefits Committee regarding its ability to amend the Qualified Plan. The ULLICO parties moved for partial summary judgment on this issue, as did the Committee Member defendants. Committee Member defendants argue, among other things, that this count should be dismissed as outside the Court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction. The Court previously dismissed a nearly identical claim because it did not relate to Carabillo\u2019s affirmative claims for plan benefits, <em>Carabillo, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 255-56, and counterclaim plaintiffs have pointed to no change in the claim that would bring it within the Court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Under this Court\u2019s prior ruling, the only counterclaims that fall within the scope of the litigation \u201care those that relate to whether Carabillo and other former ULLICO officers are entitled to the retirement benefits they claim they are eligible to receive.\u201d <em>Carabillo, </em>357 F.Supp.2d at 255. Count IV falls well short of that criteria. The claim seeks no offset from Carabillo\u2019s retirement benefits; the only relief sought is a money judgment from Carabillo\u2019s general assets. Counterclaim \u00b6 131 &amp; Prayer for Relief. The Court dismissed this allegation in its previous iteration, Count II of ULLICO\u2019s Amended Answer and Counterclaim, because it was \u201cessentially a state law claim with little, or no, factual nexus to Carabillo\u2019s ERISA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>claim.\u201d Mem. Op. and Order, March 29, 2005 [Dkt. # 101], at 5. The same holds true for Count IV of the Consolidated Counterclaim. Summary judgment on this claim is therefore GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">A genuine issue of material fact exists as to Count I \u2014 breach of fiduciary duty to the Qualified Plan \u2014 and both parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment on that claim are therefore DENIED. Counterclaim defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on three claims: (1) breach of fiduciary duty to the Welfare Plan (Count II), (2) breach of fiduciary duty to the Auxiliary Plan (Count III), and (3) professional negligence against Carabillo (Count IV). The motion for summary judgment as to these claims is therefore GRANTED. Counterclaim defendants are also entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the allegation that they breached their fiduciary duty to the Deferred Compensation Plan, but not on the allegation that they breached their fiduciary duty to ULLICO, and therefore summary judgment on Count VI is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The final count \u2014 requesting setoff of Auxiliary Plan benefits as relief for the alleged breach of fiduciary duty to ULLICO (Count V) \u2014 cannot be decided on summary judgment, and the motion as to that count is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">.Counterclaim plaintiffs are ULLICO Inc.; ULLICO Inc.

Counterclaim plaintiffs further argue that Maryland corporate law, Md.Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 2-411(a), prohibits the delegation of \"any of the powers of the board of directors\u2019\u2019 to any committee that includes non-directors, such as the Benefits Committee. Under this interpretation of the statute, any delegation of board power \u2014 such as amendment authority \u2014 to the Benefits Committee is legally invalid. Countercl. PI. Plan Amendments Reply at 18-22. Counterclaim plaintiffs cite no Maryland court that agrees with their reading of the statute, and the only court to have apparently considered this aspect of the statute squarely rejected the interpretation counterclaim plaintiffs ask of this Court. <em>See Krishan v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>873 F.Supp. 345, 353 (C.D.Cal.1994). Moreover, the plain language of the statute is ambiguous as to whether a director must be a member of any committee exercising board power, or whether such a committee must be comprised exclusively of directors. To hold that a committee exercising board authority must be comprised exclusively of directors would conflict with another provision of Maryland corporate law, Md.Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 2-414(a), which permits an <em>officer </em>to act on authority granted by board resolution. This Court therefore will not grant partial summary judgment to counterclaim plaintiffs under this line of reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b279-12\">.

Counterclaim plaintiffs also argue that Counts II, III, and VI properly arise under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), Countercl. PI. Opp. at 25 n. 2, 28-29, which allows courts to fashion equitable relief to redress violations of either ERISA or the terms of the plans. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3). To the extent that counterclaim plaintiffs claim equitable relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, their argument must fail. With 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1), Congress provided adequate relief for the breaches of fiduciary duty counterclaim plaintiffs complain of; simply because counterclaim plaintiffs have failed to prevail under that section does not entitle them to avail themselves of ERISA's catch-all provision. <em>See Varity Corp., </em>516 U.S. at 515, 116 S.Ct. 1065 (in construing ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), courts should respect \"policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others\") (quoting <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 54, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987)). To the extent counterclaim plaintiffs argue that counterclaim defendants violated plan terms, this claim, too, must fail. The ULLICO parties specifically alleged in the counterclaim that Grelle, Luce, and Carabillo breached their fiduciary duties, but they did not allege any violation of plan terms until they filed their opposition to counterclaim defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Counterclaim defendants did not have fair notice of the claim, and to raise it at this late stage is insufficient to withstand summary judgment. <em>See Ali v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>278 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C.Cir.2002); <em>Sinclair v. Kleindienst, </em>711 F.2d 291, 293 (D.C.Cir.1983) (holding that complaint must give \"defendant fair notice of plaintiff's claim and the grounds on which it rests\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">.

To succeed, counterclaim defendants must show that the contractual language was \"specific and precise\u201d in explaining the intent of the parties to preclude setoff. <em>In re Carlyle, </em>242 B.R. 881, 892 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1999). The terms of the Auxiliary and Deferred Compensation plans are, at best, ambiguous as to whether they prohibit forfeiture or setoff, and the Court therefore will not grant summary judgment on the basis of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
