II. Where appellant claimed to have disarmed his blind, suicidal father after the latter fired his gun at home, the court erred in giving the jury, as the only example of a \"proper\u201d defense of temporary, innocent gun possession, a hypothetical of defendant disarming someone who intended to use the gun to harm \"others\u201d, which example counsel protested as \"misleading\u201d and \"too narrow\u201d. <em>(People v Williams, </em>50 NY2d 1043; <em>People v Persce, </em>204 NY 397; <em>People v Montgomery, </em>106 AD2d 410; <em>People v Jones, </em>104 AD2d 826; <em>People v Figueroa, </em>80 AD2d 520; <em>People v Tabarez, </em>69 NY2d 663; <em>People v Ellis, </em>171 AD2d 619; <em>People v Thomas, </em>172 AD2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>572; <em>People v Whitehead, </em>123 AD2d 895; <em>People v Hayes, </em>55 AD2d 812.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-4\"><em>Richard A.

The trial court properly granted the prosecutor\u2019s request for a missing witness charge as to defendant\u2019s father, and this ruling did not deny defendant his right to a fair trial. <em>(People v Rodriguez, </em>38 NY2d 95; <em>People v Wilson, </em>64 NY2d 634; <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>68 NY2d 424; <em>People v Singleton, </em>42 NY2d 466; <em>People v Brown, </em>34 NY2d 163; <em>People v Paulin, </em>70 NY2d 685; <em>United States v MMR Corp., </em>907 F2d 489; <em>Griffin v California, </em>380 US 609; <em>People v Thomas, </em>51 NY2d 466; <em>Marine Midland Bank v Russo Produce Co., </em>50 NY2d 31.)

Defendant was arrested on August 2, 1990 when a number of police officers responded to a radio report of shots fired in the vicinity of defendant\u2019s residence in Queens. Three of the responding officers testified at defendant\u2019s trial. According to their testimony, upon arriving at the defendant\u2019s home, the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>observed what appeared to be bullet holes in a window screen and the garage door, and a spent round was recovered next to the house. Defendant then gave the officers consent to enter the house. While the officers were inside, they observed defendant reaching toward a pile of clothes on a table. As one officer stopped defendant\u2019s movement, another officer sifted through the clothes and discovered a .45 caliber pistol. The officer who actually physically recovered the pistol from under the pile of clothes did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The theory of the defense was that defendant was in temporary and lawful possession of the pistol <em>(see, People v Williams, </em>50 NY2d 1043). In support, defendant testified as follows. The pistol belonged to his father, who also lived in the same house. His father was totally blind and suffered from serious depression, and had expressed a desire to kill himself the night before defendant\u2019s arrest. The next day, after hearing gunshots in the kitchen and finding his father holding the pistol, defendant took the gun from his father and hid it in a hutch in the living room. Defendant\u2019s brother came to the house and took their father to his home before the police arrived and found the pistol secreted in the hutch. Defendant, however, did not call or subpoena his father as a witness to confirm the foregoing version of his temporary, innocent possession of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Upon the People\u2019s request, the trial court granted a missing witness charge against defendant based upon his failure to call his father as a witness, notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s contention that the father, if called, would probably have to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The court, however, declined defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness charge regarding the officer who actually recovered the pistol. Defendant appealed and the Appellate Division affirmed (193 AD2d 702), concluding that because defendant\u2019s father was not called or subpoenaed by the defense, the missing witness charge was properly granted to the People. A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Defendant\u2019s primary contention on this appeal is that the trial court erred in granting a missing witness charge as to defendant\u2019s father. Defendant\u2019s essential position is that a missing witness charge should not be given with respect to an uncalled defense witness in any case where the witness\u2019 potential testimony could be self-incriminating, such that the witness might invoke his or her Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Although a court may not ordinarily comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify or otherwise come forward with evidence at trial, it is by now well settled that once a defendant does so, the customary standards for giving a missing witness charge apply <em>(see, People v Wilson, </em>64 NY2d 634, 635-636; <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>38 NY2d 95, 98; <em>see also, Graves v United States, </em>150 US 118, 121). As set forth in <em>People v Gonzalez </em>(68 NY2d 424), the party seeking the missing witness charge must sustain an initial burden of showing that the opposing party has failed to call a witness who could be expected to have knowledge regarding a material issue in the case and to provide testimony favorable to the opposing party <em>(id., </em>at 427-428; <em>see also, People v Kitching, </em>78 NY2d 532, 536-537). The burden then shifts to the opposing party, in order to defeat the request, \"to account for the witness\u2019 absence or otherwise demonstrate that the charge would not be appropriate. This burden can be met by demonstrating that the witness is not knowledgeable about the issue, that the issue is not material or relevant, that although the issue is material or relevant, the testimony would be cumulative to other evidence, that the witness is not 'available\u2019, or that the witness is not under the party\u2019s 'control\u2019 such that he would not be expected to testify in his or her favor\u201d <em>(People v Gonzalez, supra, </em>at 428; <em>see, People v Kitching, supra, </em>at 537).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In the instant case, the People made an adequate prima facie showing, based upon defendant\u2019s own testimony, that his father was knowledgeable about a material issue in the case, i.e., whether defendant\u2019s possession of the weapon was innocent and lawful. It was also established that this missing witness could be expected to testify favorably to defendant <em>(see, People v Rodriguez, supra, </em>at 98, n 1 [\"A spouse or relative is perforce deemed to be under the defendant\u2019s control\u201d]). Accordingly, the burden shifted to defendant to account for the witness\u2019 absence or to otherwise demonstrate that the charge would be inappropriate. The only showing made by defendant to counter the People\u2019s request was defense counsel\u2019s unsubstantiated statement that the father would probably have to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination if called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>we recognized that if the uncalled witness were a codefendant likely to invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify, a missing witness charge against the defense would be inappropriate <em>(supra, </em>at 100). The same</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>rule extends to uncalled accomplices, even if uncharged <em>(see, </em>1 Wharton, Criminal Evidence \u00a7 88, at 275 [14th ed 1985]). The reasons underlying this exception are: (1) that the witness\u2019 probable invocation of the privilege casts into doubt one of the requisite preconditions of the missing witness inference, that the uncalled witness would likely testify <em>favorably </em>to the party opposing the charge <em>(see, United States v Pitts, </em>918 F2d 197, 200 [DC Cir]); (2) that such a witness must be deemed \"unavailable\u201d to the opponent of the charge <em>(see, Lawson v United States, </em>514 A2d 787, 791-792 [DC Ct App]; and (3) the concern that the witness\u2019 invocation of the privilege on the stand might result in undue prejudice to the defendant <em>(see, United States v Pitts, supra, </em>at 200; <em>Christensen v State, </em>274 Md 133, 140, 333 A2d 45, 49).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The dispositive issue on this point is whether, in order to avoid a missing witness charge, defendant was required to verify that his father\u2019s material testimony would have been self-incriminating and that he would likely have invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and refused to testify. One eminent authority has suggested that such verification should be required in all cases: \"the witness should at least have been summoned and asked, for he may waive the privilege\u201d (2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 286, at 201 [Chadbourn rev 1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Nonetheless, there are instances where the prosecution\u2019s own evidence establishes the existence of the witness and his or her involvement in the criminal activity for which the defendant is on trial. Because the undisputable inference in such circumstances would clearly be that the material testimony of that witness would likely be incriminating and that the witness would refuse to testify, further verification would be unnecessary. And the cases, generally involving uncalled accomplices, so hold <em>(see, e.g., United States v Pitts, supra; Lawson v United States, supra; Christensen v State, supra; State v Cavness, </em>46 Haw 470, 381 P2d 685).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Additional safeguards should, however, be required when the defendant is the only source of proof of either the existence of the uncalled witness or that favorable testimony of that witness would be self-incriminating. In such circumstances, the possibility of incurring an unfavorable missing witness charge would be a significant deterrent against a fabricated defense version, shifting criminal responsibility to the uncalled witness. Charges of illegal possession of contraband are particularly amenable to such a defense stratagem. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Thus, although Maryland does not require verification in denying a missing witness charge when the uncalled witness is a known, acknowledged accomplice <em>(see, Christensen v State, </em>274 Md 133, 333 A2d 45, <em>supra), </em>that State\u2019s highest court has required verification in a criminal possession of a stolen vehicle case when the \"[uncalled witness\u2019] existence and his involvement in this case were not demonstrated by any evidence other than the testimony of the defendant\u201d, explaining that \"[i]t is not uncommon for one found in exclusive possession of recently stolen property to fabricate a story involving another person as the provider of the property \u2014 some person often said to be known only by a street name, who supposedly gave, sold, or loaned the property to the defendant under the most innocent of circumstances\u201d <em>(Robinson v State, </em>315 Md 309, 317, 554 A2d 395, 399).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Likewise here, defendant\u2019s position on appeal would permit him to shift the criminal wrongdoing from himself to his father and absolve him from calling his father as a witness, based solely on his own assurances that the father was present, participated in the criminal activity and would verify defendant\u2019s version except for the risk of self-incriminatian. None of these facts was subject to confirmation by the police because, according to the defendant, his father left the premises between the time the weapon was fired and the police arrived. Under these circumstances, requiring some additional, nonprejudicial substantiation by the defendant represents a fair balancing of the competing legitimate interests of the People (to deter a perjurious defense) and of the defendant (to avoid an unfavorable missing witness charge when a material witness would actually be likely to refuse to testify because of the risk of self-incrimination). As the Maryland Court of Appeals noted, \"it should be kept in mind that the witness may be questioned out of the presence of the jury concerning the privilege, and if a privilege is claimed the trial judge may use that information to rule out a missing witness instruction\u201d <em>(Robinson v State, </em>315 Md, at 316, 554 A2d, at 398, <em>supra). </em>We suggested as much in <em>People v Rodriguez </em>when we stated, in upholding a missing witness instruction in that case, \"[n]or was there here an <em>assertion by or on behalf of the witness </em>that he would invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer questions\u201d (38 NY2d 95, 100, <em>supra </em>[emphasis supplied]). Thus, we cannot conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to grant the missing witness charge against the defendant in the absence of any verifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tian that the witness\u2019 testimony would be self-incriminating and he would likely refuse to testify on self-incrimination grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We likewise conclude that the trial court acted within the bounds of its discretion in rejecting defendant\u2019s request for a missing witness charge as to the officer who actually retrieved the gun from underneath the pile of clothing. Three officers testified regarding defendant\u2019s movements toward the location where the gun was found, and two testified specifically as to the retrieval of the gun from a pile of clothing on a table by their fellow officer. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the missing officer would have testified differently or in accordance with defendant\u2019s claim that the gun was retrieved from the living room hutch. \"It is not incumbent upon the prosecution 'to call at trial every witness to a crime or to make a complete and detailed accounting to the defense of all law enforcement investigatory work\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v Buckler, </em>39 NY2d 895, 897 [quoting <em>People v Stridiron, </em>33 NY2d 287, 292]), and there is ample support in the record that the missing officer\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative and therefore not a proper subject of a missing witness charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Finally, upon our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s charge on temporary and innocent possession, when read as a whole, was sufficient to impart to the jury the correct rule to apply in reaching its verdict <em>(see, People v Canty, </em>60 NY2d 830).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b248-8\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">(dissenting). The simple premise underlying an adverse inference charge for a missing witness is that a person in a party\u2019s control, and capable of offering favorable, material testimony, would \"naturally\u201d be expected to testify for that party given the party\u2019s litigation theory <em>(People v Gonzalez, </em>68 NY2d 424, 427). Thus, the party\u2019s failure to call that presumably \"friendly\u201d witness permits the logical inference that the witness was not summoned because the anticipated testimony would have been unfavorable. Where, under the party\u2019s theory, that person could give material testimony only by incriminating himself or herself, it is no longer a valid assumption that he or she would testify in the party\u2019s favor and simultaneously risk his or her own prosecution. Accordingly, I cannot join the majority\u2019s conclusion that a missing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>witness charge was warranted here because defendant failed to verify that his father would have invoked the privilege against self-incrimination \u2014 a point which was never disputed by the People. Rather, I would hold that because defendant\u2019s father would undeniably have had to place himself in criminal jeopardy to materially support his son\u2019s defense, the People failed to meet their initial burden of proving that the missing witness would \"naturally\u201d be expected to testify favorably to defendant, and an adverse inference charge was improper on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As the majority recognizes, the People bore the burden in the first instance, as the proponents of the missing witness charge, to establish both that defendant\u2019s father was \"knowledgeable about a material issue\u201d in the case and \"would naturally be expected to provide * * * testimony favorable to the party who has not called him\u201d <em>(Gonzalez, </em>68 NY2d, at 427; <em>see, </em>majority opn, at 177). The latter element of that test, referred to as \"control,\u201d will be satisfied when the prosecution establishes that the absent witness\u2019 testimony would not be hostile to the defense theory of the case. Only after that burden was satisfied was defendant required to come forward with evidence within his exclusive knowledge to otherwise \"account for the witness\u2019 absence\u201d <em>(Gonzalez, supra, </em>at 428) and defeat the prosecution\u2019s claim that his father would have been a witness with \" 'good will\u2019 \u201d towards the defense <em>(id., </em>at 430, quoting Richardson, Evidence \u00a7 92, at 66 [Prince 10th ed]). In this case, the burden never shifted to defendant, and it is on this point that I depart from the majority\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The majority erroneously concludes that the People met their burden of proving that defendant\u2019s father was under defendant\u2019s \"control\u201d merely by demonstrating that a familial relationship existed between defendant and the missing witness, and that the burden then shifted to defendant to verify that his father would have invoked the privilege against self-incrimination <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 177). This overly simplistic view ignores the reality that other circumstances \u2014 such as the obvious risk of criminal prosecution \u2014 may operate to negate the inference derived from the natural tendency of a family member to testify with a bias in favor of a relative and will preclude the party seeking the charge from satisfying its initial burden. Indeed, while a familial relationship may generally be indicative of good will between a party and a witness, it is by no means dispositive of the determination that the witness is within that party\u2019s control, and the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ity misreads this Court\u2019s precedent in concluding that the prosecution met its burden here simply by relying on that fact <em>(see, People v Gonzalez, </em>68 NY2d 424, <em>supra; People v Rodriguez, </em>38 NY2d 95; <em>People v De Jesus, </em>42 NY2d 519, 525).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The majority properly acknowledges that no further verification of a missing witness\u2019 existence or plans to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination is needed where \"the undisputable inference * * * would clearly be that the material testimony of that witness would likely be incriminating and that the witness would refuse to testify\u201d (majority opn, at 178). In other words, where \"the most likely result of calling * * * a witness would have been his refusal to testify on self-incrimination grounds\u201d, the inference that the witness would have given testimony favorable to the party who otherwise would have naturally called him or her is negated and the proponent\u2019s burden is not satisfied <em>(People v Bessard, </em>148 AD2d 49, 54 [3d Dept 1989, Levine, J.]). Indeed, \"the jury is not entitled to draw any inference from a failure to testify that is ascribable to the witness\u2019s reliance on his Fifth Amendment privilege\u201d <em>(Bowles v United States, </em>439 F2d 536, 542 [DC Cir 1970]; <em>see also, Pennewell v United States, </em>353 F2d 870, 871 [DC Cir 1965]). There is no sound reason for the majority\u2019s failure to apply that analysis to preclude adverse comment on the absence of defendant\u2019s father here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Part of the internal logic of defense theory \u2014 i.e., that defendant\u2019s father was the true possessor of the gun \u2014 is inherently inconsistent with any expectation that the absent father would substantiate that defense. Thus, it would not be natural or logical for the defense to call this witness, whose interests are potentially adverse to the defense theory, and no adverse comment is justified on this record <em>(see, United States v Pitts, </em>918 F2d 197, 200 [DC Cir 1990]). Additionally, the majority\u2019s fears that a defendant could mount a perjurious defense by shifting the blame to a fictitious third party are not implicated here <em>(see, </em>majority opn, at 178). Significantly, the People do not dispute that defendant\u2019s father exists, or that he owned the house where the gun was found. Indeed, the People never disputed that defendant\u2019s father was likely to invoke the 5th Amendment privilege, that defense counsel had knowledge of that fact or that he had met with the missing witness. Rather, the People\u2019s sole contention in support of their request for an adverse inference charge \u2014 and the sole basis for the trial court\u2019s grant of that request \u2014 was that defendant\u2019s father could testify to other nonincriminatory facts, such as his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>depression and suicidal thoughts, which would not subject him to criminal prosecution. Tellingly, the framing of the prosecution\u2019s request itself is internally inconsistent with the notion that any doubt existed as to the witness\u2019 existence or intent to invoke the privilege. Defense counsel was never required to substantiate the accepted assertion that defendant\u2019s father would have invoked his privilege, and should not now be penalized for failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In any event, testimony by the father as to those collateral facts, although relevant, would not have supported the defense in any material respect. To do so, defendant\u2019s father would have had to testify as to the sole material issue in the case\u2014 who possessed the gun. Indeed, even a statement by defendant\u2019s father that he owned or was present in the house when the shots were fired and where the gun was found could have potentially subjected him to criminal liability on a constructive possession theory. Clearly, where, as here, an alternative explanation exists for a witness\u2019 absence which is at least as likely as the prospect that the witness was not called because the testimony would be damaging, the adverse inference loses its probative force and should not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Finally, it cannot be said on this record that the error in adversely commenting on defendant\u2019s father\u2019s absence was harmless where the heart of the defense was that the missing witness was the actual culprit and that defendant had temporarily taken possession of the gun to secure that witness\u2019 safety. Indeed, defendant\u2019s success depended solely on the jury\u2019s assessment of his credibility and its acceptance of defendant\u2019s claim that his father was the true possessor of the gun, and the missing witness charge may well have influenced the jury on this critical determination <em>(see, United States v Pitts, </em>918 F2d 197, 201, <em>supra). </em>Accordingly, I vote to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith and Ciparick concur with Judge Levine; Judge Titone dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Simons concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
