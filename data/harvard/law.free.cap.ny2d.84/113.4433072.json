During voir dire, three prospective jurors stated in sidebars with the court that they might know the defendant, his family or the location of the crime. Several other venirepersons indicated general bias or personal obstacles that prevented them from offering jury service. Each was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>excused. Although the prosecutor and defense counsel participated in the sidebar discussions, these took place outside defendant\u2019s hearing. Defendant objected to the racial composition of the jury after it was impaneled, but did not offer a timely protest to the conduct of sidebars in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In a memorandum dated December 1, 1992, the Appellate Division reversed the conviction, finding on the basis of <em>People v Antommarchi </em>(80 NY2d 247) \u2014 decided October 27, 1992\u2014 that defendant\u2019s right to be present at the sidebar conferences had been violated. On December 17, 1992, however, we held in <em>People v Mitchell </em>(80 NY2d 519) that the <em>Antommarchi </em>rule was prospective only. The People\u2019s motion for reargument in light of <em>Mitchell </em>was denied, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Defendant contends that his case is distinguishable from <em>Antommarchi </em>because here the voir dire questioning concerned \"specific bias\u201d \u2014 possible familiarity with him or some aspect of his case. In <em>Antommarchi, </em>by contrast, inquiry concerned general bias, such as whether the venireperson had been the victim of a crime. Where questioning concerns specific bias, defendant argues, the right to be present is constitutional in nature under <em>People v Sloan </em>(79 NY2d 386; <em>see, Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d, at 527), and should be given retroactive effect <em>(see, Griffith v Kentucky, </em>479 US 314).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Concluding that the right to be present at voir dire sidebars is statutory \u2014 not constitutional \u2014 in nature, whether inquiry concerns \"specific\u201d or \"general\u201d bias, we reverse the decision of the Appellate Division overturning defendant\u2019s conviction for lack of presence at the sidebars.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Unquestionably, a defendant\u2019s right to be present at material stages of trial stems from the Due Process Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions as well as State statute <em>(People v Rosen, </em>81 NY2d 237, 243; <em>People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 453-457). As a constitutional matter, a defendant has a right to be present pursuant to the Confrontation Clause at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>any stage of trial where witnesses or evidence against him are being presented to the trier of fact <em>(Kentucky v Stincer, </em>482 US 730, 739). Beyond this, a defendant has a due process right to be present if that presence \"might bear a substantial relationship to a defendant\u2019s opportunity better to defend himself at trial\u201d and the stage of the criminal proceeding is \"critical\u201d to its outcome <em>(Kentucky v Stincer, </em>482 US, at 745-746; <em>see also, United States v Gagnon, </em>470 US 522, 526; <em>Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97, 105; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d, at 526-527). Our Court has identified these constitutionally significant stages of trial as \"core\u201d proceedings <em>(Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 455-457, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">CPL 260.20 confers upon a defendant the broader right to be \"personally present\u201d during the trial of an indictment. Trial, as a matter of State law, includes not only \"core\u201d proceedings such as the taking of testimony but also a myriad of \"ancillary\u201d proceedings <em>(see, People v Morales, </em>80 NY2d 450, 453, 456, <em>supra). </em>Because our State statute confers protection beyond the guarantees of the Federal Constitution (80 NY2d 450, 456, <em>supra), </em>we have not found it necessary to identify the root source of the right to be present at ancillary proceedings unless called upon to consider questions of retroactivity. In that circumstance, however, we have consistently characterized the right as statutory <em>(People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d 254, 262; <em>People v Mitchell, </em>80 NY2d 519, <em>supra). </em>In particular, the right to be present at voir dire sidebars \u2014 an ancillary proceeding \u2014 is conferred solely by CPL 260.20 <em>(People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d, at 262, <em>supra; People v Antommarchi, </em>80 NY2d 247, 250, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Sidebar conferences most often relate to one of two subjects: availability to serve, or ability to remain objective in light of a juror\u2019s personal experience. Where sidebar inquiry is directed only to ministerial matters \u2014 such as availability for jury service \u2014 not even the statutory right is triggered. Presence of counsel alone is sufficient to protect a defendant\u2019s interests <em>(People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d 469).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In <em>People v Sloan </em>(79 NY2d 386), by contrast, we explained that where sidebar questions concern a venireperson\u2019s ability to remain objective, through exploration of bias, hostility or predisposition to believe or discredit the testimony of potential witnesses, a defendant\u2019s presence would permit assessment of a juror\u2019s \"facial expressions, demeanor and other subliminal responses.\u201d Distinguishing <em>Velasco, </em>we concluded that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>bias is at issue, a defendant\u2019s presence could have a substantial effect on the ability to defend against the charges (79 NY2d, at 392). Similarly, in <em>Antommarchi, </em>we again acknowledged a right to be present under CPL 260.20 whenever bias is explored, citing <em>Sloan </em>\u2014 without distinguishing between \"general\u201d and \"specific\u201d bias (80 NY2d, at 250).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Although rooted in due process concerns, <em>Velasco </em>and <em>Sloan </em>were not directed to the distinction now urged by defendant between a constitutional and statutory right to be present. Rather, the distinction drawn was between the statutory right <em>(Sloan/Antommarchi) </em>and no right at all <em>(Velasco).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Defendant correctly points out that we have cited <em>Snyder v Massachusetts </em>(291 US 97, 108, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 a case construing the scope of the Federal due process right to be present \u2014 as supporting a due process right to be present at voir dire sidebars <em>(People v Sloan, </em>79 NY2d, at 391-392; <em>People v Velasco, </em>77 NY2d, at 472), but misreads the significance of that citation. Reliance on <em>Snyder </em>in the context of our State statutory right to be present can be traced to <em>People ex rel. Lupo v Fay </em>(13 NY2d 253, 256), where we first borrowed <em>Snyder\u2019s </em>language as the starting point for construing the scope of the statutory right to be present under section 356 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the predecessor to CPL 260.20. Under our own body of State law, we now look to the effect that defendant\u2019s absence might have on the opportunity to defend as measure of whether the statutory right to be present at an ancillary trial proceeding is triggered <em>(Morales, </em>80 NY2d, at 456; <em>see also, People v Aguilera, </em>82 NY2d 23, 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">A defendant\u2019s right to attend ancillary proceedings may be qualified as a Federal constitutional matter because these proceedings are not always critical to the outcome of the criminal proceedings. But under our State statute \u2014 conferring broader protection \u2014 presence is generally required even at these ancillary proceedings so long as the defendant can potentially contribute to the proceeding. Such a stage of the proceeding is material under our State law. An ancillary proceeding may be material for purposes of the statutory right to be present, even though it is not a core proceeding for purposes of the Federal constitutional right to be present <em>(Morales, </em>80 NY2d, at 456-457).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In <em>People v Dokes </em>(79 NY2d 656), for example, we took note of the potential for meaningful participation by the defendant during the determination of the merits of a <em>Sandoval </em>hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>but ultimately determined the right to presence as statutory in nature <em>(People v Favor, </em>82 NY2d 254, 262, <em>supra). </em>Likewise, our emphasis in <em>Sloan </em>on New York\u2019s long recognition of a fundamental right to be present with counsel at all material stages of trial (79 NY2d, at 391), particularly when that opinion is read in conjunction with <em>Velasco </em>and <em>Antommarchi, </em>establishes the doctrinal underpinning of the right to be present at voir dire sidebars as one of State, not Federal, law.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Defendant\u2019s claim thus is determined by <em>Mitchell </em>and cannot be given retroactive effect. We likewise reject defendant\u2019s contention that in <em>People v Velasco </em>(77 NY2d 469, <em>supra) </em>we implicitly recognized a defendant\u2019s right to be present at voir dire as including the right to veto his counsel\u2019s choices in selecting a jury <em>(see, People v Mirenda, </em>57 NY2d 261, 265-266, n).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed and the case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for consideration of the facts (CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Order reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\"> Alternatively, he argues that relief under <em>Antommarchi </em>should be granted retroactively where the defendant protested the manner in which voir dire was conducted. Defendant\u2019s objection to the racial composition of the impaneled jury was, however, insufficient to alert the court to his present contention that he should have been present at sidebar discussions (CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Bonaparte, </em>78 NY2d 26, 31-32; <em>People v Fleming, </em>70 NY2d 947, 948).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
