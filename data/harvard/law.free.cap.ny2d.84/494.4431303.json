Consequently, in recognition of these drivers\u2019 special needs, the Legislature enacted Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104, which qualifiedly exempts them from certain traffic laws when they are \"involved in an emergency operation.\u201d At issue in this appeal are the meaning and effect of the statute\u2019s provisions for civil liability in the event of an accident (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 [e]). Consistent with its language and purpose, we hold that Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 (e) precludes the imposition of liability for otherwise privileged conduct except where the conduct rises to the level of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The accident underlying this action occurred on a public road in the Village of Massena on March 4, 1988. According to plaintiff\u2019s submissions, Officer McGown, a seven-year veteran of the Village police force, was sitting in his patrol car at about 10:00 p.m. when he observed a dark colored van that fish-tailed and squealed its tires as it made a turn onto a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Village street. Having decided almost immediately to stop the vehicle, McGown followed it and watched its driver, subsequently identified as defendant Kerr, run a stop sign at a speed of approximately 30 m.p.h. and then proceed into a nearby shopping center parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">At that point, McGown activated his patrol car\u2019s red emergency lights. Rather than stopping, the van pulled away. McGown pursued the van behind the shopping center\u2019s stores and turned on his vehicle\u2019s siren. The van continued out onto a public road and drove into the lane for oncoming traffic, passing a red traffic light at the intersection. Concluding that the van was not going to stop in response to his show of authority, McGown reached for his radio with the intention of calling headquarters for help. His efforts were interrupted by the sound of a crash as Kerr\u2019s van collided with a vehicle driven by plaintiff. Subsequent tests revealed that Kerr had been drinking on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Plaintiff, who was seriously injured as a result of the accident, brought the present action against Kerr and the Village of Massena. With respect to her claim against the Village, plaintiff contended that it should be held vicariously liable for McGown\u2019s lack of due care in pursuing Kerr\u2019s vehicle and liable for its own negligence in failing adequately to train McGown or to adopt an adequate pursuit policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Following discovery, the Village moved for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint and defendant Kerr\u2019s cross claims against it. In opposition to the motion, plaintiff and defendant Kerr relied principally on the evidence gleaned from McGown\u2019s deposition and testimony at Kerr\u2019s criminal trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to McGown\u2019s testimony, he had been driving at a rate of approximately 60 m.p.h. by the time the chase terminated in the accident. The posted speed limit in the area was 35 m.p.h. The night was clear, but the roads were wet. McGown observed no traffic on the road until he approached the intersection at which the accident took place. However, there were several fast food restaurants and a V.F.W. meeting hall in the vicinity, and all but one of the restaurants were open. The entire pursuit lasted no more than one or two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, Supreme Court granted the Village\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>cross claims against it. The court concluded that \"recklessness\u201d was the proper standard for assessing the officer\u2019s conduct and that plaintiff and defendant Kerr had \"failed to raise any inference of reckless disregard for the safety of others by Officer McGown.\u201d The court also noted that plaintiff had failed to show how any of the alleged inadequacies in the Village\u2019s training of officers was proximately related to this accident. Indeed, the court held, there was no proof that it was McGown\u2019s conduct in pursuing Kerr rather than Kerr\u2019s own erratic and illegal driving that was the proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and reinstated the complaint and cross claims against the Village. The Court stressed the fact that the pursued Kerr vehicle had been traveling toward a \"highly populated area\u201d at the time of the accident (199 AD2d 724, 725). Further, the Court noted, there was a possibility at that relatively early evening hour that there would be traffic on the road. Finally, the Appellate Division cited an affidavit by plaintiff\u2019s expert, which stated, in substance, that the Village\u2019s policies regarding police pursuits were inadequate and that allowing officers to engage in vehicular pursuit without proper training is \"inherently dangerous and unsafe.\u201d Accordingly, the Court held, over a dissent by two Justices, there was sufficient evidence to raise questions of fact as to whether McGown had acted with \"reckless disregard for the safety of others\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 725) and whether the Village\u2019s pursuit policy and training methods were adequate. The Court then granted the Village leave to appeal to this Court, certifying the following question of law for our resolution: \"Did this court err as a matter of law in reversing the order of Supreme Court granting defendant Village of Massena\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and cross claims against it and denying said motion?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">With respect to the Village\u2019s vicarious liability for Officer McGown\u2019s conduct, the initial critical question is what standard should be applied in evaluating the culpability of that conduct. The touchstone for our analysis is Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104, which permits the driver of an \"authorized emergency vehicle\u201d <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 101, 114-b) to proceed past red traffic lights and stops signs, exceed the speed limit and disregard regulations regarding the direction of traffic, as long as certain safety precautions are observed (Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 [b] [l]-[4]). The privileges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>afforded by the statute are circumscribed by section 1104 (e), which provides that \"[t]he foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver from the consequences of his reckless disregard for the safety of others.\u201d This statute establishes the standard for determining an officer\u2019s civil liability for damages resulting from the privileged operation of an emergency vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Because the statute makes reference to both \"due regard\u201d and \"reckless disregard\u201d for the safety of others, the courts of this State have had some difficulty articulating the precise test for determining a driver\u2019s liability for injuries resulting from the operation of an emergency vehicle. In recent years, the Third Department has adhered to the more exacting standard of \"recklessness\u201d <em>(Dugan v Longo, </em>169 AD2d 872; <em>Kerwin v County of Broome, </em>134 AD2d 812, <em>lv denied </em>71 NY2d 802; <em>Mitchell v State of New York, </em>108 AD2d 1033, <em>appeal dismissed </em>64 NY2d 1128, <em>lv denied </em>64 NY2d 611; <em>Selkowitz v State of New York, </em>55 AD2d 709; <em>Dunn v State of New York, </em>34 AD2d 267; <em>see also, Palella v State of New York, </em>141 AD2d 999; <em>Stanton v State of New York, </em>29 AD2d 612, <em>affd </em>26 NY2d 990). The courts, however, have from time to time also used such terms as \"unreasonable under the circumstances\u201d <em>(Simmen v State of New York, </em>55 NY2d 924, 926; <em>Rightmyer v State of New York, </em>108 AD2d 1047; <em>Zulauf v State of New York, </em>119 Misc 2d 135, <em>affd </em>110 AD2d 1042; <em>see also, Strobel v State of New York, </em>36 AD2d 485, <em>affd </em>30 NY2d 629; <em>cf., Mercado v Vega, </em>161 AD2d 365, 366, <em>revd on other grounds </em>77 NY2d 918 [want of \"due care\u201d]) and \"negligent\u201d <em>(Stanton v State of New York, </em>26 NY2d 990, 992, <em>supra; Thain v City of New York, </em>35 AD2d 545, <em>affd </em>30 NY2d 524; <em>Murphy v City of New York, </em>16 AD2d 678; <em>Wrubel v State of New York, </em>11 Misc 2d 878; <em>see also, Myers v Town of Harrison, </em>438 F2d 293, <em>cert denied </em>404 US 828), either alone or interchangeably with \"recklessness,\u201d to describe the level of culpability that will support liability under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 (e). Likewise, courts of other jurisdictions have struggled with the meaning and effect of identically or similarly worded statutes <em>(e.g., Ruth v Rhodes, </em>66 Ariz 129, 185 P2d 304; <em>Lucas v Los Angeles, </em>10 Cal 2d 476, 75 P2d 599; <em>Sacramento v Hunger, </em>79 Cal App 234, 249 P 223; <em>Archer v Johnson, </em>90 Ga App 418, 83 SE2d 314; <em>Martin v Rossignol, </em>226 Md 363, 174 A2d 149; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Goddard, v Williams, </em>251 NC 128, 110 SE2d 820; <em>see also, Duran v Mission Mortuary, </em>174 Kan 565, 258 P2d 241).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Faced squarely with this question of statutory interpretation for the first time,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we hold that a police officer's conduct in pursuing a suspected lawbreaker may not form the basis of civil liability to an injured bystander unless the officer acted in reckless disregard for the safety of others. This standard demands more than a showing of a lack of \"due care under the circumstances\u201d \u2014 the showing typically associated with ordinary negligence claims. It requires evidence that \"the actor has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable character in disregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow\u201d and has done so with conscious indifference to the outcome (Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 34, at 213 [5th ed]; <em>see, </em>Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 500).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The use of this higher standard is compelled by the plain language of Vehicle and Trafile Law \u00a7 1104 (e). Indeed, the Legislature\u2019s specific reference to \"the consequences of [the driver\u2019s] <em>reckless disregard </em>for the safety of others\u201d (emphasis supplied) would be unnecessary and, in fact, inexplicable if the conventional criterion for negligence \u2014 reasonable care under the circumstances \u2014 were the intended standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Notably, the common law has long recognized that an emergency situation which leaves little or no time for reflection \"itself may be a significant circumstance which * * * should enter into the determination of the reasonableness of the choice of action pursued\u201d <em>(Ferrer v Harris, </em>55 NY2d 285, 292). Thus, Vehicle and Trafile Law \u00a7 1104 (e)\u2019s mention of \"the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons\u201d would have sufficed if the more \"flexible\u201d reasonable person standard for conduct in the face of an emergency were all that was contemplated <em>(see, id., </em>at 292). The fact that the Legislature went beyond that formulation and invoked the \"reckless disregard\u201d terminology demonstrates beyond question that something more exacting than that traditional inquiry was intended. Accordingly, the only way to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>statute is to read its general admonition to exercise \"due care\u201d in light of its more specific reference to \"recklessness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Such an approach also comports with the purposes of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104. The statute represents a recognition that the duties of police officers and other emergency-personnel often bring them into conflict with the rules and laws that are intended to regulate citizens\u2019 daily conduct and that, consequently, they should be afforded a qualified privilege to disregard those laws where necessary to carry out their important responsibilities. Where the laws in question involve the regulation of vehicular traffic, the exercise of this privilege will inevitably increase the risk of harm to innocent motorists and pedestrians. Indeed, emergency personnel must routinely make conscious choices that will necessarily escalate the over-all risk to the public at large in the service of an immediate, specific law enforcement or public safety goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Measuring the \"reasonableness\u201d of these choices against the yardstick of the traditional \"due care under the circumstances\u201d standard would undermine the evident legislative purpose of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104, i.e., affording operators of emergency vehicles the freedom to perform their duties unhampered by the normal rules of the road. As a practical matter, use of the undemanding ordinary negligence test \u2014 or even the more \"flexible\u201d common-law negligence test that is applied in emergency situations <em>(see, e.g., Ferrer v Harris, supra; Rossman v La Grega, </em>28 NY2d 300) \u2014 would lead to judicial \"second-guessing\u201d of the many split-second decisions that are made in the field under highly pressured conditions. Further, the possibility of incurring civil liability for what amounts to a mere failure of judgment could deter emergency personnel from acting decisively and taking calculated risks in order to save life or property or to apprehend miscreants. The \"reckless disregard\u201d test, which requires a showing of more than a momentary judgment lapse, is better suited to the legislative goal of encouraging emergency personnel to act swiftly and resolutely while at the same time protecting the public\u2019s safety to the extent practicable <em>(see generally, Campbell v City of Elmira, </em>84 NY2d 505 [decided today]).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Cases such as this involving vehicular pursuits of lawbreakers demonstrate the soundness of utilizing the \"reckless disregard\u201d standard. Having observed erratic and dangerous driving on the part of defendant Kerr, Officer McGown was duty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>bound to investigate, using all reasonable means, including pursuit, to stop the lawless vehicle\u2019s forward progress. Contrary to the Appellate Division\u2019s suggestion, the conduct McGown observed was far more serious than a series of minor traffic infractions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kerr\u2019s actions, which included fish-tailing, squealing of brakes and disregard of traffic signs and signals, plainly suggested that the van\u2019s driver was out of control or perhaps even intoxicated. Even if Kerr was not impaired, it is clear that his driving posed a threat to the public safety. Under these circumstances, the officer should have the right to use whatever means are necessary, short of the proscribed recklessness, to overtake and stop the offending driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Measured against the prescribed standard of \"reckless disregard for the safety of others,\u201d it is evident that, as a matter of law, Officer McGown\u2019s pursuit of Kerr did not overstep the limits of the statutory qualified privilege. It is true that McGown exceeded the posted speed limit, but that conduct certainly cannot alone constitute a predicate for liability, since it is expressly privileged under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 (b) (3). The other circumstances on which plaintiff and defendant Kerr rely \u2014 the wet condition of the road, the possibility of other vehicular traffic in the vicinity, the over-all speed of McGown\u2019s vehicle and McGown\u2019s purported delay in calling his headquarters \u2014 are similarly unpersuasive, particularly in the context of an inquiry based on the \"reckless disregard\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Officer McGown\u2019s maximum speed of 60 m.p.h. was hardly a \"breakneck\u201d pace for a police pursuit on relatively empty, nonresidential streets <em>(cf., Mercado v Vega, supra). </em>The wet condition of the roads and the possibility of vehicular traffic in the vicinity undoubtedly augmented the risk involved in the course of conduct McGown undertook, but the risk was one that McGown was entitled to take in the interest of stopping a motorist whose conduct on the road presented a clear and immediate threat to public safety. Finally, McGown\u2019s failure to call in to his headquarters until after the chase was underway is hardly surprising in view of the rapidly unfolding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>flow of events and the extremely short time frame in which the entire incident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The allegations in the complaint and cross claims with respect to the Village\u2019s liability for its own purported misconduct are equally flawed. Plaintiff and codefendant Kerr alleged that the Village\u2019s procedures for training its officers in the art of pursuit were inadequate, but neither was able to show how any changes in the Village\u2019s training program might have altered the course of events in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s and Kerr\u2019s alternative argument is that the Village\u2019s policy on pursuit gave its officers too much latitude. This argument is based on plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s affidavit, which cites various articles and studies and indicates that pursuit policies based primarily on the field officer\u2019s discretion are disfavored among law enforcement professionals. However, the Village\u2019s choice to adopt a \"discretionary\u201d rather than a more \"restrictive\u201d or \"discouraging\u201d model to govern its police pursuits is a matter of governmental policy that \"may not be reviewed in a personal injury action founded on negligence,\u201d at least in the absence of irrationality <em>(McCormack v City of New York, </em>80 NY2d 808, 811; <em>see, Haddock v City of New York, </em>75 NY2d 478, 484; <em>Mon v City of New York, 78 </em>NY2d 309, 313; <em>Tango v Tulevech, </em>61 NY2d 34). Thus, all of plaintiff\u2019s and Kerr\u2019s claims against defendant Village should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, defendant Village of Massena\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and cross claims against it granted, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Bellacosa, Smith, Levine and Ciparick concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\">. Neither plaintiff nor Kerr had any independent recollection of the events leading up to the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. In neither <em>Stanton v State of New York </em>(26 NY2d 990, <em>supra) </em>nor <em>Simmen v State of New York </em>(55 NY2d 924, <em>supra) </em>was the Court called upon to define the precise contours of the duty of care established in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1104 (e), since in both cases we concluded as a matter of law that the plaintiffs proof failed under even the less demanding \"negligence\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">. The characterization of the conduct McGown had observed is significant because the Village\u2019s own policy specifically provides that \"[a] traffic infraction alone does not justify the risks of a high-speed pursuit.\u201d A violation of this policy, if in fact it occurred, would be an important, although not dispositive, factor in determining whether McGown had acted recklessly <em>(cf., Patella v State of New York, </em>141 AD2d 999,1000, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
