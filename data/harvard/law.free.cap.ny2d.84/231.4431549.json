Schulz, </em>Glens Falls, and others, appellants <em>pro se. </em>I.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHU\"><em>Newell v People </em>is dispositive with regard to NY Constitution, article VII, \u00a7 11. <em>(Rodman v Munson, </em>13 Barb 63, 188, <em>affd sub nom. Newell v People, </em>7 NY 9; <em>Williamsburgh Sav. Bank v State of New York, </em>243 NY 231.) II. <em>Wein v City of New York </em>(36 NY2d 610) is not dispositive, neither is it on point. <em>(Flushing Natl. Bank v Municipal Assistance Corp., </em>40 NY2d 731; <em>McCabe v Gross, </em>274 NY 39.) III. This case is an absolute precedent with regard to the issuance of debt by a public corporation on behalf of the State, <em>and </em>where the State provides desirable credit to insure payment of debt service. IV. The Legislature has no power to interpret the Constitution: the Act\u2019s disclaimers as to debt and obligation are nullities as is the Legislature\u2019s declaration that the Act creates no moral obligation on part of the State. <em>(Defiance Milk Prods. v Du Mond, </em>309 NY 537; <em>Wiggins v Town of Somers, </em>4 NY2d 215; <em>Matter of Van Berkel v Power, </em>16 NY2d 37; <em>Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41; <em>Wein v Beame, </em>43 NY2d 326; <em>Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources, </em>46 NY2d 358; <em>Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>1 Cranch [5 US] 137; <em>People v Allen, </em>301 NY 287; <em>Newell v People, </em>7 NY 9.) V. The fundamental principle behind the debt referendum clause is the prevention of legislative burdening of future taxpayers through borrowings: the transactions authorized by the Act violate this principle. <em>(Settle v Van Evrea, </em>49 NY 280; <em>Matter of King v Cuomo, </em>81 NY2d 247; <em>Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336; <em>Smith v City of Newburgh, </em>77 NY 130; <em>Marine Midland Trust Co. v Village of Waverly, </em>42 Misc 2d 704, 21 AD2d 753; <em>Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248; <em>Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>People ex rel. Metropolitan St. Ry. Co. v State Bd. of Tax Commrs., </em>174 NY 417; <em>McCabe v Gross, </em>274 NY 39.) VI. The words of the debt referendum clause require its application to debts contracted by persons other than the State if they are in behalf of the State; bonds will be issuable under the Act in behalf of the State within the meaning of the clause. <em>(People v Carroll, </em>3 NY2d 686; <em>Matter of Clonan, </em>176 Misc 557.) VII. The adoptive and readoptive intent behind the debt referendum clause demonstrates its intended application to appropriation risk debt; the State agreements authorized by the Act involve the contracting of debt by the State within the meaning of the clause. <em>(State Div. of Human Rights v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>90 AD2d 51; <em>Monaco v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Mississippi, </em>292 US 313; <em>Newell v People, </em>7 NY 9; <em>People ex rel.

VIII. The Constitution <em>directs </em>the Comptroller to make principal and interest payments on debt created \"on behalf of\u2019 the State if the Legislature fails to make appropriations for same. IX. Defendants understate the need of the State to appropriate the necessary funds. <em>(Matter of Congdon v Washington County, </em>130 AD2d 27, 70 NY2d 610.) X. The Thruway Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are the State; their obligations are State debt. <em>(Sgaglione v Levitt, </em>37 NY2d 507.) XI. The Act is expressly forbidden; the Legislature acted in defiance of constitutional restraints. XII. The Act and the bonds issued pursuant thereto are patently unconstitutional. <em>(Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources, </em>46 NY2d 358.) XIII. Defendants reliance on the special Fund doctrine is contrived and misplaced. XIV. Plaintiffs have standing to maintain all claims. <em>(Wein v Comptroller of State of N. Y. </em>46 NY2d 394; <em>Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336.) XV. This case involves a matter of State expenditures. XVI. Plaintiffs are not guilty of loches with respect to the third claim. XVII. Debt incurred under the Act would be void, invalid and unenforceable between the parties. <em>(People v Westchester County Natl. Bank, </em>231 NY 465; <em>Wilkes County v Coler, </em>190 US 107; <em>County of Bates v Winters, </em>97 US 83; <em>School Dist. v Insurance Co., </em>103 US 707; <em>Brenham v German Am. Bank, </em>144 US 173; <em>Northern Bank v Porter Twp., </em>110 US 608; <em>Barnett v Denison, </em>145 US 135; <em>Nesbit v Riverside Ind. Dist., </em>144 US 610; <em>Brownell v Town of Greenwich, </em>114 NY 518.) XVIII. Constitutional debt-limiting and credit protection provisions need not specify all forms of debt. XIX. Both case law and generally accepted accounting principles require that the leases be treated as long-term debt. <em>(Matter of Drobner v Chapman, </em>275 App Div 520; <em>Smith v City of Newburgh, </em>77 NY 130; <em>Marine Midland Trust Co. v Village of Waverly, </em>42 Misc 2d 704.) XX. The State\u2019s own annual financial report identifies similar State leases as debt. XXI. The court should consider generally accepted accounting principles in reaching a decision. XXII. NY Constitution, article VII, \u00a7 11 is not limited to general obligation debt. XXIII. The Thruway Authority\u2019s argument is specious and unavailing. XXIV. All State debt is \"appropriation-risk\u201d debt. XXV. This Court should look to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ward other States which have been more active in this area of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-4\"><em>G.

Walsh </em>of counsel), for State of New York and others, respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQU\">I. Plaintiffs appeal should be dismissed on the ground that there is no substantial constitutional question directly involved. <em>(Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Board of Educ. v Wieder, </em>72 NY2d 174; <em>Town of Hardenburgh v State of New York, </em>52 NY2d 536; <em>Matter of Haydorn v Carroll, </em>225 NY 84.) II. The gift of funds to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is in all respects lawful. <em>(Wein v State of New York, </em>39 NY2d 136; <em>Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248.) III. The courts below correctly held that chapter 56 of the Laws of 1993 does not create a debt of the State in violation of article VII, \u00a7 11, provide for a gift or loan of the State\u2019s credit in violation of article VII, \u00a78 or assume the liability of a public corporation in violation of article X, \u00a7 5 of the State Constitution. <em>(Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Matter of Van Berkel v Power, </em>16 NY2d 37; <em>Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources, </em>46 NY2d 358; <em>Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248; <em>Schulz v State of New York, </em>151 Misc 2d 594, 185 AD2d 596, 81 NY2d 336; <em>Wein v State of New York, </em>39 NY2d 136; <em>City of Rye v Metropolitan Transp.

Assn. v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>5 NY2d 420; <em>Newell v People, </em>7 NY 9.) IV. The lower court correctly held that plaintiffs lack standing to raise any claims which do not concern the issuance of bonds which plaintiffs contend should be submitted to a referendum. <em>(New York State Coalition for Criminal Justice v Coughlin, </em>64 NY2d 660; <em>Wein v Comptroller of State of N. Y., </em>46 NY2d 394; <em>Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336; <em>Society of Plastics Indus, v County of Suffolk, </em>77 NY2d 761; <em>Matter of Mobil Oil Corp. v Syracuse Indus. Dev. Agency, </em>76 NY2d 428; <em>Matter of Messina v Sobol, </em>159 AD2d 916.) V. There is no merit to plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the Job Development Authority bond guarantee assistance program and the Urban Development Corporation loan capital assistance and loan programs. <em>(Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Wein v State of New York, </em>39 NY2d 136.) VI. The courts below correctly ruled that the third cause of action is barred by the doctrine of loches. <em>(Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>Helene Fromm, </em>New York City, <em>Michael A. Vaccari </em>and <em>Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon (Douglas M. Parker, Arthur F. McMahon, Jr., </em>and <em>James Whelan </em>of counsel), for Metropolitan Transportation Authority, respondent. I. Chapter 56 of the Laws of 1993 is constitutional; it does not create State debt. <em>(Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources, </em>46 NY2d 358; <em>Matter of Van Berkel v Power, </em>16 NY2d 37; <em>Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248.) II. Chapter 56 provides State assistance. III. <em>Wein v City of New York </em>(36 NY2d 610) cannot be distinguished. <em>(Newell v People, </em>7 NY 9; <em>Matter of Plumbing, Heating, Piping &amp; Air Conditioning Contrs. Assn. v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>5 NY2d 420; <em>McCabe v Gross, </em>274 NY 39.) IV. The constitutionality of chapter 56 is further supported by <em>Wein v City of New York\u2019s </em>progeny. <em>(Wein v State of New York, </em>39 NY2d 136; <em>Wein v Levitt, </em>42 NY2d 300; <em>New York State Coalition for Criminal Justice v Coughlin, </em>103 AD2d 40, 64 NY2d 660; <em>Burns v Egan, </em>117 AD2d 38; <em>Matter of Congdon v Washington County, </em>130 AD2d 27, 70 NY2d 610; <em>Schulz v State of New York, </em>151 Misc 2d 594, 185 AD2d 596, 81 NY2d 336.) V. Chapter 56 is grounded in the principles of the 1938 Constitutional Convention. VI. A proper regard for judicial precedent in New York and other jurisdictions requires that chapter 56 be held constitutional. <em>(People v Wesley, </em>73 NY2d 351; <em>Grace Plaza of Great Neck v Elbaum, </em>82 NY2d 10; <em>People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479.) VII. The proposed constitutional amendment makes judicial action inappropriate. VIII. The court below\u2019s decision rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 due process and standing arguments was correct in all respects. <em>(Wein v City of New York, </em>36 NY2d 610; <em>Quirk v Municipal Assistance Corp., </em>41 NY2d 644; <em>Wein v Comptroller of State of N. Y, </em>46 NY2d 394; <em>New York State Coalition for Criminal Justice v Coughlin, </em>64 NY2d 660.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-5\"><em>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, </em>New York City <em>(Arthur L.

Appellants lack standing to challenge chapter 56 other than under article VII, \u00a7 11 of the NY Constitution. <em>(Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336; <em>Wein v Comptroller of State of N. Y, </em>46 NY2d 394.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b305-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b305-6\">Chief Judge Kaye.</author>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">This challenge to a 1993 statute authorizing a multibillion dollar bond issue for State and local transportation improvements continues a debate on financing public works projects that has engaged our State throughout its history. The instant litigation attacks the statute both as imprudent fiscal policy and as violative of debt-limiting provisions of the State Constitution. The wisdom of legislation, of course, is not a matter for the courts. As to legality, we conclude \u2014 as did both the trial court and Appellate Division \u2014 that the statute before us does not violate the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">On April 15, 1993 Governor Mario Cuomo signed into law, as chapter 56 of the Laws of 1993 (the Act), a four-year, $20 billion financing plan for the State\u2019s transportation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The plan provides $10.47 billion for the Dedicated Highway and Bridge Trust Fund (Highway Fund) operated by the State Thruway Authority, and $9.56 billion for the Dedicated Mass Transportation Trust Fund (Mass Transportation Fund), operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both Funds, created in 1991, would under the 1993 statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>receive revenues \u2014 subject to annual appropriation by the Legislature \u2014 from taxes and fees derived from use of the Authorities\u2019 facilities: vehicle registration fees, the motor fuel tax, the petroleum and aviation fuel business tax, and miscellaneous highway use taxes (State Finance Law \u00a7 89-b [3]; \u00a7 89-c; Tax Law \u00a7\u00a7 289-e, 515; Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 401; L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 31, 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The Thruway Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Act authorizes the Thruway Authority to issue up to $4 billion in 30-year bonds for highway and bridge construction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Part of the Highway Fund, therefore, is a special reserve to be used by the Authority for debt service and administrative expenses on its bonds. The bond proceeds, in turn, finance improvements for highways, bridges, railways and aviation facilities. Some of the bonds are to be secured by service contracts and sale-and-leaseback agreements between the Authority and the State (L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The Act sets forth several provisos relating to Thruway Authority bonds. Any bonds issued pursuant to authorizations contained in the Act do not constitute a debt of the State. In the words of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\"The notes, bonds or other obligations of the authority authorized by this section shall not be a debt of the state and the state shall not be liable thereon, nor shall they be payable out of any funds other than those of the authority pledged therefor; and such bonds and notes shall contain on the face thereof a statement to such effect\u201d (L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7 34, adding Public Authorities Law \u00a7385 [1] [d]; <em>see also, </em>L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7\u00a716, 33; Public Authorities Law \u00a7 386 [4]; \u00a7 1269 [8]; Highway Law \u00a7 10-e [5]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Moreover, the statute in the same section declares that the State has \"no continuing legal or moral obligation to appropriate money for payments due\u201d under any agreements entered into to effect the implementation of the goals of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Restrictions on State liability must be included in any cooperative agreements flowing from the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\"Each dedicated highway and bridge trust fund cooperative agreement or agreements pursuant to this section shall contain a clause that such agreement or agreements of the state thereunder are not a debt of the state and that such agreement or agreements shall be deemed executory only to the extent of the monies available to the state and no liability on account thereof shall be incurred by the state beyond the monies available for the purpose thereof\u2019 (L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7 33, adding Highway Law \u00a7 10-e [5]; <em>see also, </em>L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 19, 34; Public Authorities Law \u00a7 385 [1] [dj; \u00a7 386 [2]; L 1991, ch 329, \u00a7 11 [d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Further, Thruway Authority bonds issued pursuant to the Act are payable only by legislative appropriations from the Highway Fund and no other source:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\"Such obligations * * * shall be special obligations of the authority secured by and payable solely out of amounts appropriated by the legislature as authorized pursuant to section eight-nine-b of the state finance law without recourse against any other assets, revenues or funds of or other payments due to the authority\u201d (Public Authorities Law \u00a7 385 [1] [c], added by L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7 34; <em>see also, </em>Public Authorities Law \u00a7 385 [1] [d]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Finally, the Act specifies that the State may assume the obligations of the Authority or substitute State security for the obligations of the Authority only upon constitutional amendment (L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7 34, adding Public Authorities Law \u00a7 385 [10]).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">The MTA</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">With regard to the MTA, the Act sets up a $9.56 billion capital funding program for the five-year period ending December 31, 1996. The existing \u2014 but not previously funded\u2014 Mass Transportation Trust Fund and the Metropolitan Mass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Transportation Operating Assistance Fund would receive appropriations from user-derived taxes and fees and, in turn, would pay into a newly created MTA Dedicated Tax Fund (L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7 7, adding Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1270-c). Appropriated under the Aid to Localities law as financial assistance for the operations and programs of the MTA, those expenditures are not subject to any restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Act does not require the MTA to issue bonds, but if it chooses to do so, it may use the Tax Fund for security and debt service. Any bonds issued by the MTA are subject to the same statutory provisos on State liability as the Thruway Authority bonds. Tax Fund money not used in connection with issuance of bonds can be applied to operating and capital costs of MTA subsidiaries (L 1993, ch 56, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 10; Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1269 [12]; \u00a7 1270-c; State Finance Law \u00a7 89-c).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Asserting voter standing, plaintiffs commenced this action on May 24, 1993, alleging that the Act misuses public authorities to circumvent constitutional limitations on contracting debt, including the prohibitions against contracting State debt without a public referendum (NY Const, art VII, \u00a7 11), the lending of credit to public corporations (NY Const, art VII, \u00a7 8), and assumption of liability of debt obligation of public corporations (NY Const, art X, \u00a7 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">On cross motions for summary judgment, Supreme Court concluded that under <em>Matter of Schulz v State of New York </em>(81 NY2d 336), plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the legislation as violative of any constitutional provision other than article VII, \u00a7 11 and, on the strength of <em>Wein v City of New York </em>(36 NY2d 610 <em>[Wein I]), </em>upheld the statute as constitutional. The Appellate Division affirmed those conclusions, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Because plaintiffs assert voter standing, Supreme Court correctly held that the only cognizable challenge to the Act is under article VII, \u00a7 11, the constitutional mandate that State contracts for debt be submitted for public referendum. Plaintiffs contend first that debt contracted by the public authorities is indistinguishable from debt contracted by the State and thus within the referendum requirement. Alternatively, they argue that the Act \u2014 by pledging appropriation of public revenues \u2014 compromises the legal independence of the public au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>thorities involved, subjecting them to the debt-limiting provisions imposed on the State. They urge moreover, that as a practical matter the Legislature always will appropriate money for the Funds rather than risk damaging the State\u2019s credit rating. The effect of long-term appropriation-risk bonds, they say, is to \"contract debt\u201d within the meaning of article VII, \u00a7 11, and the failure to submit the proposed law to a public referendum renders the enactment unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Before proceeding to an examination of each claim, we note that plaintiffs\u2019 burden is a heavy one. It is true that when the main purpose of a statute is to effect \" 'indirectly that which cannot be done directly, the act is to that extent void, because it violates the spirit of the fundamental law\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wein v State of New York, </em>39 NY2d 136, 145 <em>[Wein II], </em>quoting <em>People ex rel. Burby v Howland, </em>155 NY 270, 280). It is also true, however, that enactments of the Legislature \u2014 a coequal branch of government \u2014 enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality. In particular, we give deference to public funding programs essential to addressing the problems of modern life, unless such programs are \"patently illegal\u201d <em>(see, Hotel Dorset Co. v Trust for Cultural Resources, </em>46 NY2d 358, 369-370, quoting <em>Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248, 254).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of proving unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In considering plaintiffs\u2019 first contention \u2014 that the debt of the Authorities is debt of the State \u2014 we begin analysis with a history of the referendum requirement and the origin of public authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The State Constitution of 1777, our first, provided that the legislative power of this State is to be vested in the Senate and Assembly (art II). The unlimited grant of legislative authority \u2014 when exercised in the arena of borrowing and spending \u2014 led to abuses and prompted a movement for reform of State borrowing practices <em>(see, Matter of Schulz v State of New York, </em>81 NY2d 336, 346; <em>People v Westchester County Natl. Bank, </em>231 NY 465, 471-473). Of particular concern, and the impetus for change, was the lending of public credit to private, \"irresponsible\u201d corporations. Following the onset of economic depression in 1837, private railroad corporations defaulted on obligations that had been assumed on the strength of liberally granted State credit. The State assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the liabilities, with no hope of reimbursement, and by 1845 more than three fifths of the entire State debt was the result of such loans. Public works were suspended in response to the debt crisis <em>(see, Wein II, </em>39 NY2d, at 142-143, <em>supra; </em>2 Lincoln, Constitutional History of New York, at 87, 100 [1906]).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The precursor to the referendum requirement of article VII, \u00a7 11, proposed in 1841 by Assembly Member Arphaxed Loomis of Herkimer County, was adopted under the Constitution of 1846 (former art VII, \u00a7 12) as part of a sweeping reform of public borrowing practices, in an effort to protect the State from the uncertain and possibly disastrous consequences of incurring future liabilities \u2014 \"liabilities easy for a current generation to project but a burden on future generations\u201d <em>(Wein II, </em>39 NY2d, at 144, <em>supra). </em>Known as \"the people\u2019s resolution,\u201d the amendment reserved to voters the power to determine, by referendum, whether a proposed law creating debt would take effect (2 Lincoln, <em>op. cit, </em>at 73-83). In its present form, the Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\"Except the debts specified in sections 9 and 10 of this article, no debt shall be hereafter contracted by or in behalf of the state, unless such debt shall be authorized by law, for some single work or purpose, to be distinctly specified therein. No such law shall take effect until it shall, at a general election, have been submitted to the people, and have received a majority of all the votes cast for it and against it at such election nor shall it be submitted to be voted on within three months after its passage nor at any general election when any other law or any bill shall be submitted to be voted for or against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\"The legislature may, at any time after the approval of such law by the people, if no debt shall have been contracted in pursuance thereof, repeal the same; and may at any time, by law, forbid the contracting of any further debt or liability under such law\u201d (art VII, \u00a7 11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Long-term State obligations are the concern of article VII, \u00a711 <em>(Wein v Levitt, </em>42 NY2d 300, 304 <em>[Wein III]). </em>By article VII, \u00a79, the State may validly contract short-term debt in authentic anticipation of the receipt of taxes and revenues, for the purposes and within the amounts of appropriations previously made, if repaid within one year (NY Const, art VII, \u00a7 9; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Wein II, </em>39 NY2d, at 146, <em>supra). </em>State debt that extends beyond one year, therefore, is subject to the referendum requirement of article VII, \u00a7 11. Simultaneously, a provision was adopted forbidding gifts or loans of State credit to \"any individual, association, or corporation\u201d (NY Const of 1846, art VII, \u00a7 9).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The referendum requirement is not simply a limit on discretion. In <em>People ex rel. Hopkins v Board of Supervisors </em>(52 NY 556), we observed that it was legally impossible for the Legislature to contract debt in the absence of approval by the people through referendum: such approval is a condition precedent to the creation of debt. Any purported long-term debt created in the absence of a public referendum is simply not legally binding on the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Following adoption of the referendum requirement, the Legislature sought ways to provide long-term funding for public works projects that would not require public referendum. In 1851, without public referendum, the Legislature authorized issuance of canal certificates, to be paid from canal revenues, which by their terms were not to be deemed to create a debt against the State. While we struck down the statute because it failed to comply with a constitutional mandate as to application of canal revenues <em>(see, Newell v People, </em>7 NY 9, 92), we noted in passing that even though purchasers of the canal certificates may have no legal remedy against the State if canal revenues proved insufficient to pay the certificates, the State would no doubt make good on them by reason of moral obligation. Moreover, canal revenues paid out to certificate holders represented money that would be diverted from public coffers. The declaration that the certificates were not to be deemed debt was therefore \"an evasion, if not a direct violation, of the constitution\u201d <em>(Newell, </em>7 NY, at 93, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The Legislature then passed a series of town bonding acts that authorized \u2014 and later compelled \u2014 cities to borrow money to invest in railroad company stock. The question whether the State could authorize one of its instrumentalities to undertake commitments the Constitution prohibited the State itself from undertaking reached this Court in <em>Bank of Rome v Village of Rome </em>(18 NY 38). We upheld the scheme, leading to ratifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>tian of constitutional restrictions on municipal debt in 1874, 1884 and 1894.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Shortly after the turn of the century, the Legislature devised a new vehicle for funding public works projects that appeared to insulate the State from the burden of long-term debt: legislative creation of legally separate public benefit corporations, known as public authorities, to discharge particular functions. The first such entity was the Port of New York Authority, created in 1921 <em>(see, Collins v Manhattan &amp; Bronx Surface Tr. Operating Auth., </em>62 NY2d 361, 367). In theory, a public authority would be self-supporting, able to meet debt obligations through revenues obtained from its own valuable assets, such as fares and user fees. Such public benefit corporations would separate their administrative and fiscal functions from those of the State (1929 Opns Atty Gen 223, 224), to \" 'protect the State from liability and enable public projects to be carried on free from restrictions otherwise applicable\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Plumbing, Heating, Piping &amp; Air Conditioning Contrs. Assn. v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>5 NY2d 420, 423, citing 1951 Opns Atty Gen 130, 132).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We rejected an early challenge to the effectiveness of language disclaiming the State\u2019s liability for public authority debts, where bonds were secured solely by the revenues of the issuing authority <em>(see, Robertson v Zimmermann, </em>268 NY 52, 62). Although public authority debt was not legally binding on the State, we nevertheless recognized in <em>Williamsburgh Sav. Bank v State of New York </em>(243 NY 231) that the State might choose to honor a liability as a moral obligation. We stated, however, that whether to recognize a moral obligation is within the discretion of the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\"[I]t rests solely with the State through its Legislature to determine whether it will recognize a claim even though founded upon equity and justice and allow it to be developed into a legal demand and * * * the exercise of this choice cannot be delegated to any one else[.] * * * Practically the sole power of the courts in this respect is to determine whether all of the facts established in a given case and presumably within the knowledge of the Legislature do establish such a foundation of equity and justice that the Legislature within the rules established by the courts was authorized, <em>if it saw fit so to do, to </em>recognize the justice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>claim\u201d (243 NY, at 244-245, <em>supra </em>[emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In Williamsburgh&gt; the State had indicated its intent to allow enforcement of a moral obligation, permitting judicial determination of a claim <em>(id.; see also, Board of Supervisors v State of New York, </em>153 NY 279, 293 [unenforceable moral obligation paid by the State]).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">To prevent the State from assuming public authority debt as a moral obligation \u2014 and to overrule constitutionally the effect of <em>Williamsburgh </em>\u2014 the 1938 Constitution (our present Constitution) explicitly empowered public authorities to issue bonds and incur debt but prevented the State from assuming that liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\"Neither the state nor any political subdivision thereof shall at any time be liable for the payment of any obligations issued by such a public corporation heretofore or hereafter created, nor may the legislature accept, authorize acceptance of or impose such liability upon the state or any political subdivision thereof; but the state or a political subdivision thereof may, if authorized by the legislature, acquire the properties of any such corporation and pay the indebtedness thereof\u2019 (NY Const, art X, \u00a7 5; <em>see, </em>3 Revised Record of 1938 Constitutional Convention of State of NY, at 2259-2283; Galie, <em>New York State Constitution, </em>at 226-228).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">To limit proliferation of public authorities, the new Constitution specified that only the Legislature, through special act, could create them <em>(see, City of Rye v Metropolitan Transp. Auth., </em>24 NY2d 627).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Those who spoke in opposition to allowing public authorities expansive discretion in performing formerly State functions were in the minority. Debate at the Constitutional Convention included discussion of whether the State would be liable in the event an authority were unable to meet its obligations, and the language of the amendment was tailored to make clear that it would not. The Chair of the Committee on the Legislature and its Powers, George Fearon, supported the new provision, stating, \" T believe that when people buy [authority] bonds they should know definitely and certainly that the credit of the State of New York and that the credit of the municipality is not behind those bonds. There should not be any question about it\u2019 \u201d (Quirk and Wein, A <em>Short Constitu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>tional History of Entities Commonly Known as Authorities, </em>56 Cornell L Rev 521, 573 [1971], quoting 3 Revised Record of 1938 Constitutional Convention, <em>op. cit., </em>at 2276).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">By article VII, \u00a7 8 and article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the 1938 Constitution, the prohibition against gifts or loans of State credit was made applicable to public corporations <em>(see, Wein II, </em>39 NY2d, at 144, <em>supra). </em>While the provision bars the State from lending its \"credit\u201d to a public corporation, the State is nonetheless free to give money to a public authority and to commit itself to giving future gifts <em>(see, Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248). The distinction is rooted in the fact that the granting of State money \u2014 while depleting current State coffers and making those funds unavailable for other purposes \u2014 nevertheless does not bind future generations or create the same dangers of collapse, insolvency and crisis associated with the abuse of credit. Such a distinction presumes, of course, that the State has adequate funds to support a gift <em>(Wein II, </em>39 NY2d, at 154, <em>supra </em>[Jasen, J., dissenting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The Constitution was adopted by the people on November 8, 1938 at a general election, giving full recognition to the existence of public benefit corporations, their independent capacity to contract debt, and the continued power of the State to make gifts of money to those authorities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 contention, there can be no question that \u2014 for the purpose of contracting their own legally binding obligations \u2014 the Thruway Authority and the MTA are public benefit corporations existing independently of the State (NY Const, art X, \u00a7 5; <em>Matter of Plumbing, Heating, Piping &amp; Air Conditioning Contrs. Assn, v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>5 NY2d 420, 424-425, <em>supra; Metropolitan Transp. Auth. v County of Nassau, </em>28 NY2d 385, 390).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>of debt by public authorities was unquestionably not the aim of the referendum requirement, adopted in 1846, since those entities did not exist at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">That the 1938 Constitution expressly empowered public authorities to contract debt independently of the State lends further support to the conclusion that the Act, by authorizing the Thruway Authority and the MTA to issue bonds, does not contract legally binding debt upon the State. The power of the State and these Authorities to engage in this practice has been secured by vote of the people, through article X, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution, and any change must come by constitutional amendment. The courts have not made the Constitution and they cannot unmake it <em>(see, Sgaglione v Levitt, </em>37 NY2d 507, 514).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Though the debt of the Thruway Authority and MTA are not a legal obligation of the State, plaintiffs also contend that the Act contracts debt of the State by imposing a moral obligation on the Legislature to continue appropriating revenue to the special Funds. A moral obligation, however, is not in and of itself \"debt\u201d <em>(see, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v Agnew, </em>194 NY 165, 170) \u2014 although it may constitute sufficient consideration to support a promise to pay <em>(see, Meyer v Price, </em>250 NY 370, 376).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Debt, within the contemplation of the State constitutional debt-limiting provisions, has a settled meaning <em>(see, Wein I, </em>36 NY2d 610, <em>supra), </em>and we are not persuaded that plaintiffs\u2019 argument for an expanded definition has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>To bring themselves within article VII, \u00a7 11, plaintiffs characterize the Act as creating \"moral obligation\u201d debt \u2014 a term apparently coined in the 1960\u2019s to describe appropriation-risk bonds that could not legally bind the Legislature beyond a session but would create a \"moral obligation\u201d to appropriate money should a public authority be unable to redeem its bonds <em>(see, </em>Quirk and Wein, <em>Rockefeller\u2019s Constitutional Sleight of Hand, </em>Empire State Report, at 430 [Nov. 1975]; <em>see also, </em>Tyler, <em>The Steady Growth of Backdoor Financing, </em>Empire State Report, at 213, 222 [June 1975]). The existence of such a moral obligation would provide some assurance (though not an enforceable legal obligation) to bondholders that the bonds would retain their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The bonds authorized by the Act were not labelled \"moral obligation bonds\u201d by the Legislature, and entirely apart from nomenclature the Act does not create such an obligation. The Act requires a statement on the face of the bonds that they are not a debt of the State and are payable only out of the Authorities\u2019 funds. Moreover, the Act disavows existence of a moral obligation on the part of the State to appropriate revenues in the future. These disclaimers \u2014 particularly when read in light of the constitutional prohibition against State assumption of authority debt (NY Const, art X, \u00a7 5) \u2014 are sufficient to remove any reasonable expectation on the part of bondholders that the State will guarantee return in the event of default on the part of the Authority or that the bonds place them in privity with the State <em>(see, Matter of Mullane v McKenzie, </em>269 NY 369, 376, <em>rearg denied </em>270 NY 563, <em>supra </em>[no moral obligation arises where State acting in accordance with its legal rights]).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 heavy reliance on <em>Williamsburgh </em>(243 NY 231, <em>supra) </em>as establishing the possibility that the State could be held liable on a moral obligation is unavailing. First \u2014 unlike the Act \u2014 the statute at issue in <em>Williamsburgh </em>expressly recognized the possibility of a moral obligation. Second, article X, \u00a7 5 was adopted after <em>Williamsburgh </em>precisely to overrule constitutionally the possibility of the State assuming a moral obligation as to debt of a public authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Most critically, a moral obligation cannot be judicially imposed upon the State in the absence of its consent to be so bound <em>(see, Williamsburgh, </em>243 NY, at 247, <em>supra). </em>Even where a moral obligation exists, that circumstance creates no enforceable right on behalf of the aggrieved party. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>where circumstances support a determination that the State has a valid moral obligation to honor a private claim, we will permit the State to waive immunity from liability. But that is a unilateral right <em>(Ruotolo, </em>83 NY2d 248, <em>supra; People v Westchester County Natl. Bank, </em>231 NY 465, <em>supra), </em>and the effect is simply to permit adjudication of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In short, a moral obligation does not create \"debt,\u201d since it creates no enforceable right on the part of the one to whom the obligation is owed. Moreover, the Act could not make plainer that the State recognizes no moral obligation on its part to continue appropriations. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Act creates a moral obligation to pay which falls within the constitutional definition of \"debt\u201d therefore also must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Plaintiffs point as well to the State\u2019s need to protect our economy as binding future Legislatures to continue with annual appropriations to the Funds for the life of the bonds. They claim that, in reality, the bonds are backed by the State\u2019s full faith and credit because the consequences of default would be ruinous, assuring that appropriations will be made. Indeed, plaintiffs document instances where State officials appear to have characterized the future appropriations as legal obligations of the State, despite the Act\u2019s disclaimers. Thus, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, the Act obligates the State to continue appropriations for the life of the bonds \u2014 some 30 years \u2014creating long-term State \"debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We have previously held that a proposal to fund in a subsequent year, subject to legislative appropriation and explicit disclaimer, does not create legally binding debt <em>(Levy v McClellan, </em>196 NY 178, 195-196; <em>see also, Public Util. Dist. No. 1 v Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys., </em>104 Wash 2d 353, 370, 705 P2d 1195, 1207 [WPPS bonds do not constitute legal or equitable pledge upon State]). In <em>People ex rel. Hopkins v Board of Supervisors </em>(52 NY 556, 564, <em>supra), </em>we observed that while the Legislature might endeavor to incur future liabilities, to be appropriated on a year-to-year basis without submitting the spending plan to the people, \"[n]o harm or loss has or can come from this practice.\u201d Such spending plans are effectual only to the extent subsequent Legislatures indeed do \"give effect to them by providing the means and directing their payment, but the discretion and responsibility is with them as if no former appropriations had been made. No duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>or obligation is devolved upon them by the acts of their predecessors\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 565). If uneffected by future Legislatures, the laws will simply \"remain upon the statute books, but * * * only * * * as monuments of the extravagance, recklessness or folly of those by whom they were enacted,\u201d creating no legally binding debt or liability upon the State <em>(id., </em>at 565).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Our constitutional limitations, however, have consistently been construed as addressing legally binding debt. As in <em>Wein I, </em>where we upheld subsidies for debt service on bonds issued by the Stabilization Reserve Corporation contingent on annual appropriation, indebtedness is precluded by the very terms of chapter 56, as well as the prohibition of article X, \u00a7 5 against State assumption of authority debt (36 NY2d, at 617). We rejected in <em>Wein I </em>the suggestion that a gift of money to a public authority \u2014 upheld in <em>Comereski </em>(308 NY, at 253-254)\u2014 violated the letter or spirit of the constitutional limitations on contracting debt <em>(Wein I, </em>36 NY2d, at 616, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Next, in <em>Wein II </em>(39 NY2d 136, <em>supra), </em>we upheld a plan giving aid to New York City and the Municipal Assistance Corporation that would be funded through borrowing pursuant to the short-term debt provision of article VII, \u00a7 9 as not violating the constitutional prohibition against giving or lending credit of the State. In <em>Wein III </em>(42 NY2d 300, <em>supra), </em>a law promising to indemnify State officers from any claims arising from purchase of risky authority bonds was not \"borrowing\u201d of any kind, but rather \"a contingent cost of doing State business payable routinely out of the general fund\u201d (42 NY2d, at 305).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Apart from constituting a line of precedents upon which reliance has been placed in the financial marketplace, these cases established that a contractual obligation on the part of government to make future \"gifts\u201d to a special fund created to retire debt of an independent public authority is not offensive to article VII, \u00a7 8; article VIII, \u00a7 1; or article X, \u00a7 5 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">We define \"debt\u201d no differently for purposes of article VII, \u00a7 11. While the Legislature might make the appropriations to the Funds, to be used in turn to service the Authorities\u2019 debt, it is not bound to do so. Should it fail to do so, and the Authority default, the State is not liable to the bondholders under the provisions of the Act. Because the State does not become indebted, the financing subject to appropriation does not constitute the lending of credit or assumption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>liability of a public corporation, or indebtedness of the State for purposes of the constitutional limits on such debt <em>(Wein I, </em>36 NY2d, at 618, <em>supra). </em>Instead, the funds \u2014 if appropriated\u2014 constitute a permissible gift of money to a public corporation out of existing revenues, creating no debt (NY Const, art VII, \u00a7 8; <em>Comereski v City of Elmira, </em>308 NY 248, <em>supra). </em>Laws making annual appropriations from a special fund do not and cannot create debts within the meaning of the referendum requirement <em>(Rockaway Pac. Corp. v Stotesbury, </em>255 F 345, 348 [ND NY]).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third argument therefore must fail as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In sum, neutral principles of law and consistent precedents of this Court, upon which decades of commercial transactions have been premised, lead us to uphold the validity of the particular legislation before us. If (as plaintiffs urge) modern ingenuity, even gimmickry, have in fact stretched the words of the Constitution beyond the point of prudence, that plea for reform in State borrowing practices and policy is appropriately directed to the public arena, where indeed it is now under serious consideration <em>(see, </em>NY Senate Bill S 4359, <em>replacing </em>Assembly Bill A 7586 [Apr. 4, 1993]; Joint Press Release of Governor and Comptroller [Mar. 15, 1994]; Opn of Atty Gen to Legislature re NY Senate Bill S 4359 [May 11, 1993]).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">We have reviewed plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims, and conclude they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith and Ciparick concur; Judge Levine taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">.

It operates and maintains the 641-mile New York State Thruway, as well as New York\u2019s 524-mile canal system.

A moral obligation cognizable by the State generally falls into one of two classifications.

Where a moral obligation exists, the Legislature may use public money to remedy an injustice in cases even though no legal obligation to do so exists, so long as some higher obligation of honor, fairness or broad public responsibility is recognized <em>(Matter of Mullane v McKenzie, </em>269 NY 369). As we recently stated in <em>Matter of Ruotolo v State of New York, </em>moral obligation is properly found where legislative failure to act would be a \"travesty of justice\u201d (83 NY2d 248, 259).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
