G. Ship Maintenance Corp. v Lezak, </em>69 NY2d 1; <em>Zletz v Wetanson, </em>67 NY2d 711.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b633-7\">Chief Judge Kaye.</author>\n<p id=\"b633-8\"> At issue on this appeal is the propriety of dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint as a remedy for misconduct that involved taking and use of the adversary\u2019s privileged documents. In the circumstances presented, we affirm the Appellate Division order upholding dismissal as a proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion under CPLR 3103 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The underlying facts, as found by the Supreme Court and affirmed by the Appellate Division, are essentially undisputed. In February 1988, plaintiff was terminated as Manager of Health Services for American Red Cross in Greater New York, where she had worked for more than two years. Plaintiff thereafter commenced an action for sexual harassment and discrimination pursuant to the Human Rights Law (Executive Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq.) </em>and 42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>her former supervisor (Robert Bender) and her former employer. She alleged that her refusal of Bender\u2019s unwelcome sexual overtures prevented her advancement at Red Cross, ultimately leading to her termination, and that Red Cross itself allowed an environment hostile to its women employees. Plaintiff was represented by Wisehart &amp; Koch (Arthur Wise-hart), and defendants Bender and Greater New York Red Cross by Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges (WGM) (Mark Jacoby).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">On Friday, June 28, 1991, during the course of increasingly acrimonious pretrial proceedings marked by mutual accusation of abusive tactics, plaintiff and Wisehart appeared at a hearing room in New York County Supreme Court to argue certain deposition issues before a Special Referee. Now employed as a salaried paralegal by her attorney, plaintiff took what she described as her customary place at the conference table. Already on the table at that spot was a stack of some 200 pages, the top sheet beginning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\"Well, Gotshal &amp; Manges</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">MEMORANDUM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">December 8,1989 To: File</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">From: Lawrence J. Baer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">Re: <em>Joan Lipin v American Red Cross </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">Meeting with Mary Stanton 9/15/89\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">The page continued with a summary of counsel\u2019s meeting with Stanton, a Red Cross employee, including Stanton\u2019s candid impressions of plaintiff and her recounting of Jacoby\u2019s legal advice regarding plaintiff\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">While the attorneys \u2014 including the author of the file memorandum, WGM associate Lawrence Baer \u2014 were absorbed in heated exchanges regarding the deposition, plaintiff read the first few pages, then shifted the documents (which she concealed in a folder) to her lap and continued to read, undetected, for more than an hour. In plaintiff\u2019s own words: \"I wasn\u2019t reviewing those papers, I was reading them.\u201d Immediately, she recognized the documents as containing the lawyer\u2019s interview notes of Red Cross personnel, including defendant Bender, as well as deposition digests.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">At a break, plaintiff slipped the documents into a Redweld file \"for [her] own protection,\u201d determined to retain them as \"material evidence,\u201d and in the corridor told Wisehart about the documents and what she had done. Wisehart said that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>would not himself read the documents until he had received a \"second opinion.\u201d Plaintiff told Wisehart that she would not give him the documents unless she could keep a copy. During the luncheon recess plaintiff returned to Wisehart\u2019s office where she made three photocopies, \"Bates-stamped\u201d them, and \u2014 except for one copy she later took home with her\u2014 placed the documents in a locked filing cabinet to which she had a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">According to plaintiff, Wisehart counseled her that if Baer discovered his documents missing, she must tell the truth: that she had picked them up by mistake. Plaintiff responded that she had not picked them up by mistake, but deliberately, and would not return the originals unless asked to do so by WGM. In consultation with the lawyer who had referred plaintiff\u2019s case to him, Wisehart concluded that any claim of privilege as to the documents had been lost as a result of Baer\u2019s careless handling of them, and on Sunday evening, June 30, he read through them.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Promptly the next morning, Wisehart wrote to Jacoby that \"a recent development causes me to suggest that immediate attention should be given to the subject of settlement from all points of Anew.\u201d At a meeting the following afternoon, Wise-hart confronted defense counsel with the documents and demanded immediate termination of defendant Bender, a \"substantial\u201d money settlement and other reparations. When Jacoby asked how he had obtained the documents, Wisehart demurred, citing attorney-client privilege, asserting only that plaintiff had obtained them legitimately. Wisehart further cautioned Jacoby that plaintiff had retained a copy \"for her own protection\u201d and he had no control over what she might do with the information, suggesting that she could release it to the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On Wednesday, July 3, 1991, defendants moved for a protective order pursuant to CPLR 3103, and that very day the parties appeared in court. Wisehart consented to WGM\u2019s request for interim relief, including that plaintiff (herself present in the courtroom) turn over to her lawyer \"everything in her possession,\u201d and that he secure all copies in his vault. Over the Fourth of July holiday, however, plaintiff hand-cop-led parts of the documents from the set she retained at home, returning the documents to Wisehart on Friday, July 5. Even then, plaintiff kept her handwritten notes, and the documents were placed in the locked cabinet for which she had a key.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Following plaintiff\u2019s testimony at a hearing commenced July 8, defendants amended their request for relief to include dismissal of the complaint. Defendants based their request on plaintiff\u2019s testimony establishing her \"knowing and purposeful course of conduct to misuse the wrongfully acquired information in a blatant violation of accepted moral, ethical and legal standards, and this Court\u2019s directive.\u201d Her intimate knowledge of these defense documents had caused \"irreparable harm\u201d and \"forever tainted the conduct of this litigation and * * * severely prejudiced defendants\u2019 ability to defend,\u201d as \"neither plaintiff\u2019s memory, nor [Wisehart\u2019s] memory can be purged.\u201d Because the case was now \"poisoned,\u201d according to counsel nothing short of dismissal could remedy the wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In connection with a separate discovery dispute, on July 29 Wisehart filed a motion to compel disclosure with the Special Referee. Jacoby alerted the trial court that plaintiff\u2019s memorandum exploited information derived from the disputed documents, contending that this violation of the court\u2019s directive underscored the need for dismissal of the action. He pointed in particular to arguments made by Wisehart that Jacoby said could have come only from the interview notes. Throughout the autumn, the parties litigated plaintiff\u2019s cross motion for disqualification of WGM (on grounds they were fact witnesses in the document dispute, and had conspired in plaintiff\u2019s termination, a tort) and other disclosure controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">After reviewing the documents in camera, in January the court dismissed the complaint, rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim that careless placement of the papers waived their confidential nature. The court found that plaintiff, in retaining the documents and making notes of their contents, had acted contrary to the court\u2019s order, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\"the actions of the plaintiff and her attorney were so egregious in taking this material that was clearly the attorney\u2019s work product, clearly interviews with the defendant\u2019s employees, clearly not for perusal by any other attorney or litigant in this litigation, so heinous that the only remedy, as much as I dislike to do this, is to dismiss the lawsuit. Otherwise, there is no meaning to privilege, there is no meaning to conduct among attorneys, and there is no rule of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\"Whatever was in these papers was confidential. That confidentiality was broken. It was repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>broken by both the litigant and the attorney, and cannot be countenanced by the Court. Therefore, I am dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Appellate Division sustained the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion, agreeing that plaintiffs own egregious conduct warranted the drastic sanction of dismissal. The highly improper manner in which plaintiff obtained the documents, coupled with their subsequent use, in the court\u2019s view constituted sufficient basis for dismissal. Having ourselves reviewed the documents in camera, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In that plaintiff continues to defend the legitimacy of her behavior, analysis begins with that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The trial court, and the Appellate Division, could hardly have been clearer in their conclusions, characterizing plaintiffs conduct \u2014 as well as that of her attorney \u2014 as \"heinous\u201d and \"egregious,\u201d a threat to the attorney-client privilege, to the concept of civilized, orderly conduct among attorneys, and even to the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Moreover, there is ample support for the affirmed factual findings of wrongdoing by plaintiff, wholly apart from the conduct of her attorney that indisputably compounded it. Having deliberately taken the initial misstep of secretly reading what she recognized as attorneys\u2019 confidential documents, plaintiff was presented with several opportunities to purge herself and minimize prejudice to defendants. At each juncture, however, she chose the course of action that exacerbated the harm. Having read the documents, she concealed and then took them. Having taken them, she photocopied them, kept them accessible at the office, and insisted on retaining a set for herself at home. Upon being ordered by the court to return \"everything in her possession,\u201d she made notes of the documents and, even after surrendering the final copy, held onto the notes. And although plaintiff was present when the trial court instructed Wisehart to secure the documents in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\"vault,\u201d she placed them in a cabinet to which she had free access.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">While the Appellate Division made plain that it would reach the same result whether or not the documents were actually privileged, in fact both courts agreed as to the protected nature of the documents, which plainly fall within the ambit of work product and the attorney-client privilege <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3101 [b], [c]; <em>see also, Spectrum Sys. Intl. Corp. v Chemical Bank, </em>78 NY2d 371, 377, 380). Similarly lacking any basis in the record \u2014 as the trial court and Appellate Division further concluded \u2014 is plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendants waived the privilege by leaving the documents on the hearing room table during argument before the Special Referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">There can be no doubt that plaintiff\u2019s conduct was \u2014 to say the least \u2014 a breach of the orderly disclosure scheme set forth in CPLR article 31. The question remains whether a proper response to that breach was outright dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Plaintiff challenges dismissal of her complaint as both beyond the trial court\u2019s power and an abuse of discretion. Neither contention withstands analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Turning first to the issue of authority, we note that a good deal of the parties\u2019 argument centers on courts\u2019 inherent power to punish for contumacious conduct \u2014 understandably so, in that the trial court and Appellate Division both were concerned with intolerable behavior that, unredressed, threatens the entire litigation process. Whether there is power\u2014 inherent or otherwise \u2014 to close the courthouse doors to a plaintiff with \"unclean hands\u201d is not, however, the issue before us. Relief was sought under CPLR 3103 (c), which was the basis of both courts\u2019 review, as it is of ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">CPLR 3103 governs the subject of \"protective orders\u201d for disclosure abuses, and confers broad discretion upon a court to fashion appropriate remedies both where abuses are threatened (subd [a]) and where they have already occurred (subd M):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">\"(a) Prevention of abuse. The court may at any time on its own initiative, or on motion of any party or witness, make a protective order denying, limiting, conditioning or regulating the use of any disclosure device. Such order shall be designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>prevent unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice to any person or the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">\"(b) Suspension of disclosure pending application for protective order. Service of a notice of motion for a protective order shall suspend disclosure of the particular matter in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\"(c) Suppression of information improperly obtained. If any disclosure under this article has been improperly or irregularly obtained so that a substantial right of a party is prejudiced, the court, on motion, may make an appropriate order, including an order that the information be suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In seeking relief pursuant to CPLR 3103 (c), defendants alleged that plaintiff had violated their attorney-client privilege, and that her extensive knowledge of the contents of their private documents impaired the conduct of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">There being no specific mention of dismissal in CPLR 3103 (c), plaintiff contends that courts lack that power where information is improperly obtained <em>(contrast, </em>CPLR 3126 [3], authorizing dismissal as penalty for refusal to comply with order to disclose). We read the statute, however, to confer authority to do exactly what the statute says \u2014 that is, to enter <em>any </em>order, including an order of dismissal, that is appropriate in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The lack of greater specificity in this statute designed to confer broad discretion is hardly surprising. Spelling out the remedies for the limitless potential discovery abuses would not only overwhelm the statute but also needlessly confine the discretion of courts to tailor the remedy to the problem. The Practice Commentaries to CPLR 3103 recognize that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">\"If the recognition of possible abuse [of disclosure devices] were to take the form of special or detailed remedies built into different devices, with each one perhaps listing the possible abuses and attempting to remedy them seriatim, the disclosure article would be seriously encumbered with little resulting advantage. Experience has taught that the variations from case to case are too great and that when an article has as pervasive and important a mission as the disclosure article, the specific approach is unwise.\u201d (Siegel, Practice Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>mentarles, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR C3103:l, at 356; <em>see also, </em>3A Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac 3103.02.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As the drafters made clear, \"[tjhere is no limit but the needs of the parties on the nature of the [protective] order or the conditions of discovery\u201d (First Preliminary Report of Advisory Comm on Practice and Procedure, 1957 NY Legis Doc No. 6 [b], at 124). There being power in the trial courts to dismiss a complaint, the question remains whether in this case the remedy of dismissal was an \"appropriate\u201d order, or an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">CPLR 3103 (c) does provide that \"a substantial right of a party [must be] prejudiced\u201d by the improper conduct, focusing attention on the statutory objective of redressing harm or prejudice to the party adversely affected by the conduct. Plainly this is a measure for remediation, not sanction. Obviously, the extreme measure of dismissal \u2014 likely the severest remedy that may be visited upon a plaintiff \u2014 would require serious prejudice to the affected party, irremediable by less drastic steps, a standard we agree was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Defendants urged dismissal because of assertedly irreparable prejudice to the conduct of their defense as a result of the knowledge plaintiff herself had gained through study, retention and copying of their privileged documents. There is no question that plaintiff knowingly and deliberately intruded herself into plainly private communications between defendants and their attorney, and by retaining and hand-copying the documents preserved the information gleaned for maximum advantage to herself (and maximum disadvantage to defendants) in the litigation. Similarly, there is no question that the information was used to that end. Defense counsel argue that within the first 100 hours after plaintiff obtained the information, it surfaced in \"ten separate acts of misbehavior,\u201d which they detail, including attempts to extract a \"substantial\u201d money settlement. Plaintiff\u2019s own recognition that the information would yield significant litigation advantage to her, and consequent disadvantage to her adversary, undercuts any suggestion that the documents were immaterial. Plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of course can never be purged.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">In these circumstances, we conclude that dismissal was appropriate and not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion as a matter of law <em>(see, Matter of U. S. Pioneer Elecs. Corp. v Nikko Elec. Corp., </em>47 NY2d 914). Clearly neither suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of the documents nor suppression of the information was a realistic alternative. Nor would disqualification of plaintiffs counsel have ameliorated the prejudice, in that the wrongdoing and the knowledge were the client\u2019s own, which she would carry into any new attorney-client relationship <em>(cf., Matter of Weinberg, </em>129 AD2d 126, <em>rearg denied </em>132 AD2d 190, <em>lv dismissed sub nom. Matter of Beiny, </em>71 NY2d 994 [attorney disqualification an appropriate remedy where plaintiff was not infected by attorney\u2019s misconduct]). While in <em>Weinberg </em>the court felt it sufficient to require the plaintiff to establish, once new counsel was in place, an independent source for any information that may have also been discoverable through the documents improperly obtained by disqualified counsel, the trial court here reasonably concluded that policing such an order in this instance would be inadequate. In reaching that determination, the nature of plaintiffs misconduct could properly be considered, and indeed the trial court emphasized, in concluding that dismissal was the only practicable remedy here, the persistence of plaintiffs misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa, Smith and Levine concur; Judge Ciparick taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel thereafter simply recommenced the litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on the theory that \u2014 despite the tenor and substance of the trial court\u2019s opinion\u2014 the dismissal was not \"with prejudice.\u201d That litigation has been stayed, pending determination of the present appeal. Counsel also tried, by subpoena, to obtain a copy of the documents for use on appeal, but this Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to quash.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
