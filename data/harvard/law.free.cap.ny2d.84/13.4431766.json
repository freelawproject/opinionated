The Court below erred in holding that workers\u2019 compensation payments for permanent partial disability beyond three years postaccident are with \"basic economic loss\u201d and thus not subject to a compensation carrier\u2019s lien or credit (offset) rights under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29. In so holding, the Court below erred in its reading of the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co. </em>(76 NY2d 248); in failing to adhere to its own precedent in <em>Matter of Fellner v Country Wide Ins. </em>(95 AD2d 106) and <em>Matter of Simmons v St. Lawrence County CDP </em>(147 AD2d 323); and in its interpretation of Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 5102, 5104 and Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a). In essence, the Court below has usurped the authority of the Legislature and judicially redefined \"basic economic loss.\u201d <em>(Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41; <em>Pascente v Stoyle, </em>116 Misc 2d 641; <em>Hughes v Ryder Truck Rental, </em>125 AD2d 177; <em>Tortorello v Landi, </em>136 AD2d 545; <em>Rulison v Zanella, </em>119 AD2d 957; <em>Watkins v Bank of Castile, </em>172 AD2d 1061; <em>Matter of Granger v Urda, </em>44 NY2d 91.) II. The Court below erred in holding that claimant\u2019s third-party settlement without the carrier\u2019s consent did not bar claimant from receiving further compensation payments for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>permanent partial disability. Said holding announced without rationale and without citation to authority, is in direct conflict with the relevant statutory and decisional law. <em>(Matter of Daly v Daly Constr.

The Court below erred as a matter of law in determining that compensation payments for lost time from work more than three years from the date of accident represent payments for basic economic loss because Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (a) (2) limits \"basic economic loss\u201d wage loss to a period of three years from the date of accident. Accordingly, pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a729 (1) and (1-a), the carrier has a lien for payments made for lost time from work more than three years postaccident. <em>(Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co., </em>76 NY2d 248; <em>Matter of Simmons v St. Lawrence County CDP, </em>147 AD2d 323; <em>Matter of Fellner v Country Wide Ins., </em>95 AD2d 106.) II. The claimant failed to obtain the workers\u2019 compensation carrier\u2019s consent to his third-party settlement and failed to obtain a compromise order pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a729 (5). Because the carrier\u2019s lien may encompass payments for medical and other services as well as compensation, failure to obtain consent bars further compensation payments whether or not they represent first-party benefits for basic economic loss. <em>(Matter of Parmelee v International Paper Co., 157 </em>AD2d 878; <em>Matter of Durham v Barker Chem. Corp., </em>151 AD2d 887; <em>Matter of King v New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>132 AD2d 742.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b84-5\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> In this proceeding the issues are (1) whether workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to a claimant beyond three years may properly be construed as payment for \"basic economic loss\u201d under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co. </em>(76 NY2d 248), and thus not subject to a compensation carrier\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a729 lien and (2) whether a claimant may continue to receive compensation payments for permanent partial disability where the carrier\u2019s consent was not obtained prior to the claimant\u2019s settlement of a third-party action. Because payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for more than three years may not be considered as payment for basic economic loss and a carrier\u2019s consent is required prior to the settlement of a claimant\u2019s third-party action, we reverse the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The facts are not disputed. Claimant Johnson, employed by appellant Buffalo and Erie County Private Industry Council, sustained compensable injuries during a September 11, 1986 car accident. Claimant filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and also commenced a civil suit against the driver. Without the compensation carrier\u2019s consent, however, claimant settled the civil suit for $10,000 \u2014 the full amount of the driver\u2019s insurance policy, netting $6,666.67 after attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Claimant was examined by a State Medical Examiner employed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board who concluded that claimant had a permanent partial disability. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (WCL) Judge adopted that determination in his decision following a hearing held on August 16, 1988 to determine claimant\u2019s payments. Claimant\u2019s compensation rate was set at $82.97 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">On March 28, 1989 at a hearing before the Board, in response to the Judge\u2019s question whether the third-party action was pending, defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that the matter had been settled and that the carrier\u2019s consent was not necessary. At a hearing held January 23, 1990, the WCL Judge found that the claim came within the purview of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 (8) (d) which provides a Special Injury Disability Fund allowing reimbursement to employers or carriers for all awards for permanent disability where the claimant\u2019s injuries meet specified criteria <em>(see, </em>Minkowitz, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15, at 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>By decision dated May 1, 1990, the State Insurance Fund, the insurance carrier, suspended claimant\u2019s payments in light of his settlement of the third-party action without its consent. The carrier also requested that the Board formally close claimant\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">After a hearing to determine the implications of claimant\u2019s third-party settlement, the WCL Judge held that the settlement was for pain and suffering and directed the carrier to continue the payments at the previous rate of $82.97 per week. The carrier and the Special Funds Conservation Committee appealed the WCL Judge\u2019s decision to the Board. The Special Funds Conservation Committee\u2019s standing in this case was based upon its requirement, pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 15 (8) (d), to reimburse the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">By a decision filed on September 18, 1991, the Board modified the WCL Judge\u2019s decision, holding that as a result of claimant\u2019s settlement of the third-party action without the carrier\u2019s consent, claimant was precluded from receiving further compensation benefits subsequent to April 23, 1990. The Board also noted that \"a carrier\u2019s lien attaches to any recovery other than first party benefits under the Insurance Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The Appellate Division reversed the Board\u2019s determination (192 AD2d 763). Disagreeing with the Board that the carrier had a lien on claimant\u2019s third-party action, that Court found no distinction between the disability award in <em>Dietrick </em>and the weekly award paid to claimant here for purposes of \"basic economic loss\u201d as defined in Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 <em>(id., </em>at 764). The Appellate Division further stated that both awards, \"by their nature, extend beyond the three-year period for payment for loss of wages set by Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (a) (2)\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 764).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Here, the carrier argues that the Appellate Division erred by holding that claimant\u2019s payments, which extend beyond three years, may constitute \"basic economic loss\u201d and by concluding that the carrier\u2019s consent was unnecessary in the third-party action. Claimant contends that the Appellate Division correctly applied <em>Dietrick </em>to the facts of this case and that because his compensation payments constitute payment for economic loss, no lien may properly attach. This Court granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The legislative history of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a) indicates the remedial nature of the statute <em>(see, </em>News Mem of State Exec Dept. 1978 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>NY, at 1748). Prior to the enactment of that subdivision, our 1978 decision in <em>Matter of Granger v Urda </em>(44 NY2d 91) recognized the clash of the provisions of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) and Insurance Law \u00a7 671 (2) (b) (former no-fault automobile insurance law) which resulted in (1) the no-fault scheme allowing the no-fault insurer to deduct from its payments to an insured the amounts the insured recovered or could recover under workers\u2019 compensation and (2) continuing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) lien upon any recovery by the claimant in a third-party action. The <em>Granger </em>Court was constrained to implement the \"harsh, unintended result\u201d of the simultaneous application of those statutes <em>(see, id., </em>at 99). Thus, injured employees became \"self-insurer[s]\u201d for at least part of their basic economic loss <em>(id., </em>at 99; <em>Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co., </em>76 NY2d 248, 253, <em>supra; see also, Grello v Daszykowski, </em>44 NY2d 894, 895; <em>see, </em>News Mem of State Exec Dept, 1978 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 1748). The <em>Granger </em>Court further urged that \"corrective legislative action is advisable, if not imperative\u201d <em>(Granger, supra, </em>at 99).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The Legislature responded to <em>Granger, </em>enacting Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a). The relevant portion of that subdivision precludes the compensation carrier from imposing a lien \"for compensation and/or medical benefits paid which were in lieu of first party benefits which another insurer would have otherwise been obligated to pay under [the no-fault provisions] of the insurance law\u201d <em>(see, Matter of Simmons v St. Lawrence County GDP, </em>147 AD2d 323, 324-325; <em>Matter of Fellner v Country Wide Ins., </em>95 AD2d 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The No-Fault Automobile Insurance Law defines \"first party benefits\u201d as \"payments to reimburse a person for basic economic loss on account of personal injury arising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle\u201d (Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [b]). Pivotal for resolution of this case is whether claimant\u2019s compensation fits within the term \"basic economic loss\u201d as delineated by the statute. Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (a) (2) limits the definition of \"basic economic loss\u201d to \"[l]ass of earnings from work which the person would have performed had he not been injured * * * up to one thousand dollars per month for not more than three years from the date of the accident causing the injury.\u201d Here, it is uncontested that payments to claimant continued far beyond three years from the date of the accident. Thus, at least a portion of claimant\u2019s payments may not be properly characterized as for \"basic economic loss\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a729 (1-a) lien restrictions should not have been applied to the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Claimant relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co. </em>(76 NY2d 248, <em>supra) </em>to support his position that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1-a) lien restriction is applicable here. First, <em>Dietrick </em>makes clear that compensation for permanent partial disability or facial disfigurement <em>may </em>be deemed compensation in lieu of first-party benefits because it often relates to a claimant\u2019s basic economic loss, as in lost earnings, \"whether actual or presumed\u201d <em>(see, id., </em>at 252). This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dietrick, </em>however, was to establish facial disfigurement as an injury which requires acknowledgement of its often income-impairing characteristics, and, thus, awards for such injuries may often be deemed \"compensation 'in lieu of first party benefits\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 252, quoting Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [1-a]; <em>see, Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co., </em>145 AD2d 8 [indicates that issue at Appellate Division was whether compensation for facial disfigurement constituted first-party benefits]). <em>Dietrick </em>did not effect a change in the statutory requirement that compensation for \"basic economic loss\u201d be limited to three years <em>(see, </em>Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 [a] [2]). Additionally, there is no showing that the award in <em>Dietrick </em>fell outside the parameters of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (a) (2) requiring that monthly compensation not exceed $1,000<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and that the award not exceed three years from the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Claimant\u2019s contention that the carrier\u2019s consent was unnecessary in this case is meritless. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (5) requires either the carrier\u2019s consent or a compromise order from the court in which a third-party action is pending for a claimant to settle a third-party action and continue receiving compensation benefits <em>(see, Matter of Parmelee v International Paper Co., </em>157 AD2d 878 [claimant precluded from receiving further compensation benefits where he settled the third-party negligence action without the consent of self-insured employer]; <em>Matter of Durham v Barker Chem. Corp., </em>151 AD2d 887; <em>see also, Matter of Vincent v Geneva Pizza, </em>196 AD2d 917).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Further, claimant mistakenly assumes that a third-party settlement that constitutes 100% of a liability policy obviates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the need for an insurance carrier\u2019s consent. Nothing in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a729 so states, and decisional law of this State has held to the contrary <em>(see, Matter of Daly v Daly Constr. Corp., </em>136 AD2d 798, <em>lv denied </em>72 NY2d 807 [claimant barred from further compensation even where settlement for full policy limits, absent carrier\u2019s consent]). Claimant\u2019s remaining contentions concerning consent, supported essentially by claimant\u2019s interpretation of the application of <em>Dietrick </em>to the facts of this case, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Simons, Titone, Bellacosa and Ciparick concur; Judge Levine taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\"> The statute was amended in 1991 raising the monthly compensation limit to $2,000 <em>(see, </em>L 1991, ch 320, \u00a7 1). The new limit is not applicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
