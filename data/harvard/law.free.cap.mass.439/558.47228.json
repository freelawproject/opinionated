The only witnesses at trial were the victim and the defendant. Their respective accounts of what occurred between them differed markedly, and the outcome clearly depended on the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of their testimony. A divided panel of the Appeals Court reversed the conviction, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 88, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>94 (2002), on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. It concluded that the prosecutor had presented the defendant \u201cas a \u2018crack\u2019 cocaine-dealing, drug- and alcohol-abusing thief\u201d during the trial, and had then, in her closing, both invited \u201cthe jury to consider the defendant\u2019s character,\u201d and disregarded \u201cthe judge\u2019s explicit order to refrain from argument about the defendant\u2019s supposed guilty conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. For these reasons, and in the absence of what it deemed to be adequate curative instructions, the court ruled there had been prejudicial error requiring reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 94. The case is before us on the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We affirm the conviction on the basis of our conclusion that the defendant, not the prosecutor, affirmatively introduced the evidence on the very subjects about which he now complains, and to the extent there was prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, the judge took adequate steps, including a pointed and strong curative instruction, to ensure that the trial was fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>The Commonwealth\u2019s Case.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The victim, who stood four feet, eleven inches tall, testified that on the day of the incident she came into contact with the defendant, whom she had never seen before, on three separate occasions. In the late morning, while she was sitting on a park bench with a friend enjoying the October weather, the defendant approached and asked her for a cigarette. After she gave him one, he remained in the area. A few hours later, while she walked her dog, the defendant approached her again and engaged in some small talk. While the victim testified that she thought the defendant to be \u201ca little strange,\u201d and did not wish to engage him in conversation, being cordial, she did so for a few minutes. Finally, at 7 p.m., when she left her home to walk to a restaurant to pick up some take-out food for her daughter, the defendant came up to her and grabbed her face so tightly that \u201cI had cuts inside my mouth from my teeth.\u201d He then shoved her toward a bench and \u201cwas trying to stick his tongue in my mouth.\u201d As he did so, the victim struggled and he told her that he had a \u201cpiece,\u201d which she took to mean \u201ca gun or a weapon.\u201d She began kicking her legs furiously. A couple happened by and called to her to see if she was \u201call right,\u201d she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>responded that she was not, and the defendant fled. She thanked the couple, ran to her apartment, and telephoned the police. She testified that she was traumatized by, and terrified during, the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">After the police arrived, they took her to a homeless shelter located in the building next door to her apartment building. There she identified the defendant who \u201cwas crouched in the comer, you know, down\u201d by a Coca-Cola machine. He was arrested and found to have a serrated knife in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">This was the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. There was no evidence introduced about the defendant\u2019s drag dealing, drug use, drinking, or anything else of a derogatory nature except, of course, that he had committed this frightening assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>The Defense.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The defendant took the stand in his own defense. He did not deny that he had approached the victim multiple times on the day in question, that there had been some sort of physical contact between them, that a couple had happened by and asked if the victim was \u201call right,\u201d that she had responded, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not,\u201d and that he then left the scene. He contended, however, that the victim (whom he had not previously known) had given him a \u201chug\u201d after he told her that it was his birthday. In the course of telling his story, the defendant testified that he was unemployed, had been panhandling outside a liquor store, received his meals at the Salvation Army (where he must have \u201cgrab[bed]\u201d the serrated knife while trying to get something to eat), was on probation for selling cocaine, and was using crack cocaine and drinking liquor during the day of the incident to celebrate his birthday. He testified that at the time of the incident he was \u201cbuzzed,\u201d and that although he told the victim that he had \u201ca piece\u201d on him, he meant a piece of crack cocaine that he was offering to share with her. He believed she would be interested in the cocaine, because the person he had seen her with in the park earlier that day, he claimed, was someone he knew from his own experience to be a \u201ccrack dealer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">At the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s direct examination, the prosecutor, not surprisingly, cross-examined him on some of these subjects. She began by countering the defendant\u2019s assertion that he believed the victim would be interested in crack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>cocaine because the victim\u2019s friend was a drug dealer, by asking him whether he was \u201cthe crack dealer\u201d in this story and not the person who had been sitting with the victim in the park. When he equivocated, she pointedly asked him whether in fact he had been the one convicted for selling cocaine, something he had already testified to on direct examination. The prosecutor then got the defendant to admit that he had begun drinking alcohol and smoking crack cocaine around 1:30 p.m. on the day of the assault, and was \u201cheavily intoxicated\u201d at the time he claimed it was the victim who hugged him. She also proceeded to cross-examine him on why a couple might have approached them and asked if the victim was \u201call right,\u201d why the victim would have responded, \u201cno,\u201d and why he would have fled if this was a hug she had initiated. Finally, the prosecutor questioned the defendant about an additional motive to lie about what happened and avoid a conviction because he was on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\n<em>Closing Argument.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In her closing, defense counsel argued that the defendant\u2019s testimony was worthy of belief because he took the stand when he did not have to and \u201c[laid] his flaws out here,\u201d \u201claid it all out for you, clear, straight.\u201d She went on to argue that, because the defendant was willing to disclose all these bad things about himself, things that otherwise would never have come before them, \u201c[t]hat says something about him; he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The prosecutor responded to this argument about how the jury should assess the defendant\u2019s credibility in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, this [is a] case which comes down to credibility, credibility of the witnesses. And I would suggest to you that you make credibility assessments in your daily lives every day, every single day. For instance, you might bring your car into the shop. Your mechanic will tell you, you need a brand new transmission. You make an assessment, you make an assessment about his credibility. And sometimes it\u2019s not what he said, but how he said it. You make determinations about someone\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cI\u2019m asking you to draw on your life experiences, draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>on your own every day experiences in this case, and make determinations about credibility here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201cNow I want you to take in consideration of [the] defendant\u2019s character. He\u2019s a crack dealer. He was dealing crack cocaine in 1998. That was the year of this incident, 1998. He was convicted of dealing crack cocaine. Now [defense counsel] says that happened a couple of years ago, no, 1998 he was convicted of dealing crack cocaine. Take that into consideration when you\u2019re assessing his testimony on the stand. He was drinking. He told you that. He did crack that day. Take that into consideration. He also stole a knife that day. So, he admitted to you on the stand that he stole a knife. He\u2019s a thief now, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re taking in the fact that he did crack and he drank, take into consideration that the effects of his ability to perceive the events of that night. Now, he admitted to you that he saw her around 10, 10:30, when she was smoking a cigarette. ... He was already drunk. It [a]ffected what he heard from her. It [a]ffects his ability to perceive what she\u2019s saying to him. He took it to mean something it wasn\u2019t . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Later in her closing, the prosecutor made reference to testimony that the defendant was \u201c[c]rouched down at the Coke machine\u201d at the time he was identified, and asked why he would have been crouched down \u201c[i]f this was a hug . . . .\u201d The judge interrupted the prosecutor\u2019s argument and admonished her for making this argument, which the judge believed the prosecutor had agreed not to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Evidence of a person\u2019s bad character is generally not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity with it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 86 (1975), quoting Fed. R. Evid. 404 (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specific acts of misbehavior may of course be relevant to an issue legitimately in the case (e.g., state of mind, intent, knowledge, modus operand!), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>evidence of such acts cannot be used for the purpose of establishing the defendant\u2019s bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>434 Mass. 805, 820 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>371 Mass. 803, 809-810 (1977). Consequently, it is improper for a prosecutor to offer evidence of bad character for the purpose of proving the Commonwealth\u2019s case, or to argue that a jury should consider the defendant\u2019s bad character as evidence that he committed the crime on which they will be deliberating. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 646 (1997), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The credibility of a witness, on the other hand, may be impeached by attacking his or her character, at least as it pertains to truthfulness. P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.10.1, at 309 (7th ed. 1999). Such impeachment can properly come only in the form of evidence of a witness\u2019s general reputation for truth and veracity, or by evidence of a witness\u2019s prior criminal convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 129 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 17 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to the latter, the jury are permitted \u201cto infer a readiness to lie from the witness\u2019s prior involvement in criminal activity.\u201d P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 6.10.2, at 314. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordeiro, </em>401 Mass. 843, 855 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>400 Mass. 296, 302-303 (1987) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s earlier disregard for the law may suggest to the fact finder similar disregard for the courtroom oath\u201d). The use of prior convictions for impeachment purposes must be done strictly in accordance with G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, and, of course, is generally done during cross-examination. A witness may, however, testify about his prior convictions for criminal conduct in direct examination in order to blunt the anticipated use of such evidence on cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blodgett, </em>377 Mass. 494, 502 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cadwell, </em>374 Mass. 308, 312 (1978). If he does so, however, opposing counsel is also free to examine him further on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In addition to impeachment by evidence of an untruthful character, a witness may also be impeached by evidence challenging his testimonial faculties (e.g., ability to perceive the events or remember them accurately), see <em>Morea </em>v. <em>Cosco, Inc., </em>422 Mass. 601, 604-605 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 273-274 (1990), and by evidence of a motive to prevaricate, even though such evidence reveals an otherwise inadmissible fact, such as the witness\u2019s criminal activity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>423 Mass. 17, 20-21 (1996). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>400 Mass. 508, 513 (1987). This case involves impeachment of the defendant\u2019s credibility by each of these means.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">If a prosecutor misuses impeachment evidence, either in the examination of a witness or in closing argument, we have long recognized that instructions from the trial judge may mitigate any prejudice to the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987) (\u201cimpact of an improper final argument has been mitigated by the judge\u2019s forceful instructions to the jury that the argument was inappropriate and should be disregarded\u201d). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 127-128 (1979) (prosecutor\u2019s misuse of prior convictions of defendant during cross-examination adequately cured by judge\u2019s instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We turn now to the claim of prosecutorial misconduct raised in this case. The evidence offered by the Commonwealth in its case-in-chief presents no controversy, and the questioning undertaken on cross-examination of the defendant was well within proper bounds. Questioning directed at impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility by eliciting evidence of his drinking and drug use during the hours preceding the assault was perfectly proper. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, supra </em>at 273-274, and cases cited (witness\u2019s use of drugs and alcohol at time of events was proper subject of cross-examination). Similarly, questioning regarding the defendant\u2019s probationary status was properly directed at eliciting an additional motive for him to misrepresent what had occurred. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316-318 (1974). With respect to the prosecutor\u2019s limited questioning of the defendant regarding his prior conviction of drug dealing, that was a subject opened up and made relevant by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>during his direct testimony, and it was received in evidence without limitation. It was therefore fair game for further examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>385 Mass. 165, 179 (1982) (once defendant introduces subject, he may be cross-examined on it even if questioning does not conform to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21). Indeed, all of these subjects were introduced in the case by the defendant as part of his own trial strategy. We perceive neither error nor abuse by the prosecutor in her conduct of the case prior to closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">With respect to her closing argument, if the prosecutor had argued that in assessing the credibility of the defendant the jury should consider (1) his character for untruthfulness as evidenced by his prior conviction; (2) his motive to lie based on his probationary status at the time of trial; and (3) his inability to perceive or recollect his conduct in light of his use of crack cocaine and alcohol throughout the day of the assault, her argument would have been well within proper legal bounds. Unfortunately, it was not. The argument was that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d as a dealer in crack cocaine and as a \u201cthief\u201d should be used by the jury in assessing his credibility. This was error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The argument also increased the risk, always present when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>jury learn of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, that the jury might improperly consider that same evidence of character in deciding the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMarzo, </em>364 Mass. 669, 679-680 (1974) (Hennessey, J., concurring) (\u201ccommon sense and experience have led trial judges and trial lawyers to conclude that jurors do in fact regard the prior convictions of the defendant in many cases as proof of guilt\u201d). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 38 (1986), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 1006 (1987), and 413 Mass. 252 (1992) (impeachment of defendant\u2019s credibility by prior convictions always subject to misconstruction by jury, who may regard impeachment as substantial evidence of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The judge astutely recognized the risk of prejudice in the prosecutor\u2019s argument, particularly with respect to the potential misuse of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of selling cocaine. She responded, sua sponte, by instructing the jury, immediately at the close of the prosecutor\u2019s closing, that it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d for the prosecutor to say that they could consider the defendant\u2019s character as a convicted drug dealer. The judge went on to tell the jury the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cYou may consider his prior conviction solely to help you determine whether or not he is a truthful witness. His character is not at issue here, whether he was in the past a crack dealer. He\u2019s not charged with dealing crack in this case. The sole question for you to decide is whether or not the Commonwealth has sustained its burden of proof with regard to the crime which he is charged with, and certainly you may assess his credibility. In that connection, you may consider that prior conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">This instruction was correct, pointed, and adequate to obviate the risk of harm created by the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s character as a drug dealer in her closing argument. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 127 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The judge gave no specific curative instruction with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>to the added characterization of the defendant as a \u201cthief.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 56The issue we must decide is whether this additional reference to character that adjoined the error corrected in the judge\u2019s instruction, constituted prejudicial error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cOnce a properly raised objection to a prosecutor\u2019s argument is found to be valid, the entire record . . . becomes relevant in determining whether the error was prejudicial to the point of requiring a reversal of the conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 523 (1987). After a review of the record in this case, including the care with which the judge empanelled the jury,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the significance of the error in the context of the evidence and the issues presented to the jury, the judge\u2019s instructions, and the inquiries from the jury during deliberations, we conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Whether the defendant \u201cstole\u201d the knife was completely ir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>relevant to the issues in the case, and the jury could not have concluded otherwise. The jury heard the undisputed evidence that the defendant had the knife when he was arrested, and that he took it from the Salvation Army at some point when he ate there. In the context of the defense, which emphasized that at the time of the alleged assault, the defendant had many \u201cflaws\u201d including being on probation for selling drugs, using crack cocaine (while on probation), drinking, and panhandling for a living, whether he was also a \u201cthief\u201d because he did not return a dinner knife, was innocuous. In addition, the judge clearly and forcefully instructed the jury to consider only the crime charged, and no other, on the question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and underscored that the defendant\u2019s character was not at issue. Lastly, although the trial was short, the jury deliberated over two days, asking four separate questions of the judge, including questions about the evidence, whether they could review a police report that had been mentioned but was not in evidence, whether they could review a transcript of a portion of the defendant\u2019s testimony, and about the judge\u2019s instruction regarding the elements of indecent assault and battery. These questions suggest that the jury engaged in a careful and thorough examination of the evidence, focused, as the judge directed, on the defendant\u2019s conduct on the day in question, and not on his character. In these circumstances, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s error could not possibly have made a difference in the jury\u2019s conclusion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>432 Mass. 404, 422-423 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The final issue raised regarding the prosecutor\u2019s closing involved her argument about the defendant\u2019s postassault conduct. The victim testified that when she identified the defendant, he was \u201ccrouching\u201d down near a Coca-Cola machine. Prior to closing arguments, defense counsel asked the judge to bar the prosecution from arguing that any of the defendant\u2019s actions evinced consciousness of guilt, because, in response to her discovery request, the Commonwealth had stated that it had no evidence of consciousness of guilt. The judge asked if the prosecutor was going to argue it, to which she responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cYour Honor, the Commonwealth is not asking for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>consciousness of guilt instruction. I\u2019m certainly not going to make an argument in the sense, I might ask the jury to draw on their common life experiences, but I\u2019m not going to make a specific argument that this is an indication of his guilt to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">In her closing, the prosecutor began to argue that the jury, using their life experience, could interpret the defendant\u2019s crouching as inconsistent with his claim that the contact between himself and the victim was a consensual hug. The judge interrupted at once, and said: \u201c[W]e talked about this particular argument, and you said that you were not going to argue this. So, you\u2019d better move on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The prosecutor moved on. No specific argument was ever made that the \u201ccrouching\u201d demonstrated the defendant was conscious of his guilt and no specific argument was ever made that such feelings on his part tended to show his actual guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>398 Mass. 535, 547-549 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 584-585 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The defendant made no objection and requested no instruction from the judge concerning the prosecutor\u2019s comments, which are reviewed only to ensure that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 517. There was no such risk. The prosecutor touched only tangentially on the inference of guilt and the jury, in any event, had heard the evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201ccrouching,\u201d first from the victim and then from the defendant himself, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 392-393 (1992), and were free to make whatever use of it that they thought it merited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The portrayal of the defendant as a drug and alcohol abuser, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>on probation for selling cocaine, was a self-portrait drawn for the purpose of framing a viable defense. Any missteps made by the prosecutor were admonished and adequately mitigated by a prudent and watchful judge who ensured that the defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\">rThe rationale for this rule is not that evidence indicative of bad character is irrelevant, but that \u201cparticularly in the setting of the jury trial, the dangers of prejudice, confusion and time-consumption outweigh the probative value.\u201d McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 190, at 659 (5th ed. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Rule 608 (b) of the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence would permit the impeachment of a witness\u2019s credibility through cross-examination regarding prior bad acts even if they have not led to criminal convictions. We have not yet adopted this rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-6\">It appears that the prosecutor may have explained to the judge, at the end of her argument, that her use of the word \u201ccharacter\u201d in the context of what the jury should consider in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility, came directly from the Instruction 2.07 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1995). That instruction (which was used by the judge in her charge) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cYou may consider a witness\u2019s character, his appearance and demeanor on the witness stand, his frankness or lack of frankness in testifying, whether his testimony is reasonable or unreasonable, probable or improbable. You may take into account how good an opportunity he had to observe the facts about which he testifies, the degree of intelligence he shows, whether his memory seems accurate. You may also consider his motive for testifying, whether he displays any bias in testifying, and whether or not he has any interest in the outcome of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The use of the word \u201ccharacter\u201d in this instruction, not limited to character for truthfulness, is unfortunate, and its pedigree is far from clear. It apparently derives from language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>390 Mass. 797, 802 (1984), but finds no specific support, or even mention, in other cases. Regardless of the merit of the argument that there is a difference between a jury\u2019s assessing the credibility of a defendant\u2019s testimony based on evidence of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>character for truthfulness (which is permissible), and a jury\u2019s use of that same evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant (which is not), the language in this instruction is inadequate to explain the subtleties or the difference, potentially confusing, and should be avoided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor committed misconduct by misstating the evidence when she argued that the defendant \u201cstole\u201d the knife. There was evidence from the defendant that he took the knife from the Salvation Army, and evidence from the victim from which the jury could have inferred that he was armed with it at the time of the assault. This is an adequate basis for the prosecutor\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">We cannot ascertain the extent of defense counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument on this point because the transcript of the sidebar conference at which the objection was made reflects that it was somewhat \u201cinaudible.\u201d Counsel clearly objected to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s testimony as admitting that he \u201cstole\u201d the knife, and we proceed on the assumption that that objection also encompassed the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the jury should consider the defendant\u2019s character as a \u201cthief\u201d in their assessment of his credibility. As preserved error, we review it to determine whether it was prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">We do not agree with the Appeals Court that the judge\u2019s focus on the drug distribution conviction in her corrective instruction could have been construed by the jury as an endorsement of the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defendant as a \u201cthief.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Daley, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 94 (2002). The role of drugs in the case became pronounced when the defendant took the stand, and the judge correctly perceived that the misuse of that evidence might be prejudicial and needed to be addressed specifically and pointedly. She also thoroughly and correctly instructed the jury regarding the role of closing argument, and what they should and should not consider in their deliberations. We do not assume that these instructions were ignored or not given equal weight with the instruction about the prior conviction. Taken together, they were adequate to ensure a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The judge conducted an individual voir dire of the jurors specifically with regard to their ability to be fair and impartial in deciding the case and in their assessment of the credibility of witnesses likely to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b589-10\">In light of our holding affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction, we deal briefly with two additional issues not addressed by the Appeals Court. First, the question posed by the couple who happened by at the time of the assault, \u201cAre you all right?,\u201d was not inadmissible hearsay because it was relevant and admissible for the nonhearsay purpose of explaining why the assault ended and the defendant fled. Second, defense counsel was not ineffective. None of the alleged omissions of counsel constitutes \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel . . . falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and the defendant was not deprived of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
