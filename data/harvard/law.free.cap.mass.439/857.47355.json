See generally <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>431 Mass. 251 (2000). This case requires us to determine whether the Department of Telecommunications and Energy (department) properly interpreted and applied a provision of the Restructuring Act, relative to the latter feature, directing it to define the exclusive \u201cservice territories\u201d for each electric distribution company. The context is an appeal by Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering (Olin) from an order of the department requiring it to receive electricity service from Boston Edison Company, doing business as NStar Electric (Edison), rather than from Wellesley Municipal Light Plant (Wellesley Municipal). We affirm the order of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>Edison is an investor-owned utility that since 1903 has provided electricity to the residents of the town of Needham, which adjoins the town of Wellesley. Wellesley Municipal is a municipal lighting plant that since 1892 has provided electricity to the residents of Wellesley and a small number of other customers outside the town. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 34; St. 1891, c. 370. Babson College (Babson) is an educational institution whose campus straddles the boundary between Wellesley and Needham, but is located primarily in Wellesley. Babson receives most of its electric service from Wellesley Municipal at a \u201cswitchgear\u201d\u2014 an electricity transfer point \u2014 located on the Wellesley side of the Babson campus. The electricity is then distributed on Babson-owned lines to its facilities in Wellesley and to some of its facilities on the Needham side of the campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In March, 2000, Olin purchased seventy acres of land from Babson, on which it intended to establish its campus. This parcel, which is divided into six lots, is located entirely within Needham. At the time of the acquisition by Olin, the facilities located on five of the lots received electric service from Edison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>(These lots are not at issue in this litigation.) Prior to its purchase by Olin, the sixth lot had been a parking lot (lot 2), illuminated by street lamps that Babson connected to its own internal electricity network emanating from the Wellesley switch gear. The lamps were removed before the lot was sold to Olin. The question presented in this litigation is whether Edison or Wellesley Municipal should provide electric service to the buildings currently being constructed on lot 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">On November 9, 2001, Olin filed a petition with the department requesting that it order Wellesley Municipal to provide electric service to lot 2. Although not conceding that it was located in Edison\u2019s service territory, Olin did acknowledge that its location in Needham might make the issue of its proper service provider a contested one, and so requested that the department foreclose any legal dispute by either (a) ruling pursuant to 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.08 (1993)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that lot 2 should receive electricity from Wellesley Municipal; or (b) ordering Wellesley Municipal, pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 47A (d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to provide power to lot 2. As reasons for its request, Olin listed reduced cost, greater reliability of service, reduced disruption of public ways and property, and its prospective partnership with Babson in certain endeavors. The department permitted Edison and Wellesley Municipal to intervene in the proceedings. Edison claimed that because Olin was located entirely within Needham, Olin must be served by Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">After hearings on the matter, the department issued an order on October 24, 2002, finding that Needham is within Edison\u2019s exclusive service territory; Olin\u2019s campus, including lot 2, is within Needham; and all of Olin\u2019s electricity consumption occurs in Needham. Consequently, it concluded that Olin was within Edison\u2019s \u201cservice territory\u201d as provided in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB (a), and Edison was to be Olin\u2019s distribution company. The department also declined to exercise what it viewed as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>limited discretion to depart from the legislative policy of defining service territories along municipal boundaries where that is possible without giving rise to anomalies.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Olin appealed the department\u2019s order pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and a single justice of this court stayed the order and reserved and reported the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Historically, municipalities have been served by a single electric utility, such as Edison in Needham and Wellesley Municipal in Wellesley. This practice was almost completely uniform throughout the Commonwealth, with only eleven of 351 cities and towns generally served by more than one provider.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Consistent with the historical congruence of service territories and municipal boundaries, the Restructuring Act directed the department to \u201cdefine\u201d service territories for each distribution company \u201cfollowing to the extent possible municipal boundaries.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB <em>(\u00e1).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> A </em>\u201c[sjervice territory\u201d is further defined as \u201cthe geographic area in which a distribution company provided distribution service on July 1, 1997.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 1, IB <em>(a). </em>Once defined by the department, these service territories are to be exclusive, and each distribution company assumes an obligation to provide service to all customers within its assigned territories. G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Before the department, Olin and Wellesley Municipal argued, as they do on appeal, that lot 2 is a \u201cgeographic area\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1, and that on July 1, 1997, it was actually receiving electricity from Wellesley Municipal through Babson\u2019s internal system. Therefore, it was and should remain part of Wellesley Municipal\u2019s \u201cservice territory\u201d as provided in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB <em>(a). </em>The department disagreed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Quoting its Report to the General Court Pursuant to Section 312 of the Electric Restructuring Act at 37 (2000), it held that a service territory \u201cencompass[es] the <em>municipality </em>in which a distribution company is operating, versus the <em>physical area </em>reached by the lines of that utility\u201d (emphasis added). Because Edison actually served Needham on July 1, 1997, customers located within Needham were in Edison\u2019s exclusive service territory, with exceptions only for customers whose property straddled municipal boundaries,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> such as Babson, and for other anomalies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because lot 2 was no longer owned by a straddling customer, and the \u201cstructures that received service from [Wellesley Municipal] through Babson on July 1, 1997,\u201d were removed, it became possible \u201cto conform the service territory boundary to the municipal boundary in this case without an anomalous result.\u201d Hence, the department concluded that lot 2 was within Edison\u2019s exclusive service territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">We afford substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering. <em>City Council of Agawam </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>437 Mass. 821, 828 (2002). While G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 1, does not further define the term \u201cgeographic area\u201d as it is used in the definition of a \u201cservice territory\u201d (a \u201cgeographic area in which a distribution company\u201d operates), it does express a clear legislative policy favoring municipally defined service territories. The department\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cservice territory\u201d to encompass the entire municipality in which a distribution company operates, and not just the physical area reached by the lines then existent in that municipality, is consistent with that policy. <em>City Council of Agawam </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number><em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We see no reason to set it aside.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor do we see any reason to upset its conclusion that once an anomaly (such as a straddling customer) is eliminated, the affected property ought to be served by the distribution company within whose service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>territory it resides in the absence of significant disruption or other extraordinary circumstances. The facts here present no such circumstances. The only facilities previously served by Wellesley Municipal were street lamps, and they were removed before Olin bought the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Olin next claims that, even if G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB (a), places it in Edison\u2019s service territory, the department retains the discretion to reassign it based on policy considerations, and that in this case the department abused its discretion by refusing to make findings or consider Olin\u2019s policy arguments \u2014 such as cost and service reliability \u2014 for remaining in Wellesley Municipal\u2019s service territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In proceedings undertaken soon after the enactment of the Restructuring Act, the department had ruled that it could deviate from municipal boundaries in assigning customers to electric utilities \u201cif facts and fairness so warrant.\u201d Massachusetts Elec. Co., D.T.E. 98-122, at 7 (2002). In its October 24 order, the department noted that, while \u201cprior precedent may remain instructive,\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB (a), substantially narrowed the department\u2019s authority to consider such factors because of the mandate, now statutory, to conform service territories to municipal boundaries wherever possible. As a consequence, it gave only cursory attention to Olin\u2019s \u201cfacts and fairness\u201d policy arguments, finding that none of them warranted a \u201cDepartment-authorized departure from [Edison\u2019s] defined service territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The fact that service territories are to be defined with reference to municipal boundaries does not mean that the Restructuring Act forecloses any deviation from those boundaries. Indeed, the fact that \u00a7 IB <em>(a) </em>directs that municipal boundaries be followed only \u201cto the extent possible\u201d stands, at least in part, as legislative recognition that uniquely situated customers or areas may require individualized accommodation. We see no legislative intention, for example, to overrule the department\u2019s practice of permitting a straddling customer more flexibility in selecting the provider from which it is to receive electric service, or that an area such as Cartwright Road, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>must be served by the provider for the service territory in which it is located regardless of the harm to the environment or the extraordinary expense that would be incurred. Consequently, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>conclude that the department retains discretion to recognize individual exceptions to the municipal boundary rule under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB. While we need not define the precise contours of that discretion in this case, the department\u2019s conclusion that such discretion does not extend to customers such as Olin, who seek principally to get a better deal on their electric rate from a provider across the border, is a reasonable one. The pressure on the department from customers anxious to get relief on that basis would threaten to recreate the very \u201cpatchwork quilt\u201d of electric service providers that G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 IB, was intended to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">While the department must give some consideration to an applicant\u2019s reasons for its service request, a finding that the reasons are not of the type or the gravity that would warrant the exercise of such discretion was an adequate response in this case. The department\u2019s rejection of Olin\u2019s request on that basis did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The order of the department is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Title 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.08 (1993) allows the department to issue an advisory ruling applying a statute to a petitioning party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 47, gives the department power in circumstances not present here to authorize a municipal light plant to provide service to customers in an adjoining municipality. General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 47A (&lt;f), gives a municipal light plant the authority to provide service to an adjoining municipality if the department so orders pursuant to \u00a7 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b880-9\">According to the department, of the 351 cities and towns in the Commonwealth, only Bellingham, Cheshire, Dighton, Erving, Hancock, Lakeville, Lenox, Pembroke, Russell, Scituate, and Westport are generally served by more than one provider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b880-10\">A \u201cdistribution company\u201d is that arm of a utility responsible for transmitting electricity from a generation facility or power grid to the end consumer. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Boston Edison </em>Co., 431 Mass. 251, 253-255 (2000). For purposes of this case we use the term interchangeably with \u201cservice provider\u201d or \u201celectricity provider.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b881-6\">With respect to customers whose property straddled municipal boundaries, it was the department\u2019s practice that they could select their utility provider. See Massachusetts Elec. Co., D.T.E. 98-122, at 8 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The Cartwright Road area of Needham, discussed at some length before the department and in the parties\u2019 briefs, is a good example of a geographic anomaly. Prior to the Restructuring Act, the department had initiated an investigation (D.P.U. 86-45, 86-144 [1987]), and concluded that this area ought to be served by Wellesley Municipal rather than Edison because it was physically separated from the rest of Needham by wetlands. D.P.U. 86-45, 86-144 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Wellesley Municipal makes much of the fact that the department\u2019s position in this litigation \u2014 that a \u201cservice territory\u201d equates with a municipal boundary \u2014 is apparently contrary to a remark it made in D.P.U. 86-45, 86-144 at 8 (1987), its 1987 decision regarding Cartwright Road, in which it stated that, because Wellesley Municipal had historically served the Cartwright Road area, that area was \u201cwithin [Wellesley Municipal\u2019s] authorized service territory.\u201d Wellesley Municipal contends that because the department\u2019s current interpretation of \u201cservice territory\u201d conflicts with that term\u2019s previous definition, the department\u2019s current ruling should be reversed. There are three problems with this argument. The first is the Restructuring Act, which was enacted ten years after the Cartwright Road decision. The second is that the department\u2019s use of the term \u201cservice territory\u201d in its 1987 opinion was not precise; it referred to the Cartwright Road area as also being within Edison\u2019s \u201cservice territory\u201d because the area was located in Needham. The dual use of the phrase is consistent with its current interpretation. Further, the Cartwright Road area comprised an entire neighborhood, not the single lot at issue here, and the decision did not unequivocally establish that the definition of \u201cservice territory\u201d could include one lot. Third, even if the department\u2019s interpretation in this case is inconsistent with its previous ruling, such a contradiction does not render the more recent interpretation invalid. While \u201c[significance in interpretation may be given to a consistent, long continued administrative application of an ambiguous statute\u201d (emphasis in original), <em>Connery </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>414 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1993), quoting <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343 (1964), the meaning the department apparently gives to a phrase in a single case is not established automatically as its meaning in all future cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">As a practical matter, the use of municipal boundaries also reduces the uncertainty surrounding lots that are not currently receiving electric service. If service territories were defined on a lot-by-lot basis, an unused lot would not have been \u201cactually served\u201d by any distribution company on July 1, 1997, and thus would not be part of any service territory until the department assigned it to one. Olin\u2019s argument that a municipally based rule will increase confusion because every time a straddling lot is subdivided into smaller lots that do not cross municipal borders some lots may be ordered to receive power from a new distribution company, is overstated. First, the phenomenon of straddling customers balkanizing into sublots should not be so prevalent that mass confusion regarding electric service ensues. Second, while the demise of a straddling customer may cause some lots to change providers, the identity of those providers will be known beforehand, so that while change may occur, confusion need not accompany it. Finally, the department, as always, retains the discretion to assign a customer to a provider different from the one serving its service territory should the cost of switching service or the resulting network be prohibitively expensive, unsafe, or otherwise unwise.
