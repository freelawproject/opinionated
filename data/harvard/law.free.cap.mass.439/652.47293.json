The Appeals Court reversed an order granting summary judgment entered in the Superior Court that had dismissed claims that USF&amp;G and another insurer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had engaged in unfair settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, in connection with a lawsuit brought by the plaintiff for personal injuries after he slipped and fell while crossing a street in Somerville. See <em>Bobick </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 9 (2003). We agree with the decision of the judge that the summary judgment record demonstrates that USF&amp;G acted lawfully in all challenged respects. Accordingly, we now affirm the judgment in favor of USF&amp;G.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *SWe also conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the complaint to assert a loss of consortium claim was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">The factual background of this case may be summarized as follows. The plaintiff, a mildly retarded individual, was about sixty years old at the time of the accident that gave rise to this litigation. For approximately three weeks a month, the plaintiff resided with his sister, Pauline Graustein. One week per month, the plaintiff stayed at the Walnut Street Center (Walnut), a facil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ity for rehabilitation and training of learning disabled individuals in Somerville. During this time, the plaintiff was employed in a sheltered workshop operated by Walnut and was transported to and from the workshop in a van by Park Transportation Co., Inc. (Park).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">It was the responsibility of the operator of Park\u2019s van to ensure that passengers in the van, all developmentally disabled individuals, were met by someone at their destination. On January 15, 1993, the plaintiff apparently was left unattended after Park had transported him to Walnut. He crossed Highland Avenue, a busy main street in Somerville, to go to a convenience store and, as he approached the store, he slipped and fell on an icy embankment. This fall resulted in a displaced fracture at the head of the plaintiff\u2019s right femur. The plaintiff did not completely recover from his injuries, and, at the time of the judge\u2019s memorandum and order granting summary judgment and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim against USF&amp;G, he walked with the aid of a walker. Medical bills for the plaintiff\u2019s care totaled in excess of $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The procedural history of this case is complicated. We relate only those prior proceedings relevant to our decision. On October 25, 1994, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court, asserting claims of negligence against Park and Walnut, and G. L. c. 93A violations against USF&amp;G (Park\u2019s insurer) and Continental<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Walnut\u2019s insurer). The latter were premised on the alleged failures of each insurance company to make a reasonable offer of settlement when liability was clear, as required by G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) <em>(f), </em>the statute defining unfair or deceptive acts in the business of insurance, and were stayed pending the outcome of the underlying tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to amend his complaint to add, among other matters, a loss of consortium claim on behalf of his sister. A judge in the Superior Court denied the motion \u201cinsofar as it seeks to add Pauline Graustein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>as a plaintiff .... [T]here is no viable claim for [loss] of consortium on the part of a sister.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Following a trial on the plaintiff\u2019s tort claims, a jury found for the plaintiff and apportioned liability in the following manner: Park, forty per cent; Walnut, twenty per cent; Rebecca Pontius,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> twenty per cent; and the plaintiff (comparative negligence), twenty per cent. The jury awarded the plaintiff damages in the amount of $150,000, which were reduced by the twenty per cent assigned to his negligence, resulting in a total award of $120,000. An amended judgment entered for $120,000 (plus interest and costs). The plaintiff, Walnut, Pontius, and Park subsequently filed a motion for a separate and final judgment on the underlying tort claims, and their motion was allowed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On July 29, 1996, the plaintiff, and defendants Walnut, Pontius, and Park, filed a written waiver of appeal, in which they \u201cwaive[d] their rights of appeal of the within case, execution to issue immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The underlying tort claims having been resolved, the remaining parties in the case, the plaintiff, USF&amp;G, and Continental, filed motions for summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93A claims. In her written memorandum of decision, the judge concluded, essentially, that the summary judgment record (to be summarized later in this opinion) was devoid of evidence that either USF&amp;G or Continental had engaged in unfair claim settlement practices. Accordingly, the judge allowed both insurers\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and judgment subsequently entered on the G. L. c. 93A claims in favor of USF&amp;G and Continental. The plaintiff appealed, challenging the resolution of the summary judgment motions as well as the denial of his earlier motion to amend his complaint in order to pursue a loss of consortium claim on behalf of Graustein.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The Appeals Court affirmed the denial of the motion to amend, reversed the entry of summary judgment in favor of USF&amp;G and Continental, and remanded the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings. See <em>Bobick </em>v. <em>United States Fid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>&amp; Guar. Co., supra. </em>We turn first to the primary issue on appeal, whether judgment properly entered pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974), dismissing the G. L. c. 93A action against USF&amp;G.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">1. No disputes of material fact appear in the summary judgment record, which we now summarize. USF&amp;G received its first notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel dated May 16, 1994. The letter alleged that Park was at fault in connection with the injuries incurred by the plaintiff on January 15, 1993,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and provided a doctor\u2019s report, hospital records, and medical and hospital bills totaling approximately $83,000, as well as a report of an investigation conducted by the disabled persons protective commission, pursuant to G. L. c. 19C, \u00a7 5 (DPPC report). The DPPC report concluded that, although there were \u201cnumerous and conflicting accounts\u201d of the events that took place on the date of the injury, Park had been \u201cremiss\u201d in its responsibilities to ensure that the plaintiff entered Walnut safely after leaving the van.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, that letter incorporated a demand for settlement (that had been made to Continental as well) for $747,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">USF&amp;G made no offer in response to this letter. According to an affidavit of Deborah A. Duncan, the USF&amp;G senior claims representative assigned to the case, Park\u2019s insurance policy with USF&amp;G was for automobile coverage, and USF&amp;G initially took the position that the claim was not an \u201cauto\u201d risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">USF&amp;G received a letter, dated August 23, 1994, from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, sent pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, demanding payment of its full policy amount, $250,000. USF&amp;G initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>an investigation into the plaintiff\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This investigation included recording an interview with Park\u2019s van driver, who stated that, on the day of the plaintiff\u2019s accident, when no Walnut staff had appeared after she sounded the horn, she had escorted the plaintiff to the front door of the house, watched him enter, and then closed the door. The driver informed Duncan that she then got back in her van and waited to make sure that the plaintiff did not come back out.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In its original response to the G. L. c. 93A demand letter, on September 16, 1994, USF&amp;G declined to offer a settlement because, in its opinion, liability was not \u201creasonably certain\u201d at that time. USF&amp;G further informed the plaintiff that \u201c[o]ur investigation to date, which continues, of the circumstances surrounding this loss has revealed that the control of [the plaintiff] had been passed on to the personnel of [Walnut] by [Park] prior to his injury .... Upon the delivery and discharge of [the plaintiff] he then became the responsibility of [Walnut].\u201d USF&amp;G also repeated its position that the plaintiff had not received his injury \u201cwhile in transport, delivery or disembarking [its] insured\u2019s vehicle\u201d and stated that \u201cwe continue to investigate this case. When and if additional facts should be discovered linking our insured more closely to the cause of the [plaintiff\u2019s] injury our position regarding settlement will be reevaluated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On October 17, 1994, the plaintiff extended to October 21 the thirty-day response period allowed by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3), and, the next day, USF&amp;G extended to the plaintiff a settlement offer of $50,000. Duncan\u2019s deposition testimony indicates that this offer reflected USF&amp;G\u2019s assessment of its share of the settlement offer, which USF&amp;G had valued at $170,000 or $180,000. The plaintiff rejected this offer and immediately initiated litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Three months after suit was filed, USF&amp;G prepared a case assessment report estimating the total damages of the plaintiff\u2019s case, including incremental cost of future custodial care, to be $190,000. In addition, the report estimated chances of a verdict in USF&amp;G\u2019s favor to be zero to twenty per cent. The report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>indicated that the outcome of the case rested on the fact finder\u2019s assessment of the credibility of Park\u2019s van driver, who had been required to turn the plaintiff over to the actual physical custody of a Walnut staff member before leaving. The report recommended against an immediate settlement offer and pointed to the \u201cneed to determine negligent employees of [Walnut] so as to add them as co-defendants and avoid the charitable immunity defense<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> before [Continental] will take the case seriously.\u201d The report recommended mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Subsequent mediation efforts between the plaintiff, USF&amp;G, and Continental, however, were unsuccessful. An offer of $200,000 extended to the plaintiff during mediation was rejected.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We set forth the applicable law. General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a), states that \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3, in turn, prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of insurance,\u201d including, in subsection (9) (/), the failure \u201cto effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d We have stated that \u201cthe former statute incorporates the latter, and [accordingly] an insurer that has violated G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) (/), by failing to \u2018effectu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear,\u2019 by definition, has violated the prohibition in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, against the commission of unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 564 (2001). Together, the statutes require an insurer, such as USF&amp;G, \u201cpromptly to put a fair and reasonable offer on the table when liability and damages become clear, either within the thirty-day period set forth in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3), or as soon thereafter as liability and damages make themselves apparent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566. The standard for examining the adequacy of an insurer\u2019s response to a demand for relief under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3) is \u201cwhether, in the circumstances, and in light of the complainant\u2019s demands, the offer is reasonable.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 420 (1997), quoting <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Ctr., Inc., </em>392 Mass. 228, 234 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim against USF&amp;G rests on the two-fold premise that (1) Park\u2019s liability was reasonably clear on August 23, 1994, when the plaintiff\u2019s demand pursuant to G. L. c. 93A was sent to USF&amp;G, and (2) the $50,000 offer of settlement USF&amp;G extended in response to that demand was neither fair nor equitable. Although these matters ordinarily are appropriately determined by a fact finder, there is no reason why the question whether an insurer has fulfilled its duties under G. L. c. 176D may not be settled in favor of an insurer on a motion pursuant to rule 56, in circumstances when undisputed material facts in the record demonstrate that the plaintiff has \u201cno reasonable expectation of proving an essential element\u201d of his case. <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). See <em>Van Dyke </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 671, 678 (1983). Such circumstances are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">USF&amp;G was not required to put a fair and reasonable offer on the table until liability and damages were apparent. See <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 566; <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra </em>at 418. The record leaves no doubt that, from the time the initial claim was presented to USF&amp;G on May 16, 1994, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>USF&amp;G\u2019s offer of settlement on October 17, 1994,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there existed a legitimate difference of opinion as to the extent of Park\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The DPPC report had revealed the presence of differing accounts of events leading up the accident and suggested that Walnut, as well as Park, shared responsibility for failing to ensure the plaintiff\u2019s safety. According to deposition testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the DPPC report was the sole evidence supporting the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of fault on Park\u2019s part.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> USF&amp;G\u2019s initial investigation revealed evidence that the driver of Park\u2019s van had not left the plaintiff on the sidewalk, but had physically escorted the plaintiff into the home before leaving the scene. Although USF&amp;G\u2019s case assessment report, dated January 27, 1995, acknowledged Park\u2019s probable fault in the incident, the report also indicated a concern that Walnut employees should share the burden of liability. Indeed, the plaintiff was of the view that Walnut was also liable and sent Continental a demand letter claiming that Walnut\u2019s liability also was reasonably clear. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the record thus demonstrates that, although fault on the part of Park may have been ascertained by August 23, 1994, the percentage of damages attributable to USF&amp;G and to Continental was still the subject of good faith disagreement. We conclude that the extent of USF&amp;G\u2019s liability to the plaintiff cannot, as matter of law, have been clear at that time. See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra. </em>This conclusion is evidenced by the jury\u2019s verdict in April, 1996, which divided liability between Park, Walnut, a Walnut employee, and the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Regardless whether liability was clear, on October 18, 1994, an offer of $50,000 was extended by USF&amp;G and rejected by the plaintiff. Had this matter proceeded to trial, the burden would have been on USF&amp;G to prove that $50,000 was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>reasonable offer in the circumstances and in light of the plaintiff\u2019s demands. See <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 568-569; <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 795, 799 (1976). We do not accept the Appeals Court\u2019s suggestion that USF&amp;G was required to meet this burden at trial with evidence of insurance industry practices in similar circumstances and expert testimony. See <em>Bobick </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 8 (2003). See also <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Ins. Co., </em>895 F.2d 830, 837 (1st Cir. 1990) (\u201cThat [reasonableness] is <em>ordinarily </em>a fact question does not make it <em>invariably </em>a fact question\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We emphasize two factors. First, USF&amp;G\u2019s own evaluation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as of the fall of 1994, taking into consideration the plaintiff\u2019s documented medical expenses of approximately $83,000, was $170,000 to $180,000. This amount is higher than the total damage award accorded the plaintiff by the jury, and even the plaintiff does not now contend that USF&amp;G\u2019s estimation was low. USF&amp;G was allowed to discount this amount to reflect the potential liability of Walnut employees, who were insured by Continental and fully solvent. We reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the doctrine of joint liability, which allows an injured plaintiff to proceed against, and recover damages from, any or all joint tortfeasors, operates in these circumstances. The statutes at issue were enacted to encourage the settlement of insurance claims and to discourage insurers from forcing claimants into unnecessary litigation to obtain relief, see <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra </em>at 419, but do not require an insurer to settle not only its own, but another solvent tortfeasor\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are aware of no authority that supports the plaintiff\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Second, the reasonableness of an insurer\u2019s response is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>considered in the light of the situation as a whole. \u201cNegotiating a settlement, particularly when the damages are unliquidated is, to an extent, a legitimate bargaining process. The statute [G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9)] does not call for [a] defendant\u2019s final offer, but only one within the scope of reasonableness. Experienced negotiators do not make their final offer first off, and experienced negotiators do not expect it, or take seriously a representation that it is.\u201d <em>Forcucci </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>11 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1993). It is particularly significant that the offer extended by USF&amp;G (and rejected by the plaintiff) was only $10,000 less than the principal amount assessed by the jury against USF&amp;G.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To be sure, a jury\u2019s verdict is not always predictable and may not constitute in all circumstances a definitive measure of reasonableness. Nevertheless, in circumstances, as here, when an offer timely extended is not substantially less than the amount ultimately determined by a jury to be the proper measure of damages, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, a thoughtful fact finder could reach but one conclusion, that the offer in question was reasonable. We conclude that the $50,000 offered to the plaintiff by USF&amp;G was a reasonable offer as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We make final observations to clarify a subject of apparent confusion. Neither G. L. c. 176D nor G. L. c. 93A, of course, required USF&amp;G to accede to the plaintiff\u2019s demand of $250,000, made in his G. L. c. 93A letter. Even excessive demands on the part of a claimant, however, do not relieve an insurer of its statutory duty to extend a prompt and equitable offer of settlement once liability and damages are reasonably clear. They may be considered as part of the over-all circumstances affecting the amount that would qualify as a reasonable offer in response, but the underlying duty to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement remains unaltered.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The judge\u2019s written memorandum and order on the motions for summary judgment indicates that her decision was based, in part, on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to demonstrate that he would have been willing to accept a reasonable settlement offer at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>before trial. This is incorrect. We rejected a similar argument in <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 567 (2001), decided after the entry of summary judgment in this case, in circumstances when no settlement offer was forthcoming. Cf. <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Choukas, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 200 (1999), overruled on other grounds, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>438 Mass. 529, 533 n.7 (2003). In the <em>Hopkins </em>case, we noted that \u201cquantifying the damages for the injury incurred by the plaintiff as a result of [an insurer\u2019s] failure under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3 (9) <em>(f), </em>does not turn on whether the plaintiff can show that [he] would have taken advantage of an earlier settlement opportunity. The so-called causation factor entitles a plaintiff ... to recover interest on the loss of use of money that should have been, but was not, offered .... It is this amount of money that has been wrongfully withheld from the plaintiff, and it is this sum on which the defendant must pay interest to remedy its wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, supra </em>at 419, quoting <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>418 Mass. 41, 48 (1994) (\u201cThis is precisely the type of damage we have described as appropriate[] ... in an action . . . under [G. L.] c. 93A\u201d). The plaintiff can demonstrate no injury in this case, not because he cannot prove that a higher offer would have been accepted if made, but because there was no wrongful refusal on USF&amp;G\u2019s part to extend a fair and reasonable settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">2. The relevant portion of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the complaint to add a loss of consortium claim had been denied well before judgment entered on the plaintiff\u2019s tort claims against Walnut, Pontius, and Park. A joint motion for entry of separate and final judgment was allowed on August 1, 1996. The waiver filed at that time by the parties with respect to \u201ctheir rights of appeal of the within case\u201d allowed for immediate execution on the judgment. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s right to appeal from the denial of his motion to amend may have been waived.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Putting aside the waiver issue, the judge properly denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>motion. In view of the status of the law with respect to consortium claims, the plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment would have been futile. See <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>409 Mass. 256, 264-265 (1991). We have never recognized the right of a sibling to bring a loss of consortium claim and, in fact, have repeatedly rejected attempts to extend such claims past an actual spouse or parent-child relationship. See, e.g., <em>Mendoza </em>v. <em>B.L.H. Elecs., </em>403 Mass. 437, 438 (1988) (stepson); <em>Feliciano </em>v. <em>Rosemar Silver Co., </em>401 Mass. 141, 142 (1987) (de facto spouse).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The loss of filial consortium statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85X, inserted by St. 1989, c. 259, \u00a7 1, authorizes loss of consortium claims by \u201cparents of a minor child or an adult child who is dependent on his parents for support,\u201d and its explicit language does not extend to claims by siblings. See <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 579 (1991) (loss of filial consortium statute is \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">3. We affirm that part of the judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim against USF&amp;G. The judgment against Continental will be the judgment directed by the Appeals Court.

Continental Insurance Company is an insurance company under the service mark of CNA, but it is not a party to the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-15\">SCNA filed no application for further appellate review. We thus leave undisturbed that part of the rescript of the Appeals Court reversing the summary judgment that had dismissed the case against Continental and remanding the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings. See <em>Bobick </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 1,9 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The original complaint named only Continental Loss Adjusting Services, Inc., but later was amended to add CNA as a codefendant. Inexplicably, the plaintiff\u2019s original complaint and amended complaints are included in neither the record appendix nor the supplemental record appendix. Because there appears to be no dispute as to their contents, we merely note their absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Rebecca Pontius, a Walnut employee, was impleaded by Park as a third-party defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The record does not indicate, however, that a separate and final judgment ever entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In the letter, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel alleged: \u201cWhen dropping clients off, the transportation company [Park] is required to wait until a staff member of [Walnut] comes to the van to escort the client into [Walnut]. If a staff member does not appear, the driver is required to call to let [Walnut] know of the client\u2019s arrival and wait until a staff member appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">\u201cThese rules were not followed on January 15, 1993. [The plaintiff] was dropped off unattended and the driver of the van simply lef[t].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b676-10\">This document properly was excluded from the evidence at trial as inadmissible hearsay. We refer to it, nonetheless, because the prohibition against hearsay would not render the document inadmissible if offered by the plaintiff in the G. L. c. 93A claim, not for its truth, but to demonstrate the extent of USF&amp;G\u2019s awareness of its potential liability in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The plaintiff has introduced no evidence that USF&amp;G\u2019s investigation was inadequate in any respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\">It appears that Walnut may be protected by the charitable cap of $20,000 imposed by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K, on damages recoverable from a charitable corporation for a tort committed in the course of the performance of its charitable purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s attempt to characterize this offer as a privileged communication under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 23C, is unavailing. That the offer of $200,000 was extended (presumably, jointly by USF&amp;G and Continental) and rejected is undisputed and is relevant to demonstrate USF&amp;G\u2019s continuing attempt to settle the plaintiff\u2019s claim and thus relieve the plaintiff of his burden to litigate. In our view, by accusing USF&amp;G of failing to make a reasonable settlement offer, the plaintiff implicitly has waived the privilege, at least with respect to the issue whether such an offer indeed was made. See <em>Darius </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>433 Mass. 274, 277-278 (2001), and cases cited (accepting principle that litigant may implicitly waive attorney-client privilege by injecting certain claims or defenses into case). Moreover, as noted by the judge who allowed summary judgment in favor of USF&amp;G, if the plaintiff\u2019s position were deemed correct, there could be no evidence in cases involving alleged misfeasance by a mediator or breach of settlement agreements achieved during the mediation process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We note that, although this date was beyond the thirty-day period allowed by G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3), the time period had been extended by the plaintiff, and, thus, the offer was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">At the time, USF&amp;G also questioned whether any liability would be covered under the automobile policy, but, in its summary judgment motion, USF&amp;G did not rely on coverage issues as a basis for finding that its settlement offers were reasonable. We therefore do not address issues of coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel testified that, although he was aware at the time that the DPPC report would be inadmissible at trial, he conducted no independent investigation into the matter on behalf of the plaintiff at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The situation would be different in circumstances where a plaintiff\u2019s potential recovery against other tortfeasors was barred by reason of insolvency, limited by a statutory cap on damages, or remote, due to a weak theory of liability, or a paucity of facts pertaining to liability. Although USF&amp;G may have suspected, at the time the offer was made, that the plaintiff\u2019s potential recovery against Walnut could be limited by the charitable cap of $20,000 set forth in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85K, USF&amp;G would have been aware that Walnut\u2019s employees, also insured by Continental, were not protected by the cap. See <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 63-64 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">USF&amp;G ultimately paid approximately $75,000 (including interest and costs) as its share of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. At the time of USF&amp;G\u2019s offer, neither interest nor costs had begun to accrue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">We use the words \u201cmay have been waived\u201d because the loss of consortium claim belonged to the plaintiff\u2019s sister, not to the plaintiff, and, thus, his waiver may not have been operative as to her claim. No one argues this precise point, so we merely note it and dispose of the asserted claim on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The decision of <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 270 (1986), in which the Appeals Court allowed a loss of consortium claim brought by a handicapped adult who was \u201cphysically, emotionally and financially\u201d dependent on an injured parent, is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
