Brittle now seeks back pay for the forty-month period preceding his plea of guilty during which he was suspended without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No law requires that result. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court denying Brittle all compensation lost during his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the undisputed material facts, paying particular attention to those recited by the Federal prosecutor at Brittle\u2019s plea colloquy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beginning at least as early as 1992, Brittle, while serving as a Boston police officer, was an active participant in an international heroin smuggling ring, traveling to Asia to import heroin into the United States, recruiting other couriers and assisting in the planning of other smuggling trips. L\u00e1veme Cotton was the ring leader. In mid-1992, Brittle and Cotton had a falling-out: the two had \u201ca physical confrontation,\u201d and Cotton obtained a protective order against Brittle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 209A. Brittle then took a \u201chiatus\u201d from Cotton\u2019s drug smuggling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In May, 1994, Brittle resumed his illegal activities as a courier for Cotton, traveling to Asia to acquire large amounts of heroin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Brittle and Cotton had another falling-out: Brittle \u201cbarreled his way\u201d into Cotton\u2019s house, the two had \u201ca physical confrontation,\u201d and Cotton obtained a second protective order against Brittle. The physical confrontation followed a \u201cstrong dispute\u201d that commenced earlier in the day when Brittle delivered a suitcase of heroin to Cotton. Over the following days, Brittle made threatening telephone calls to Cotton, demanding payment for his most recent smuggling trip and threatening to inform the Dmg Enforcement Agency of Cotton\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>operation unless she paid him for the heroin delivery. In response, Cotton sought charges against Brittle and, on July 8, 1994, a grand jury indicted Brittle on two charges: stalking, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43, and threatening to commit an assault and battery, G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Brittle was immediately suspended from his duties as a police officer; the police commissioner of Boston notified Brittle of his suspension on July 13, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">While the Commonwealth\u2019s indictments against Brittle were pending, Cotton and Brittle\u2019s illegal drug activities were under investigation by Federal law enforcement officials. A Federal grand jury were convened, and on June 13, 1996, Brittle and thirteen others were indicted by the grand jury on numerous drug-related charges involving conspiracy, importation of heroin, and possession of heroin with intent to distribute. At the time of the 1996 Federal indictment, Brittle remained suspended from his duties as a Boston police officer, and the Commonwealth\u2019s indictment against Brittle for threatening to commit an assault and battery on Cotton was still pending.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">On November 19, 1996, while the Federal case was proceeding toward trial, the Commonwealth sought and obtained an order of nolle prosequi of its pending indictments against Brittle. The assistant district attorney explained the reason for seeking the nolle prosequi: the State and Federal charges were \u201cdirectly related,\u201d Cotton was to be called as a witness in the Federal trial against Brittle, and if the State charge proceeded to trial as scheduled, Cotton would be required to testify about \u201cthe same issues.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time, Brittle did not ask the city to remove his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>suspension, he did not claim that he was entitled to receive back pay or benefits, and he did not attempt to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">On November 5, 1997, Brittle pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to all of the Federal charges. At Brittle\u2019s plea colloquy, the assistant United States attorney recited Brittle\u2019s activities in the Cotton drug-smuggling conspiracy, recited Cotton\u2019s activities, and explicitly referred to the earlier State charges triggered by the falling out between Brittle and Cotton over the payment for heroin. Immediately after his change of plea, Brittle submitted his resignation to the Boston police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In April, 1998, Brittle filed this action, seeking compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25.* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court allowed the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that, although G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, did not explicitly address circumstances where, as here, multiple indictments had been brought against a suspended employee, it would be inconsistent with the statute\u2019s underlying intent to award Brittle compensation. A divided panel of the Appeals Court reversed, concluding that this case was controlled by our decision in <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>412 Mass. 1010 (1992). <em>Brittle </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 820 (2002). It awarded Brittle back pay from the date that he was suspended, July 13, 1994, to the date that he was indicted on the Federal charges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>June 13, 1996.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We granted the city\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Brittle contends that he is entitled to back pay for the entire period of his suspension because the State indictments, which initially triggered his suspension, terminated \u201cwithout a finding or verdict of guilty.\u201d G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25. Although Brittle did plead guilty to the Federal indictments, he asserts that those indictments are \u201cnot relevant\u201d to whether he is entitled to lost compensation while he was suspended. The relief he seeks is neither compelled by the language of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, nor consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 25, provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the criminal proceedings against the [suspended employee] are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty on any of the charges on which he was indicted, his suspension shall be forthwith removed, and he shall receive all compensation or salary due him for the period of his suspension . . . .\u201d By its express terms, the statute contemplates that payment for a period of suspension shall occur if, and only when, the employee is entitled to removal of his suspension. The suspended employee, of course, is entitled to removal of his suspension, only when the \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d against him terminate \u201cwithout a finding or verdict of guilty on <em>any </em>of the charges on which he was indicted\u201d (emphasis added). Brittle was under indictment throughout the entire forty-month period of his suspension before he resigned. He was never eligible to perform any public duties during that time; he was not entitled to \u201cremov[al]\u201d of his suspension, and he most assuredly was not entitled to reinstatement during that forty-month period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cCriminal proceedings\u201d against him did not terminate until he pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>guilty to the Federal indictments on November 5, 1997, and those proceedings terminated in a \u201cfinding or verdict of guilty.\u201d G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Brittle in effect asks us to construe the phrase \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d narrowly to encompass only the State court proceedings. There is no reason to do so. A statute should not be \u201cunduly constricted so as to exclude matters fairly within [its] scope.\u201d <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 577 (1942), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401 (1931), cert, denied, 284 U.S. 684 (1932). Rather, \u201c[i]f the language of the statute is \u2018 \u201cfairly susceptible [of] a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result\u201d we will construe [it] so as \u201cto make [it an] . . . effectual piece[] of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>427 Mass. 59, 62 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 251, 254 (1983). The Legislature surely recognized that there are numerous circumstances, such as here, where an initial indictment may give rise to or be related to other indictments, as the fullness of the criminal conduct of a defendant comes to light.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> One indictment may spawn several, or a defendant may be convicted of charges arising from a course of criminal conduct on which multiple indictments are based, but not necessarily of each indictment arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>out of that conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Legislature reasonably withheld from the employee the right of removal of suspension (and corresponding back pay) only when \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d against him were \u201cterminated\u201d without a finding of wrongdoing on \u201cany\u201d of the charges against him. To cabin the term \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d to refer solely to proceedings concerning the initial indictment is thus inconsistent with the language of the statute, and with its purpose: \u201cto remedy the untenable situation [that] arises when a person who has been indicted for misconduct in office continues to perform his public duties while awaiting trial.\u201d <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>398 Mass. 786, 788-789 (1986), quoting <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. Retirement Bd., </em>397 Mass. 734, 739 (1986). See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 n.3 (1986), quoting <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984) (\u201cOur primary duty is to interpret a law so as to effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting it\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Our reading of the statute is also consistent with the converse purpose of the statute: to ensure that a suspended public employee is fully compensated if no misconduct by him is established. See <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, </em>348 Mass. 605, 608 (1965) (\u201cThe statute fully protects the suspended employee upon his vindication . . ,\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>412 Mass. 1010 (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>on which Brittle relies, is readily distinguishable. Madden was indicted on State charges and suspended. All the State charges were nol pressed, and there were at the time no other indictments pending against him; all \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d had terminated. Seven weeks later he was again indicted, this time on unrelated Federal charges.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Within that seven-week period, Madden could have sought, and in fact did seek, reinstatement. He also sought \u201call compensation or salary due him.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59. In contrast, Brittle\u2019s State charges were nol pressed only after (and indeed because) he had been indicted on \u201cdirectly related\u201d Federal charges. Unlike Madden, Brittle\u2019s \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d did not terminate until he ultimately pleaded guilty. Had Brittle, like Madden, sought reinstatement when the State charge was nol pressed, his request to resume his duties as a police officer would undoubtedly have been summarily denied because of the pending Federal indictments. See <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works, supra </em>at 608 (\u201cIt is the ascertainable and indisputable fact of the indictment, quite apart from guilt, that makes continuance in office unsuitable\u201d). Our decision today does not overrule <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, supra. Post </em>at 592. The result here is consistent with the holding in that case, which retains its full precedential value.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We need not decide whether we would reach the same result in a case where various indictments brought at different times or by different prosecuting authorities overlap in time but are unrelated. Here, there is an obvious and close relationship between the conduct that gave rise to Brittle\u2019s State indictments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>and the conduct that resulted in his Federal indictments. Both involve the Brittle-Cotton drug smuggling conspiracy. Brittle and Cotton were engaged in a violent dispute concerning money Brittle claimed he was due on the delivery of a suitcase of heroin to Cotton. His violent conduct led initially to the State indictments. As Brittle\u2019s illegal conduct came to light in full measure, State and Federal law enforcement officials coordinated their strategy against Brittle. Cotton was the complaining witness in the State indictments against Brittle. She was also a critical witness in Brittle\u2019s Federal trial and, according to the assistant district attorney, would testify to \u201cthe same issues\u201d in both the State and Federal proceedings, i.e., to the conduct that ultimately ended Brittle\u2019s involvement with Cotton and her drug-smuggling operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">It is of no consequence that the remaining State indictment was not fully detailed at the Federal plea colloquy, or that the Federal indictment was not laid bare in minute detail when the State charge was nol pressed. For it is abundantly clear from the representations of both the district attorney for the Suffolk district and the United States attorney that those two respective offices were proceeding in tandem precisely because the conduct giving rise to the State and Federal indictments was related. Had Cotton been subjected to cross-examination by Brittle\u2019s attorney in the relatively insignificant State case, the Federal indictment against Brittle might well have been compromised. Neither office would have accepted that risk, as any punishment of Brittle resulting from a conviction of international heroin smuggling would be far greater than, and indeed would eclipse, any punishment that Brittle might receive in the State proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nol pressing the State indictment to strengthen the closely related and more serious Federal indictment was not only reasonable, it would have been foolhardy for the district attorney to proceed otherwise. To grant Brittle the relief he seeks would provide a perverse incentive to prosecutors to pursue a less weighty State claim and possibly jeopardize a far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>more serious Federal case, or vice versa, in order to avoid the distasteful obligation of back pay to a subsequently convicted public employee. The plain wording of the statute forecloses any such result. Brittle may not benefit from his criminal conduct at the expense of the city\u2019s taxpayers merely because the prosecutors of his drug-related crimes cooperated to bring him to justice.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Because of our conclusion, we need not address the city\u2019s argument that Brittle should be equitably estopped from seeking back pay. See, e.g., <em>Yetman </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 708-709 (1979) (city permitted to raise affirmative defense of loches, \u201can equitable defense consisting of unreasonable delay in instituting an action which results in some injury or prejudice to the defendant\u201d). We note that the statute is silent as to the proper resolution of a claim by a suspended employee for back pay in circumstances where a city, acting in good faith, does not forthwith remove a suspension, and the employee does not seek reinstatement or back pay. The statute gives no indication that the employer has a duty to monitor the disposition of the \u201ccriminal proceedings,\u201d or that the prosecuting authority has any duty to advise the employer of an outcome favorable to the employee. The Legislature could reasonably have assumed that a suspended employee vindicated of every charge would promptly assert his right to removal of the suspension, or to receive compensation for the period of his suspension, or both. See <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>412 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1992) (suspended employee sought back pay ten days after entry of order of nolle prosequi).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> Alternatively, Brittle seeks back pay for the twenty-three month period from the date he was suspended until the date he was indicted on Federal charges to which he ultimately pleaded guilty. But see note 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">As the judge in the Superior Court noted, Brittle \u201cwas given the opportunity at the change of plea hearing in the Federal case to dispute the Government\u2019s synopsis of its evidence. . . .

As early as 1986, Brittle had been aware of Cotton\u2019s illegal drug smuggling activities and had shared in its proceeds, but it appears that it was not until 1992 that Brittle became an active participant in Cotton\u2019s operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\">It appears that, by then, Brittle and Cotton were no longer in a personal relationship, and Cotton was pregnant with the child of another man. During that period, Brittle \u201cbegan to drink heavily.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth knew at that time that Cotton\u2019s allegations against Brittle concerned a payment dispute over their joint drug operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Earlier, on May 19, 1995, the indictment against Brittle on the charge of stalking had been dismissed, perhaps in response to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 546-547 (1994), holding that the stalking statute was unconstitutionally vague in certain respects. The Commonwealth continued to press its indictment against Brittle for threatening to commit an assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Specifically, the assistant district attorney informed the judge: \u201c1.

The Legislature limited suspension without pay to public employees who are indicted for misconduct committed while in office, presumably for at least two reasons: (1) before an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>indictment is properly issued, a grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to identify the defendant and probable cause to arrest him, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982), and (2) many misdemeanors and other crimes that do not involve \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d do not raise the kind of \u201cuntenable\u201d concerns that we noted in <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>398 Mass. 786, 788-789 (1986). We give full effect to the Legislature\u2019s obvious intent, reflecting as it does a careful balance of the rights of public employees against whom wrongdoing is not proved, and protection of the public from those employees who do engage in illegal conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Secretary of Public Safety made no claim that Madden\u2019s Federal charges were related in any manner to the earlier State indictments. See <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>412 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1992).

Had he been convicted of the State charge of threatening to commit an assault and battery, the sentence could have been a fine of not more than $100 or a prison sentence of not more than six months. See G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b609-18\">The dissent posits that the Commonwealth could have \u201cdelay[ed] its proceeding until after the disposition of the Federal charges,\u201d <em>post </em>at 596, thereby recognizing that suspension of Brittle until the conclusion of the Federal prosecution was fully warranted. We see nothing in the statute that requires a prosecutor to manipulate proceedings so as to delay a trial, or to require the Commonwealth to expend unnecessary resources to bring to trial a defendant already convicted of far more serious crimes arising from his related conduct. In short, the solution preferred by the dissent elevates form over substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b609-17\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWg\">(dissenting, with whom Greaney and Spina, JJ., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>join). The court today ignores the plain language and intent of a statute to reach a result it finds pleasing as a matter of policy. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The final paragraph of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201cIf the criminal proceedings against the person[] suspended are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty on any of the charges on which he was indicted, his suspension shall be forthwith removed, and he shall receive all compensation or salary due him for the period of his suspension . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">This language unambiguously renders both reinstatement and back pay contingent on the fate of the charges that gave rise to the suspension, and automatic if those charges are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilt. The court has, however, rewritten the statute (and, presumably, the cognate G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59) to provide that back pay shall be contingent, not on the fate of the charges giving rise to the suspension, but on the <em>removal of the employee\u2019s suspension </em>and his application for reinstatement to his former position. The statute has thus been revised by the court to defeat its automatic and limited application.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">In addition, the court has greatly broadened the scope of the statute by infusing it with a \u201crelatedness\u201d consideration. According to the court, the employee is entitled to removal of his suspension (and, therefore, to his back pay) only if the criminal proceedings against him, including those \u201cclosely related\u201d to the proceedings under the indictment that gave rise to the suspension, are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty. \u201cRelatedness\u201d now pervades the statute despite the fact that it is a consideration foreign to the text. \u201cWe will not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 294 (2002), and cases cited. This court\u2019s authority to interpret and apply statutes \u201cis limited by its constitutional role as a judicial, rather than a legislative body. . . . We cannot interpret a statute so as to avoid injustice or hardship if its language is clear and unambiguous and requires a different construction.\u201d <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>423 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>534, 539 (1996), cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1131 (1997), quoting <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Kokofsky, </em>373 Mass. 778, 780-781 (1977). We are under a duty \u201cto avoid judicial legislation in the guise of new constructions to meet real or supposed new popular viewpoints, preserving always to the Legislature alone its proper prerogative of adjusting the statutes to changed conditions.\u201d <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 595 (1975). That the court believes that the Legislature should have included a \u201crelatedness\u201d concept does not authorize the court to do so itself, even to achieve a desired \u201cgood policy\u201d result. The court does not direct attention to anything in the terms of the statute or its legislative history from which one could infer that such was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In addition to legislating judicially to create a \u201crelatedness\u201d feature not present in the statute, the court never pauses to define what \u201crelated\u201d means. The omission of this definition is glaring, for often charges against the same person are \u201crelated\u201d in some sense. The court declares, <em>ante </em>at 588, that charges are \u201cclosely related\u201d when the course of criminal conduct on which the indictments are based is \u201crelated,\u201d or when there is an \u201cobvious and close relationship\u201d between the conduct giving rise to the separate indictments, or when it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that the separate indictments are related. <em>Ante </em>at 587, 588. Thus, the court essentially states that \u201crelated\u201d means \u201crelated,\u201d thereby providing little guidance to public employers and lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Regardless whether the State and Federal charges against Brittle were \u201crelated\u201d in some way, they were not related for purposes of this statute. \u201cOffenses are not related merely because they were committed by the same defendant, even on the same day.\u201d <em>Brittle </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 820, 823 (2002). It is only an indulgent reading of the record that permits the court to conclude that the State charges against Brittle were sought by Cotton \u201c[i]n response\u201d to the drug-related threats, <em>ante </em>at 582, that Brittle\u2019s illegal conduct \u201ccame to light in full measure,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 588, because of the investigation surrounding the State indictments, and that Federal and State authorities were \u201cproceeding in tandem\u201d or \u201ccooperat[ing] to bring him to justice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 588, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Nor does the court let precedent prevent it from reaching its desired conclusion. In <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>412 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1992), we said that under the <em>\u201cunambigu</em>ous\u201d language of the statute \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018charges on which he was indicted\u2019 <em>clearly </em>refers to the charges found <em>in the indictments that gave rise to the </em>suspension\u201d (emphases added). The court has overruled <em>Madden.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, the statute provides that when those charges are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty, the employee\u2019s suspension \u201cshall forthwith be removed\u201d and the employee \u201cshall receive\u201d his back pay. <em>Id. </em>The court does not inform us why what was clear and unambiguous at the time of the <em>Madden </em>decision has become opaque and in need of refashioning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We recognized, correctly, in the <em>Madden </em>case that it is our duty to apply the <em>unambiguous </em>statute as written: \u201cAlthough the [city\u2019s] arguments are persuasive as social policy, these arguments are properly addressed to the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1011. In the decade since this court issued the <em>Madden </em>decision, the Legislature could have, but did not, express disagreement with our reading of the statute by amending it. The court should not ignore its silence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>438 Mass. 187, 193 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>We interpret a statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature, as evidenced by the language used, and considering the purposes and remedies intended to be advanced.\u201d <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 574, 577 (1984). The court ignores the context in which this statute was passed and the situation for which it was intended. General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 59 (the so-called \u201cPerry Law\u201d), identical in its operative language to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, see <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. Retirement Bd., </em>397 Mass. 734, 739 n.8 (1986), was enacted to rid the Commonwealth of indicted public officials continuing to hold office <em>while under indictment. </em>\u201cThe purpose of the statute is to remedy the untenable situation which arises when a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>has been indicted for misconduct in office continues to perform his public duties while awaiting trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The restrictive language of the statute demonstrates that the Legislature purposely drafted a statute with a \u201cnarrow focus,\u201d <em>id., </em>and did not intend to act as broadly as the court would (were it to sit as a law-making body). Initially, only an <em>indictment </em>(and not a complaint) potentially invokes the statute. Thus, by its terms the statute is inapplicable to an employee prosecuted in the District Court for serious offenses such as motor vehicle homicide, indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age, intimidating a witness or juror, driving while under the influence of alcohol, assault with intent to murder, distribution of cocaine within a school zone, or carjacking. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26 (criminal jurisdiction of District Court). An employee-defendant may choose to waive indictment and be prosecuted in the Superior Court by complaint, see Mass. R. Crim. R 3 (a), 378 Mass. 847 (1979); again, the statute would not apply. Or, an employee originally prosecuted by complaint (to be superseded by indictment) may enter into a plea bargain pursuant to which the offense is reduced to a lesser one in the District Court; the statute would not apply here, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Moreover, the statute requires \u201cmisconduct in . . . office.\u201d Except for cases involving teachers and police officers, this phrase has been interpreted generally to <em>exclude </em>an employee\u2019s off-duty conduct. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>McHatton, </em>428 Mass. 790, 792-793 (1999); <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 12, 13-15 (2002); <em>Perryman </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 349-351 (1983); <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 537-539 (1983). Thus, the statute has been interpreted not to apply to a chief deputy sheriff indicted for bribery, <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>377 Mass. 212, 213 &amp; n.3 (1979), or to a school system human resource manager indicted for larceny over $250 and removal or concealment of a motor vehicle to defraud an insurer, <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Lynn, supra. </em>The statute is also inapplicable to <em>elected, </em>as opposed to appointed, officials. <em>McGonigle </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>418 Mass. 147, 149-150 (1994). In addition, the statute only states that the employee <em>\u201cmay\u201d </em>be suspended, rather than \u201cshall.\u201d It is therefore permissive, not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>These restrictions on the statute\u2019s application signify that the Legislature intended to protect governmental employees by limiting the statute to misconduct in office and only to such misconduct as results in an indictment. Even in such situations, the appointing authority has discretion whether to suspend and, in order to effect suspension, that authority must comply with specific, detailed statutory requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In contrast, by the terms of the statute, nothing is required of the suspended employee, who is entitled to have his suspension removed and back pay restored automatically if the criminal proceedings are terminated without a finding or verdict of guilty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The employee has no burden to assure compliance with the statute by the appointing authority. That burden falls squarely on the appointing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The reason for an \u201cunpalatable\u201d result, <em>Brittle </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 820, 822 n.2 (2002), is the design of the statute, not its application by a court. It is helpful to recall what this court stated when interpreting G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 15 (3A), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>mandates forfeiture of retirement benefits by public employees convicted of certain enumerated offenses: \u201cEven if the Legislature did not foresee the possibility of a public employee who might have been convicted under one of the two enumerated Massachusetts statutes being convicted under an arguably equivalent Federal statute, it is not our function judicially to amend the statute to cover this eventuality.\u201d <em>Collatos </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>396 Mass. 684, 688 (1986), citing <em>Thacher </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>250 Mass. 188, 190-191 (1924). Fortunately, the indictment of a public employee is a rare occurrence. It should not be a hardship for the appointing authority and the prosecution to communicate in order to be certain that the consequences of the dismissal or nolle prosequi of an indictment are understood. We should not, as the court suggests, <em>ante </em>at 588-589, interpret the statute so as to assist the interplay of Federal and State proceedings. Had the Commonwealth wished to delay its proceedings until after the disposition of the Federal charges, it could have sought to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">I may consider this result \u201cunpalatable,\u201d <em>Brittle </em>v. <em>Boston, supra. </em>Nevertheless, it is this court\u2019s obligation to apply the statute as written. For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the Superior Court and enter judgment for Brittle in the amount of his regular compensation from July 13, 1994, to November 5, 1997. Should the Legislature decide that the statute is inadequate, it is its role to amend it. See <em>Leopoldstadt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Health Care Fin. &amp; Policy, </em>436 Mass. 80, 92 (2002).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Contrary to the court\u2019s assertion, <em>ante </em>at 586 n.13, the court\u2019s opinion directly contradicts the statutory language. The indictment triggers the right to suspend the employee, and the continuation of the right to maintain the suspension is dependent on the \u201ccharges found in the indictments that gave rise to the suspension.\u201d <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>412 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1992). The court\u2019s decision is contrary to the statute, and can be squared with neither the result nor the reasoning of the <em>Madden </em>case. Although the court asserts that <em>Madden </em>\u201cretains its full precedential value,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 587, it is clear that <em>Madden </em>survives this case only in the sense that Pompeii survived into the Middle Ages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The fact that weeks passed between the indictments in <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, supra, </em>rather than the indictments overlapping as in the present case, is a distinction without a difference. The operative fact in the <em>Madden </em>case was that the original charges concluded without a verdict or finding of guilty. Those were the charges under which Madden was suspended, and the case is directly on point. The fact that Madden sought reinstatement is also irrelevant. The statute does not impose on the employee the responsibility to seek reinstatement; it is designed to operate automatically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The court\u2019s characterization of the legislative history, <em>ante </em>at 585 n.ll, is inaccurate. The Legislature has amended the cognate statute, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59, only twice, both in quick succession after the original 1962 enactment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>St. 1962, c. 798. The 1963 amendment merely made clear that temporary employees have the same powers as the suspended employees they replaced. St. 1963, c. 829, \u00a7 2. This did not broaden the statute\u2019s scope (because the original statute allowed the appointing authority to fill the position with a temporary employee, an amendment authorizing the temporary employee to do the job was hardly necessary). The <em>only </em>other amendment, in 1964, reflected a minor broadening of the statute; it clarified that an employee may be suspended not just for misconduct in his employment, but also for misconduct in <em>any </em>public office, elected or appointed, and it clarified that the appointing authority may suspend regardless of whether the original appointment was subject to approval. St. 1964, c. 528. These changes merely reflect the normal tinkering that often follows soon after a statute\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"AUy\">In any event, the amendments, the most recent of which was enacted thirty-nine years ago, are of no assistance in resolving the present dispute. It is debatable whether they were, in fact, expansions at all. The court treats as an \u201cexpansion\u201d the fact that the original statute differed from the bill that was introduced. <em>Ante </em>at 585 n.ll. Leaving aside the obvious point that this was not the expansion of a statute (which did not yet exist), it was accompanied by a host of extensive safeguards. See note 5, <em>infra. </em>Given the sparse legislative history, caution is warranted in attempting to glean meaning from deleted or changed provisions \u201cduring a legislative journey to enactment.\u201d <em>Mercy Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>381 Mass. 34, 42 (1980). See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 773 (1984). In addition, the court selectively quotes from the 1964 amendment. The amendment\u2019s stated purpose was \u201cto enable forthwith the appointing authority to suspend certain officers or employees under indictment for misconduct at any time in public office or employment <em>pending the outcome of such indictment\u201d </em>(emphasis added). St. 1964, c. 528, preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj6\">The Legislature has not amended the statute for four decades, despite the existence of numerous instances of public corruption during that period. This is scarcely consistent with the court\u2019s view that the Legislature has \u201csuccessively expanded\u201d the statute\u2019s scope. <em>Ante </em>at 585 n.ll.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The statute contains specific requirements for the notice of suspension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cNotice of said suspension shall be given in writing and delivered in hand to said person or his attorney, or sent by registered mail to said person at his residence, his place of business, or the office or place of employment from which he is being suspended. Such notice so given and delivered or sent shall automatically suspend the authority of such person to perform the duties of his office or employment until he is notified in like manner that his suspension is removed. A copy of any such notice together with an affidavit of service shall be filed as follows: in the case of a county, with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the officer or employee is employed; in the case of a city, with the city clerk; in the case of a town, with the town clerk; in the case of a regional school district, with the secretary of the regional school district; and in the case of all other districts, with the clerk of the district.\u201d G.
