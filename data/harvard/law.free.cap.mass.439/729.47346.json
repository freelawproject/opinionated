The Trial Court, in conjunction with the clerk,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed from the commission\u2019s affirmance to the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge vacated the decision of the commission and remanded the case for rehearing. The commission and the complaining parties appealed from that ruling<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">I. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">The hearing on this matter took place in November and December, 1995, and the hearing commissioner issued his opinion in March, 1996. We recount the significant factual findings contained in that opinion, which we find to be supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>School Comm, of Brockton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>423 Mass. 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>11 (1996). In 1993, the complainants, Cheryl A. Cossaboom and Theresa O\u2019Brien,* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were employed by the Hampden County Superior Court clerk\u2019s office (clerk\u2019s office). Each had been employed by that office for approximately twenty years, and by 1993, each had attained the position of head administrative assistant, the highest clerical position within the office. Due to staffing shortages in the clerk\u2019s office caused by a Trial Court \u201chiring freeze,\u201d both complainants had also been sworn in as deputy assistant clerks. As such, in addition to their normal responsibilities, they performed the court room duties of an assistant clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The hiring freeze was lifted in the fall of 1992, and William J. Martin, Jr., then the elected clerk,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> posted two assistant clerk positions. The complainants applied for these positions, but, despite a Trial Court recommendation that clerks hire from within their own organizations, Martin chose to hire John Fitzgerald and Terrence Ginley, both males, from outside the office. In written hiring documents, Martin (who did not testify at the hearing) listed \u201c[j]ob knowledge insufficient for the position\u201d as his reason for declining to hire the complainants. Neither Fitzgerald, a former probation officer, nor Ginley, a former tax collector, had ever worked in a clerk\u2019s office, although both had participated in Martin\u2019s 1982 political campaign. During Martin\u2019s tenure as clerk, he hired five assistant clerks and four head administrative assistants. All were male. In addition, male office personnel received preferential consideration for office space and less strenuous session assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">After finding for the complainants, the commissioner awarded back pay, front pay, and damages for emotional distress. In ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>dition, he ordered the Trial Court and clerk\u2019s office<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to cease engaging in discriminatory hiring practices, to appoint the complainants to the next available assistant clerk positions in the clerk\u2019s office,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and to distribute a copy of the commissioner\u2019s decision and a blank employment discrimination complaint form to the entire clerical staff of the Trial Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">1. <em>Discrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Because the complainants did not provide any direct evidence of discrimination,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the commissioner applied the legal framework applicable to discrimination cases based on indirect or circumstantial evidence. This framework, first articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792 (1973), and adopted by this court in <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130 (1976), involves a three-stage order of proof. In stage one, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. In a hiring discrimination case, this requires four showings: (1) that the plaintiff is a member of a protected class; (2) that the plaintiff applied for an open position; (3) that the plaintiff was not selected; and (4) that the employer filled or sought to fill the position with a similarly qualified individual. See <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>431 Mass. 655, 665-666 n.22 (2000). A prima facie case, once established, \u201ccreates a presumption of discrimination.\u201d <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number><em>lows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 116 (2000). This presumption may be rebutted in the second stage of the analysis if the employer can articulate \u201ca legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision\u201d backed by \u201ccredible evidence [showing] that the reason or reasons advanced were the real reasons.\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 441-442 (1995), quoting <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 138. If an employer can produce a nondiscriminatory reason for its decision with an adequate evidentiary backing, then, to prevail in the third stage of the analysis, the plaintiff must persuade the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that discriminatory animus was the \u201cdeterminative cause\u201d for the employer\u2019s decision. <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. 493, 504 (2001). A fact finder\u2019s decision in the third stage may be based, either in whole or in part, on a determination that a legitimate reason for the employer\u2019s decision advanced in stage two was actually a pretext. See <em>id. </em>at 501; <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Applying the three-stage analysis to the facts of this case, the commissioner first ruled that the complainants had presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of sex discrimination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The commissioner next addressed Martin\u2019s statement that the complainants were passed over for promotion because they did not have the requisite job knowledge to fill the position of assistant clerk. He treated this statement as a stage two nondiscriminatory justification for Martin\u2019s hiring decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When he evaluated that justification in stage three, however, the commissioner found that, in view of the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ants\u2019 extensive experience performing the duties of assistant clerks, Martin\u2019s stated rationale was a pretext. Based on this and other evidence of discrimination contained in the record, the commissioner concluded that the complainants had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that they were denied a promotion on the basis of their sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">According to the Trial Court, the two successful candidates were hired either because of their political support for Martin, or because they possessed educational or managerial backgrounds that the complainants did not. There was some support for the first theory in the record: Fitzgerald and Ginley testified that they participated in Martin\u2019s 1982 political campaign, and a letter was admitted in evidence containing a statement by Martin concerning the need to hire political supporters for assistant clerk positions. As to the allegedly superior qualifications, the evidence showed that both Fitzgerald and Ginley had college degrees, and Ginley, who had been a tax collector, had some supervisory experience. However, there was no evidence that Martin considered these factors or that, in even a general way, he had a preference for candidates with these qualifications. (Again, the clerk himself did not testify.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The Superior Court judge, citing our decision in <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra, </em>held that the commissioner had an obligation to make findings regarding each of the nondiscriminatory reasons advanced by the Trial Court. Because the commissioner failed to do so, the judge remanded the case to the commission for further consideration of the Trial Court\u2019s explanations. Our review of the record, however, indicates that the commissioner\u2019s findings were adequate and no remand is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The judge\u2019s decision was based on a flawed interpretation of the <em>Wheelock College </em>case. In that case we ordered a remand, not because the commissioner failed to make findings regarding all the employer\u2019s possible nondiscriminatory reasons, but rather because the commissioner entirely ignored the evidence that supported a particular motive. See <em>id. </em>at 137. That is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>situation here: the commissioner\u2019s findings acknowledged both Fitzgerald and Ginley\u2019s qualifications and their political connections to Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">An agency adjudicator does not have to make detailed findings concerning every aspect of the matter before him; his findings need only embrace those facts necessary to support his decision in sufficient detail to permit judicial review. See <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 538 (1984). In this case, the commissioner\u2019s findings were perfectly adequate: he determined that sufficient evidence had been presented to establish the elements of a prima facie sex discrimination case and that Martin\u2019s proffered explanation for failing to hire the complainants was a pretext. He explained his supporting reasoning. Although the commissioner made other relevant findings, the two mentioned above were sufficient, even in the face of other potentially nondiscriminatory reasons, to support his ultimate conclusion that the complainants were denied promotion based on their sex. See <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 506-507; <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, supra </em>at 118. See also <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 446 (\u201cThe plaintiff need not conclusively exclude all other possible explanations for the decision and prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">There was no need for the commissioner explicitly to reject the nondiscriminatory reasons ultimately proffered by the Trial Court because a violation of G. L. c. 151B may still occur even if those reasons played some part in Martin\u2019s decision. See <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 506 (no requirement for G. L. c. 151B plaintiff to \u201cdisprove every reason articulated by the defendant or suggested in the evidence\u201d). Because hiring decisions are seldom made for a single reason, discriminatory and nondiscriminatory hiring motives may coexist in the mind of a decision maker. Thus, even when nondiscriminatory reasons play some role in a decision not to hire a particular applicant, that decision may still be unlawful if discriminatory animus was a \u201cmaterial and important ingredient\u201d in the decision-making calculus. See <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., supra </em>at 506 n.19. See also <em>Desert Palace, Inc. </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>539 U.S. 90, 100-102 (2003). Here the commissioner found that the complainants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>were passed over for promotion primarily because they were women.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because that fact alone established a violation of G. L. c. 151B, detailed findings regarding other possible nondiscriminatory reasons were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">2. <em>Remedies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The Trial Court contests the validity of the commissioner\u2019s awards of injunctive relief, front pay, and emotional damages. With regard to the appropriateness of the injunctive relief granted in this case, the order requiring the appointment of Cossaboom to the next available assistant clerk position was proper. Although the Trial Court argues that the commission lacks the authority to control the present clerk\u2019s hiring decisions, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5, states explicitly that the commission may require an employer to hire a person against whom it has discriminated at an earlier date. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Dracut, </em>374 Mass. 619 (1978), cited by the Trial Court, stands for the proposition that a court cannot require successor elected officials publicly to support their predecessor\u2019s policies. See <em>id. </em>at 626. It is inapposite to this case, where Martin\u2019s elected successor is being ordered to correct an injury inflicted by the office that she now heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The order requiring Statewide distribution of the commissioner\u2019s decision was also within the commissioner\u2019s discretion. The commissioner found that the Trial Court, through Martin, engaged in sex discrimination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When a hearing commissioner makes such a finding, G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5, authorizes him to order affirmative action that, \u201cin the judgment of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>sion, will effectuate the purposes\u201d of the antidiscrimination statute. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>365 Mass. 357, 366 (1974). The commissioner has the discretion to formulate an appropriate order. See <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>431 Mass. 655, 674 (2000). Although mandatory training programs are most frequently imposed in cases such as this one, orders requiring employers to give notice of the rights conferred by Federal and State discrimination laws are also appropriate. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 367. Viewed in this light, the commissioner\u2019s decision to require a one-time distribution of the text of his decision to the Trial Court\u2019s clerical employees was neither unreasonably burdensome nor unrelated to the legitimate goals of discovering and deterring discrimination in other departments of the Trial Court. See <em>id. </em>\u201cIn G. L. c. 151B, the Legislature has given the commission broad powers to receive, investigate and act on complaints of discrimination. We will not lightly interfere with that mandate by permitting the court\u2019s judgment to be substituted for the commission\u2019s on issues that lie within the latter\u2019s designated field. To do so would render meaningless the administrative scheme enacted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>East Chop Tennis Club </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>364 Mass. 444, 450 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">As for the award of front pay and emotional distress damages, the commissioner determined that both were necessary to make the complainants whole. His conclusions were based on substantial evidence and therefore appropriate. See <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 387-388 (1988); <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 317 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court vacating the decision and order of the commission is reversed. A judgment is to enter affirming the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-12\">O\u2019Brien argues that the clerk has no standing in this appeal.

See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>427 Mass. 75, 76 n.2 (1998); <em>Cliff House Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>378 Mass. 189, 191 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b750-15\">The Trial Court argues that we should reject the commissioner\u2019s factual findings because he improperly considered a report documenting gender bias within the Trial Court and because he ignored other evidence favorable to the Trial Court. The admission of the report was proper, see <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>423 Mass. 7, 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>(1996) (hearsay evidence may be considered in administrative proceedings), and the evidence referred to by the Trial Court was discredited, not ignored. We will not second guess the commissioner\u2019s credibility determinations. See <em>id. </em>(\u201cThe commission, and not the court, is the sole judge of the credibility and weight of the evidence before it\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Theresa O\u2019Brien is now deceased and is represented by the administratrix of her estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b751-13\">In 1995, Martin was succeeded in office by another elected clerk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In the remedy section of the decision, the commissioner ordered the \u201cRespondent\u201d to take various remedial steps. Because there were several respondents in this action, the use of the singular term has been a source of some confusion. It is sufficiently clear from the totality of the decision, however, that the commissioner intended the term \u201cRespondent\u201d to encompass both the Trial Court and the clerk\u2019s office. There is no real dispute concerning which remedies apply to which party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\">This portion of the order is obviously now moot as to O\u2019Brien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Direct evidence is evidence that, \u201cif believed, results in an inescapable, or at least highly probable, inference that a forbidden bias was present in the workplace.\u201d <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>431 Mass. 655, 667 (2000), quoting <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 300 (1991). Typically, direct evidence consists of statements of discriminatory intent attributable to an employer, see <em>Wynn &amp; Wynn, P.C. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, supra </em>at 667-668. Not surprisingly, such evidence is rarely presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Trial Court has not challenged this initial determination on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">It makes no difference that, in its argument to the commissioner, the Trial Court disavowed Martin\u2019s stated reason for rejecting the complainants\u2019 applications. An employer\u2019s possible nondiscriminatory motives (pretext or not) are defined by the evidentiary record, not the arguments of counsel. See <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255 &amp; n.9 (1981). If, at the time of the hiring, Martin articulated a lawful, but false, reason for his decision, then the commissioner was warranted in inferring that by doing so Martin intended to cover up a discriminatory motive. See <em>Lipchitz </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>434 Mass. 493, 500-501 (2001). While a finding of pretext does not lead inescapably to the conclusion that the employer who advanced it was attempting to conceal discriminatory behavior, see <em>Abramian </em>v. <em>President &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Fellows of Harvard College, </em>432 Mass. 107, 118 (2000), an employer cannot avoid the adverse inference created by advancing a false reason merely by acknowledging it as false at a later date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The commissioner issued his findings more than five years before our <em>Lipchitz </em>opinion. He therefore did not have the benefit of the causality formula articulated there and did not couch his findings in terms of \u201cmaterial and important ingredient[s].\u201d Nevertheless, the text of the decision indicates that the commissioner believed sex-based discrimination to be the determinative cause of Martin\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The complainants did not argue, and the commissioner did not find, that then Chief Justice for Administration and Management (CJAM) acted with discriminatory animus when he approved Martin\u2019s decision to hire Fitzgerald and Ginley. The personnel standards enforced by the CJAM prohibit discriminatory hiring, and therefore under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 8, the CJAM has a duty to ensure that clerks do not discriminate.
