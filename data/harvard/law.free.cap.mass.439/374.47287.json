L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, that they are subject to mandatory disclosure pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (public records statute), and that such disclosure is not prohibited by the Criminal Offender Record Information statute, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 167 et seq. (CORI statute). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. On grounds other than those utilized by the judge below, we conclude that the declaratory judgment was correctly entered with respect to the type of record request at issue in this case. However, the wording of that declaration must be modified slightly to avoid erroneous application to other types of record requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">1. <em>Facts and procedural background. </em>The undisputed facts are taken from the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. On July 31, 1998, a reporter for the Globe sent a letter to the Attorney General and to each district attorney in the Commonwealth requesting information pertaining to \u201ccases of municipal corruption\u201d involving \u201celected or appointed officials or employees of cities and towns\u201d prosecuted between 1993 and June, 1998. Specifically, the reporter sought the docket number, defendant name, municipality, and charge for each such case. In her letter, the reporter agreed to pay search and copying charges up to $75, and, if such charges would exceed that sum, to be notified of the total charges in advance of fulfilling her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The Attorney General and the district attorneys for two districts provided the information as requested. Two other district attorneys did not respond to the request at all. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>remaining seven district attorneys responded, but refused to produce the requested information, citing the burden of identifying \u201cpublic corruption\u201d cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Six of the district attorneys who refused to produce the requested information also claimed that the CORI statute prohibited them from releasing such information. Counsel for the Globe followed up with an amended request, identifying the charges (by statutory citation) that the Globe viewed as most likely to be at issue in public corruption cases, and suggesting that members of each district attorney\u2019s staff \u201cwould recall some number of prosecutions of municipal corruption\u201d if any had been brought during the preceding five years. See 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.05(4) (1993) (\u201ccustodian\u2019s superior knowledge of the contents of a governmental entity\u2019s files shall be used to assist\u201d in complying with request for public records). As to the prohibitions imposed by the CORI statute, counsel for the Globe pointed to <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>819 F. Supp. 89 (D. Mass. 1993), and to a decision of the Superior Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in support of the Globe\u2019s position that the CORI statute did not prohibit release of the requested information. When the district attorneys still refused to comply with the Globe\u2019s amended request for records, again citing the CORI statute and the allegedly burdensome nature of the requested record search,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Globe filed the present action for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In its complaint, the Globe sought an injunction requiring the defendant district attorneys to provide it with the requested information, and a declaration that the documents were public records subject to mandatory disclosure under the public records statute, that the CORI statute did not prohibit defendants from disclosing the requested information, and that the Globe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>was entitled to receive the information at \u201cactual expense\u201d with copies of documents at \u201creasonable cost.\u201d After stipulating to the dismissal of all claims against three of the defendants (with whom the Globe had apparently resolved the dispute over access to the requested information), the Globe and the remaining six defendants filed cross motions for summary judgment. As framed in its summary judgment motion, the Globe sought declarations that (1) docket numbers of criminal cases are public records under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, and G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth; (2) docket numbers were exempt from the restrictions of the CORI statute pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, eighth par.; (3) if the CORI statute prohibited the disclosure of criminal docket numbers it was violative of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, and (4) the public records statute and regulations thereunder required custodians of records to make inquiry of their staff to determine the existence of documents responsive to a request for public records.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The judge allowed the Globe\u2019s motion in part. Although she did not accept the Globe\u2019s argument that the requested docket numbers came within the literal terms of the exceptions to the CORI statute, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, eighth par., she concluded that the requested docket number information was closely analogous to each of the categories of information described in those exceptions. For these purposes, the CORI statute operated as an exception to the public records statute, and relying on the principle that exceptions to the public records statute were to be interpreted narrowly, she determined that the defendants had not overcome the presumption that the records were public. She also reasoned that treating the docket number information as a public record in the manner requested by the Globe would not frustrate or be contrary to the purposes of the CORI statute. She declined the Globe\u2019s request for a declaration concerning any duty on the part of the district attorneys to make inquiry of staff personnel concerning the existence of records, noting that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>an inquiry might be reasonable in some circumstances but not in others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, she entered declaratory judgment in favor of the Globe on statutory grounds, without reaching the Globe\u2019s alternative constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">2. <em>Presence of an actual controversy. </em>The defendant district attorneys first argue that no declaratory relief should have been granted because the Globe \u201cwas unwilling\u201d to pay the costs of search necessary to respond to its record requests<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> means that there is no actual controversy remaining. See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1 (granting jurisdiction to make binding declarations \u201cin any case in which an actual controversy has arisen\u201d); <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court, </em>421 Mass. 502, 504 (1995), and cases cited. None of the defendants raised this argument below, and the judge therefore committed no error in reaching the merits of the cross motions pending before her.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">To the extent that the defendants suggest that the present appeal is moot because of the Globe\u2019s alleged unwillingness to pay the costs of the requested record searches, we are unpersuaded. At no time has the Globe indicated any final refusal to pay the fees imposed by the statute. The Globe was confronted with responses from the district attorneys indicating that, even if search costs were paid, they would not produce the records based on their interpretation of the CORI statute. There was thus no reason for the Globe to have agreed to any of the proposed search expenses, or to have made a counterproposal (as to either the fees themselves or to a narrowing of the search parameters) unless and until the CORI statute issue was resolved. While it may be unlikely that the Globe would agree to pay the estimated fees previously announced by certain defendants (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>there is no conclusive impasse between the Globe and the defendants on that issue that would automatically moot the Globe\u2019s request for public records.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Moreover, the Globe correctly maintains that the present case falls into the category of cases that are capable of repetition yet evading review. The present case is at least the third time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the Globe has commenced litigation concerning district attorneys\u2019 refusal to produce docket number information, and the third time that certain district attorneys have contended that the CORI statute precludes them from releasing such information.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the defendants argue that any future denial of records on account of the CORI statute may again be litigated and will not escape review, that argument ignores the fact that compliance with a request for public records should ordinarily occur within ten days of that request. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (b). See also <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., ante </em>124, 125, 127 (2003), and cases cited. Litigation to vindicate rights of access to public records cannot realistically be completed in that time frame. Even if financial considerations may ultimately moot the Globe\u2019s present request for records, it is appropriate that we resolve the CORI statute issue underlying an apparently ongoing dispute between some district attorneys and the Globe.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">3. <em>Status of docket numbers under the CORI statute. </em>\u201cEvery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>person having custody of any public record, as defined in [G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth], shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it. . . to be inspected and examined by any person . . . and shall furnish one copy thereof upon payment of a reasonable fee.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a). The definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d is broad: \u201call books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the commonwealth, or of any political subdivision thereof, or of any authority established by the general court to serve a public purpose,\u201d unless the item is excluded by one of the statute\u2019s exemptions. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. There is a presumption that a requested record is public, and the burden is on the official refusing to permit inspection \u201cto prove with specificity the exemption which applies.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c). The purpose of these statutes is \u201cto give the public broad access to governmental records.\u201d <em>Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette Corp. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Worcester, </em>436 Mass. 378, 382-383 (2002). \u201cBecause of the statute\u2019s presumption in favor of disclosure, we have said that the statutory exemptions must be strictly and narrowly construed.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 801-802 (1999). See <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>414 Mass. 609, 614 (1993), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Here, the defendants rely on the exemption for records \u201cspecifically or by necessary implication exempted from disclosure by statute,\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (a), on the theory that the CORI statute specifically prohibits disclosure of such records. The CORI statute governs dissemination of \u201ccriminal offender record information,\u201d defined as \u201crecords and data in any communicable form compiled by a criminal justice agency which concern an identifiable individual and relate to the nature or disposition of a criminal charge, an arrest, a pretrial proceeding, other judicial proceedings, sentencing, incarceration, rehabilitation, or release.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 167. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Criminal offender record information may only be disseminated to criminal justice agencies,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to agencies and individuals required to have the information by statute, and to individuals and entities approved by the criminal history systems board (based on a determination that the public interest in disseminating the information to such persons \u201cclearly outweighs the interest in security and privacy\u201d). G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, first par.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Globe is not within any of the categories of persons to whom criminal offender record information may be distributed, and it does not dispute that the information it seeks from the district attorneys would come within the definition of \u201ccriminal offender record information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">However, the CORI statute identifies certain records which, notwithstanding that they would come within the definition of criminal offender record information, \u201cshall be public records: (1) police daily logs, arrest registers, or other similar records compiled chronologically, provided that no alphabetical arrestee, suspect, or similar index is available to the public, directly or indirectly; (2) chronologically maintained court rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ords of public judicial proceedings [<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] (3) published records of public court or administrative proceedings, and of public judicial administrative or legislative proceedings; and (4) decisions of the parole board as provided in [G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 130].\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 172, eighth par.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Globe contends that the docket number information it seeks comes within the first three exceptions to the CORI statute and is therefore a \u201cpubhc record\u201d subject to disclosure under the pubhc record statute. We agree that the docket numbers at issue qualify as \u201cchronologically maintained court records of pubhc judicial . . . proceedings,\u201d <em>id., </em>and therefore need not consider whether any of the other exceptions would be applicable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Docket numbers are assigned chronologically and maintained by courts as part of their court records, criminal proceedings against adult defendants are pubhc proceedings, and docket number information thus falls squarely within the second listed exception to the CORI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The defendants maintain, however, that such information in their hands is no longer a \u201ccourt\u201d record, as they are district attorneys, not courts. In essence, they contend that the term \u201ccourt records\u201d as used in this exception includes a requirement that the record be physically located at a \u201ccourt\u201d and thus apphes only to the precise copy of the record that is at the court house. We disagree. A record does not cease to be a \u201ccourt\u201d record when it is distributed to the parties to a case, here, to the district attorney prosecuting the case. It retains its original character as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>a \u201ccourt\u201d record, and hence a \u201cpublic record,\u201d without regard to which entity has a copy. Put differently, if the item sought is a court record that could be obtained from the clerk\u2019s office, it is a public record, and it may be obtained from any other government official who also happens to have a copy of that same public record.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (definition of \u201c[p]ublic records\u201d includes documents \u201cmade or received by\u201d public officer or employee). The court record\u2019s status as a public record does not depend on the identity of the custodian from whom that public record is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">To the extent that there is any ambiguity whether the term \u201ccourt records\u201d refers only to those record copies that are physically located within a court house, that ambiguity must be resolved in favor of disclosure. The judge correctly perceived the hierarchy of the public records statute and the CORI statute. The CORI statute operates as an exception to the definition of \u201c[pjublic records,\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(a), </em>and, as an exception, it must be construed narrowly. See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 801-802 (1999); <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>414 Mass. 609, 614 (1993), and cases cited. Consistent with that principle, the term \u201ccourt records,\u201d which operates as an exception to the exception, must be construed broadly in favor of disclosure. Absent clear indication from the Legislature that the exception for \u201ccourt records\u201d was intended to require persons seeking such records to obtain them solely from court clerks\u2019 offices, we should not engraft such a requirement onto that exception. Rather, we treat the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>for \u201ccourt records\u201d as applying to all copies of those same records in the possession of any public official, making them \u201cpublic records\u201d without regard to their physical location.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We also agree with the judge below that allowing members of the press and the public to obtain docket numbers from the district attorneys does not undermine the purposes of the CORI statute. The CORI statute is intended to protect privacy and to promote the rehabilitation of criminal defendants, recognizing that ready access to a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record might frustrate a defendant\u2019s access to employment, housing, and social contacts necessary to that rehabilitation. Requests for docket numbers of particular types of cases, not being framed with reference to any named defendant, do not subvert the CORI statute. The CORI statute is not intended to shield officials in the criminal justice system from public scrutiny. Evaluation of a district attorney\u2019s performance of necessity involves review of that district attorney\u2019s cases, e.g., the types of cases prosecuted, the results achieved, the sentences sought and imposed. Requiring district attorneys to respond to public records requests for docket numbers of particular types of cases prosecuted by their offices facilitates that review without undermining the CORI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">4. <em>Wording of the declaration. </em>The judge entered a declaration that \u201cdocket numbers of criminal cases prosecuted in public judicial proceedings, not correlated with defendant-specific information, are public records under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, that they are subject to mandatory disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, and that their disclosure is not prohibited by the CORI statute.\u201d For purposes of the type of record request before her, that declaration was accurate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, applied broadly to all types of requests for docket numbers, the declaration as worded would not be accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">While docket numbers are court records, responses to requests for docket number information about particular types of cases inherently reveal information beyond the docket numbers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>themselves. By definition, the list of docket numbers produced in response to a request also reveals that each case on that list conforms to whatever search criteria were employed consistent with the terms of that request (e.g., that the case involved a particular charge, or was handled by a particular assistant district attorney, or resulted in a prison sentence of a particular length). There is no violation of the CORI statute when the search specifications consist of information that would also be revealed on the court\u2019s records accessible to the public. The declaration entered here arose from a request that was framed in terms of information that would presumably appear on the court\u2019s records, i.e., docket numbers for cases involving particular types of crimes and against municipalities as victims. However, a request for docket numbers correlated with information that is <em>not </em>in the court\u2019s records or any other public record effectively calls for the release of information that would not be a public record, as the resulting list of docket numbers would inform the recipient that each case on that list had a particular attribute that could not have been ascertained from public records. A district attorney\u2019s office has considerable information about its cases and defendants, not all of which is ultimately revealed on the court\u2019s records, e.g., information about a defendant\u2019s personal background. Such information constitutes criminal offender record information, and it would not be exempt from the CORI statute as a \u201ccourt record.\u201d Its disclosure would thus still be prohibited by the CORI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We therefore conclude that the wording of the declaratory judgment must be modified to limit it to those record requests that are framed entirely in terms of information that would be available from court or other public records, as only those requests call for disclosures that are entirely exempt from the CORI statute. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for modification. The declaration should be amended to read as follows: \u201cDocket numbers of criminal cases prosecuted in public judicial proceedings, correlated with information that is also available from court or other public records, but not correlated with defendant-specific information, are public records under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, subject to mandatory disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, and their disclosure is not prohibited by the CORI statute, G.

Both of those interpretations cannot be right: there is either a violation of the CORI statute being perpetrated by the Attorney General and those district attorneys who produce docket numbers in response to requests of this nature, or a violation of the public records statute by those district attorneys who decline to produce the docket numbers.

As a result of that decision, the public has access to court clerks\u2019 alphabetical indices of defendants\u2019 names and may thereby obtain access to court records concerning an individual defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\">By way of regulation, the criminal history systems board has created additional specific exceptions allowing release of criminal offender record information. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.04(5), 4.02, 5.03, 6.06 (1993). See also <em>Bellin </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>435 Mass. 261, 265-269 (2001) (upholding board\u2019s authority to promulgate such regulatory exceptions). The Globe\u2019s request for docket numbers does not fit within any of these regulatory exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Because we agree with the Globe on the interpretation of this exception to the CORI statute, we also need not reach the Globe\u2019s alternative argument challenging the CORI statute on constitutional grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On constitutional grounds, the Federal court has held that \u201cnothing in the CORI statute may be held to impose liability for the communication of information otherwise available at the time of the communication in a judicial record to which the public has access\u201d and that it would violate the First Amendment to impose a sanction \u201cfor the communication of criminal record information contained in a judicial record open to the public at the time of the communication of such information.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Fenton, supra </em>at 100, 101. The defendants correctly maintain that nothing in the final decree in that case requires them to disclose information in court records. That case, however, was a constitutional challenge to the CORI statute, not an interpretation of the public records statute. It is the public records statute that requires the defendants to disclose anything that qualifies as a \u201cpublic record.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The Globe has not challenged the limitation the judge added to the requested declaration, namely, that the request for docket numbers \u201cnot [be] correlated with defendant-specific information.\u201d We therefore need not address whether that limitation is necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
