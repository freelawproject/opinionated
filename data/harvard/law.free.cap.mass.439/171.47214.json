L. c. 151 A. A review examiner in the division of employment and training (division) concluded, after a hearing, that adult carriers were entitled to the benefits. The examiner\u2019s decision was entered as the decision of the division\u2019s deputy director, and the decision was affirmed by the board of review (board). The News sought judicial review in the District Court as provided in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 12. A judge in the District Court determined that the adult carriers were not entitled to benefits and reversed the board\u2019s decision. The deputy director appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the adult carriers are not covered by G. L. c. 151 A, and direct that a judgment be entered reversing the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">1. The undisputed facts are as follows. The News is a small newspaper company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that publishes its newspaper six times a week, Monday through Saturday. The newspapers are then distributed to subscribers within the News\u2019s circulation territory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by carriers, who pick up the newspapers either at the News\u2019s circulation room or at bundled drop points near the carriers\u2019 homes. The division conducted a random audit of the News\u2019s operations. At the time of the division audit, the News engaged twelve adult carriers, whom the News had retained after advertising available routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The News intended all carriers to be independent contractors. Each carrier entered into an Independent Newspaper Carrier Agreement (agreement) with the News to deliver the newspaper to subscribers each day, in good condition, not later than 4:30 p.m. on weekdays and 8:30 a.m. on Saturday. Pursuant to the agreement, carriers receive the names and addresses of subscribers on their route from the News. Carriers agree not to sell or give away the route, and not to give customer lists to anyone without permission from the News. Carriers may increase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>number of subscribers on their routes without permission, so long as a current list of all subscribers is kept and made available to the News on request. Carriers are free to engage in delivery services for entities other than the News. A carrier who cannot service his or her route for any reason must find a substitute carrier at his or her own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Under the agreement, the News agrees to sell to the carrier newspapers required to be delivered to customers on the carrier\u2019s route at a wholesale price determined by the News. The News further agrees to notify the carrier of any changes in the wholesale price at least forty-eight hours prior to any change. Finally, the News agrees that, when monies are paid for advance subscriptions, the News will maintain complete records to ensure that carriers receive full credit for delivery. Carriers are paid based on the number of papers delivered. Although each carrier may establish the price charged to customers on the carrier\u2019s route, most, if not all, use the price suggested by the News. Customers either pay the News or the carrier directly for their newspapers. Prepaid customers, who make up the majority of the News\u2019s subscribers, pay the News directly and receive a reduced price. The News then refunds the carrier with credit for delivery of those newspapers. If a customer pays the carrier directly, the carrier then pays the News the wholesale rate for that customer\u2019s papers and pockets the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In addition to home delivery, some carriers deliver bundles of newspapers to predetermined locations along their routes, to be picked up for subsequent delivery by youth carriers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Some carriers also deliver newspapers to vending machines along their routes. The News pays carriers a set fee for each \u201cbundle drop,\u201d and it reimburses carriers for mileage. The News prepares a statement each week, showing the carrier\u2019s previous balance, number of papers delivered that week, credits for bundle drops, store collection, mileage allowance, and tips. At the end of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>week, either the carrier owes the News or the News provides the carrier with a refund. The News does not deduct any State or Federal taxes from the carrier\u2019s pay and issues no wage statements to the carriers for tax purposes at the end of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The News employs a circulation manager who oversees carrier routes. Customers direct complaints regarding the delivery of newspapers to either the carrier or the News, and the News informs the carrier of any complaint received about him or her. Although the agreement provides that the carrier will notify the News at least two weeks in advance of the carrier\u2019s intention to terminate delivery services, both the News and the carrier may terminate the agreement without incurring any liability for breach of contract. The agreement expressly states that carriers are not employees of the publisher and disclaims responsibility on the part of the News for any liability that may arise during the performance of the carrier\u2019s route.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">2. We review the decision of the board<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> according to the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), giving \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d In addition, we are required to construe G. L. c. 151A liberally, in view of its overriding purpose \u201cto lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his family.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 74. See <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. 805, 809 (1996). So long as the facts in the board\u2019s decision are supported by substantial evidence (a matter not in issue here) and the board utilizes the proper legal standards (a matter in issue), its decision will be upheld. See <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>398 Mass. 609, 611 (1986); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 678, 685-686 (1977). We are not, however, bound by an erroneous construction of G. L. c. 151 A. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>374 Mass. 784, 790 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 2, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">\u201cService performed by an individual . . . shall be deemed to be employment1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 subject to this chapter irrespective of whether the common-law relationship of master and servant exists, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>such individual has been and will continue to be free from control and direction in connection with the performance of such services, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\"><em>\u201c(b) </em>such service is performed either outside the usual course of the business for which the service is performed or is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which the service is performed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\"><em>\u201c(c) </em>such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">An employment relationship thus exists, for purposes of G. L. c. 151 A, unless it can be demonstrated that the services at issue are performed (a) free from control or direction of the employing enterprise; (b) outside of the usual course of business, or outside of all the places of business, of the enterprise; and (c) as part of an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business of the worker. The employer bears the burden of proof, and, because the conditions are conjunctive, its failure to demonstrate any one of the criteria set forth in subsections <em>(a), (b), </em>or (c), suffices to establish that the services in question constitute \u201cemployment\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A. See <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 613-614. Conversely, an employing entity who successfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>meets the criteria of subsections (a), <em>(b), </em>and (c) establishes that the services do not constitute employment and, thus, the workers performing the services are independent contractors and not \u201cemployees\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> within the meaning of G. L. c. 151A. This tripartite test is commonly known as the \u201cABC\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In this case, the board determined that the News had failed to meet its burden with respect to all three prongs of the ABC test.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Based on the undisputed factual findings, the board concluded that the carriers \u201cdo not control the routes, accounts or subscribers list,\u201d and thus \u201cdo not have a proprietary interest ... to the extent that he/she can operate [a delivery business] without a hindrance from any individual or force whatsoever.\u201d In addition, the board determined that the carriers performed services \u201cin the usual course of [the News\u2019s] business and were not \u201cfree from [the News\u2019s] direction and control in connection with the performance\u201d of these services. Based on these determinations, the board decided that the carriers are \u201cemployees\u201d who perform services constituting \u201cemployment\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 9The judge reversed the board\u2019s decision, and the division appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">3. The question before the judge and before us is one of law, whether, on the undisputed facts, and consistent with the standards stated above, the News has demonstrated that the adult carriers are independent contractors under the ABC test. Based on our review of the record and consideration of the applicable principles of law, we conclude that the News has satisfied its burden.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">(a) The first part of the test examines the degree of control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and direction retained by the employing entity over the services performed. Prior to 1971, this part was the sole standard of \u00a7 2, which read: \u201cService performed by an individual shall be deemed to be \u2018employment\u2019 unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the director that such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction by another with respect to the performance of such services, both under his contract of service and in fact.\u201d St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1. This provision generally was construed according to the common-law analysis of master and servant relationship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>O\u2019Malley\u2019s Case, </em>361 Mass. 504, 505 (1972); <em>Brigham\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 140, 141-142 (1964) (\u201cIf in the performance of his work an individual is at all times bound to obedience and subject to direction and supervision as to details, he is an employee; but if he is only responsible for the accomplishment of an agreed result in an agreed manner, he is an independent contractor\u201d). The essence of the distinction under common law has always been the right to control the details of the performance, see <em>Mc-Dermott\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 74, 76 (1933), and the freedom from supervision \u201cnot only as to the result to be accomplished but also as to the means and methods that are to be utilized in the performance of the work.\u201d <em>Maniscalco </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>327 Mass. 211, 212 (1951), quoting <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>315 Mass. 371, 372-373 (1944). Contrary to the interpretation given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>board, the test is not so narrow as to require that a worker be entirely \u201cfree from direction and control from outside forces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Here, the agreement requires only that the newspapers be delivered in good condition and before a certain time each day. Beyond those requirements, the performance of a carrier\u2019s delivery service is completely within the carrier\u2019s decision. Carriers may deliver on foot, by bicycle, automobile, motorcycle, or otherwise. They are free to adopt any manner of dress or wrap the newspapers in any way. They may agree to perform services for their customers other than the delivery of newspapers and to charge separately for these services. Without approval from the News, they may expand the number of customers on their routes or be assisted by anyone in the delivery of the newspapers. In fact, once carriers receive their newspapers from the News, they are entirely free from its supervision in performing the services for which they were engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Factors relied on by the board in considering this part \u2014 that the suggested manufacturer\u2019s price of the newspapers is determined by the News; that subscribers may complain directly to the News if dissatisfied with a carrier\u2019s performance; that the circulation manager is responsible for the carriers; and that the News may terminate the carrier agreement at any time \u2014 go to the carriers\u2019 relationship with the News and are not indices of control over the details of the carriers\u2019 performance as contemplated by \u00a7 2 <em>(\u00e1). </em>The record demonstrates that the carriers pick up and deliver the newspapers however they wish. As found by the board, \u201c[t]he mode, manner and means of delivery are up to the carrier.\u201d That is enough to satisfy part (a) of the ABC test.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">(b) The second part of the test involves two separate criteria, and, if the employer demonstrates either, part (b) will be met. The question asked is whether the services are performed outside of the usual course of business of the enterprise or whether the services are performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise. The board considered only the former criteria and, because it determined that the carriers\u2019 services were performed \u201cin the usual course of the employer\u2019s business,\u201d concluded that the News had failed this part of the test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>In light of the fact that the News itself defines its business as \u201cpublishing and distributing\u201d a daily newspaper, we agree that the carriers\u2019 services are performed in \u201cthe usual course of [the News\u2019s] business.\u201d See <em>Mattatuck Museum-Mattatuck Historical Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>238 Conn. <em>273, </em>280 (1996) (art instructor services performed \u201con a regular or continuous basis\u201d within art museum); <em>Bigfoot\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Review of the Indus. Comm\u2019n of Utah, </em>710 P.2d 180, 181 (Utah 1985) (musicians performed \u201cusual and customary\u201d activity of beer bar); <em>Yurs </em>v. <em>Director of Labor, </em>94 Ill. App. 2d 96, 104 (1968) (organist played music as \u201cusual part of\u201d funeral home\u2019s business).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The board erred, however, in failing to consider the second component of the either-or test, which, on these facts, is easily met. The record demonstrates that, although carriers may pick up newspapers at the company\u2019s distribution center, most newspapers are delivered from house to house on a public route within one or more local communities. Other newspapers are delivered to bundle drops, stores, and vending machines. It is clear that all of the carriers make deliveries outside of premises owned by the News or which could fairly be deemed its \u201cplaces of business.\u201d It is this type of inquiry that is contemplated by the second prong of part (b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">(c) The third part of the test asks whether the worker is \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.\u201d The division asserts that this language requires proof that a carrier\u2019s delivery services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>constitute in fact an independently established enterprise capable of operating without the benefit of its relationship with the News, or another newspaper publishing company. The board\u2019s determination that the carriers are not engaged in such an enterprise was based on its finding that they \u201cdo not have a proprietary interest [in their delivery services] to the extent that he/she can operate without a hindrance from any individual or force whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This legal standard, however, is far too stringent. Its literal application would deny independent contractor status to almost any worker whose trade, occupation, profession or business, although established and operated independently, remains economically viable solely because of its contractual relationships with other entities, and would render superfluous any examination of criteria set forth in part (a) (freedom from control over performance of services) or part (b) (performance of services outside the usual course or places of business) of the ABC test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The better approach to the evaluation required by part (c) is to consider whether the service in question could be viewed as an independent trade or business because the worker is capable of performing the service to anyone wishing to avail themselves of the services or, conversely, whether the nature of the business compels the worker to depend on a single employer for the continuation of the services. As stated recently by the Appeals Court in <em>Boston Bicycle Couriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Deputy Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (2002), part (c) \u201cseeks to discern whether the worker is wearing the hat of an employee of the employing company, or is wearing the hat of his own independent enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">In <em>Boston Bicycle Couriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Deputy Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, supra, </em>the Appeals Court affirmed a decision of the board that bicycle couriers were employees of a delivery business and not independent contractors under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 2. There, the plaintiff\u2019s business consisted entirely of the pick up and delivery of letters and packages on an on-call basis. The business thus was virtually indistinguishable from the services performed by the bicycle couriers themselves. See <em>id. </em>at 483 (\u201cwithout delivery drivers ... [the plaintiff\u2019s business] could not operate\u201d). Due to the specialized nature of the plaintiff\u2019s business, the option of performing the same services for similar companies was, as a practical matter, unavailable to the bicycle couriers. See <em>id. </em>at 481. In addition, the record in that case showed that the plaintiff provided couriers with radios and pagers, purchased workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the couriers, and assumed the risk of loss for nonpayment of delivery charges. See <em>id. </em>at 482. None of the above factors that supported an employment relationship between the plaintiff and its bicycle carriers in the <em>Boston Bicycle Couriers </em>case, however, are present in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-35\">By its very nature, the business of delivering newspapers is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>not limited to a single employer, and nothing with respect to the carriers\u2019 job performance in this case is unique to one certain newspaper publisher. The carriers use their own vehicles, not company vehicles, and are compensated for mileage. They are not paid an hourly wage, but purchase newspapers from the News and resell them to subscribers at (theoretically, at least) a price of their own choosing. Carriers may independently contract with subscribers to perform other tasks (such as bringing milk bottles to the customer\u2019s door) and may charge as they wish for those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">It is significant that, regardless of whether carriers control their own routes, accounts, or subscribers list, the carriers are free to deliver newspapers (or other publications, such as advertising flyers) for anyone who wishes to contract with them, even competitors of the News. The record indicates that several of the carriers in fact act as carriers for other publishers and are paid on the basis of work performed for those publishers, without regard to their contractual obligations to the News. In determining that the carriers are not engaged in an independent business or trade, the board noted that none of the carriers advertised their delivery services. This observation misses the mark. The fact of the matter is that the carriers are free to advertise their delivery services, if they so desire, in an attempt to increase the number of subscribers on their routes or to acquire similar relationships with other publishing companies. The breadth of each carrier\u2019s delivery service is a function, not only of the original subscriber list given to the carrier by the News, but of the individual initiative of the carrier. See <em>Shoppers Guide </em>v. <em>South Dakota Dep\u2019t of Labor Unemployment Ins. Div., </em>551 N.W.2d 584, 587 (S.D. 1996). This in itself is compelling evidence that a carrier is an entrepreneur and performs his or her newspaper delivery service for the News in that capacity within the meaning of part (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The result we reach is consistent with decisions reached by other courts in analogous circumstances. See <em>id. </em>at 587-588 (applying two-part statutory test to determine that newspaper carriers were independent contractors and not employees of newspaper publisher); <em>Venango Newspapers </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>158 Pa. Commw. 379, 387-388 (1993) (same). But see <em>Times-Argus Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Employment &amp; Training, </em>146 Vt. 320, 323-324 (1985) (board\u2019s finding that drivers delivering newspapers on rural routes were newspaper employees not contrary to evidence).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">4.

L. c. 151A, \u00a7 6 (o), see note 4, <em>supra, </em>demonstrates a legislative intent to include adult carriers (over the age of eighteen) within the statute\u2019s scope. We read \u00a7 6 (o) as an unambiguous expression that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>children are not to be deemed employees merely because they have a paper route before or after school, and, thus, are categorically exempt from the tripartite test of \u00a7 2. Moreover, if the list of workers exempt from the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d under \u00a7 6 were considered to be exclusive, the case-by-case approach provided by \u00a7 2 would be unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\">We likewise are unpersuaded by the division\u2019s argument that the Legislature\u2019s failure to adopt an exemption for adult newspaper carriers similar to that under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3306 (c)(15)(B) (2000), indicates a deliberate choice by the Legislature that there be no corresponding exclusion under G. L. c. 151 A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It should be noted that, while under the common-law test for employment, the degree of control is the dominant factor, for purposes of the \u201cABC\u201d test, it carries no more weight than the other two factors that are to be considered. Thus, notwithstanding that the worker could be considered an independent contractor under common law, the worker may still be deemed an employee for purposes of G. L. c. 151A under \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The division\u2019s assertion that the News\u2019s \u201cplaces of business,\u201d for purposes of the second part of the ABC test, includes the geographic area tracked by all of the News\u2019s delivery routes, is illogical. The one decision cited by the division in support of its position, <em>Richardson Bros. </em>v. <em>Board of Review of the Dep\u2019t of Employment Sec., </em>198 Ill. App. 3d 422 (1990), concerned truck drivers who distributed garden plants to retail outlets, and not carriers who deliver newspapers to private homes. To the extent that language employed by the Illinois court suggests that a newspaper delivery route is a newspaper company\u2019s place of business for purposes of G. L. c. 151A, we respectfully disagree. See <em>id. </em>at 430, citing <em>Eutectic Welding Alloys Corp. </em>v. <em>Rauch, </em>1 Ill. 2d 328 (1953) (\u201cwhere an employing unit assigns a specific area to an individual for the purpose of selling its product . . . that area is the place of business of the enterprise\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In support of its position, the division cites decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting identical, or nearly identical, provisions in other State unemployment compensation statutes. See <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>State, </em>598 P.2d 84, 86-87 (Alaska 1979), quoting <em>Schuffenhauer </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Sec., </em>86 Wash. 2d 233, 238 (1975) (business must establish \u201centerprise created and existing separate and apart from the relationship with the particular employer, an enterprise that will survive termination of that relationship\u201d); <em>AFM Messenger Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Sec., </em>198 Ill. 2d 380, 401 (2001), quoting <em>Jack Bradley, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Sec., </em>146 Ill. 2d 61, 78 (1991) (\u201cemployee\u2019s entrepreneurial enterprise must enjoy a \u2018degree of economic independence such that the enterprise could survive any relationship with the particular person contracting for services\u2019 \u201d); <em>Lewiston Daily Sun </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Comm\u2019n, </em>733 A.2d 344, 347 (Me. 1999) (must prove proprietary interest in occupation such that able to \u201coperate without hindrance from any source\u201d); <em>Matter of Hendrickson\u2019s Health Care Serv., </em>462 N.W.2d 655, 659 (S.D. 1990) (\u201ccalls for an enterprise created and existing separate and apart from the relationship with the particular employer; an enterprise that will survive the termination of that relationship\u201d). These decisions may provide guidance but are not binding on this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\">It is hardly remarkable that courts applying the above standard, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>almost invariably conclude that the employer has failed to cony its burden under part (c) of the ABC test. See, e.g., <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 87 (log cutters harvesting timber on land owned by lumbermill not independent contractors); <em>AFM Messenger Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 407 (drivers\u2019 delivery business not established independently of messenger service company); <em>Lewiston Daily Sun </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 347-348 (newspaper reporter employee not customarily engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>independently established trade for purposes of part [c] of ABC test); <em>Matter of Hendrickson\u2019s Health Care Serv., supra </em>(nurses and nurse\u2019s aides providing in-home health care to business clients were employees of business).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b201-37\">To meet its burden of proof under \u00a7 2 (c), Boston Bicycle Couriers, Inc. (BBC), had been required to demonstrate that: \u201c(1) [the bicycle courier] customarily engaged in an independent courier delivery service on his own; (2) [his] courier delivery service operated wholly independently of his work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>for BBC; and (3) [his] business was established and running.\u201d <em>Boston Bicycle Couriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Deputy Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 479 (2002). These requirements are unnecessarily rigid. Moreover, criteria based on the factual circumstances of each individual worker, rather than on the nature of the services performed, would have the anomalous result of inconsistent status determinations with respect to workers performing identical services for the same company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Past decisions in which the division has determined, on facts similar to this case, that newspaper earners are independent contractors; also are instructive, but not determinative. See Essex County Newspapers, No. 292334 (Jan. 24, 2001); Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., No. S-N0025 (Dec. 3, 1986). We note that these decisions were those of a review examiner that, unlike this case, were never adopted or affirmed by the board, which is bound by case law and by its own precedent, but not by prior decisions of a review examiner. See <em>Pizura </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>331 Mass. 286, 291-292 (1954); <em>Potris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Employment &amp; Training, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 735, 738 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
