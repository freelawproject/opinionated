Krapf (defendant) appealed from a declaratory judgment ordering him to pay to his former spouse, Constance E. Krapf (plaintiff), an amount equal to the military pension income she would have received pursuant to the parties\u2019 separation agreement (agreement) had the defendant, after the divorce, not voluntarily and without the plaintiff\u2019s consent waived his military retirement benefits in order to receive Veterans Administration (VA) disability payments. The defendant also appealed from the judge\u2019s order that he pay the plaintiff\u2019s appellate attorney\u2019s fees pendente lite. The Appeals Court affirmed the declaratory judgment with modifications. <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 485, 492 (2002). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We conclude that the judge acted properly in construing and specifically enforcing the agreement and in awarding the plaintiff appellate counsel fees, pendente lite. Accordingly, we affirm the declaratory judgment, as modified by the Appeals Court, see <em>id.., </em>and the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The core facts are undisputed. In 1984, after twenty-seven years of marriage and three children, the defendant filed for divorce from the plaintiff. At the time, the plaintiff was approximately fifty-one years old; the record does not disclose either her health status or her employment status. The defendant was approximately forty-nine years old. He was on inactive or reserve duty in the United States Army. According to his counsel at oral argument, the defendant was \u201cable bodied,\u201d in good health, and suffered from no known or suspected disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">On December 5, 1985, the parties entered into the separation agreement, three provisions of which are germane to this case. First, the parties agreed that the plaintiff would receive $200 a month in alimony for seven months, and that \u201c[thereafter, neither [party] will make any claim against the other for alimony, support or'maintenance.\u201d Second, the parties agreed that the defendant would \u201ccause to be entered by the Middlesex Probate Court an order allocating half his pension rights with the U.S. Army to the [plaintiff].\u201d Third, the parties provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>that, if the agreement were breached, the breaching party \u201cshall be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by the non-breaching party to enforce\u201d the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement was incorporated in the divorce judgment but survived as an independent contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">On June 2, 1986, a judge in the Probate and Family Court entered a qualified court order, see 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(2) (2000),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> directing the Secretary of the Army to apportion to the plaintiff fifty per cent of the defendant\u2019s \u201cdisposable retire[ment] or retainer pay\u201d accrued as of December 5, 1985, the date of the judgment of divorce nisi.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The qualified court order stated that it was \u201cintended to carry out an approved property settlement\u201d entered in connection with the judgment nisi. In May, 1994, the defendant separated from the army after thirty-seven years of service. Both he and the plaintiff began receiving their respective fifty per cent allotment of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>military retirement benefit, including periodic cost-of-living increases, directly from the Department of Defense. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In early 1997, without the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, the defendant applied for VA disability benefits on the ground that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from his army service. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1110 (2000) (wartime disability). In April, 1997, the VA classified the defendant as ten per cent disabled. In April, 1998, it reclassified him as fifty per cent disabled; and in June, 2000, it reclassified him as one hundred per cent disabled. With each determination of increased disability, the defendant received a commensurate increase in VA disability income. However, because Federal law prohibits a military retiree from \u201cdouble dipping\u201d into Federal retirement accounts, see <em>Mansell </em>v. <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 583 (1989), the defendant executed a waiver that reduced his military retirement payments one dollar for every dollar of VA disability payments he received. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5305 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 Because the waiver applied to the defendant\u2019s total military retirement pay, his election to forgo his army pension reduced not only his own military retirement income but also that of the plaintiff, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">April, 1997, reduced from $1,009.04 to $969.09 a month;</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">May, 1998, reduced from $969.09 to $797.38 a month;</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">June, 2000, reduced from $787.38 to $145 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">As of April 4, 2001, the defendant\u2019s total VA disability payment was $2,166, an amount that included a stipend for his current wife. He received an additional $145 each month in military retirement pay. The plaintiff received only $145 each month in military retirement pay. In other words, after he obtained a one hundred per cent disability rating, the defendant\u2019s service-related income more than doubled, while his former wife\u2019s service-related income fell by approximately eighty-six per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">On July 19, 2000, the plaintiff filed a contempt complaint against the defendant in the Probate and Family Court, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>that he violated the qualified court order by \u201cunilaterally\u201d electing to make changes in his disposable military retirement income that resulted in the reduction of her own pension income. On September 18, 2000, a judge in the Probate and Family Court summarily dismissed the complaint with prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On October 6, 2000, the plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231A in the Probate and Family Court. She alleged that the defendant\u2019s actions in seeking and obtaining VA disability pay \u201cdefeated the intentions of the parties\u201d under the agreement that the plaintiff would receive one-half of the defendant\u2019s military retirement pay. The plaintiff sought a declaration of the rights of the parties concerning the VA and Department of Defense payments, an award of an amount that would \u201crestore [the plaintiff] to the financial position she would have enjoyed from April, 1997 to date,\u201d and counsel fees. The defendant answered and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (5) and Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1994). He claimed that he was in compliance with the agreement that the plaintiff receive fifty per cent of his disposable retired or retainer pay accmed as of December 5, 1985, and thus there was no controversy. He also claimed that the complaint for declaratory judgment was an impermissible attempt to circumvent final and binding determination on the merits occasioned by the dismissal with prejudice of the contempt action. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 41 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 803 (1974). Waiving a hearing, the parties submitted the case on the pleadings and on a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On April 4, 2001, the judge issued a memorandum of deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>sion and entered declaratory judgment for the plaintiff. She concluded that the defendant impermissibly modified the agreement by divesting himself of an asset that he had legally pledged to the plaintiff in which she thus had a vested interest, and from which she had a reasonable expectation of receiving income. See <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, </em>432 Mass. 390, 398-399 (2000). She further held that, in so acting, the defendant violated his fiduciary obligation to his former spouse, see <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>233 Mass. 351, 370 (1919), the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in all contracts, see <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>361 Mass. 24, 33 (1972), and the court\u2019s authority and obligation to provide equitably for divorcing spouses. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. The judge \u201cspecifically enforc[ed]\u201d the agreement by ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff an amount that, when added to the amount the plaintiff currently received, was the equivalent of fifty per cent of his pension \u201cif same was in payout status.\u201d The judge also ordered the defendant to pay arrearages accumulated from April, 1997, to the judgment date. She declined to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201c[a]s this is a case of first impression</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 52 (b), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996), on the ground that the judgment constituted a division of his military disability pay in violation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301 (2000) (exempting VA disability payments from certain creditors\u2019 claims and enforcement mechanisms). The judge denied the motion, and the defendant appealed from both the April 4, 2001, declaratory judgment and the denial of his reconsideration motion. In May, 2001, the plaintiff filed a motion to restrain the defendant from diminishing his assets and a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pendente lite to defend against the appeal. Another Probate and Family Court allowed both motions, and the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of both orders. When the motion was denied, he timely filed a second notice of appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also filed motions to stay the award of attorney\u2019s fees in the Probate and Family Court and in the Appeals Court, respectively. Both motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>On the main appeal, the Appeals Court affirmed the order of the trial judge in all respects, except that it modified the judgment to include \u201ca declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to receive from the defendant, pursuant to the agreement, a sum of money per month equivalent to fifty per cent of the monthly military retirement pay that the defendant would receive if his military retirement pay were not reduced by the disability payments minus the monthly military retirement pay the plaintiff receives directly from the Department of Defense.\u201d <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 485, 492 (2002). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">2. <em>Separation agreement. A </em>policy of long standing in our Commonwealth encourages divorcing couples to resolve their marital disputes by mutual agreement rather than resort to litigation. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 1A; <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 436 (1976); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 720 n.3 (1997). To that end, our laws permit divorcing parties to enter into written separation agreements, which they may elect to survive the divorce judgment as independent contracts. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>389 Mass. 21, 24 (1983) (noting Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cstrong policy . . . favor[ing] survival of separation agreements, even when such an intent of the parties is merely implied\u201d). Such surviving separation agreements may secure with finality the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations concerning the division of marital assets, among other things, according to established contract principles. See, e.g., <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 106 (1994); <em>DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 231, 236-237 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">However, spouses who enter into agreements with each other are held to standards higher than those we tolerate in the arm\u2019s-length transactions of the marketplace. Parties to a separation agreement stand as fiduciaries to each other, and will be held to the highest standards of good faith and fair dealing in the performance of their contractual obligations. See <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Eaton, supra </em>at 370. See also <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, supra </em>at 109. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Moreover, a separation agreement is a \u201cjudicially sanctioned contract\u201d that is valid and enforceable only if and as approved by the judge. <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>393 Mass. 20, 26 (1984), cert, denied, 470 U.S. 1027 (1985) (Abrams, J., dissenting). In deciding whether to approve a separation agreement, judges have their own independent duty to ensure that the division of the marital estate is fair and reasonable in accordance with the factors set out in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. See <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, supra </em>at 436-437. Cf. <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>409 Mass. 727, 732 (1991) (judge\u2019s finding agreement fair and reasonable not explicitly stated on record did not warrant reconsideration of issue). Among other things, a judge must ensure that the division of marital property is equitable in the circumstances. The equitable division of marital assets cannot be considered in a vacuum; property division is but one aspect of the finances of the divorcing household that the judge must consider. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34; <em>Caccia </em>v. <em>Caccia, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 382 (1996). See also <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 759, 761 (1989) (combination of alimony and equitable division pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, \u201cmust make sense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The Legislature has recognized that pensions often constitute valuable marital assets. General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, specifically directs the court to consider the equitable division of \u201cretirement benefits,\u201d including \u201cmilitary retirement benefits if qualified under and to the extent provided by federal law,\u201d when apportioning the marital estate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 504, 508-509 (1991) (dividing military retirement benefit as marital asset). The parties in this case do not dispute that, at the time they entered into the agreement, the defendant\u2019s \u201cpension rights with the U.S. Army\u201d constituted divisible marital property to be equitably divided in accordance with G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. Their disagreement centers on whether the defendant in fact breached the agreement by waiving his military retirement benefits in order to receive VA disability benefits. In other words, their dispute is a matter of contract interpretation, which is a question of State law to be decided by the court. The agreement does not define the term \u201cpension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>rights with the U.S. Army,\u201d and the judge made no specific findings regarding the parties\u2019 intent in using those words. However, we must construe the agreement in a manner that \u201cappears to be in accord with justice and common sense and the probable intention of the parties ... [in order to] accomplish an honest and straightforward end [and to avoid], if possible, any construction of a contract that is unreasonable or inequitable.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State St. Trust Co., </em>270 Mass. 140, 153 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Applying these basic contract principles, we have no difficulty in concluding that the parties intended the term \u201cpension rights with the U.S. Army\u201d to mean exactly what it says: the totality of benefits due to the defendant on his retirement from the army. We draw our conclusions from the entire agreement itself and from the context of its execution. See <em>id.; DeCristofaro </em>v. <em>DeCristofaro, supra </em>at 237, and cases cited. Although the parties have not furnished us with their financial statements as of the date of the judgment nisi, we infer from the agreement that the defendant\u2019s military pension was among their most substantial marital assets. It was, at any rate, valuable enough to the plaintiff in this long-term marriage to induce her to waive any entitlement to alimony, support, or maintenance for an agreement that gave her an enforceable, vested interest in one-half of the defendant\u2019s military retirement benefits. It is highly unlikely that she negotiated such an agreement intending to give the defendant carte blanche to reduce the value of her pension to a pittance in order to benefit himself. Nothing in the agreement suggests such authorization. We think it far more likely that the agreement gave her a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that she would receive pension income in her later years. See <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, 478 (2000). We also credit the representation of the defendant\u2019s counsel that, as of the date of the agreement, the defendant was able bodied and no longer on active duty, and that neither party had reason to anticipate a disability claim stemming from his active service. That the defendant waived the joint military retirement rights unilaterally further confirms our conclusion that, at the time they entered into the agreement, each party expected and intended that the plaintiff would receive one-half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>defendant\u2019s full \u201cpension rights with the U.S. Army\u201d when he retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The defendant challenges this construction of the contract by claiming now that the plaintiff continues to reap the benefits of her bargain and that he had no control over the evaporation of her pension income. But the defendant\u2019s military retirement benefit did not become essentially worthless because of changes in the law or changes in the market. It became worthless because of the defendant\u2019s unilateral and voluntary action. We respect the defendant\u2019s long years of service and sacrifice in the armed forces, but cannot escape the conclusion that by converting his and the plaintiff\u2019s military retirement benefits to VA disability benefits for his own benefit, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>he denied the plaintiff the fruits of her bargain in breach of his continuing duty to exercise the utmost good faith and fair dealing in performing his obligations under the agreement. See <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, </em>432 Mass. 390, 398-399 (2000) (breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not require showing of bad faith; lack of good faith may be inferred by considering totality of circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">This case bears strong similarities to <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, supra. </em>There, a party to a postdivorce settlement agreement agreed to bequeath the majority of his estate to the children of his former wife. Subsequently, he poured most of his assets into a revocable inter vivas trust in favor of his new wife, with the result that, when he died, the children of his former wife were left with nothing in the probate estate and very little from the trust. Relying on one hundred years of contract law, we held that, by destroying or injuring the rights of the children of his first marriage to receive the benefit of his agreement with his former wife, the decedent breached his continuing duty of good faith and fair dealing. See <em>id. </em>at 398-400, and cases cited. We rejected the trustees\u2019 argument that the agreement merely required the decedent to leave the bulk of his \u201cprobate\u201d estate to his heirs, while leaving the decedent free to empty the probate estate of all value. <em>Id. </em>at 399. A court of equity, we said, will not countenance such \u201cquestionable logic,\u201d nor permit \u201can individual to have an estate to live on but not an estate from which his debts could be paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The defendant is correct that he was permitted by Federal law to seek and obtain VA disability payments, and that the characterization of his disability and degree of impairment rested with the VA. But a court in equity will not sanction voluntary action that amounts to an \u201cevasion of the spirit of the bargain.\u201d <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 110 (1994), quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 205 comment d (1981). See <em>Nile </em>v. <em>Nile, supra </em>at 398-399. To conclude otherwise would negate a divorcing spouse\u2019s high obligation of good faith and fair dealing in both the execution and the performance of a surviving separation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge improperly transgressed the declaratory judgment statute by effectively converting a declaratory judgment action under G. L. c. 231A into a modification proceeding under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37, and then reapportioning the division of marital property contrary to established law. See <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 409 (1988) (\u201cThe parties to a divorce may not relitigate the division of property that already has been the subject of a proceeding under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34\u201d). See also <em>Taverna </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass. 882, 886 (2000); <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 244 (1987). First, the Legislature has directed courts to construe and administer the declaratory judgment remedy broadly in order \u201cto remove, and to afford relief from, uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, duties, status and other legal relations.\u201d G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9. Second, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, a judge may order monetary relief in a declaratory judgment action. See <em>Trustees of Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>331 Mass. 219, 227-228 (1954). Finally, as the trial judge noted, it was the defendant himself, and not the judge, who unilaterally and impermissibly accomplished a de facto modification of the agreement. The judge merely exercised her well-established equitable authority to construe the agreement to effectuate the parties\u2019 intent in circumstances where the contracted-for method of paying the plaintiff her equitable share of the marital estate was no longer available because of the defendant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">While not dispositive on this matter of first impression in Massachusetts, we note that many other State appellate courts have ordered similar relief against military retirees who waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the military retirement benefits pledged to a former spouse under a separation agreement in order to obtain VA disability payments. See, e.g., <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>105 Md. App. 678, 685-686 (1995); <em>In re Marriage of Stone, 274 </em>Mont. 331, 336 (1995); <em>Blissit </em>v. <em>Blissit, </em>122 Ohio App. 3d 727, 733 (1997); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>37 S.W.3d 892, 897 (Tenn. 2001). See also <em>Clauson </em>v. <em>Clauson, </em>831 P.2d 1257, 1263 (Alaska 1992) (court may \u201cconsider[] veterans\u2019 disability benefits as they affect spousal maintenance or the equitable allocation of the parties\u2019 assets\u201d). But see <em>Matter of the Marriage of Pierce, </em>26 Kan. App. 2d 236, 242 (1999).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Mansell </em>v. <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581 (1989), does not compel a different result, but holds that the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408 (2000), which provides for the divisibility of military retirement pensions, does not permit State courts \u201cto treat as property divisible upon divorce military retirement pay that has been waived to receive veterans\u2019 disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judgment in this case does not divide the defendant\u2019s VA disability benefits in contravention of the <em>Mansell </em>decision; the judgment merely enforced the defendant\u2019s contractual obligation to his former wife, which he may satisfy from any of his resources.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nothing in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408 or in the <em>Mansell </em>case precludes a veteran from voluntarily entering into a contract whereby he agrees to pay a former spouse a sum of money that may come from the VA disability benefits he receives. In upholding the declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>judgment, however, we agree with the Appeals Court that the judgment must be modified to declare the respective obligations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">3. <em>Other Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">(a) <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The defendant claims that the judge lacked authority in a declaratory judgment action to award the plaintiff appellate counsel fees pendente lite \u201cpursuant to\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38. He does not claim that the amount of fees awarded was unreasonable. We agree with the Appeals Court that this issue is most properly addressed by resort to the plain language of the contract. The agreement provides that a party in breach of its provisions shall be \u201cresponsible for all reasonable costs incurred by the non-breaching party to enforce\u201d the agreement. Although we recognize that the judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for attomey\u2019s fees to prosecute the declaratory judgment action on the ground that the case presented an issue of first impression,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it was also reasonable for the judge, in the context of this dispute concerning the interpretation and enforcement of a separation agreement, to construe the agreement to require the payment of such fees once the defendant was adjudged in breach and the defendant elected to continue with the litigation. See <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Retardation (No.1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 468 (1997) (attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded by contract of stipulation; by statute, or by rules concerning damages). Cf. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38 (permitting award of attorney\u2019s fees at judge\u2019s discretion in original or subsidiary actions under G. L. c. 208).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-29\">(b) <em>Res judicata. </em>The defendant claims that the plaintiff was barred from bringing her subsequent action for declaratory judgment because the dismissal with prejudice of her contempt complaint was res judicata on the issue of his liability under the agreement. The Appeals Court rejected this argument on the ground that the record was not sufficiently developed to enable the court to determine the judge\u2019s reasons for dismissing the complaint for contempt with prejudice. <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 485, 492 (2002). We agree. It is plausible, as the defendant argues, that the judge intended the dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>contempt complaint with prejudice as a ruling on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant violated the agreement when he waived his military retirement benefits for VA disability payments. It is equally plausible, as the plaintiff argues, that the judge dismissed the contempt complaint with prejudice because she concluded that an action for civil contempt was the wrong vehicle to resolve an issue of contract interpretation. See <em>Diver </em>v. <em>Diver, </em>402 Mass. 599, 603 (1988) (civil contempt cannot be found absent proof of \u201ca clear and unequivocal command\u201d and \u201cability to comply\u201d). The defendant bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff\u2019s declaratory judgment action should have been dismissed. He has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">(c) <em>Due process. </em>In his supplemental brief to this court, the defendant claims for the first time that the judge denied him due process by failing to afford the defendant the opportunity to be heard on all relevant issues.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the issue is untimely raised, we do not consider it. See Mass. R. A. R 16 (a) (4), as amended 367 Mass. 921 (1975), and Mass. R. A.

In a subsequent pleading in the declaratory judgment action, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant argued at the contempt hearing that, because the defendant\u2019s actions were not so culpable as to give rise to a contempt judgment, the plaintiff should have filed either a modification complaint or a declaratory judgment action and the contempt action should be dismissed.
