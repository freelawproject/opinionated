On July 12, 2002, a judge of the Probate and Family Court awarded sole legal and primary physical custody of Kali to her mother, and visitation and partial custody to her father. The father appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>and this court granted his application for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the findings of the probate judge. The mother and the father began dating in 1994 and the next year began living together in the father\u2019s home in Conway, Massachusetts. In January, 1998, the mother gave birth to Kali.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The relationship between the father and the mother (both of whom worked) rapidly deteriorated, in part because of disputes regarding Kali\u2019s care and the father\u2019s often extended work schedule. As a result, Kali and her mother moved to her mother\u2019s family home in Montague in the spring of 1998. They returned to the father\u2019s home later that year after the mother and the father reconciled, but moved back to Montague in January, 1999. In March, 1999, the mother moved to Ledyard, Connecticut, to work in Groton for an employer who also had operations in Springfield. She initially anticipated that she would be transferred back to Springfield, which is located near Montague.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">When the mother moved to Connecticut, both parents agreed that it would be best for Kali to live with her father at his home in Conway during the week and spend weekends with her mother. During her weekdays in Conway, Kali was principally in the care of a day care provider whom the mother had previously selected. Typically, Kali would be awakened by her father at approximately 5 a.m. and taken to the day care provider\u2019s home by 5:45 a.m. The father then left for his job as a mason, which required him to travel throughout western Massachusetts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>and occasionally Vermont. He would pick Kali up between 4:15 and 5 p.m. and spend each evening with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">On the weekends, Kali visited her mother in Connecticut or the mother returned to Massachusetts to spend time with Kali either in Montague or at the father\u2019s home. As the father and the mother still maintained their relationship, the father often joined them on weekends. Although the mother claims that she paid for Kali\u2019s care during their weekends together and contributed $100 a week toward Kali\u2019s Massachusetts expenses, the father denies that the latter contribution was ever made, and the judge made no findings on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">These custodial arrangements continued until June, 2000, when the relationship between the father and the mother ended. The father then instituted the present action to establish paternity and obtain legal custody of Kali. In August, 2000, the probate judge adjudicated the father\u2019s paternity, and entered a temporary order awarding legal and physical custody of Kali jointly between the mother and the father, with each to have physical custody of Kali on alternating weeks. The judge also appointed a guardian ad litem (guardian) to observe Kali in each parental setting. Thereafter, during the weeks spent in Massachusetts with her father, Kali\u2019s daily schedule was the same as it had been during the previous year. During the weeks Kali spent with her mother in Connecticut, Kali was awakened at approximately 5:45 a.m. in order to be at day care by 6:45 a.m., where she would stay until 3:30 or 4 p.m. when her mother finished work.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Trial commenced seventeen months later, in January, 2002. The witnesses included the guardian, the day care provider, a friend of the father, family, and a clinical psychologist. The guardian testified that the parties should share legal custody and that primary physical custody should reside with the father. In July, 2002, the judge entered his final order, supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. The judge awarded legal custody of Kali to the mother, and divided physical custody between the father and the mother corresponding with the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>year and vacations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the school year, Kali was to reside principally with her mother, with the father having custody of her three weekends a month. During the summer, Kali was to reside principally with her father, with the mother having custody every other weekend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> School vacation periods were to be split between the mother and the father. In addition, the father was to have unimpeded access to Kali\u2019s educational and health records, and was to be informed at least one week before, and have written input into, any major nonemergency decision with respect to her upbringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The judge\u2019s custody award was based on his conclusion that these arrangements were in the best interests of the child. This conclusion was based, in turn, on a number of findings, including, inter alla, that the mother and the father are not able to make shared decisions relative to their daughter\u2019s welfare, and joint legal custody would not be in Kali\u2019s interest<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; that the mother provides well for Kali\u2019s physical needs, is concerned with her health and educational issues, and is the one who \u201cpreoccupies herself\u201d with Kali\u2019s care regarding clothing, hygiene, doctor\u2019s appointments, and child care providers; that the father, while clearly fond of his daughter, and engaged in a positive relationship with her, does not appear to be \u201coverly concerned\u201d about Kali\u2019s physical needs \u201cbeyond the basics,\u201d and has \u201cminimized\u201d her medical needs and her need for medical care in general; that the father works long hours, often involving overtime, resulting in Kali\u2019s spending most of her time during the week in day care; that the mother has more flexible hours and is able to spend more time with Kali during the weekdays; that the mother is more \u201cattuned\u201d to Kali\u2019s medical, educational, and daily needs and is better able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>provide for Kali\u2019s welfare and physical needs during the week; that the father is more \u201cattuned\u201d to many of the activities that he and Kali can pursue together when time constraints because of his work schedule and her school do not interfere; and that it is important that Kali be able to spend as much time as possible with her father on weekends, holidays, and during school vacations to continue to foster their close and positive relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">2. <em>The father\u2019s claims. </em>On appeal, the father claims that (1) the decision of the probate judge was in error because it violated the prohibition against gender discrimination contained in art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments (prohibiting discrimination based on sex); (2) the probate judge applied the wrong standard (\u201cbest interests of the child\u201d) when he should have applied the \u201csubstantial change in circumstances\u201d standard applicable to custody modification proceedings brought under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and (3) the probate judge failed to acknowledge adequately or consider adequately the standards for awarding custody to unmarried parents set forth in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">a. <em>Claims under the Constitution and G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20. </em>We can readily dispose of two of the father\u2019s three claims for relief. With respect to his constitutional claim, the father does little more than cite the Massachusetts Constitution and make an assertion that the probate judge\u2019s order would have been different had the genders of the parties been reversed. This claim does not rise to the level of appellate argument, and we decline to consider it. See Mass. R. A. R 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975) (appellant\u2019s arguments shall contain \u201ccitations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on\u201d); <em>Adoption of Kimberly, </em>414 Mass. 526, 536-537 (1993) (three-sentence argument did not assist court with meaningful citation of authority and did not rise to level of acceptable ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>pellate argument).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">We also decline to consider the father\u2019s claim that the probate judge should have applied the \u201csubstantial change in the circumstances\u201d standard applicable to modification actions brought under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20, rather than the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard applicable to custody determinations under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>The premise of the father\u2019s claim is that G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c), operated to give him sole legal custody of Kali when the mother moved to Connecticut and \u201crelinquish[ed]\u201d Kali\u2019s care to the father,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and consequently, any change in Kali\u2019s legal custody would constitute a modification under \u00a7 20. While the mother disputes the father\u2019s contention that she \u201crelinquished\u201d the care of Kali within the meaning of \u00a7 10 <em>(c), </em>it is not necessary for us to consider the merits of their various points. It is clear from the record that the case in the Probate Court was tried under G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>not G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20, and on the theory that, prior to the trial proceedings, the mother and the father had joint custody of Kali. The father\u2019s arguments that G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (c), applies, that he was the sole legal custodian at the time the proceedings commenced, and that that status cannot be modified in the absence of a \u201csubstantial change in the circumstances\u201d (as required by \u00a7 20) were not made to the probate judge and are waived. See <em>Baccanti </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>434 Mass. 787, 803 (2001), and cases cited. While this court has, in exceptional cases, exercised its discretion to consider a claim not raised in the trial court where the opposing party would not be prejudiced by such consideration and consideration was necessary in order to prevent injustice or resolve an important question of law, see <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>395 Mass. 107, 111-112 (1985), those circumstances are not present in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernette, </em>398 Mass. 658, 667 (1986), quoting <em>Santa Maria </em>v. <em>Trotto, </em>297 Mass. 442, 447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>(1937) (\u201ctheory of law on which by assent a case is tried cannot be disregarded when the case comes before an appellate court for review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">b. <em>The requirements of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 </em>(a). We turn now to the father\u2019s sole preserved claim on appeal, that the probate judge failed to consider adequately the statutory factors set forth in G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Section 10 (a) gives a probate judge the power to award custody of nonmarital children \u201cto the mother or the father or to them jointly ... as may be appropriate in the best interests of the child.\u201d G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), first par. In reaching a decision on custody, the statute further provides that the probate judge \u201cshall\u201d (1) preserve \u201cto the extent possible\u201d the relationship between the child and the primary caregiver; (2) consider \u201cwhere and with whom the child has resided within the six months immediately preceding\u201d the action; and (3) consider whether either parent has established a \u201cpersonal and parental relationship\u201d with or exercised \u201cparental responsibility\u201d over the child. G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 (a), second par. This case raises the question of the relationship between the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard set forth in the first paragraph of the statute and the three requirements set forth in the second. To resolve this question, we examine the origin of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, whether that standard has been modified by the enactment of G. L. c. 209C, and the judge\u2019s application of the standard in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">In custody matters, the touchstone inquiry of what is \u201cbest for the child\u201d is firmly rooted in American history, dating back to the Nineteenth Century. See generally Mercer, A Content Analysis of Judicial Decision-Making \u2014 How Judges Use the Primary Caretaker Standard to Make a Custody Determination, 5 Wm. &amp; Mary J. of Women &amp; the L. 1, 13-32 (1998) (describing evolution of Anglo-American jurisprudence since Seventeenth\u2019Century). This legal principle replaced the notion that children were the property of their parents, and instructed courts to view children as individuals with interests independent of their parents. See <em>id. </em>at 21-29. The \u201cbest interests\u201d standard appeared in our case law at least as early as 1865, in <em>Wardwell </em>v. <em>Wardwell, 9 </em>Allen 518, 522 (1865), in which the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>a judge should not follow a father\u2019s wish regarding the guardianship of his son if custody by the proposed guardian would not be in the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d It has been adhered to ever since. See, e.g., <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649, 657 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003) (best interests standard \u201chas long been used in Massachusetts to decide issues of custody and visitation\u201d); <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 710 (1985) (\u201cbest interests of the children always remain the paramount concern\u201d); <em>Surrender of Minor Children, </em>344 Mass. 230, 234 (1962), quoting <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Raspperry, </em>320 Mass. 333, 335 (1946) (\u201cmost fundamental [principle] is that the paramount issue is the welfare of the child\u201d); <em>DeFerrari </em>v. <em>DeFerrari, </em>220 Mass. 38, 41 (1914) (custody award is subject to revision \u201cas the best interests of the child may demand\u201d). See also Mercer, <em>supra </em>at 13 (calling best interests standard \u201cprevalent ethical principle governing child custody decisions today\u201d); Catania, Accounting to Ourselves for Ourselves: An Analysis of Adjudication in the Resolution of Child Custody Disputes, 71 Neb. L. Rev. 1228, 1244 (1992) (\u201cIn the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions in the United States, the guiding principle of law in child custody disputes ... is the \u2018Best Interests of the Child\u2019 standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In spite of its widespread use as an appropriate standard for custody determinations, the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d formulation has been criticized by a number of commentators, who contend that the open-endedness of the standard leads either to an inconsistency of results or to the systematic imposition by courts of unnamed prejudices regarding what outcomes represent a child\u2019s best interests. See, e.g., Crippen, Stumbling Beyond Best Interests of the Child: Reexamining Child Custody Standard-Setting in the Wake of Minnesota\u2019s Four Year Experiment with the Primary Caretaker Preference, 75 Minn. L. Rev. 427, 499-500 (1990) (best interests standard \u201crisks unwise results, stimulates litigation, permits manipulation and abuse, and allows a level of judicial discretion that is difficult to reconcile with an historic commitment to the rule of law\u201d [footnotes omitted]); Elster, Solomonic Judgments: Against the Best Interest of the Child, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 16 (1987) (\u201cbest interest principle is usually indeterminate when both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>parents pass the threshold of absolute fitness\u201d); Glendon, Fixed Rules and Discretion in Contemporary Family Law and Succession Law, 60 Tul. L. Rev. 1165, 1181 (1986) (\u201c \u2018best interests\u2019 standard is a prime example of the futility of attempting to achieve perfect, individualized justice by reposing discretion in a judge .... Its vagueness provides maximum incentive to those who are inclined to wrangle over custody\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">As a remedy for the perceived vagueness in the standard and for its apparent amenability to inconsistent application, Legislatures, courts, and commentators have adopted or proposed a number of constraints on judicial discretion or, in the alternative, specific criteria that a judge must take into account when ruling on the issue of custody. Some of these constraints have come in the form of irrebuttable presumptions, see, e.g., <em>Garska </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>167 W. Va. 69, 70 (1981) (primary caretaker proving to be fit parent of child of \u201ctender years\u201d must be awarded custody); others have come in the form of legislatively required considerations. See, e.g., Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 107.137 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">These efforts also reflect the view that it is in the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d to preserve the current placement with a parent, if it is a satisfactory one, and that stability and continuity with the child\u2019s primary caregiver is itself an important factor in a child\u2019s successful upbringing. See, e.g., Catania, <em>supra </em>at 1260-1261 (describing primary caretaker presumption as \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cgender-neutral,\u201d \u201ccreat[ing] a legal norm that encourages nurturing behavior,\u201d and \u201cserving as a concrete model for the kind of fiduciary conduct that members of a reordering family should continue to expect from one another\u201d); <em>Roen </em>v. <em>Roen, </em>438 N.W.2d 170, 174 (N.D. 1989) (\u201cContinuity in a child\u2019s relationship with the closest, nurturing parent is also a very important aspect of stability\u201d); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>749 P.2d 647, 648 (Utah 1988) (\u201cconsiderable weight should be given to which parent has been the child\u2019s primary caregiver\u201d). Echoing this view, the American Law Institute\u2019s Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution (2002) (ALI Principles) state that a judge \u201cshould\u201d allocate custody in proportion to the amount of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>each parent previously spent providing care, subject to eight listed exceptions. ALI Principles, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.08(1).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>which was enacted in 1986, reflects this trend and is consistent with the more recently adopted ALI Principles.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statute gives direction to the judge\u2019s consideration of a child\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d by \u201cevincing a general intent on the part of the Legislature to maintain the bonds between the child and her caregiver.\u201d <em>Custody of Zia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 244 (2000). It cautions against rearranging a child\u2019s living arrangements in an attempt to achieve some optimum from all the available permutations and combinations of custody and visitation, when it is generally wiser and safer not to meddle in arrangements that are already serving the child\u2019s needs. If the parenting arrangement in which a child has lived is satisfactory and is reasonably capable of preservation, it is ordinarily in the child\u2019s best interests to maintain that arrangement, and contrary to the child\u2019s best interest to disrupt it. Stability is itself of enormous benefit to a child, and any unnecessary tampering with the status quo simply increases the risk of harm to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The required considerations of the second paragraph of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>neither replace the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard nor limit the factors that a judge may consider in determining what custodial arrangements are in the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>interests of the child. See <em>Custody of Zia, supra </em>at 243-244 (\u201cjudge may consider any factors found pertinent to [child\u2019s best] interests in the circumstances [and] judge is to identify and weigh those factors\u201d). Nor do they create a presumption that the caretaker with whom the child is primarily residing will be awarded permanent custody. See <em>id. </em>at 242-243. There may be serious shortcomings in the primary caretaker\u2019s parenting to date, or evidence that a previously exemplary caretaker will not be able to continue providing adequate care. Or, even assuming that the primary caretaker has been providing good care, and all indications are that that parent would continue to do so, it is possible that the other parent may offer some extraordinary advantage to the child that makes the disruption in the child\u2019s life worth the risk. In most cases, however, if the child has been living with one parent for some time, the child\u2019s needs are being adequately met under that parent\u2019s care, and that parent is capable of continuing to care for the child, it is not in the child\u2019s best interests to disrupt that successful arrangement. Rather, it is in the child\u2019s best interests to preserve it. Belief that the other parent might be a little better in some areas ought not suffice to disrupt a child\u2019s satisfactory home life with the caretaker parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">For these reasons, the three requirements set forth in \u00a7 10 (a), second par., must be carefully considered by the judge in reaching a decision regarding custody. Moreover, merely considering these requirements at the end stages of the custody proceedings is not enough. In order to provide a child with the benefits of stability and continuity, these principles also need to be applied during the pendency of the proceedings. See ALI Principles, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.08(1) (custody decisions should reflect each parent\u2019s performance of caretaking functions \u201cbefore the filing of the action\u201d). When the child has been living with one parent, the judge\u2019s initial inquiry on any motion for a temporary order of custody must be whether there would be any harm to the child in maintaining that status quo pending the outcome of the case. By definition, the significant benefits of maintaining the status quo, and the option of preserving those benefits, may be irreparably lost if the status quo is disrupted at the outset of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">In light of these principles, we now consider the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>3. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe determination of which parent will promote a child\u2019s best interests rests within the discretion of the judge . . . [whose] findings in a custody case \u2018must stand unless they are plainly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998), quoting <em>Prindle </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 843, 844 (1974). However, we will not sustain an award of custody \u201cunless all relevant factors in determining the best interests of the child have been weighed.\u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, supra, </em>quoting <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The father contends that the judge\u2019s findings do not acknowledge or adequately consider the factors required by G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>He is correct that the judge\u2019s findings do not specifically reference \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>or the three requirements of the second paragraph. He is incorrect, however, in his claim that the judge did not adequately consider them in his final custody determination. Ordinarily, a judge should both reference the statutory requirements and explain their impact, if any, on the custody award. Nevertheless, in this case, we look to the substance of the judge\u2019s findings and not to their form.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Beginning with the third required consideration (the establishment of a parental relationship with or responsibility over the child), the judge\u2019s findings are unequivocal: both parents established close personal and parental relationships with Kali, and in the long period between the entry of the temporary custody order and the date of judgment both parents regularly exercised parental responsibility over her health and well-being. As to the second required consideration (where and with whom the child resided within six months of the initiation of the proceeding), the judge\u2019s findings are equally clear. Kali resided with her father during the week and with her mother (often joined by her father) on the weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">Finally, with respect to the first requirement that the judge preserve \u201cto the extent possible\u201d the relationship between the child and the primary caregiver, the father argues that the judge\u2019s permanent custody order should have reverted to and preserved the specific arrangements for Kali\u2019s care that existed before the proceeding commenced because the father was Kali\u2019s primary caregiver. The temporary custody order entered at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>beginning of this action significantly altered Kali\u2019s living arrangements and the parties\u2019 parental responsibilities. Assuming that the father was the primary caregiver before proceedings began, his role as the primary caregiver was effectively destroyed by that order. A judge should not temporarily change a child\u2019s existing living arrangement so that he (or a guardian ad litem) can \u201ccompar[ej\u201d the two parents, their respective homes, and their respective day care providers \u201con an even basis,\u201d or to give feuding parents an \u201cincentive to get this matter heard as quickly as possible,\u201d as the judge said when he entered the temporary order requiring that Kali live with each parent on alternate weeks. Because of the temporary order, by the time the judge rendered his findings, the benefits of stability and continuity that should have been a major focus of the judge\u2019s analysis were eviscerated by two years of shuttling Kali from one parent to the other on a weekly basis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the judge did not make a finding regarding which parent (if either) was the primary caregiver at the time of trial, it was certainly within his discretion to proceed as if neither parent occupied that role where the record contained ample evidence that, at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>point, both parents regularly exercised proportional parental responsibility over Kali\u2019s care. Given such circumstances, the judge had little choice but to do what he did: abandon the requirements of the second paragraph of \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>in favor of a point-by-point comparison between two fit parents. It is apparent that the judge\u2019s final judgment was intended to accomplish the objective of preserving \u201cto the extent possible\u201d the relationship between the child and her parents at the time of his decision. The judgment was structured to ensure that both parents, each of whom had, during the pendency of the action, exercised responsibility as Kali\u2019s caregiver, and each of whom had established a positive parental relationship with her, would be able to preserve, foster, and strengthen those relationships. Kali is to spend school weekdays with her mother because her mother\u2019s schedule was sufficiently flexible to ensure that Kali\u2019s needs during those periods will be attended to, and because that schedule would also provide ample opportunity for the mother and daughter to spend time together. To the same end, the order provides that Kali is to spend most school year weekends with her father, when he will not be constrained by long work days.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The order splits summer and school vacations, with the larger block of time awarded to the father, to accommodate the type of activities that the trial evidence suggested formed the strongest basis for the ties between the father and daughter. Ultimately, the judge concluded that the mother was more \u201cattuned to [Kali\u2019s] medical, educational, and daily needs\u201d and this tipped the balance as to where the best interests of the child lay.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The facts of this case, as presented to the judge at the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>made the decision regarding custody a difficult one. Both parents obviously love and are capable of and committed to caring for their daughter. Leaving aside the award of temporary custody (from which the father did not take an appeal), the judge\u2019s findings reflect that he considered all of the circumstances before him and attempted to structure a permanent custodial award to serve the best interests of Kali, including her continued and substantial involvement with both parents. In these circumstances, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s resolution of the merits as they stood at the time of trial was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Probate and Family Court judge is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The father\u2019s paternity of Kali was not adjudicated by a court until he filed a complaint to establish paternity and obtain legal custody of Kali, which commenced this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The parties and the judge each present a different chronology of these events. The judge found that the mother began working in Connecticut in March, 1999, and commuted from Montague to Groton for one year before permanently relocating to Connecticut. According to the father, the mother began working in the Ledyard, Connecticut, office in March, 1999, and immediately rented an apartment in Ledyard. The mother claimed that she began working in Connecticut in 1998, commuting to Connecticut until March, 1999, at which point she moved there permanently. Because the chronology on this point found by the probate judge does not fit logically with the rest of his findings, we accept that the mother relocated to Connecticut in March, 1999. Whether she commuted to Connecticut before that date is of no consequence to the legal questions at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The order was stayed by the Appeals Court pending the resolution of this appeal or Kali\u2019s entrance into kindergarten this fall, whichever occurs first.

That the order may have affected the outcome of this case underscores the importance of carefully considering the preservation of stable living arrangements at the outset of a custody dispute. When the father sought a temporary order that he be allowed to maintain custody of Kali pending the outcome of the case, Kali had been living with him for over a year, from the time she was fourteen months old until she was two and one-half years old. Although she had been seeing her mother on weekends, she was often accompanied by her father during those weekend visits. Kali\u2019s home, and, at that age, the only \u201chome\u201d that she could ever remember, had been with her father. That arrangement could have been preserved with only the most minor difference, namely, that the father would no longer remain with her during any of her weekend visits to her mother. In all other respects, her life could have gone on normally, with no perceptible change in what she understood to be her \u201chome.\u201d Yet, rather than inquire whether there would be any problem with leaving Kali at \u201chome\u201d pending the outcome of the proceedings, the judge entered an order that Kali split her time evenly between the two parents, spending alternate weeks with each. The child bounced back and forth in this fashion at least until the judge rendered his findings in July, 2002, and, we assume, thereafter. Moreover, the ostensible benefits that the judge used to justify Kali\u2019s living arrangements during the pendency of the proceedings proved ephemeral. The guardian ad litem, after making the even comparison, recommended that the father be awarded custody, but the judge rejected that recommendation. As for an expeditious resolution, it still took two years to complete the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We would be troubled if the judge\u2019s award of primary custody between two working parents was based solely on the minor differences in the amount of time the child would spend in day care. Day care is a fact of life in such circumstances and ought not be used as the measure of a parent\u2019s ability or commitment to provide a protective, healthy, and positive environment for the child. We are satisfied here that the judge considered Kali\u2019s respective day care arrangements and the work schedules of her parents in the context of balancing many factors to reach a conclusion as to what is in Kali\u2019s best interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">sIndeed, this case illustrates how subjective value judgments affect a judge\u2019s assessment of the child\u2019s best interests. See ALI Principles, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2.08 comment b (approach to determining child\u2019s best interests \u201cdraws the court into comparisons between parenting styles and values that are matters of parental autonomy not appropriate for judicial resolution\u201d) and \u00a7 2.02 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ment c (\u201cWhen the only guidance for the court is what best serves the child\u2019s interests, the court must rely on its own value judgments, or upon experts who have their own theories of what is good for children and what is effective parenting\u201d). Beyond the comparison of the day care providers and schedules, the judge was critical of the father because he \u201cdoes not appear to be overly concerned about [Kali\u2019s] physical needs beyond the basics,\u201d whereas the mother \u201cpreoccupies herself with [Kali\u2019s] care regarding clothing, hygiene, doctor\u2019s appointments and childcare providers.\u201d To some, it would be preferable that a parent stay focused on \u201cthe basics\u201d and not become \u201coverly concerned\u201d about things beyond those \u201cbasics,\u201d and some might think it a disadvantage to have a parent \u201cpreoccupiefd]\u201d with the child\u2019s clothes and cleanliness. Even on the issue of medical care, where the judge viewed the mother as \u201cmore attuned,\u201d the differences between the two parents reflected justifiably different attitudes. Keeping the focus on whether the child\u2019s primary caretaker has provided and can continue to provide satisfactory care, rather than engaging in an inherently subjective assessment of which parent will provide what the judge views as optimal care, is part of the purpose behind \u00a7 2.08(1) of the ALI Principles and the second paragraph of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10 <em>(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
