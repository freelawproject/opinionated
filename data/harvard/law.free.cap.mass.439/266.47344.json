A &amp; P\u2019s complaint, as far as now relevant, was based on G. L. c. 21E, the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention Act. The jury found the defendants liable under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 (a) (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for releases of subsurface oil onto A &amp; P\u2019s property, attributing only eight per cent of damages to Creative. The jury awarded \u201cresponse costs\u201d under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4,3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to A &amp; P in the amount of $239,904.77. In addition, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>reply to special questions on damages sought pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(5) (iii),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the jury found that $500,000 \u201cwould [be] need[ed] ... to remediate the oil contamination\u201d; the oil contamination on A &amp; P\u2019s property was not \u201creasonably curable by repairs or remediation\u201d; and that $2.4 million \u201crepresented] the diminution in fair market value of [A &amp; P\u2019s] property caused by the oil contamination.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The case is before us on cross appeals. The MDC appeals from the judge\u2019s denial of its posttrial motion to dismiss the G. L. c. 21E claim on the grounds that the claim is \u201csubject to the immunities retained\u201d under G. L. c. 258, commonly referred to as the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, and is barred by G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (/) and <em>(e). </em>A &amp; P appeals from an order of the judge that allowed in part the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v.), Mass. R. Civ. P. 50 (b), as amended, 428 Mass. 1402 (1998), by setting aside the portion of the jury\u2019s verdict awarding A &amp; P $2.4 million in property damage, but affirming the verdict in all other respects. A &amp; P also appeals from an order of the judge denying its post-trial motion for attorney\u2019s and expert witness fees under G. L. c. 21E. We granted MDC\u2019s application for direct appellate review (with which A &amp; P joined) and now affirm the orders and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts. In 1992, while removing a 6,000 gallon underground storage tank from its property that had been installed in 1980, and had been used to store heating oil, A &amp; P discovered subsurface oil.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An investigation revealed that the oil was \u201chighly aged,\u201d that its release had occurred prior to 1972, and that a large amount of oil, ranging from 20,000 to 90,000 gallons, had been released. Further investigation revealed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the release of oil had not come from either of the underground storage tanks that had been removed from A &amp; P\u2019s property, nor from any other source on A &amp; P\u2019s property. Rather, the oil was determined to have come from upgradient locations, namely property adjacent to A &amp; P\u2019s owned by the MDC and Creative. The oil essentially had migrated to A &amp; P\u2019s property consistent with the groundwater flow. Despite the contamination of its property, since 1993, A &amp; P has been able to lease the property to an automobile dealership, and has collected substantial rental income over the years. At the time of trial A &amp; P was collecting approximately $200,000 annually in rental income under the terms of the property\u2019s lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">1. We reject the MDC\u2019s argument that the judgment against it must be reduced to $100,000, the cap on liability for \u201cpublic employers\u201d under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because G. L. c. 21E\u2019s \u201cstrict liability waiver of a public employer\u2019s sovereign immunity [is] subject to the immunities of [G. L. c. 258].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Under G. L. c. 2IE, private parties may seek to recover response costs from any \u201cperson\u201d \u201cliable for [the] release or threat of release [of oil or hazardous material],\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, or property damages from \u201cthe owner or operator of a vessel or a site from or at which there is or has been a release or threat of release of oil or hazardous material,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(1). An \u201c[o]wner\u201d or \u201c[operator\u201d of a site is defined as \u201cany <em>person </em>owning or operating such site\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2. The term \u201c[p]erson\u201d is defined as \u201cany agency or political subdivision of the federal government or the commonwealth, any state, public or private corporation or authority, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>interstate body, foreign nation, individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, partnership, association or other entity, and any officer, employee, or agent of such person, and any group of persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In keeping with the unambiguous terms of G. L. c. 21E, the MDC, an agency of the Commonwealth, cannot reasonably contend that G. L. c. 21E does not subject it to liability to private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The MDC asserts that, while \u201c[G. L. c. 258\u2019s] immunities do not apply to [c.] 21E enforcement actions <em>by </em>the Commonwealth against [Sjtate agencies . . . whether the Commonwealth seeks injunctive relief, cost recovery, or natural resource damages,\u201d G. L. c. 258 limits \u201cthe extent of availability of damages to private parties in [c.j 21E actions\u201d against it (emphasis in original). In support of this contention, the MDC relies on language, italicized below, contained in a 1992 revision of the definition of \u201cowner\u201d or \u201coperator\u201d in G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 2. That amendment provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201cThe term [\u2018owner\u2019 or \u2018operator\u2019] shall not include the commonwealth to the extent the commonwealth holds or held any right, title, or interest in a site or vessel solely for the purpose of implementing or enforcing the commonwealth\u2019s rights or responsibilities pursuant to this chapter, unless the commonwealth caused or contributed to the release or threat of release; <em>provided, that nothing in this definition or in this chapter shall be construed to waive any immunity that public employers or public employees may have pursuant to chapter two hundred </em>fifty-eight\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 274. The MDC argues that the judge erroneously denied its motion to dismiss by narrowly construing the proviso to afford \u201conly the Commonwealth (and no other public employer) the protection of those immunities in a [c.] 21E litigation, and only in the limited circumstances when a [Sjtate enforcement agency takes over the cleanup of a contaminated site.\u201d The MDC maintains that \u201c[h]ad the Legislature intended the proviso to afford [G. L. c. 258\u2019s] immunities only to the Commonwealth, and only in the limited circumstances involving a [S]tote enforcement agency cleanup, it would have consistently used the word \u2018Commonwealth\u2019 in its singular form throughout that sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The MDC reads the proviso in a vacuum. The relevant part of the 1992 amendment, as recognized by the judge, addressed the particular problem of \u201cparties trying to make the [Sjtate\u2019s environmental enforcement agencies strictly liable based solely on the fact that those agencies had taken over or operated a site\u2019s cleanup activities.\u201d To interpret the proviso in reference to this problem or situation, as identified in the language preceding the semi-colon, comports with both G. L. c. 258, and G. L. c. 21E. Liability of public employers under G. L. c. 258, although limited, is imposed in connection with tortious conduct, that is, negligent or wrongful acts or omissions. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. Pursuant to the relevant part of the amendment, it is only when the Commonwealth takes over a site for enforcement or cleanup purposes <em>and </em>causes or contributes to a release or threat of release, that the Commonwealth may be subjected to liability and may receive the benefit of having its liability limited. To extend this limited liability to situations such as the one presented here, or in all private actions under G. L. c. 2 IE against public agencies or entities, would defeat one of the primary features of G. L. c. 21E (which was enacted five years after G. L. c. 258), namely the imposition of liability without regard to fault. This in turn would frustrate the purpose of G. L. c. 21E, \u201cto compel the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous material and to ensure that costs and damages are borne by the appropriate responsible parties.\u201d <em>Taygeta Corp. </em>v. <em>Varian Assocs., Inc., </em>436 Mass. 217, 223 (2002). As correctly noted by the judge, \u201c[i]f the intent of the 1992 amendments was to relieve all public employers of the strict liability they faced under G. L. c. 2 IE and impose on them only the liability they faced under G. L. c. 258, one would have expected the [Legislature to address that problem directly in the definition of \u2018person,\u2019 not in [a] proviso attached to a subsection defining only \u2018owner or operator.\u2019 \u201d The judge\u2019s constmction is further supported by the absence of any legislative history suggesting \u201cthat the imposition of G. L. c. 21E liability on public entities was considered a problem at the time the [1992] amendment was passed.\u201d As explained by the judge, and noted below, adoption of the MDC\u2019s position would present numerous problems concerning what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>procedures to follow.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, as noted below, the judge correctly demonstrated how applying the immunities in G. L. c. 258 \u201cwould be virtually unworkable.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>We thus agree with the judge that \u201c[i]f the [Legislature actually intended to mesh G. L. c. 258 with G. L. c. 21E for all environmental cases involving public agencies and public entities, it needed to do a lot more than simply refine the definition of \u2018owner or operator\u2019 in G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 2.\u201d Rather, G. L. c. 258, and G. L. c. 21E, were intended to be interpreted as separate waivers of sovereign immunity, concerning distinct categories of claims, with separate rights and procedures. The MDC\u2019s motion to dismiss was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">2. Because A &amp; P did not satisfy the burden placed on it by the judge\u2019s unobjected-to instructions of proving that the oil contamination on its property was not \u201creasonably curable by repairs or remediation,\u201d we conclude that the judge correctly allowed in part the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n.o.v. by vacating the portion of the jury\u2019s verdict awarding A &amp; P $2.4 million for diminution in the fair market value of its property. That the defendants did not object to the special verdict on inconsistency grounds is not of consequence because, in their motions, the defendants argued that the jury\u2019s finding that A &amp; P\u2019s property was not reasonably curable lacked a basis in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We begin our analysis with the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the issue of property damage under G. L. c. 21E. The parties did not object to these instructions, and A &amp; P characterizes them as \u201cproper and appropriate.\u201d The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201c[T]he general rule would be that the measure of damage to a plaintiff\u2019s property is the amount by which its fair market value has been decreased, has been diminished, has been reduced because of the contamination on the property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">.... However, if the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property can reasonably be cured, can reasonably be repaired, re-mediated, then the plaintiff, instead, gets the expense of doing those repairs, of doing that remediation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cThat will be true as long as the costs to do those repairs, to do that remediation, are less than the decrease in fair market value, and if those repairs would reasonably \u2014 what we call reasonably cure the damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">After providing some examples to the jury of those principles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the judge stated, \u201cif the property cannot be remedied, cannot be repaired, if it is not reasonably curable . . . then the plaintiff would get the decrease in fair market value.\u201d As to the definition of \u201creasonably curable,\u201d the judge told the jury that the term \u201cmeans that the property may be repaired at a reasonable cost, with reasonable certainty, within a reasonable period of time. . . . Sometimes people refer to this concept by using the terms temporary damage as opposed to permanent damage. In this context, the term temporary would refer to damage that is reasonably curable. Permanent would refer to damage that is not reasonably curable.\u201d The judge went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cIn this context the term temporary doesn\u2019t refer to fleeting. And the term permanent does not mean perpetual, in eternity. It is a different terminology, again, used to convey the same concept of reasonably curable. Something that is reasonably curable is referred to as temporary damage, meaning it can be repaired at a reasonable cost, with reasonable certainty, within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The judge instructed the jury to consider various factors in determining whether the property damage was reasonably curable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cThose [factors] would include the nature of the pollution, the nature of the contamination; whether techniques, technology are available to clean it up; whether the contamination is still ongoing at the time of trial; how long it has existed as of the time of trial; whether the pollution will continue for an unpredictable time in the absence of remedial action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cAs I say, whether the property can be fully restored to its prior pre-release, that is, pre-contamination condition, within a reasonable period of time, through a reasonable expenditure of money; whether the pollution has caused some irreplaceable loss during the time that it has existed on the property; whether the repair, the remediation is not feasible because of factors beyond the plaintiff\u2019s control, you consider all these factors, all the evidence that you have heard about this particular contamination, and you decide: is this damage reasonably curable, or is it not reasonably curable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Finally, the judge instructed the jury that the burden of proof fell on A &amp; P to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that its property was not reasonably curable. The judge appears to have drawn her instructions from cases such as <em>Trinity Church in the City of Boston </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>399 Mass. 43, 50 (1987), and cases cited, and <em>Black </em>v. <em>Coastal Oil New England, Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 465-466 (1998), and cases cited. The unobjected-to instructions became the law of the case. <em>Gendreau </em>v. <em>C.K. Smith &amp; Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 989, 990 (1986), and cases cited. As far as relevant, the significant point in the instructions is the <em>limit </em>of recovery solely to remediation costs where the effect of contamination is reasonably curable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Our concern is with the lack of any evidence from A &amp; P demonstrating that the contamination to the property was not reasonably curable or remediable. A &amp; P\u2019s expert witness on this subject was Richard Wozmak, a hydrogeologist, engineer, and licensed site professional in Massachusetts. Wozmak testified that the contamination on A &amp; P\u2019s property could be remediated at a cost of approximately $500,000 by pumping the oil and contaminated groundwater out of the ground, thereby lowering the water table and enabling the removal of the contaminated soil, which then would be disposed of off site at a proper disposal facility. Wozmak testified that this cleanup would be \u201cuseless\u201d unless (1) there was remediation of MDC\u2019s property, and possibly Creative\u2019s property, to prevent recontamination of A &amp; P\u2019s property due to the manner in which the oil was migrating; or (2) the release of oil from the adjacent properties was \u201ccut off.\u201d As to the latter option, Wozmak explained that \u201cinterceptor trenches\u201d could be placed along the property boundaries to collect contaminated oil or groundwater, which would then be pumped out. These options, and the costs associated with them, were not included in Wozmak\u2019s remediation plan. During cross-examination, Wozmak made clear that complete remediation was possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">A &amp; P argues that the judge \u201cincorrectly found that the \u2018undisputed evidence\u2019 is that the contamination on the A &amp; P [pjroperty is \u2018reasonably curable by repairs,\u2019 \u201d and that the judge\u2019s conclusion that the property could be remediated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>$500,000 \u201cis contrary to the evidence and undisputed expert testimony,\u201d namely Wozmak\u2019s testimony. A &amp; P also alleges that the judge improperly usurped the jury\u2019s fact-finding role. These arguments miss the mark. What A &amp; P overlooks is that the burden was on it to prove damages, and as explained by the judge in her instructions to the jury, which were not objected to, this burden included proving that A &amp; P\u2019s property was not reasonably curable or remediable.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Quite simply, A &amp; P failed to satisfy this burden. While A &amp; P, through Wozmak, conceded that complete remediation was possible by using interceptor trenches,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A &amp; P did not offer evidence on the cost feasibility of this option. Nor did A &amp; P offer evidence on whether this option would cure the contamination with reasonable certainty and within a reasonable amount of time. A &amp; P concedes as much in its reply brief: \u201cthe cost of the installation of these devices [interceptor trenches] explicitly was not included in the remedial cost estimate, and . . . the feasibility of installing these structures without interfering with the current use of the [p]roperty has not been evaluated.\u201d The judge correctly recognized A &amp; P\u2019s failure. As she stated in her memorandum on the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n.o.v.: \u201cThere was no evidence that [use of interceptor trenches] would not work or that its costs would exceed the $2.4 million value of the A &amp; P property.\u201d Thus, \u201ctaking into account all the evidence in [the] aspect most favorable to the plaintiff,\u201d as we must, <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Honeyman, </em>406 Mass. 43, 45 (1989), quoting <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>394 Mass. 482, 494 (1985), there was no evidence introduced by A &amp; P on which the jury could base a finding that A &amp; P\u2019s property was not reasonably curable. A &amp; P\u2019s evidence that the property could not be sold does not bear on whether the property was or was not reasonably curable. Further, A &amp; P\u2019s assertion that the interceptor trenches would not reasonably cure its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>property because they would require \u201cconstant and indeterminately long operation and maintenance,\u201d is not supported by any evidence and is a fact A &amp; P had the burden to show by expert testimony. The conclusion that A &amp; P has failed in its burden of proof is dictated by the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The judge\u2019s suspicion that A &amp; P was attempting \u201cto bolster its $2.4 million claim for \u2018property damage,\u2019 \u201d is also warranted. To permit A &amp; P to avoid establishing that its property was not reasonably curable so that it may recover a greater amount of damages (the diminution of the property\u2019s fair market value) results in an inappropriate windfall to A &amp; P. Such a recovery would also contravene \u201cthe general requirement [applicable in property damage cases] that a party seeking damages take reasonable action to limit or mitigate damages.\u201d <em>Guaranty-First Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Textron, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 332, 337 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">3. Review of the judge\u2019s order denying A &amp; P\u2019s posttrial motion for attorney\u2019s and expert witness fees pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7\u00a7 4A <em>{d) </em>(2) &amp; (3), and 15, raises different facts and issues with respect to the two separate statutory provisions authorizing such fees. Accordingly, we separately address A &amp; P\u2019s arguments in connection with the applicable statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">(a) A &amp; P contends that it should have been able to recover its expert witness and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4A <em>(d) </em>(2) &amp; (3),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> from the MDC because the MDC refused to participate in the presuit \u00a7 4A process thereby demonstrating \u201cbad faith and purposeful neglect of statutory requirements.\u201d The judge rejected this argument after assessing documentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and testimonial evidence offered by A &amp; P, concluding that, \u201c[t]here [was] absolutely no evidence of \u2018bad faith.\u2019 \u201d The judge explained: \u201cMDC itself was subject to certain technical requirements concerning its own response, and it appropriately protected itself by explaining that its own less than technically correct response was due at least in part to A &amp; P\u2019s less technically correct notice.\u201d Nor had A &amp; P, during the relevant time frame, established the MDC\u2019s liability with reasonable clarity, as \u201c[a]ll that A &amp; P had presented . . . was that contamination had been found on both properties and that groundwater flow analyses to date were inconclusive.\u201d The judge\u2019s conclusions are supported by the evidence and are based on credibility determinations within her province. We affirm that portion of the judge\u2019s order denying A &amp; P\u2019s motion for fees under \u00a7 4A <em>{d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">(b) We also conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in denying A &amp; P\u2019s motion for expert and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15, set forth below,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> from both defendants. An award under \u00a7 15 is not automatic simply because a prevailing plaintiff established that it advanced the purposes of G. L. c. 21E. Contrary to A &amp; P\u2019s assertion, the judge expressly credited A &amp; P\u2019s claim that it had advanced G. L. c. 21E\u2019s purposes to some extent. With respect to Creative, which prior to trial (and at trial) admitted that some of the oil had come from its property, and had early in the dispute made a reasonable settlement offer (which turned out to be not significantly less than its share of liability), the judge found that litigation against Creative \u201cdid not accomplish anything,\u201d and that A &amp; P\u2019s request for fees against Creative was meritless. With respect to the MDC, the judge found that A &amp; P \u201cdeliberately and for no good reason breached the parties\u2019 . . . agreement to mediate this entire dispute,\u201d with the likely effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of postponing \u201cthe ultimate cleanup of this property by a matter of many years beyond the date it would otherwise have occurred,\u201d thus \u201cflout[ing] the spirit\u201d of G. L. c. 21E. The judge noted that A &amp; P\u2019s conduct would have permitted the MDC to seek fees against A &amp; P under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A <em>(f),</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and, therefore concluded that any fees she would have otherwise awarded to A &amp; P would be offset by an award under \u00a7 4A (/). The judge carefully considered the matter and made credibility determinations to which we are bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We reject A &amp; P\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s conclusions were \u201cunfounded\u201d and \u201cunsupported\u201d by evidence. In addition to the evidence at trial, Creative presented an affidavit at the hearing on A &amp; P\u2019s motion for fees to support its contention concerning its pretrial settlement offer to A &amp; P as documentary evidence concerning the parties\u2019 agreement to mediate and A &amp; P\u2019s withdrawal from that agreement. The affidavit had been appended to the MDC\u2019s opposition to A &amp; P\u2019s motion for fees. Creative also indicated that there was a witness prepared to testify and be cross-examined. The judge made it clear that she would take evidence on the issues concerning A &amp; P\u2019s request for fees, and gave A &amp; P an opportunity to present evidence on the issues, which A &amp; P did not do (apart from the witnesses it offered on the \u00a7 4A <em>[d] </em>aspect of fees). The record indicates that the judge considered A &amp; P\u2019s arguments concerning the futility of mediation and its reasons for withdrawing from its agreement to mediate. A &amp; P\u2019s arguments on appeal are not supported in the record and are unconvincing. Because there was no abuse of discretion, we affirm the judge\u2019s order denying A &amp; P\u2019s request for fees under \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">4. The orders denying MDC\u2019s posttrial motion to dismiss the G. L. c. 21E claim, and A &amp; P\u2019s posttrial motion for attorney\u2019s and expert witness fees under G. L. c. 21E, are affirmed.

L. c. 21E claim against a public employer, a host of obstacles and definitional problems emerge. For example, how does one square the presentment requirement of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4 with the notification, response and conference requirements of G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4A? The contents of the required notices are different, the time frames are different, and the obligations of the public employer recipient are different. The statutes of limitations operate differently, with a far more complex analysis as to what starts the time running on a G. L. c. 21E claim. See G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 11A (2) and (4). MDC avoids these problems by saying that it is only the \u00a7 10 \u2018immunities\u2019 and the $100,000 cap on liability that protect a public employer in a G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 case, not the G. L. c. 258 procedural requirements. Nowhere is this distinction set forth in G. L. c. 21E or in G. L. c. 258. One routinely characterizes the public employer as \u2018immune\u2019 from suit if the G. L. c. 258 presentment requirements have not been met \u2014 how are those presentment requirements not part of the \u2018immunities\u2019 that protect the public employer?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u201c[I]n this case, [A &amp; P] prevailed against the MDC simply by proving that the oil on its property came from the MDC\u2019s property. [A &amp; P] did not have to prove (and did not attempt to prove) how that oil had gotten onto the MDC\u2019s property in the first place. The MDC had argued that the oil had not come from its property at all, and it never sought to show (indeed it firmly denied) that the source of the oil was an Exxon pipeline that ran through the MDC property. Now, as it seeks to invoke the exception in \u00a7 10 (j), the MDC argues that it cannot be held liable for \u2018the harmful consequences of a condition or situation\u2019 which was caused by Exxon, and it seeks to invoke the exception in \u00a7 10 (e) because it cannot be sued for its \u2018issuance\u2019 of or \u2018refusal to revoke\u2019 Exxon\u2019s \u2018permit\u2019 or \u2018authorization\u2019 to use the pipeline. By inference one could conclude that the Exxon pipeline was the source (as no other source on the MDC property was identified), but the trial record is void of any information as to how any leak or spill from that pipeline occurred, let alone whose conduct caused that leak or spill or what that conduct consisted of. One would have to hold a second trial to ascertain precisely how the leak occurred, identify what conduct of the MDC (if any) caused or contributed to that leak, then decide whether that MDC conduct came within any of the G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cAs this case illustrates, the very facts that are necessary to determine the applicability of \u00a7 10 exceptions will often not be at issue in a G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 claim. The \u00a7 10 exceptions are largely based on an assessment of what the public employer <em>did, </em>from which one then determines whether that action involved a discretionary function, a failure to prevent harmful consequences of a condition caused by someone else, a failure to inspect, etc. By contrast, a G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 claim is rarely based on what the public entity did. It can be, as in the present case, premised solely on where the public entity\u2019s property was and whether the hazardous material [or oil] came from the public entity\u2019s property onto the plaintiff\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Having not objected to these instructions concerning its burden of proof, A &amp; P cannot now claim that the judge \u201cinappropriately placed the burden on [it] to prove that interception of the migration of contamination from the MDC site was not feasible to support any claim that cleanup on the A &amp; P site was not feasible.\u201d <em>Gendreau </em>v. <em>C.K.
