Triplett, then the chief of police of the town of Oxford (town), was the subject of State criminal indictments and charges by the State Ethics Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>mission (commission). He incurred substantial legal fees in mounting a wholly successful defense against the criminal indictments and a largely successful defense against the ethics charges. When the town refused to reimburse him for his legal fees, Triplett filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court seeking indemnification under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (tort claims act), G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13. The town moved for summary judgment, claiming that G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, does not encompass indemnification of municipal employees accused of criminal or ethics misconduct, even if the employee is later vindicated. Alternatively, the town posited that Triplett was not acting within the scope of his employment in connection with his alleged misconduct. Triplett responded with a cross motion for summary judgment, taking the contrary view on both arguments. A judge in the Superior Court concluded that G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, is applicable to municipal employees who defend against criminal indictments and ethics charges, but further concluded that there were questions of material fact whether Triplett had been acting within the scope of his employment. He denied the town\u2019s motion and allowed Triplett\u2019s motion, in part. A single justice of the Appeals Court granted the town leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We conclude that G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, does not authorize a town to reimburse a municipal officer for legal fees and costs incurred in defending against criminal indictments or ethics charges, regardless of whether he is acquitted or his defense is otherwise successful. We therefore need not consider whether Triplett was acting within the scope of his employment when he engaged in the alleged conduct that gave rise to the indictments and ethics charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>Triplett\u2019s tenure as chief of police lasted from 1985 to 1997. In 1987, he received a law degree, and the following year he was admitted to the Massachusetts bar. Thereafter, while continuing to serve as chief of police, Triplett maintained a private law practice. The criminal indictments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ethics charges were returned in the wake of allegations that, as a lawyer, Triplett represented clients who were subject to town regulations that he, as chief of police, was responsible for enforcing; that he interfered with a criminal investigation concerning his own alleged illegal drug activity; and that, as chief of police, he showed favoritism to certain town residents. We summarize the charges and their disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In December of 1994, a Worcester County grand jury indicted Triplett for twice violating the conflict of interest law (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 17), filing a false report (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A), improperly accepting money for dismissing an application for a criminal complaint (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 3), and obstructing justice (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13A). In 1995, a jury convicted Triplett of obstructing justice. The jury acquitted Triplett on the charge of improperly accepting money and on one conflict of interest charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>426 Mass. 26, 27 n.3 (1997). The trial judge allowed Triplett\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the second conflict of interest charge, and declared a mistrial on the false report charge. <em>Id. </em>In 1997, Triplett\u2019s sole conviction was reversed on appeal for insufficient evidence. See <em>id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Meanwhile, in January of 1995, one month after Triplett had been indicted, the commission issued an order to show cause alleging that Triplett had four times violated G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 <em>(b) </em>(2) (using his official position to secure for certain persons privileges not available to similarly situated individuals), and six times violated G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 (b) (3) (acting in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to conclude that certain individuals could unduly enjoy Triplett\u2019s official favor). The ethics charges arose from alleged conduct different from that which had led to the criminal indictments. Pursuant to a 1996 disposition agreement, Triplett admitted to three of the ethics charges under G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 23 (b) (3), and paid a $2,000 civil penalty. Of the remaining ethics charges, the commission dismissed five and determined that Triplett had not committed the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Triplett sought reimbursement from the town under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, and submitted invoices for the legal fees he had incurred in defending against the charges; Triplett did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>however, seek reimbursement for the legal fees he incurred in connection with the ethics charges to which he had admitted. The town refused to reimburse him, whereupon Triplett filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 13, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cAny . . . town which accepts this section in the manner hereinafter provided in this section1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 shall indemnify and save harmless municipal officers, elected or appointed from personal financial loss and expense including reasonable legal fees and costs, if any, in an amount not to exceed one million dollars, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of any act or omission, except an intentional violation of civil rights of any person, if the official at the time of such act or omission was acting within the scope of his official duties or employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">By its terms, \u00a7 13 provides for the indemnification of municipal officers who incur financial losses arising out of \u201cany claim, demand, suit or judgment.\u201d Triplett argues that the criminal indictments and ethics (conflict of interest) charges fall squarely within the category of \u201cnny claim, demand, suit or judgment\u201d (emphasis added). We disagree. Statutory language is the principal source of insight into legislative purpose, <em>Pielech </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound, Inc., </em>423 Mass. 534, 539 (1996), cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1131 (1997), and the words \u201cindictment,\u201d \u201ccriminal complaint,\u201d \u201ccharges,\u201d \u201corder to show cause,\u201d or \u201cethics violation\u201d do not appear in \u00a7 13 or in any other section of G. L. c. 258. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914) (we do not \u201cread into [a] statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there\u201d). We therefore interpret the statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>With those principles in mind, we consider first the meaning of the disputed words (\u201cclaim,\u201d \u201cdemand,\u201d \u201csuit,\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d) with reference to their use in other sections of the tort claims act. See <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 66, 69 (2000) (\u201cWhere words in a statute are used in one part of a statute in a definite sense, they should be given the same meaning in another part of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The word \u201cclaim,\u201d as used throughout G. L. c. 258, refers to civil actions for tort damages. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5. Moreover, a criminal \u201cindictment\u201d or ethics \u201ccharge\u201d is not a \u201cclaim\u201d in any ordinary sense of the word. The word \u201cdemand\u201d as used in G. L. c. 258, a term similarly devoid of any ordinary applicability to criminal indictments or ethics charges, refers to a demand for civil damages. See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 772 (1984) (\u201cWe interpret the word \u2018claim,\u2019 as used in [the tort claims act], as referring to a demand for all damages arising from a tort . . .\u201d); <em>Filippone </em>v. <em>Mayor of Newton, </em>392 Mass. 622, 623 (1984) (former city employee made \u201cwritten demand for relief\u201d before commencing her civil action for wrongful termination under tort claims act). Finally, the tort claims act employs the word \u201csuit\u201d to denote a \u201cclaim for damages\u201d resulting from an alleged tort or civil rights violation, and uses the word \u201cjudgment\u201d to refer to a final judgment in a tort case, and not to a criminal or ethics proceeding. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9A. See also <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Dartmouth, </em>413 Mass. 641, 645 (1992) (G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, \u201cstates that an officer of a municipality [that] has accepted that section must be protected against personal liability for damages and attorneys\u2019 fees that arise out of a civil action against the municipal officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The legislative history of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, confirms that the section does not extend to indemnification for \u201cfinancial loss and expense\u201d arising from criminal indictments or ethics charges. Before 1978, when the Legislature enacted the tort claims act, the Commonwealth and its municipalities enjoyed immunity from suit, subject to certain statutory and common-law exceptions. See <em>Troy &amp; Greenfield R.R. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>127 Mass. 43, 46 (1879); <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Light-Boat Upper Cedar Point, </em>11 Allen 157, 174 (1865); <em>Mower </em>v. <em>Leicester, 9 </em>Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>247, 250 (1812).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Certain individual public employees could, however, be held personally hable for tort damages arising from the performance of their ministerial duties. See <em>Desmarais </em>v. <em>Wachusett Regional Sch. Dist., </em>360 Mass. 591, 593 (1971); <em>Trum </em>v. Paxton, 329 Mass. 434, 438 (1952); <em>Fulgoni </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>302 Mass. 421, 423 (1939). To protect those employees from the financial burden of both damages or expenses arising from the defense of tort actions, the Legislature enacted several indemnification statutes, two of which \u2014 precursors to \u00a7 13 \u2014 covered municipal officers. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 100E, 1001. See generally Glannon, Governmental Tort Liability Under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act of 1978, 66 Mass. L. Rev. 7, 14 (1981). Nothing in these early indemnification provisions suggests that the Legislature intended to reimburse employees for legal fees related to charges of criminal misconduct or ethics violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Specifically, the first indemnification statute covering municipal officers, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 100E, inserted by St. 1969, c. 413, represented one of a series of legislative efforts to protect public employees sued for civil damages. See, e.g., G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 100 (indemnification for damages or expenses incurred by police officers and fire fighters); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 100A, 100D (indemnification for damages or expenses incurred by municipal employees causing injury or death through use of municipal vehicles); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 100C (indemnification for damages or expenses incurred by school teachers). Although G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 100E, permitted a city or town to reimburse municipal officers, it did not <em>require </em>a municipality to do so, leaving public employees vulnerable to a case-by-case determination of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>claim for indemnification. To address that issue, legislation was proposed to make such indemnification of municipal officers mandatory rather than discretionary. See 1975 House Doc. No. 689.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A Senate version of the House bill \u2014 an enabling statute whereby a city or town could choose whether to accept it, and if so, the city or town would then be required to indemnify municipal officers \u2014 was enacted later that year. 1975 Senate Doc. No. 2109, as amended, 1975 House J. 2880, enacted as St. 1975, c. 753, \u00a7 3. The words at issue in this case, \u201cany claim, demand, suit, or judgment,\u201d appeared for the first time in 1975 House Doc. No. 689, and were retained in the Senate version, later codified as G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 1001. It is noteworthy that the words first appeared as part of legislative efforts designed to safeguard public employees from personal liability for damages or expenses arising from tort actions. See Glannon, Governmental Tort Liability Under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act of 1978, 66 Mass. L. Rev. 7, 14 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The enactment of the tort claims act three years later lifted the shield of immunity for negligence claims against State and local governments, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2; immunized public employees against personal negligence suits, <em>id..; </em>and provided public employers with the <em>discretion </em>to indemnify public employees for financial loss and expenses arising from certain civil actions (intentional torts and civil rights violations), G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9. The Legislature simultaneously repealed G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 100E and 1001, and struck other indemnification statutes. See St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 10, 17. In response to the \u201ccertainly inadvertent\u201d failure of the Legislature to provide for mandatory indemnification, see Glannon, Indemnification Under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9: Who is a \u201cMunicipal Officer\u201d?, 2 Mass. Gov\u2019t Liab. Rep. 19, 19 (1988) (discussing enactment of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13), the Massachusetts League of Cities and Towns sought reinstatement of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 1001, because its repeal in 1978 threw into doubt \u201cthe continued statutory support of the automatic [mandatory] indemnification of municipal officers of those cities and towns which had accepted [\u00a7] 1001.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Legislature responded by enacting G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, inserted by St. 1979, c. 396,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an enabling statute that closely resembles \u00a7 1001. The Legislature\u2019s obvious goal in enacting \u00a7 13 was to permit cities and towns, if they so chose, to provide mandatory indemnification to employees who were sued for damages. See Glannon, Indemnification Under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9: Who is a \u201cMunicipal Officer\u201d?, <em>supra. </em>There was no reference to indemnification of those employees accused of criminal or ethics misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Whether public officials should be indemnified for legal fees incurred in defending criminal charges arising from conduct within the scope of their employment has, on other occasions, been considered by the Legislature. In 1967, the Legislative Research Council, responding to repeated filings of individual bills calling for the reimbursement of legal fees incurred by public officials indicted and later acquitted, issued a Report Relative to Reimbursement of Legal Costs to Indicted Public Officials. See 1967 House Doc. No. 4636. The report presented, without recommendation, arguments for and against a broad reimbursement statute, one that would encompass criminal indictments. The Legislature took no action in response to the report, nor has it done so in the succeeding thirty-five years. Moreover, when the Legislature has authorized a municipality to indemnify a public employee for legal fees and costs incurred in defending against criminal charges, it has done so in clear language. See, e.g., St. 1983, c. 337, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 (city of Waltham could, in its discretion, indemnify public employee for \u201cfines, penalties, [and] legal and professional fees and costs . . . arising out of any . . . criminal complaint or application therefor, [or] indictment\u201d). There is no comparable language in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Triplett has excluded from his fee request the fees incurred with respect to the admitted ethics violations. In doing so, he impliedly concedes that it would be repugnant to require municipalities to pay for the legal fees of those found guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>criminal charges or ethics violations in connection with their official duties. Yet G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 13, contains no restriction limiting reimbursement based on the outcome of the underlying \u201cclaim, demand, suit or judgment.\u201d To the contrary, the indemnification covers the officer even if the officer is found liable for that \u201cclaim, demand, suit or judgment.\u201d Whatever the equitable merits of reimbursing a wrongly accused municipal officer, nothing in \u00a7 13 would limit reimbursement to those cases in which the fees were incurred as part of a successful defense. This confirms our view that \u00a7 13 was not intended to address that problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We recognize that the financial burden of a successful defense against criminal indictments or ethics charges can be substantial. This is so whether or not the defendant is a municipal or other public employee. The Legislature has considered whether to indemnify public officials for their defenses of criminal charges. It has not acted. We see no basis to interpret the existing legislation beyond its \u201cmain object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We reverse the denial of the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment, vacate the order of partial summary judgment for Triplett, and order that judgment be entered for the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed by the Attorney General and the State Ethics Commission; Common Cause Massachusetts; and the Massachusetts Police Association, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The parties agree that the town accepted this section in the manner specified in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The Commonwealth could be sued for breach of contract, injuries caused by highway defects, and private nuisances that caused injury to property.

A municipality could also be held liable for an employee\u2019s acts undertaken for the municipality\u2019s own profit or corporate interests, but not for an employee\u2019s acts undertaken for the public good.
