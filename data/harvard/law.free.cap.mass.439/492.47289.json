L. c. 272, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After denying the defendant\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>dismiss,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3the judge reported two questions of law to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979):<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (1) \u201cIs exposure or attempted exposure of genitalia an essential element of an open and gross lewdness offense prosecuted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16?\u201d; and (2) did the defendant \u201chave fair notice that exposure of \u2018thong\u2019 clad buttocks could be prosecuted as an open and gross lewdness offense under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16?\u201d We transferred the report here on our own motion. We answer both questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>For the purpose of deciding the reported questions, we need consider only the factual assumption contained in the second question, that the defendant exposed his \u201c \u2018thong\u2019 clad buttocks.\u201d To explain the context in which the charge arose, however, we recite the allegations contained in a Boston police incident report concerning the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">At about 3 p.m., four young girls, aged thirteen years, were walking behind their parochial school, presumably at the end of their school day. The defendant, whose automobile was parked on a nearby street, was standing outside the school, and, as one of the young girls described, he \u201cpulled down his pants as the girls walked by exposing his buttocks along with a pair of red \u2018thong\u2019 underwear.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A boy alerted a police officer on patrol in the area that there was a man behind the school \u201cpulling his pants down showing a group of girls his \u2018thong\u2019 underwear.\u201d From the boy\u2019s description of the perpetrator, the officer located the defendant and saw the young girls walking away from him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>At the scene, the police officer placed the defendant under arrest for \u201copen and gross lewdness.\u201d After receiving Miranda warnings, the defendant stated, \u201cYou stupid mother fucker you don\u2019t have indecent exposure. I didn\u2019t pull my prick out. I only pulled down my pants. It\u2019s not against the law to pull your pants down and show people your thongs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">2. <em>Interpretation of G. L. c. 272, 16. </em>The offense of \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is \u201cclosely similar\u201d to the offense of \u201copen and gross lewdness,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 116 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, </em>315 Mass. 20, 22 (1943) (open and gross lewdness is \u201can offence at least closely similar to the common law offence of indecent exposure\u201d). The exposure of genitalia has been defined by judicial interpretation as an essential element of the offense of indecent exposure. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>420 Mass. 535, 540-541 (1995).* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant argues that we should require the same limitation as an essential element of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>exposure of genitalia is not an essential element of the crime of open and gross lewdness: a defendant may be convicted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, for exposing his buttocks provided, of course, that the other elements of that crime are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880) (describing elements of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We interpret statutes that address similar subject matter \u201cso that effect is given to every provision in all of them.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 554 (1996), quoting 2B Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02, at 122 (5th ed. 1992). Although the two statutes, \u201copen and gross lewdness,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, are similar, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396, they have different elements, reflecting (in part) their different origins. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 538 (1978) (\u201cThe history of \u00a7 16 is quite separate from that of \u00a7 53 . . .\u201d). The \u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d statute was first enacted in 1784, and, for over 200 years, has remained essentially unchanged.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> St. 1784, c. 40, \u00a7 3. In contrast, the crime of \u201cindecent exposure\u201d was not codified until 1943, see St. 1943, c. 377, although it was recognized as an offense at common law. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, supra </em>at 22 (common-law offense of indecent exposure). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 493-495 (1971) (legislative history of St. 1943, c. 377).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The two statutes prohibit different conduct. Any intentional exposure of genitalia may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, supra </em>at 21-22 (indecent exposure prohibits \u201can intentional act of lewd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>exposure, offensive to one or more persons\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Conviction of \u201copen and gross lewdness,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, on the other hand, requires the Commonwealth to prove, among other elements, intention, manner (done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock), and impact (does in fact alarm or shock). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, supra </em>at 53 (\u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d construed to prohibit a defendant from \u201cintentionally, indecently, and offensively exposing himself. . . without necessity or reasonable excuse, and in such a way as to produce alarm\u201d). The requirement that the defendant must engage in conduct such as actually to alarm or shock another has remained unchanged since 1880.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, supra </em>(elements of open and gross lewdness); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy G., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 274 n.4 (2001) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poillucci, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 302 (1999) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 901 (1996) (same). Whichever \u201cprivate parts of one\u2019s body,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, supra </em>at 539, is intentionally exposed, the fact finder must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted in such a way as to alarm or shock. In contrast, to sustain a conviction of indecent exposure, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, the Commonwealth is not required to prove the elements of alarm or shock. Greater precision of the offensive conduct (exposure of genitalia) is therefore necessary under that statute to give a defendant constitutionally adequate notice of the circumscribed offensive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The defendant notes that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, supra </em>at 541, we commented that convictions of \u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, \u201cinvariably have involved exposure of the genitalia,\u201d citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271 (1983) (masturbating in automobile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>348 Mass. 767 (1964) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, supra </em>at 53 (defendant\u2019s indecent exposure \u201cof his person\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poillucci, supra </em>at 302 (masturbating in car); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montez, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 806 (1997) (standing in window of apartment and masturbating); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, supra </em>at 901 (oral sex). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Maunsell, </em>170 Vt. 543, 547 (1999) (affirming defendant\u2019s conviction of open and gross lewdness while masturbating through his pants and without exposure of penis). While such conduct is sufficient to support a conviction under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, in none of these cases did the court suggest that \u201clewd and lascivious behavior\u201d is confined to exposure of genitals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The sudden exposure of but-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tacks by dropping one\u2019s pants in front of children<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in an area (school) where such conduct would be wholly unexpected may alarm or shock, as surely as revealing one\u2019s penis. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117-118 (1980) (conduct that involves \u201ctouching of the . . . buttocks,\u201d covered or uncovered, \u201cfor purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense\u201d is an element of the \u201csex-related\u201d criminal offense of \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious behavior.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A woman approaching a group of school children suddenly opening her blouse to expose her breasts may alarm or shock just as a man masturbating in a passing automobile might. If the conduct is intentionally committed such as to produce alarm or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>shock, it may be prohibited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, supra </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Pointing to the number of people who are seen wearing \u201cthongs\u201d on public beaches, the defendant argues that unless limited to exposure of genitalia, our statute outlawing lewd and lascivious conduct will be cast adrift in the \u201cshifting community notions of good taste.\u201d A woman revealing her knees in public in 1890 may have offended the then community notions of good taste. But the issue then, as now, is not whether a defendant\u2019s conduct offends \u201cgood taste,\u201d but whether the conduct is such that it causes alarm or shock. Today, society may tolerate far greater displays of nudity, including the exposure of genitalia on public beaches. But the defendant does not argue that the crime of \u201copen and gross lewd and lascivious behavior\u201d has become obsolete such that all public displays of nudity, no matter how alarming or shocking, must be tolerated. In his view, it is simply a matter of degree: exposure of genitalia, but not breasts or buttocks, may be prosecuted. We see no reason to restrict the definition of open and gross lewdness in the manner he urges, and have no difficulty in concluding that a fact finder could find that the exposure of buttocks may in some circumstances alarm or shock in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">3. <em>Fair notice. </em>While the exposure of buttocks can be prosecuted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, we agree with the defendant that he was not provided with fair notice that deliberately exposing his thong-clad buttocks may be illegal. The statute is therefore unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201cAn essential principle of due process is that a statute may not proscribe conduct \u2018in terms so vague that [persons] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 110, quoting <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). A vague statute offends due process because of \u201cits lack of reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement and its consequent encouragement of arbitrary and erratic arrests and prosecutions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra. </em>A statute, the terms of which do not themselves provide clear guidelines, may nonetheless be sufficiently definite because of \u201cjudicial construction, common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>law meaning, or the statutory history of particular terms,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gallant, 373 Mass. 577, 581 (1977), and such a statute may be rendered \u201cconstitutionally definite by giving it a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,\u201d neither mentions exposure of the buttocks nor, without further judicial construction, informs a person precisely which private body parts may not be exposed. In ordinary usage, \u201clewdness\u201d or \u201clascivious behavior\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> convey no more specific meaning than the terms \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cwanton,\u201d which we have said failed to reference sufficiently definite conduct, and applied only \u201cbroadly to conduct which the speaker considers beyond the bounds of propriety.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 111, quoting <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial Dist. 25 </em>Cal. 3d 238, 246-247 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">As to judicial construction, our decisions have made clear that the exposure of genitalia may be prohibited by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 395-396 (exposing penis to two ten year old boys); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271 (1983) (driving slowly down public way with penis exposed and masturbating). Our decisions have not otherwise provided sufficiently \u201cclear and definite content\u201d of the range of other conduct that is prohibited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 115. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>420 Mass. 535, 541 (1995) (noting that cases under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, to that date \u201cinvariably have involved exposure of the genitalia\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And while some decisions have indicated that exposure of \u201cbuttocks\u201d is encompassed within the zone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>conduct prohibited by statutes outlawing \u201clewd\u201d or \u201clascivious\u201d behavior, those decisions did not interpret G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and could not have provided notice to the defendant that his behavior would violate that statute. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sefranka, <em>supra </em>at 117-118 (noting that touching buttocks for sexual arousal may constitute offense of \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Castillo, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 566 &amp; n.1 (2002) (\u201cthe breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area\u201d are private areas for purposes of indecent assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In short, with the exception of the exposure of genitalia, no \u201clongstanding judicial interpretation [of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16] clearly conveys \u2018sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971). This defendant cannot be prosecuted for exposing his buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>In order to satisfy the constitutional standard of specificity, we construe G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, to prohibit the intentional exposure<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of genitalia, buttocks, or female breasts to one or more persons. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant exposed his or her, genitals, buttocks, or female breasts to one or more persons; (2) the defendant did so intentionally; (3) the defendant did so \u201copenly,\u201d that is, either he or she intended public exposure, or he or she recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of public exposure, to others who might be offended by such conduct; (4) the defendant\u2019s act was done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock; and (5) one or more persons were in fact alarmed or shocked by the defendant\u2019s exposing himself or herself.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880) (\u201cthe conduct of the defendant [exposing himself in a house to two girls] was intentionally open and public, as distinguished from that which is intended to be private, covered and concealed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Almost all jurisdictions prohibit \u201cindecent exposure\u201d by statute similar to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. Like Massachusetts, the exposure of genitalia is either expressly proscribed in the statute or judicially required for conviction of that offense. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-6-68 (1934); Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-7-302 (2002); Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 707-734 (1993); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17 \u00a7 35-854 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, supra </em>at 540 (describing jurisprudence of \u201cindecent exposure\u201d in other States). In contrast, only seven States have a statutory offense of \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u201d or \u201copen or gross lewdness\u201d similar to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16. See Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 798.02 (West 2000); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.335 (West 1991); Minn. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 617.23 (West 2003); Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 201.210 (1996); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, \u00a7 2601 (1998); Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-345 (1996); W. Va. Code \u00a7 61-8-4 (2000). As far as we can ascertain, there is no decision interpreting those statutes in such a manner as to cabin the offensive conduct to the intentional exposure of genitalia. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coyle, </em>718 So. 2d 218, 219 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1998) (\u201c[Lewdness] is generally used to indicate gross indecency with respect to the sexual relations\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mell, </em>227 Mich. App. 508, 512, rev\u2019d in part, 459 Mich. 881 (1998) (lap dancing done for purpose of masturbation); <em>Young </em>v. <em>State, </em>109 Nev. 205, 215 (1993) (masturbation and oral copulation in public restroom); <em>State </em>v. <em>Purvis, </em>146 Vt. 441, 442 (1985) (defendant exposed himself to young girls). In at least one reported decision, the exposure of genitals is not an essential element of the open and gross lewdness statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Maunsell, </em>170 Vt. 543 (1999) (defendant masturbated through pants).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Convictions under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, have usually concerned exposure in front of children. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, supra </em>at 53 (\u201cif the Commonwealth were to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u2018intentionally, indecently, and offensively expos[ed] himself ... to [a child] of tender years, without necessity or reasonable excuse, and in such a way as to produce alarm . . . [the defendant would be] guilty of gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\">For the purposes of interpreting the offense of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, and indecent assault and battery on a person aged fourteen years and over, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H, buttocks are included as a \u201cprivate area\u201d of the body. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 757-758 (1995) (no error in jury instruction that \u201can assault and battery was indecent if it involved the touching of the genitals, buttocks or breasts\u201d because judge also instructed that conduct must be \u201cfundamentally offensive to contemporary standards of decency and moral values\u201d and that indecent act is to be \u201cmeasured by common understanding and practices,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is behavior which the common sense of society would regard as immodest, immoral, and improper\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holman, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 786, 792-793 (2001) (affirming conviction of indecent assault and battery on child under fourteen years where defendant rubbed child\u2019s buttocks); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 181, 185 (1991) (touching of buttocks and verbal proposition with \u201cdistinctly sexual overtones\u201d warranted finding of indecent assault and battery).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In other contexts, the Legislature has included \u201cbuttocks\u201d in its definition of sexual conduct or sexual contact. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C (vii) (for purposes of child pornography statute \u201ca lewd exhibition of the unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks or, if such person is a female, a fully or partially developed breast\u201d of child is depiction of sexual conduct); G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11L (including in definition of sexual contact for unlicenced mental health and health professionals as intentional touching of \u201cgenital area, groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or breast or the clothing covering any of these body parts\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> \u201cLascivious\u201d is defined as: \u201c1. Given to or expressing lust; lecherous. 2. Exciting sexual desire; salacious.\u201d \u201cLewd\u201d is defined as: \u201c1. a. Preoccupied with sex and sexual desire; lustful. 2. b. Obscene; indecent.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1016, 1035 (3d ed. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The Commonwealth notes that Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instruction for Use in the District Court (1988), see note 16, <em>infra, </em>specifically mentions the exposure of buttocks. Those instructions are not, however, binding law. Moreover, in a reported decision in which that instruction was favorably cited by the Appeals Court, the court described the relevant element as the exposure of the defendant\u2019s \u201cgenitals,\u201d the conduct at issue in that case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 901 (1996). Later, in <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Guy G., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 274 n.4 (2001), the Appeals Court again recited instruction 5.42 favorably, this time including a specific reference to \u201cbuttocks.\u201d But that decision was issued after the defendant\u2019s arrest in 2001, and could not have placed the defendant on notice that his conduct was illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">We are not asked to determine whether, under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, masturbation, without the exposure of genitalia, would constitute prohibited conduct. See <em>State </em>v. Maunsell, 170 Vt. 543 (1999) (affirming defendant\u2019s conviction of open and gross lewdness while masturbating through his pants).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Instruction 5.42 correctly provides in relevant part that in order to prove the defendant guilty under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove five things beyond a reasonable doubt: <em>First: </em>That the defendant exposed his (her) (genitals) (buttocks) (or) (female breasts) to one or more persons; <em>Second: </em>That the defendant did so intentionally; <em>Third: </em>That the defendant did so \u2018openly,\u2019 that is, either he (she) intended public exposure, or he (she) recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of public exposure, to others who might be offended by such conduct; <em>Fourth: </em>That the defendant\u2019s act was done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock; and <em>Fifth: </em>That one or more persons were in fact alarmed or shocked by the defendant\u2019s thus exposing himself (herself).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
