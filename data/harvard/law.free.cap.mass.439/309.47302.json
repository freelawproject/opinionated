On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge in the Superior Court decided that Safety was required to pay to its policyholder uninsured motor vehicle benefits because the operator of the vehicle that struck him was uninsured, even though the owner of that vehicle carried insurance. Safety appealed and we granted its application for direct appellate review. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">1. <em>Background. </em>These facts are not disputed. On August 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>1999, Nichole Bruton, driving a U-Haul truck, struck Nigel Seale\u2019s parked vehicle, injuring Seale, who was sitting in his vehicle. We proceed on the premise that Bruton was legally responsible for the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The U-Haul truck was owned by a third party and, at the time of the accident, was insured by Republic Western Insurance Company (Republic Western). This policy provided coverage for bodily injury for which operators of the U-Haul truck were legally responsible, to a limit of $20,000 a person. Bruton held a policy issued by Trust Insurance Company (Trust), which contained optional bodily injury liability coverage for causing bodily injury while driving a third party\u2019s vehicle, to a limit of $20,000 a person. Seale was insured under an automobile policy issued by Safety. This policy (sixth edition standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy) provided uninsured motor vehicle (UM) coverage to a limit of $20,000 a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Seale first pursued the insurance of the U-Haul truck\u2019s owner, and demanded from Republic Western payment of the limit of that policy; Republic Western agreed to pay. Seale then pursued the insurance of Bruton, the operator, and demanded from Trust payment of the limit of the Trust policy. Trust, however, was subsequently adjudged to be insolvent by this court, effective August 2, 2000. By reason of G. L. c. 175D, the Fund became obligated to pay certain \u201ccovered claims\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the Trust policy, subject to certain restrictions in the Fund\u2019s statute, G. L. c. 175D. See <em>Clark Equip. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>423 Mass. 165, 166-167 (1996). Seale therefore demanded payment from the Fund of the bodily injury claims that would have been covered under the Trust policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Fund rejected Seale\u2019s claim. It reasoned as follows. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>exhaustion provision of G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 9,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires that claimants look first to available coverage provided by solvent insurers before resorting to the Fund (which stands in place of the insolvent carrier). <em>Vokey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>381 Mass. 386, 389-390 (1980). Under the Safety policy, a vehicle responsible for an accident that is insured by an insolvent insurer is treated as \u201cuninsured,\u201d triggering UM coverage. Because Trust was insolvent, the Fund reasoned, Seale was able to recover UM benefits under the Safety policy, and was required to do so by G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 9. This, the Fund claimed, reduced the Fund\u2019s liability to zero, because of the second sentence of \u00a7 9, which states a rule of nonduplication of recovery. See <em>Vokey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, supra </em>at 390. Because the Safety policy\u2019s UM limit was the same as Trust\u2019s optional bodily injury liability limit ($20,000), the Fund claimed it had no obligation to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Seale then made demand on Safety for UM benefits. Safety denied coverage, stating that, because Republic Western insured the U-Haul truck and was not insolvent, UM benefits did not obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The Fund then filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231 A, seeking declarations to the effect that UM coverage is available under the Safety policy and that the Fund has no obligation to pay. Safety counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that no UM coverage is available to Seale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Fund and Safety filed cross motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge allowed the Fund\u2019s motion and denied Safety\u2019s. The judge reasoned that UM benefits are available if either the owner <em>or </em>operator legally responsible is uninsured, and Bruton is treated as uninsured because of Trust\u2019s insolvency. Thus, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>cording to the judge, UM coverage was available and the Fund\u2019s liability is reduced to zero by the set-off provision in G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The issue in this case is whether an injured party is entitled to UM benefits under his automobile insurance policy when the vehicle that caused the accident is insured by the owner, but the operator of that vehicle is not separately insured.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982) (responsibility for construing language of insurance policy is for trial judge and reviewing court).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The policy at issue is the standard policy. Its language is controlled by the Commissioner of Insurance. Thus, the UM provision is not construed against the insurance company, but in conformity with the statute, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, which dictates its content. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 517, 522 n.6 (1999). We interpret the policy according to the \u201cfair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 174, 179 (2001), quoting <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984). The UM provision in the Safety policy (Part 3), states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201cPart 3. Bodily Injury Caused By An Uninsured Auto</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is uninsured. Some accidents involve unidentified hit-and-run autos. Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily injury to people injured or killed in certain accidents caused by uninsured or hit-and-run autos. We will pay only if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from' the owner or operator of the uninsured or hit-and-run auto. . . . Sometimes the company insuring the auto responsible for an accident will . . . become insolvent. We consider such an auto to be uninsured for purposes of this Part. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The portion of the statute requiring UM coverage, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1), states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cNo policy shall be issued or delivered . . . unless [it] provides coverage [in stated amounts] under provisions approved by the insurance commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles . . . and . . . such coverage shall include an insured motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof [is insolvent].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We conclude that both the statute and the Safety policy contemplate that UM benefits apply only when the <em>motor vehicle </em>is uninsured. Under the statute, UM benefits must be provided when (1) the insured is legally entitled to recover damages for certain injuries from the owner or operator of a motor vehicle and (2) the motor vehicle responsible for the accident is uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The judge erred when he construed the word \u201cuninsured\u201d to modify \u201cowner or operator.\u201d It describes the vehicle. Section 113L refers unambiguously to \u201cuninsured <em>motor vehicles\u201d </em>and \u201cinsured <em>motor vehicle[s]\u201d </em>(emphases added). Similarly, the Safety policy statement that UM benefits will be provided only if the injured party is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an \u201cuninsured . . . <em>auto,\u201d </em>speaks of the \u201ccompany insuring the <em>auto\u201d </em>becoming insolvent, and states that it considers \u201csuch an <em>auto\u201d </em>to be uninsured (emphases added). The first sentence of the Safety policy\u2019s UM provision, which speaks of an owner or operator\u2019s being uninsured, contains the only language supporting the Fund\u2019s position. This is an inartful shorthand reference to uninsured vehicles. The \u201cfair meaning\u201d of this part of the policy, read as a whole and in the context of the insurance scheme in Massachusetts, makes this abundantly clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Massachusetts requires the insurance of <em>motor vehicles. </em>E.g., G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1A (requiring liability insurance before vehicle registration); \u00a7 3 (vehicles owned by non-residents); \u00a7 34C (single policy covering more than one vehicle); \u00a7 34D (deposit of cash in lieu of liability bond or policy); \u00a7 34H (revocation of registration on cancellation of insurance policy); \u00a7 34J (penalizing operating an uninsured <em>vehicle)', </em>\u00a7 340 (property damage liability coverage); \u00a7 34P (seizure of registration plates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>uninsured vehicles). By contrast, one may obtain and renew a driver\u2019s license without submitting evidence of insurance. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 8. Insurance coverage operates primarily with respect to <em>motor vehicles. </em>To a certain, limited extent, compulsory insurance \u201ctravels with\u201d the policyholder, protecting the holder even when he or she is not driving the vehicle for which the insurance was purchased.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The policyholder may opt to expand this coverage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it remains the motor vehicle that must be insured, rather than the operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The 1959 Report of the Special Commission Relative to the Motor Vehicle Laws and the Insurance Laws as They Relate to Motor Vehicles, which both Safety and the Fund cite, contemplated the effect of changing the laws to insure the individual driver instead of the vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1959 Senate Doc. No. 466, at 120-121. The commission declined to make a recommendation, as it considered the change to be \u201ca proposal so revolutionary in concept and in practice that it should be made the basis of an entirely separate study.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121. See <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1120 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">It is true, as the Fund notes, that St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 5, which inserted G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, was entitled, \u201cAn Act. . . requiring compulsory insurance coverage for damages caused by uninsured motorists\u201d (emphasis added). But this tells only part of the story. When UM coverage first became available in the Commonwealth the statute\u2019s title referred to \u201coperators of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>uninsured <em>motor vehicles\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See St. 1966, c. 260. See also St. 1980, c. 532. \u201c[A]lthough the title of an act is often helpful in interpreting the body of a statute, it is not conclusive.\u201d <em>Baldiga </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Uxbridge, </em>395 Mass. 829, 835 (1985). Throughout the various iterations and recodifications of the UM statute, the Legislature has used \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d and \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d interchangeably. The statute has even oscillated between these. Thus, what was \u201cuninsured motor vehicles\u201d in St. 1968, c. 643, \u00a7 5, became \u201cuninsured motorists\u201d in St. 1980, c. 532, \u00a7 2, and reverted to \u201cuninsured motor vehicles\u201d in St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46, which is how it remains today. In fact, the present statute uses \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d at times, see G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1) &amp; (2), \u201c[u]ninsured motorists,\u201d at another time, see G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (5). We, too, have used both terms interchangeably. Compare <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pascar, </em>421 Mass. 442, 444 n.4 (1995) (uninsured motor vehicle coverage); <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>367 Mass. 106, 107 (1975) (same) with <em>Berger </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood, Inc., </em>424 Mass. 144, 150 (1997) (uninsured motorist coverage); <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>American Cas. Co., </em>419 Mass. 138, 141-142 (1994) (same). This merely reflects the paradigm of an operator who is also the owner of the vehicle. Moreover, the terms of the standard policy itself reflect that, generally, compulsory insurance covers the owner and those operating the vehicle with the owner\u2019s consent. Nonetheless, these words do not alter the structure of the insurance scheme the Legislature established: it is the <em>vehicle </em>that must be insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We reject the Fund\u2019s argument that G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 9 (see note 3, supra) bars Seale from recovering from the Fund. That statute, which requires exhaustion of other policies before recovery from the Fund, is inapplicable. See <em>Vokey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>381 Mass. 386, 389-390 (1980). The exhaustion requirement applies only when a person has a claim against his insurer. Here, because the U-Haul truck was insured by a solvent insurer, Republic Western, Seale has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>no claim for UM coverage. The Fund also argues that Seale\u2019s claim is not a \u201c[c]overed claim\u201d under G. L. c. 175D, \u00a7 1 (2) (see note 2, supra) because payment by the Fund would benefit another insurer (Safety), relieving it of an obligation. This is not so. Safety is not relieved of an obligation; it had none. An interpretation of G. L. c. 175D that would automatically shift liability from the Fund to the nearest solvent insurer would do violence to the legislatively established scheme. Cf. <em>Dufresne\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 87-88 (2001) (workers\u2019 compensation insurer not entitled to offset settlement monies that included assets from the Fund); <em>Ferrari </em>v. <em>Toto, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 483, 484-486 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>383 Mass. 36, 37-38 (1981) (no liability on Fund because any payment would go not to plaintiffs but to workers\u2019 compensation insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The Fund suggests that our interpretation renders less protection to persons in the case of insolvent insurers than in the case of unidentified vehicles. This is not correct. A person in Seale\u2019s position remains protected; he simply must look to the Fund to recover rather than to his UM benefits. It is true that Seale would have been able to recover UM benefits had Bruton fled the scene, and therefore been \u201cunidentified,\u201d but such is the nature of hit-and-run accidents. Seale would not have recovered from the owner\u2019s insurer in that case. Thus, he may in fact be better off now that he can recover from <em>two </em>\u201clegally responsible\u201d entities, the owner and the operator. \u201cHowever, the statute and the policy prescribed by it. . .are clear.\u201d <em>Alguila </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>416 Mass. 494, 499 (1993). Any argument about \u201cirrational outcomes\u201d must be addressed to the Legislature. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The result reached here does not conflict with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That section essentially entitles the UM carrier to recover amounts the insured received from legally responsible persons, in certain circumstances. The Fund is correct that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>provision contemplates situations in which UM benefits are available even though the insured has partially recovered from another source. Our interpretation does not conflict with \u00a7 113L (4). If, for example, an insured were to recover from the personal assets of an uninsured tortfeasor, his UM carrier may have a claim for setoff or reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>In cases where the legally responsible operator of a motor vehicle is not the owner of that vehicle, the relevant inquiry for applicability of UM benefits is whether the <em>motor vehicle </em>was insured. In this case, the U-Haul truck <em>was </em>insured by Republic Western. No UM benefits were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The judgment is vacated.
