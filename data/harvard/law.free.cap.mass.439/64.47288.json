L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where the inmate and the codefendant knew that the conversation was being recorded, but the defendant did not. We conclude that the recording need not be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>On February 22, 2000, a grand jury in Plymouth County returned an indictment against the defendant, Demetrius Ennis, charging him with murder in the first degree. On July 16, 2001, Ennis filed a motion to suppress the audiotape recording, which contained allegedly incriminating statements. A Superior Court judge allowed the motion and suppressed the recording. The Commonwealth took an interlocutory appeal, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We first summarize the relevant uncontested findings of the motion judge. On December 28, 1999, the victim was found shot to death in the trunk of his automobile. During the ensuing investigation, the police learned of a telephone conversation that had taken place on the same day among Steven Knight, Jaear Williams, and Ennis. At the time, Knight was an inmate in the Plymouth County house of correction, and the telephone call was recorded pursuant to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 482.07(3)(d) (1993) (\u201cAll inmate telephone calls, except calls to pre-authorized attorney telephone numbers are subject to telephone monitoring\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Knight placed two collect telephone calls to Williams that day. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 482.07(3)(a) (1993) (\u201cAll inmate calls shall be one-way collect calls only, utilizing an automated operator\u201d). Williams\u2019s girl friend answered the first call, heard a recorded message, and then handed the telephone to Williams. After a brief conversation with Knight, Williams tried to add Ennis to the telephone call, but the call was disconnected. See note 2, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Knight then telephoned Williams a second time. Williams\u2019s girl friend again answered the telephone, but this time, both Williams and Knight heard an automated announcement to the effect that a collect telephone call was being placed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>inmate, that the call was being recorded, and that the call would disconnect if the recipient attempted to activate a three-way or conference call feature. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 482.07 (3)(f) and (g) (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Williams accepted the call and despite the warning, he was able to add Ennis to the conversation, presumably using a telephone conferencing feature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 45As a result, Ennis did not hear the automated announcement, and it is undisputed that he did not know that his communications were being recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Williams and Ennis are codefendants in the underlying murder case. In allowing Ennis\u2019s motion, the judge \u201cdeem[ed] the interception of the telephone conversation unlawful\u201d because, he ruled, there was no evidence that Ennis knew that the conversation was being recorded. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>426 Mass. 313, 315 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 66 (1987) (\u201csecret transmission or recording of oral communications without the consent of <em>all </em>parties is generally proscribed by \u00a7 99\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>370 Mass. 502, 507 (1976) (recording is \u201csecret\u201d if party does not have \u201cactual knowledge of the recording\u201d). The Commonwealth concedes that the recording at issue was an \u201cinterception,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>department did not \u201cunlawfully\u201d intercept Ennis\u2019s statements because it did not do so \u201cwillfully.\u201d See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C l.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Section 99 P of the Massachusetts wiretap act, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, provides that a criminal defendant may \u201cmove to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom,\u201d but only in circumstances enumerated in the wiretap act. Ennis relies on three grounds for suppression, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 1, 2, and 5, and we must therefore determine whether the communication was \u201cunlawfully intercepted,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 1, or was \u201cnot intercepted in accordance with the terms of this section,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 2, or whether the recording was \u201cillegally obtained,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The wiretap act does not explicitly define these terms, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>makes clear that a person \u201cintercepting\u201d an oral communication commits an \u201coffense\u201d only when he or she acts \u201cwillfully.\u201d See note 6, <em>supra. </em>This requirement is consistent with the wiretap act\u2019s purposes to circumscribe purposeful \u201celectronic eavesdropping,\u201d i.e., secret recordings of conversations, except as specifically authorized by the Legislature. In enacting the wiretap act the Legislature sought to curtail two \u201cgrave dangers\u201d: (1) \u201cthe increasing activities of organized crime\u201d and (2) \u201cthe uncontrolled development and unrestricted use of modem electronic surveillance devices,\u201d which the Legislature termed a danger \u201cto the privacy of all citizens.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As to the first, the Legislature determined that to combat organized crime, law enforcement officials should be permitted to engage in electronic surveillance, but only if judicially authorized. See <em>id. </em>Second, the Legislature sought to prohibit all \u201csecret\u201d electronic eavesdropping by \u201cprivate individuals,\u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but provided that such conduct is an \u201coffense\u201d subject to criminal sanction only if done \u201cwillfully.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 1. Thus, not every recording of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>an oral communication without the knowledge of all participants is an \u201coffense,\u201d nor is every such recording \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cillegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In this case, the department did not wilfully record any oral communication of Ennis, secretly or otherwise. The department did wilfully record inmate Knight\u2019s telephone call to Williams, announcing to both parties that their conversation would be recorded. But the department affirmatively sought to prevent any additional party from being added to that two-party telephone conversation. See 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 482.07(3)(g) (1993) (\u201cany attempt to access a three party line or conference call will cause the [department\u2019s telephone] system to immediately disconnect the call\u201d), and 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 482.07(3)(b) (1993) (\u201cthree way or conference calling . . . [is] prohibited\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no evidence that the department\u2019s system failed or that the department could have taken other steps to prevent Williams from including Ennis in the telephone conversation. By whatever means (the record is not clear) Williams was able to bypass the feature intended to disconnect the call.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Certainly the department did not <em>\u201csecretly </em>record\u201d any part of the result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ing conversation wilfully. The department informed all of the anticipated parties to the collect telephone call that their communications would be recorded. The wiretap act is not so broad as to impose liability each time an additional party is added to a two-party conversation in circumstances beyond the recorder\u2019s knowledge, direction, or control. Because there was no wilful conduct by the department, there was no \u201cunlawful\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d interception, see G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 1 and 5, Ennis cannot prevail on either of these two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">As to the third ground for suppression claimed by Ennis, as noted above the Commonwealth has conceded that there was an \u201cinterception\u201d and does not argue that the interception was \u201cin accordance with the terms of this section.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 2. General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 D, sets forth the circumstances in which an \u201cinterception\u201d is affirmatively authorized, none of which is relevant to the department\u2019s recording in this case. However, even where the recording is an \u201cinterception,\u201d see note 6, <em>supra, </em>and is not \u201cin accordance with\u201d the wiretap act, suppression is not automatically warranted. The exclusionary rule is designed \u201cto deter future police conduct in violation of constitutional or statutory rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>406 Mass. 421, 423 (1990). Ennis\u2019s oral communications were caused to be recorded solely because of conduct by Williams. There is nothing to indicate that the Commonwealth was culpable, or even negligent, and \u201c[n]o deterrent purpose would be served by suppressing the intercepted conversations.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The order of suppression is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">GeneraI Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99, is the Massachusetts wiretap act (wiretap act).

Order-by-telephone retailers, telemarketers, and financial institutions, among others, commonly record telephone calls after first informing the person answering the telephone that the call may be recorded. The announcement of the recording may be, as in this case, automated. The party receiving the telephone call hears the announcement, but may then add a third party without the knowledge or consent of the person making the recording. Because the Commonwealth does not dispute the issue, we need not decide whether a person recording a telephone call (here the department) commits an \u201cinterception\u201d where the original parties to the call (here Knight and Williams) are informed that the call is being recorded and where the addition of a sequential party (here Ennis) is beyond the recorder\u2019s knowledge or control.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b87-12\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 C, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cOffenses. 1. Interception, oral communications prohibited. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section any person who \u2014 <em>willfully </em>commits an interception, attempts to commit an interception, or procures any other person to commit an interception or to attempt to commit an interception of any wire or oral communication shall be fined. . . or imprisoned ... or both . . (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b87-13\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 99 P, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who is a defendant in a criminal trial in a court of the commonwealth may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom, for the following reasons: (1) [t]hat the communication was unlawfully intercepted^] (2) [t]hat the communication was not intercepted in accordance with the terms of this section ... (5) [t]hat the evidence sought to be introduced was illegally obtained.\u201d The three other enumerated grounds each concern interceptions made pursuant to a warrant, and are not at issue here. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 P 3, 4, and 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b87-14\">It is unclear whether, on appeal, Ennis continues to rely on all three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>grounds for suppression. In his brief, Ennis cites to subsections P 1 and P 2 only, but at oral argument, Ennis referenced subsection P 5. Because all three grounds were argued below and because it is the Commonwealth, and not Ennis, pursuing this appeal, we consider all three grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The first version of the wiretap act was enacted in 1920. See St. 1920, c. 558. In 1968, having substantially revised the wiretap act once, see St. 1959, c. 449, \u00a7 1, the Legislature further amended the statute, adding the provisions relevant here. St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1. The 1968 amendments were introduced in the wake of a study by a special commission on electronic eavesdropping. See Res. 1964, c. 82 (establishing special commission). See also Interim Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1967 Sen. Doc. No. 1469; Interim Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1967 Sen. Doc. No. 1198; Report of the Special Commission on Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Sen. Doc. No. 1132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The special commission\u2019s report suggests at least two reasons for the latter concern. First, the commission heard testimony that newly developed inventions, \u201ceavesdropping devices\u201d and \u201cbugs,\u201d could be easily concealed and used to monitor private conversations secretly and continuously. 1967 Sen. Doc. No. 1198, at 3. The commission feared that \u201c[a] person with a minimal education in electronics [could] easily install these commercially available devices for purposes of illegally intercepting wire or oral communications.\u201d 1968 Sen. Doc. No. 1132, at 6. Second, the commission was informed that New England Telephone and Telegraph Company had been conducting \u201cservice observations,\u201d during which the company would secretly record private telephone calls to monitor service and customer perceptions of service. See <em>id. </em>at 6-7; 1967 Sen. Doc. No. 1198, at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Ennis argues that the department promulgated the regulatory prohibition on three-way and conference calling \u201cto ensure compliance with [the wiretap act].\u201d To the contrary, the \u201cdepartment promulgated these telephone regulations to prevent inmates from using the telephone system for illegal activities such as planning escapes, organizing drug trafficking, orchestration of criminal activities, solicitations to murder, and fraudulent use of third-party calls or telephone credit cards . . . [and] for the legitimate purpose of improving the security of the Massachusetts correctional system.\u201d <em>Cacicio </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>422 Mass. 764, 768-770 (1996).

The wiretap act imposes no obligation on a person recording a two-party telephone call to prevent affirmatively the addition of third parties by one of the telephone conversation participants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The motion judge noted that \u201cfor some unknown reason, the [telephone] did not disconnect\u201d when Ennis was added to the telephone call. The judge also stated that the \u201cgovernment system . . . did not properly operate\u201d and that Ennis\u2019s conversation was recorded \u201cdue to the failure of the Commonwealth\u2019s system.\u201d There is no evidence that the system failed, rather than being bypassed or circumvented in some way by Williams. Nor, even if there was some form of equipment or system failure, is there any evidence to indicate whether it was the department\u2019s equipment or system that failed as opposed to some failure on the part of the telephone company\u2019s equipment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>system. Notably, the system functioned properly earlier that day, when it disconnected Williams\u2019s first attempt to add Ennis to the conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We reject the judge\u2019s conclusion that the \u201c[f]uture failure of the [Commonwealth\u2019s] telephone system ought to be deterred.\u201d As noted above, the record does not establish that the Commonwealth\u2019s system \u201cfailed\u201d or that \u201cfuture failure\u201d is within the department\u2019s control and could be \u201cdeterred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
