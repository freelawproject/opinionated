L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB; 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32 [2000]) and to list the plaintiff\u2019s name on the department\u2019s registry of alleged perpetrators (see G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51F; 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.36 [1996]), the plaintiff, Wayne E. Covell, sought judicial review of that decision. A judge in the Superior Court affirmed the department\u2019s decision; the Appeals Court reversed, ordering that Covell\u2019s name be removed from the registry,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 816 (2002); and we granted the department\u2019s application for further appellate review. For the following reasons, we affirm the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>On October 14, 1993, a school guidance counsellor filed a report under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, notifying the department of an allegation that Covell had sexually abused his teenaged stepdaughter, Linda.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following its investigation, the department decided that the allegation of abuse was supported and that Covell\u2019s name should be listed in the department\u2019s registry of alleged perpetrators. The matter was also referred to the office of the district attorney pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (4), and the district attorney brought a complaint against Covell alleging three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Covell sought a hearing with respect to the department\u2019s decision to place his name in the registry, and an initial hearing was held in March, 1994. That hearing officer affirmed the department\u2019s decision; a judge in the Superior Court also af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>firmed the department\u2019s decision; and Covell appealed. While that appeal was pending, Covell\u2019s criminal trial proceeded in the District Court, and the jury acquitted him of all charges. The Appeals Court was notified of that fact, and invoking the doctrine that an agency had the inherent power to reopen proceedings \u201cin compelling situations as justice may require,\u201d the Appeals Court decided to defer action on Covell\u2019s appeal pending his application to reopen the administrative proceedings and submit additional evidence gleaned from the trial at which he was acquitted. <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 433-434 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The matter was reopened, and a new evidentiary hearing before a different hearing officer was conducted. The only live witnesses who testified before the hearing officer were the department\u2019s investigator and Covell. The department also introduced the investigator\u2019s written report. Covell introduced some exhibits and most of the transcript from the criminal trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at which Linda, her mother, and Covell had all testified. The hearing officer found the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Covell married Linda\u2019s mother in 1983, when Linda was three years old. Linda lived with her mother and stepfather and their four children, and visited her biological father out of State each summer. In 1991, Covell acquired a small country store, operating that store in addition to his job at a supermarket. Linda began working at Covell\u2019s store, running the cash register and performing miscellaneous tasks. She worked with Covell at the store for a period in June, 1992, and then left for the summer to visit with her father. The store closed the following spring, at which time Covell acquired another general store in a different town. Linda worked in the new store that spring, again leaving to spend the summer with her father. By the time she returned, Linda was exhibiting what the hearing officer characterized as \u201cchallenging behavior not atypical for teenagers.\u201d Linda was \u201cgrounded,\u201d and lost certain privileges around the home, after her mother and Covell learned that she had lied to them about attending a \u201cslam dance.\u201d Covell also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>disapproved of Linda\u2019s friends, her tastes in music, and her television viewing habits, leading to occasional arguments and confrontations.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In early October, 1993, Linda told a friend that Covell had sexually abused her in the past. On October 12, Linda reported her allegations to a school guidance counsellor, telling the counsellor that the abuse had occurred approximately one and one-half years earlier. At the guidance counsellor\u2019s recommendation, Linda then told her mother. Linda was \u201cextremely upset and crying\u201d while disclosing her allegations to her mother. After that encounter, Linda and her mother met together with the guidance counsellor, whereupon the counsellor filed the required report with the department pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Within the following two weeks, the investigator assigned to the case spoke with the guidance counsellor, Linda, Linda\u2019s mother, and Covell. In her interview, Linda reported that Covell had abused her on three or four separate occasions, each occurring on a Saturday evening when she had been working at the store with Covell. Linda could not recall the exact dates of these incidents, but did remember that her mother had been pregnant at the time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Linda claimed that, after the store closed in the evening, she would sit on a couch in the back room at the store watching television while waiting for her stepfather to complete that day\u2019s paperwork. Linda claimed that, on three or four occasions, Covell came back and sat next to her, placed his hands under her shirt, and fondled her breasts. She said that he would then reach down her pants inside her underwear. These incidents lasted about ten or fifteen minutes each time, with nothing being said by either of them during the incident. Linda was frightened and uncertain how Covell would react if she attempted to stop him. She tried to avoid him afterward, and began protesting that she did not want to work at the store any more.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The mother confronted Covell with Linda\u2019s accusations when he came home from work one evening about one week after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Linda had made her disclosures to the guidance counsellor. The mother put Covell\u2019s belongings on the front steps and told him to leave. He began to cry, collapsed on the porch, and eventually left. The following day, the mother obtained a protective order against Covell. The mother subsequently filed for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">During his interview with the investigator, Covell denied that he had touched Linda in any sexual or inappropriate manner. He confirmed that Linda had worked at the store in June, 1992; that she would watch television while sitting on a couch in the back room after the store closed; and that he would sometimes sit on the couch with her and ask her about the program she was watching. He said that he would hug her and pat her on the back as a way of showing how pleased he was with her helping out at the store. He denied putting his hands inside her clothes or fondling her, saying that \u201cif anything seemed that way it was nothing more than incidental contact\u201d and explaining that \u201c[Linda] always wore a bra anyway.\u201d He also told the investigator that he and Linda would give each other \u201cback rubs,\u201d including rubbing her neck \u201con top of her clothing.\u201d He told the investigator about recent incidents involving discipline of Linda, the increased restrictions that had been placed on her, and that, with both him and her mother standing firm on that discipline, \u201cthe strangle hold on her was too much.\u201d He also explained that he had marital problems and was seeing a counsellor for those problems. He opined that \u201ceverything will be destroyed if he can\u2019t go home,\u201d that he loved his wife, and that the children were \u201cinnocent pawns\u201d in the struggle between himself and his wife. The investigator noted that Covell was \u201cvery nervous, very upset\u201d during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The investigator decided to \u201csupport\u201d Linda\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse, based on the fact that Linda had made her disclosures of abuse \u201cconsistently and in significant detail\u201d to several people, including the investigator, and the fact that Covell had confirmed the accuracy of the events leading up to the alleged abuse. At the hearing, Covell brought out the fact that the investigator had asked Linda some \u201cleading questions,\u201d but the investigator did not feel that posing those questions had impaired the interview. She noted that she had asked Linda some questions to which Linda had responded by denying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>particular forms of abuse had occurred \u2014 for example, despite specific inquiries, Linda denied that there had been any attempt to remove her clothes, denied that Covell had ever removed any of his clothes, and denied that Covell had made any attempt to have her touch or fondle him.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Covell also raised an issue with respect to the time period of this alleged abuse. During the criminal proceedings, the time frame for the alleged incidents had been narrowed down to October, 1992. Both Linda and her mother had testified that Linda was working in the store at that time, after the mother had stopped working in the late stages of her pregnancy. Covell claimed that Linda had not worked at all during the fall of 1992, and that she only resumed work in the spring of 1993 at the new store location. He sought to bolster that claim, and thus impair Linda\u2019s credibility as to the timing, by reference to the store\u2019s obtaining a liquor license and selling liquor during the summer and fall of 1992, whereas Linda had testified at trial that no liquor was sold at the store when she worked there. However, whatever the precise dates of the alleged abuse (as to which Linda had initially been uncertain), Covell acknowledged that Linda had worked in the store alone with him during June, 1992, and as to the later identified October, 1992, period, the mother corroborated Linda\u2019s recollection that she had worked at that time as well. The hearing officer therefore concluded that Linda\u2019s credibility had not been impaired by Covell\u2019s argument concerning the dates on which Linda had worked at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The hearing officer also rejected Covell\u2019s theory that Linda\u2019s allegations had been made in response to recent discipline. The hearing officer noted that Linda\u2019s mother had been \u201cequally if not more involved in handing out punishments\u201d for Linda\u2019s misbehavior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Linda\u2019s mother, despite her involvement in that discipline, had not been the target of any accusations, and the mother had in fact credited Linda\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>at the hands of her stepfather and obtained a protective order against him in the wake of Linda\u2019s disclosures. In her trial testimony, the mother claimed that Covell had met with her in late 1993, after Linda\u2019s allegations had surfaced, at which time he explained to her that he was learning things about himself in counselling and acknowledged being sexually attracted to Linda. Covell denied making any such statement to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Covell claims that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and that he is therefore entitled to reversal of the department\u2019s decision. In the alternative, he claims that if the hearsay allegations presented do constitute substantial evidence, such a conclusion would violate his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">2. <em>Statutory and regulatory framework. </em>Analysis of Covell\u2019s arguments first requires an examination of the specific regulatory requirements and procedural steps involved in the department\u2019s investigation and recording of reports of suspected child abuse. Pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, persons in specified professions and positions are required to notify the department whenever they have \u201creasonable cause to believe that a child under the age of eighteen years is suffering physical or emotional injury resulting from abuse inflicted upon him which causes harm or substantial risk of harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare including sexual abuse, or from neglect, including malnutrition.\u201d See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, </em>437 Mass. 340, 352-353 (2002), and cases cited. The department must conduct an investigation of such reports promptly, including an evaluation of the child\u2019s household and the risks to any other children in the household, and a determination of \u201cthe identity of the person or persons responsible\u201d for any injuries to the child. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (1), (2). Depending on what that investigation reveals, the department then institutes various measures. If the investigation gives the department \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the child is suffering from abuse, the department offers the child\u2019s family \u201cappropriate social services to prevent further injury to the child, to safeguard his welfare, and to preserve and stabilize family life whenever possible\u201d and, if necessary, takes temporary custody of the child. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (3), (5). If the department\u2019s investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>uncovers \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the abuse or neglect has resulted in particular listed forms of serious injury, or if the abuse consisted of sexual assault, the department must notify the office of the appropriate district attorney. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5 IB (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The department is required to maintain records of \u00a7 51A reports and \u00a7 5 IB investigations. Specifically, the department is to keep a \u201ccentral registry\u201d containing information identifying each child who is the subject of any report or investigation. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IF. If the department\u2019s investigation of a report determines that the report of suspected abuse \u201ccannot be substantiated,\u201d the information in the central registry pertaining to that child, and to the child\u2019s parents or guardian, is to be removed after one year. <em>Id. </em>If the allegations in the report are \u201csubstantiated,\u201d the information remains in the central registry until the child reaches age eighteen years or until one year after the child\u2019s family ceases to receive services, whichever is later. <em>Id. </em>If the department determines that the allegations in a \u00a7 51A report are \u201cfrivolous,\u201d or if it makes some other \u201cabsolute determination that abuse or neglect has not taken place,\u201d the report is labeled \u201cinvalid\u201d and the information pertaining to it is not entered in the central registry. <em>Id. </em>The data in the central registry are confidential and accessible only with the approval of the Commissioner of Social Services or by court order, and the commissioner is to promulgate rules and regulations governing access to information in the central registry. <em>Id. </em>It is a criminal offense, punishable by imprisonment for up to two and one-half years, for a department employee to make an unauthorized release of information from the central registry. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Extensive regulations govern the department\u2019s screening and investigation of reports of abuse or neglect and the maintenance of the required central registry and report files. When the department is notified of suspected abuse under \u00a7 51 A, it first screens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the report to determine whether it involves alleged abuse or neglect by a \u201ccaretaker.\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.21 (2000). The department\u2019s principal focus is \u201cto protect children from abuse or neglect <em>inflicted by their parents or parent substitutes\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis in original), <em>id., </em>citing G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1, and the regulations therefore define both \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201cneglect\u201d in a manner that limits those terms to acts committed by a \u201ccaretaker.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00 (1996). The definition of \u201ccaretaker\u201d is broad, including the child\u2019s parent, stepparent, guardian, and \u201cany other person entrusted with the responsibility for a child\u2019s health or welfare whether in the child\u2019s home, a relative\u2019s home, a school setting, a day care setting (including babysitting), a foster home, a group care facility, or any other comparable setting. As such \u2018caretaker\u2019 includes (but is not limited to) school teachers, babysitters, school bus drivers, camp counselors, etc. The \u2018caretaker\u2019 definition is meant to be construed broadly and inclusively to encompass any person who is, at the time in question, entrusted with a degree of responsibility for the child. This specifically includes a caretaker who is him/herself a child (i.e. a babysitter under age 18).\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00. The initial screening of a report ascertains whether the report alleges abuse or neglect by such a \u201ccaretaker,\u201d and if it does, an investigation is then undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">After conducting its investigation, the department determines whether to \u201csupport\u201d or \u201cunsupport\u201d the allegation of abuse or neglect. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32(1) (2000). The department will \u201csupport\u201d the allegation if it has \u201creasonable cause to believe that an incident (reported or discovered during the investigation) of abuse or neglect by a caretaker <em>did </em>occur\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>(emphasis in original). 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32(2) (2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The term \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d is defined as \u201ca collection of facts, knowledge or observations which tend to support or are consistent with the allegations, and when viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and credibility of persons providing information, would lead one to conclude that a child has been abused or neglected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulation specifies that factors to be considered in assessing whether there is \u201creasonable cause\u201d are \u201cdirect disclosure by the children) or caretaker; physical evidence of injury or harm; observable behavioral indicators; corroboration by collaterals (e.g., professionals, credible family members); and the social worker and supervisor\u2019s clinical base of knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the investigation finds \u201ca lack of reasonable cause to believe a report that a child has suffered abuse or neglect inflicted <em>by a </em>caretaker,\u201d the department will \u201cunsupport\u201d the report (emphasis in original). 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.00, 4.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">A decision to \u201csupport\u201d an allegation \u201cdoes <em>not </em>mean that the [department has made any finding with regard to the perpetrator(s) of the reported incident of abuse or neglect. It simply means that there is reasonable cause to believe that <em>some caretaker </em>did inflict <em>abuse </em>or neglect upon the child in question\u201d (emphasis in original). 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32. There are times, however, when the investigation does identify a specific alleged perpetrator of a supported incident of abuse or neglect. The identity of the \u201calleged perpetrator\u201d is to be recorded when \u201c[t]he incident of child abuse or neglect has been supported and referred to the District Attorney pursuant to [G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5 IB (4),] and there is substantial evidence indicating that the alleged perpetrator was responsible for the abuse or neglect.\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.33(1) (1996). Commentary to that regulation gives examples of when an alleged perpetrator\u2019s identity should be recorded, including an example that is virtually identical to the facts of this case \u2014 i.e., when a teenaged girl makes an allegation of sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>by a parent, the department\u2019s investigation results in a decision to support that allegation, and the department refers it to the district attorney. Commentary to 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.33 (Example B).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The regulations then create, as a \u201ccomponent\u201d of the department\u2019s central registry maintained pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IF, a \u201cregistry of alleged perpetrators,\u201d containing the alleged perpetrator\u2019s name, identifying information, cross reference to the victim, and relationship to the victim. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.36 (1996). The central registry, and hence its component registry of alleged perpetrators, is maintained as a computerized database; it does not include the underlying files and reports. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00. Consistent with the companion regulation as to when the department shall \u201crecord\u201d an alleged perpetrator\u2019s identity, 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.33, the identified person is to be listed in the registry of alleged perpetrators when the same conditions are met \u2014 i.e., when the allegation of abuse or neglect has been supported, the matter has been referred to the district attorney, and there is \u201csubstantial evidence indicating that the alleged perpetrator was responsible for the abuse or neglect.\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37 (1996). The regulations adopt the statutory definition of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>citing G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). Once entered, the name remains in the registry of al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>leged perpetrators for seventy-five years. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Department officials and employees are allowed access to the registry of alleged perpetrators for the following purposes: to screen applicants for employment with the department if the position involves direct contact with clients or children, to screen applicants for foster parents or adoptive parents,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to conduct an investigation into a report of abuse or neglect,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to provide services to a child or family.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.38(1), (2) (1996). A person identified as an alleged perpetrator is given notice of that identification, 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.33(3) (2000), and a person may obtain confirmation whether his or her own name appears in the registry of alleged perpetrators. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.38(3) (1996). Otherwise, no one may access information in the registry of alleged perpetrators without the written permission of the commissioner or a court order. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.38(4). As part of the central registry, the registry of alleged perpetrators is governed by the same confidentiality requirements that govern the central registry. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5 IF.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">When a report of abuse or neglect has been supported by the initial investigation, the department proceeds with an \u201cassessment\u201d of the child\u2019s or the family\u2019s need for services. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.01-5.04 (1996). Following the assessment, which is more comprehensive than the initial investigation, there is automatic review of the earlier decision to support the report. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.05(1) (1996). At that juncture, a report that was originally supported may be redesignated as unsupported. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.05(2) (1996). Whenever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>a previously supported report is changed to an unsupported report, the corresponding entries in the central registry are changed, and if any alleged perpetrator was identified in the previously supported report and listed in the registry of alleged perpetrators, that entry in the registry is eliminated. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.05(3) (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The department allows an administrative appeal from the decision to support a report of abuse or neglect and the decision to list someone on the registry of alleged perpetrators. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.06(8), (9) (1994). The decision to support a report may be challenged by, among others, any caretaker identified in the department\u2019s records as \u201cthe person believed to be responsible for the abuse or neglect.\u201d \u00a7 10.06(8). The decision to support a report will be reversed if, based on either the original information or new information, the decision to support the report is not in conformity with department policies, regulations, or procedures and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party. \u00a7 10.06(8)(c). The decision to list a person on the registry of alleged perpetrators may be appealed by the person so listed, and that decision will be reversed if, based on either the original information or new information, the decision \u201cwas not in accordance with 110 [Code Mass. Regs.] [\u00a7] 4.33,\u201d or not in conformity with the department\u2019s regulations or procedures and resulted in substantial prejudice. \u00a7 10.06(9)(a). Because the decision to list someone as an alleged perpetrator is itself dependent on the decision to support the report, an appeal of the decision to list the alleged perpetrator automatically entails review of the decision to support. \u00a7 10.06(9)(b). 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.08(2), (3) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Hearings on appeals are not subject to any formal rules of evidence, and written materials from the department\u2019s files and records are admissible. 110 Code Mass.

See \u00a7 10.06(8)(c). To support the report, there need only be \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that abuse occurred, which, as the regulations expressly state, may be based on the child\u2019s own report of abuse. 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.32(2). The fact of Covell\u2019s acquittal at his criminal trial does not undermine that \u201creasonable cause,\u201d given the differing standards of proof applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">b. <em>Decision to list Covell on the registry of alleged perpetrators. </em>Covell contends that the decision to list his name in the registry of alleged perpetrators was not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.37, and thus was not in conformity with the department\u2019s regulations. In particular, he contends that his testimony denying the allegation made the case hinge on a comparison of his credibility with Linda\u2019s credibility, and that the hearing officer could not find Linda to be the more credible of the two when Linda did not appear in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">i. <em>Interpretation of the listing regulations. </em>Covell\u2019s argument inherently contends that the department must present \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the underlying abuse occurred in order to list him in the registry of alleged perpetrators. A careful reading of the regulations governing identification of alleged perpetrators and listing in the registry does not suggest such a requirement. A person is to be recorded as an alleged perpetrator listed in the registry if (1) \u201cthe allegation of child abuse or neglect has been supported\u201d (a determination that only requires \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that the abuse occurred), (2) the nature of the abuse or injury is such that it is referred to the district attorney (which the department was required to do in this case pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 5IB [4]), and (3) \u201cthere is substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>evidence indicating that the alleged perpetrator was responsible for the abuse or neglect.\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.33, 4.37. If, as Covell\u2019s argument assumes, the underlying abuse itself needed to be proved by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d it would be superfluous to include as a prerequisite to identification and listing that the report be \u201csupported,\u201d as that requirement only requires \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that the abuse occurred. As constructed by the regulations, the registry of alleged perpetrators is not limited to those cases of abuse that have been proved by some greater quantum of evidence than a mere \u201csupported\u201d report.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, the registry includes all cases where the underlying abuse has been established by \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d and the identification of the perpetrator is sufficiently clear that it meets the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test as to the identification itself. Thus, for example, if a child reports that his father deliberately pushed him down the stairs while the father contends that the child fell down the stairs by accident, a decision to \u201csupport\u201d the report determines that the department will treat the case as one of abuse as opposed to an accident. Having made the decision to support the allegation, and assuming that the severity of the child\u2019s injuries led to referral to the district attorney, the father will be listed on the registry of alleged perpetrators because the evidence is clear that he was the caretaker responsible for the abuse that has been supported. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>There would be no listing of any alleged perpetrator if it remained unknown <em>which </em>caretaker was involved \u2014 mother, father, stepparent, grandparent, babysitter, or older sibling left in charge. Thus, while a caretaker may vehemently contend that an injury to a child is the result of an accident and not the product of abuse, or, as here, that there was no sexual contact with the child, once the department has properly decided to support the report of abuse based on the \u201creasonable cause\u201d standard, the listing of the alleged perpetrator is merely a matter of identification. It does not reopen, or impose a higher standard of proof on, the underlying determination that the abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Here, the investigator apparently understood the requirements for listing an alleged perpetrator in precisely this fashion. Her report concludes: \u201cSince sexual abuse by a caretaker was supported a mandatory [district attorney] referral is warranted. Furthermore since the alleged perpetrator was clearly identified by the child, [Linda], the alleged perpetrator will be placed on the Central Registry.\u201d If that is the correct interpretation of the regulations, there is no error in the listing of Covell. The department properly supported the underlying report of abuse, the claim of sexual assault was referred to the district attorney, and the child\u2019s report provided clear identification of the perpetrator of that supported allegation of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">However, for reasons that are not specified, the hearing officer analyzed Covell\u2019s arguments as if the underlying abuse, and not just the identification, needed to be supported by substantial evidence, and she found that there was substantial evidence to support a conclusion that the abuse had occurred. Before the Appeals Court and before this court, the department\u2019s brief has similarly argued that the finding of abuse itself is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, assuming (without deciding) that the regulations require that the underlying abuse itself be demonstrated by substantial evidence before the department\u2019s records and registry may list anyone as an \u201calleged perpetra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>tor\u201d of a supported incident of abuse, we will assess whether there was substantial evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">ii. <em>Inadequacy of appellate record. </em>Our consideration whether there was substantial evidence of the underlying abuse is hampered by the fact that Covell did not obtain or submit the transcript of the hearing before the hearing officer. He has submitted the available transcripts from the criminal trial, plus the exhibits submitted to the hearing officer, but not the testimony of the department\u2019s investigator (the sole witness presented by the department at the agency hearing) or his own testimony at that hearing. We can, as the Appeals Court did, assess the logic of the analysis that the hearing officer articulated in her decision, see <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 814-816 (2002), but not the evidence itself, which may have included detail and nuance that was not expressly referenced in the hearing officer\u2019s written decision. See <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, </em>368 Mass. 745, 751 (1975) (\u201csummary of evidence contained in the board\u2019s \u2018Findings of Fact and Report\u2019 is no substitute for a transcript\u201d). As the Appeals Court noted, the department\u2019s argument that Covell\u2019s failure to submit the complete record precludes him from challenging the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201ctechnically correct.\u201d <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., supra </em>at 812. See <em>Fox Ridge Assocs. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Marshfield, </em>387 Mass. 1002 (1982); <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, supra </em>at 749-751; <em>Sturdy Memorial Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of N. Attleborough, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 519 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Unlike the Appeals Court, however, we do not brush the department\u2019s argument aside. That a transcript must be submitted to support a claim that the evidence was insufficient is not some hypertechnical requirement, but a reflection of the fact that resolution of such a claim requires the reviewing court to see the entirety of the evidence that was presented. In the absence of such a transcript, both sides have had to rely exclusively on the contents and analysis reflected in the hearing officer\u2019s decision. Contrary to the Appeals Court\u2019s suggestion, <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., supra </em>at 812-813, the fact that the department argues the merits based on that decision - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>does not amount to any agreement or concession by the department that the appellate record is adequate. There was no stipulation or agreement to limit the record on appeal to the exhibits introduced at the hearing; no agreement or stipulation that the hearing officer\u2019s decision contained each and every relevant detail of the testimony of the two witnesses; and no agreed statement of facts submitted as an acceptably condensed version of the record below. Rather, the first argument advanced in the department\u2019s brief by the Appeals Court, supported by ample precedent, was that the merits of Covell\u2019s substantial evidence argument should not be entertained in the absence of the hearing transcript. On this ground alone, the department should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">iii. <em>Application of the substantial evidence test to the limited record. </em>Even if we were to overlook this defect in the appellate record, our review of the hearing officer\u2019s decision and the excerpts of the record submitted confirms that there was sufficient evidence of the underlying alleged abuse to satisfy the substantial evidence test. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d means \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), a test which takes into account the entire record, both the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s conclusion and whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of that evidence. See <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981), and cases cited.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The investigator, who met with Linda in person in the immediate aftermath of her disclosures, related that Linda\u2019s allegations of abuse were specific, detailed, and consistent. Linda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>was thirteen years old at the time, not a small child. Cf. <em>Edward E. </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 478, 484-487 (1997) (three year old child claiming sexual abuse). The backdrop for the alleged abuse, i.e., the customary routine of sitting together on the couch in the store\u2019s back room after closing time, was realistic, and indeed confirmed by Covell himself. Cf. <em>id. </em>(child placed abuse in implausible setting and circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">As with virtually every case involving a child\u2019s allegation of sexual abuse, one of the primary issues in assessing the credibility of that allegation is whether there is any reason why the child would invent or fabricate such an allegation. If the evidence indicates a likelihood that there is such a reason, that would greatly tend to undermine the child\u2019s credibility. On the other hand, if there is no plausible reason for fabrication, the very absence of such a reason tends to support the child\u2019s credibility. Here, the evidence tested, and substantial evidence refuted, three of the reasons commonly advanced as possible explanations for a child\u2019s false accusation of sexual assault: (1) that the allegation was the product of suggestive questioning by an interviewer, (2) that some other adult with a motive to harm the alleged perpetrator planted the allegation in the child\u2019s mind, or (3) that the child had some motive to invent the false allegation on her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">With respect to any suggestive questioning, the evidence was undisputed that Linda first reported the abuse to a friend and then, on her own initiative, to a guidance counsellor. There was no suggestive questioning that preceded the allegation. While the department investigator later posed some \u201cleading questions\u201d to Linda during her interview, Linda responded in the negative to those questions. Rather than expand the scope of her allegations in response to any suggestion implicit in such questions, Linda remained consistent as to the specific but limited acts that constituted the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">As to some other adult prompting Linda to make these accusations, the record is devoid of anything other than Covell\u2019s vague speculation that his wife was using the children as \u201cpawns\u201d during their divorce. Aside from the fact that that is speculation, the divorce was sought <em>after </em>Linda\u2019s allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>surfaced \u2014 there was not a bitter divorce underway at the time the allegations were made. Cf. <em>Edward E. </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., supra </em>at 483 (\u201ccontentious litigation\u201d between parents at time small child alleged sexual abuse by father). Nor was there any evidence that Linda\u2019s mother was involved with the disclosures. Linda made her disclosures to her friend and guidance counsellor at a time when her mother was not present. Rather than being in league with her mother or peculiarly susceptible to her influence, the evidence was that Linda was beginning to rebel against parental influence and resented the tight restrictions her mother had placed on her in an effort to curb that rebellion. Linda only told her mother about the abuse, with some difficulty, after the guidance counselor recommended that she do so. The mother\u2019s reaction was one of shock, and she had \u201cdifficulty comprehending what had happened.\u201d There is nothing to suggest that these allegations were planted in Linda\u2019s mind by her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">As to the theory that Linda had her own motive to fabricate the allegations (the theory most vigorously advanced by Covell), the evidence did not support that theory. The hearing officer noted that Linda\u2019s adolescent defiance disturbed both her mother and Covell. However, it was Linda\u2019s mother, not Covell, who was principally involved in the efforts at discipline, and the mother, not Covell, who had instituted the assortment of restrictions that had been placed on Linda in September, 1993, the month prior to her report of abuse. The mother, well aware of Linda\u2019s recent infractions and Linda\u2019s dismay at the imposition of discipline, credited her daughter\u2019s allegations against Covell. The hearing officer had a sound basis for concluding that these allegations against Covell were not prompted by a motive to retaliate for recent discipline.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We reject Covell\u2019s suggestion that the evidence of abuse can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>not be \u201csubstantial\u201d because Linda\u2019s statements were presented only through hearsay sources \u2014 the testimony and report of the investigator and the (partial) transcript of Linda\u2019s testimony at the criminal trial. Substantial evidence may be based on hearsay alone if that hearsay has \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Embers of Salisbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 526, 530 (1988). As discussed above, the detail and consistent nature of Linda\u2019s reports, her resistance to the suggestiveness of leading questions, and the absence of any motive or reason for her to make false allegations against Covell combine to give her statements some indicia of reliability. Her testimony at the criminal trial, presented to the hearing officer by way of a partial transcript, was given under oath. That her trial testimony had not, in the jury\u2019s opinion, met the standard of proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \u2014 the highest standard of proof imposed by our jurisprudence \u2014 does not mean that it was unreliable for purposes of the substantial evidence test.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Covell\u2019s argument also ignores the fact that the hearing officer heard Covell\u2019s own testimony. While disbelief of Covell\u2019s denials does not create positive evidence that abuse occurred, the hearing officer could consider his demeanor and credibility in light of Linda\u2019s statements to the interviewer and the transcript of her trial testimony, and could judge the credibility of his proffered explanation that Linda was retaliating against him for recent discipline imposed on her. (The investigator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>report and, presumably, the investigator\u2019s testimony referenced the observation that Covell had been \u201cvery nervous, very upset\u201d during his interview.) Covell is correct when he claims that the case revolved around an assessment of credibility, but we do not accept his assertion that credibility cannot be compared unless all of the witnesses testify in person.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. Mass. R. Civ. R 32 (a) (3), as amended, 392 Mass. 1105 (1984) (allowing introduction of deposition testimony at trial). While live testimony may provide the optimal opportunity for the assessment of credibility, the fact that parties before an agency have differing versions of critical events does not make live testimony the sine qua non for satisfying the substantial evidence test.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">On this record, such as it has been presented to us, the hearing officer had a sound basis for determining that there was substantial evidence to support Linda\u2019s allegations of abuse by her stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">c. <em>Due process. </em>Covell\u2019s constitutional arguments are without merit. The department readily acknowledges that its decisions to support allegations of abuse and to list alleged perpetrators in its central registry implicate due process protections. However, Covell received due process. He was given notice of the department\u2019s investigation and an opportunity to be heard dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ing the course of that investigation, and when the investigation concluded in a manner adverse to his interests, he was given notice and an opportunity to be heard through the department\u2019s appeal procedures. Instead, what Coveil is actually asserting is a right of confrontation, as the only claimed defect in the proceedings is that Linda did not testify in person.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There is no right of confrontation in civil proceedings. See <em>Frizado </em>v. <em>Frizado, </em>420 Mass. 592, 596-597 n.3 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGruder, </em>348 Mass. 712, 716 (1965), cert, denied, 383 U.S. 972 (1966). That Linda did not testify at the administrative hearing does not violate Covell\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court affirming the department\u2019s decision to support the report of child abuse and to list Covell\u2019s name on the department\u2019s registry of alleged perpetrators is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\">The Appeals Court found no error in the decision of the Department of Social Services (department) to support the underlying report of child abuse, reversing only with respect to the decision to list Covell\u2019s name in the registry of alleged perpetrators. <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>54 Mass.

One example involves a pediatrician opining that injuries to an infant were not accidental, where only two known caretakers \u2014 the infant\u2019s divorced parents \u2014 had access to the infant. Despite the fact that the decision to support the allegation of abuse has not determined which parent was responsible, the example indicates that <em>both </em>parents may be listed as \u201calleged perpetrators.\u201d Commentary to 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.33 (Example D). The other example given is where a child victim suffering medically confirmed nonaccidental injuries reports that he was injured when he was punched by his father, but then at other times reports that the injuries were inflicted by his grandfather. Again, if the underlying report of abuse is supported and referred to the district attorney, the commentary indicates that <em>both </em>the father and the grandfather are to be listed as alleged perpetrators. <em>Id. </em>(Example F). These examples do not comport with our normal understanding of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as to a perpetrator\u2019s identification, and we need not resolve any of the issues that would be raised by listing a caretaker as an \u201calleged perpetrator\u201d when the evidence shows nothing more than a possibility that that caretaker may have been the person responsible for the abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">A person is not eligible to be a foster parent if that person has been identified as an alleged perpetrator, and the evaluation of a foster parent application therefore includes a check of the central registry. 110 Code Mass.

See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 7.100(3)(c) (1998). Similarly, when the department is investigating a report of abuse or neglect, or assessing what services should be provided to an abused or neglected child, it is important for the department to ascertain whether any of the people involved in the newly reported incident, or any household members living with the child being serviced, have previously been identified as perpetrators of any supported incident of abuse or neglect. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.22, 5.04(7) (1996).

The substantial evidence test does not become more stringent or more relaxed based on a judge\u2019s perception that a particular agency decision is of greater or lesser importance or portends consequences of greater or lesser severity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The hearing officer also rejected the argument that discrepancy or uncertainty as to the dates of the alleged abuse undermined the reliability of Linda\u2019s allegations. The precise dates were irrelevant, and a child\u2019s inability to give precise dates of prior abuse does not impair the credibility of the allegation that abuse occurred. Moreover, it was undisputed that, in June, 1992, Linda had worked with Covell at the store on various occasions, and Covell testified that, after closing time, they had sat together on the couch and given each other \u201cback rubs.\u201d Linda\u2019s initial disclosure in October, 1993, dated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>abuse as approximately one and one-half years earlier, which would adequately comport with that June, 1992, time frame. To the extent that Linda subsequently changed her assessment of the dates, placing the abuse in October, 1992, there was evidence that Linda had also worked at the store at that time, including her mother\u2019s testimony that Linda covered for her at the store when she, the mother, had to stop working that fall in the final weeks of her pregnancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Coveil\u2019s reliance on <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>375 Mass. 434, 436-437 (1978), is misplaced. In that case, two eyewitnesses testified to divergent versions of what had occurred, and a third witness, who had not observed the events in person, gave a hearsay account of yet another version of those events. On that record, a decision that credited the witness who had not observed the events was not supported by substantial evidence because it was contrary to the testimony of the only two eyewitnesses. As such, the case recognizes the difference between eyewitnesses and persons who are only reporting what they have heard second hand. It does not suggest that the statement of an eyewitness, submitted in some fashion other than live testimony, cannot be substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In cases where live witnesses giving different versions <em>do </em>testify at an agency hearing, a decision relying on an assessment of their relative credibility cannot be made by someone who was not present at the hearing. See <em>Bayer Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>436 Mass. 302, 305-308 (2002) (term of only Appellate Tax Board member to hear evidence expired; decision by other members premised on resolution of conflicting testimony vacated); <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>404 Mass. 170, 173, 174-175 (1989) (commissioner who presided at evidentiary hearing died before rendering decision; decision by successor who had not been at hearing vacated); <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 340-343 (2001) (chairman of the Appellate Tax Board who had heard conflicting evidence no longer on board when decision rendered; decision vacated where board members issuing decision had not been present). These cases do not suggest that credibility disputes can only be resolved by live testimony. Rather, they stand for the proposition that when parties do present live testimony, they are entitled to have the credibility determination made by someone who heard the testimony that was presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Such an approach to the substantial evidence test would also be contrary to the department\u2019s articulated policy of <em>not </em>having child witnesses testify at such proceedings absent a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d showing that the child\u2019s testimony is \u201cessential.\u201d 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.13(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Covell had, of course, confronted Linda when she testified at his criminal trial, and he was allowed to submit as evidence at the agency hearing the transcript of his attorney\u2019s cross-examination of Linda at that trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
