The issue arose when the Commonwealth filed a petition to commit the defendant to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>one and one-half months prior to the defendant\u2019s release. The Commonwealth filed the qualified examiners\u2019 report eight days<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after the deadline specified in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a). A judge in the Superior Court concluded that missing the report filing deadline and initiating the petition process so close to the defendant\u2019s discharge date required dismissal under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527, 530 (2001). The judge also denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to stay execution of his judgment pending appeal. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. Because we conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to meet the report filing deadline did not affect the defendant\u2019s liberty interest, and because the Commonwealth met all other deadlines, we vacate the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">I. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">In 1998, the defendant pleaded guilty to multiple indictments charging rape of a child, indecent assault and battery on a child, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and dissemination of pornographic material. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of from three to five years in a State prison, with a release date of July 23, 2002. On June 6, 2002, the Commonwealth filed a petition under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>for the defendant\u2019s civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person. After an eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>tiary hearing, a Superior Court judge found probable cause to believe the defendant was a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a), and to have him \u201ccommitted to the treatment center for a period not exceeding 60 days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners.\u201d The sixty-day period was to expire on February 6, 2003. Pursuant to the statute, the judge required the report on the defendant to be filed \u201c15 days prior to the expiration of said period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">At the defendant\u2019s request, the district attorney\u2019s office instructed the treatment center to postpone temporarily the examinations in anticipation of the defendant\u2019s filing a motion to stay the proceedings. Three days later, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, but the district attorney did not inform the treatment center that it should proceed with the examinations. Thus on January 22, 2003, one day before the report was due, the Commonwealth discovered that the qualified examiners had not yet started the examinations. At the Commonwealth\u2019s request, the qualified examiners began the examinations and filed the requisite report on February 4, 2003, eight days after the report filing deadline. Also on February 4, the Commonwealth timely filed its petition for trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the petition based on the late filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 report. Another judge, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>granted the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also denied the Commonwealth\u2019s oral motion to stay execution of his judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">This case raises several questions of interpretation concerning G. L. c. 123A petitions: (1) whether a judge may grant a stay of execution pending appeal from a judgment dismissing a petition; (2) whether a late filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 report requires dismissal of a petition; and (3) whether \u00a7 12 (a) or \u00a7 12 <em>(b) </em>requires filing a petition or notifying a defendant six months prior to the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>did not eliminate the discretion provided to judges by the Legislature to detain a person pending appeal from a dismissal of a G. L. c. 123A petition. General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (e), provides that at any time prior to final judgment, the judge may \u201ccommit [persons eligible to be released from detention] to the treatment center pending disposition of the petition.\u201d When the Commonwealth files a timely appeal from the allowance of a motion to dismiss, a judge may enter a stay that results in further detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Here, the judge made no written findings of facts concerning the denial of stay. However, the record demonstrates that he weighed various factors in his decision. For example, the transcript reveals that the judge inquired into the terms of release and the defendant\u2019s probation status before making his decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 505 (1979) (in stay of execution, judge should consider issues of \u201cpossibility of flight. . . further acts of criminality during the pendency of the appeal . . . [and] likelihood of success on the merits of the appeal\u201d). Additionally, although there is conflicting evidence in the record, there is some indication that the judge weighed the likelihood of the Commonwealth\u2019s success on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nassar, </em>380 Mass. 908, 909 (1980) (judge issued stay of judgment for release, which resulted in continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>detention, in order to report question to appellate court regarding statutory interpretation). We thus conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to stay the judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">2. In reviewing the motion to dismiss, we examine whether \u201cthe trial judge committed legal error or abused his discretion.\u201d J.R. Nolan &amp; C.A. Caldeira, Appellate Procedure \u00a7 1:4 (2d ed. 2002). The defendant posits that the eight-day delay in filing the qualified examiners\u2019 report interfered with his liberty interest. He argues that because \u201cconfinement without legal justification is never innocuous,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530, failure to comply \u201cwith such statutory deadlines require[d] dismissal\u201d and the judge properly exercised his discretion by dismissing the Commonwealth\u2019s petition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>states that \u201cthe qualified examiners . . . <em>shall, </em>no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of [the sixty-day] period, file with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cWhere the statutory language is clear, courts apply the plain and ordinary meaning of that language.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530. \u201cThe word \u2018shall,\u2019 in this context, where substantive rights are involved, indicates that the action is mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus it is clear that the Commonwealth violated a provision of \u00a7 13 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The defendant in this case, however, did not suffer an infringement to his liberty interest due to the filing violation because the Commonwealth submitted the report and filed its petition for trial within the sixty-day period specified in \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Thus, although the report was late, the delay did not result in the Commonwealth\u2019s filing its trial petition late or the defendant\u2019s being detained beyond sixty days. This is in stark contrast to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530, where the Commonwealth\u2019s conduct \u201cresulted] in a period of detention for examination vastly in excess of the maximum allowed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>the statute.\u201d There, the defendant\u2019s total detention time lasted more than one year beyond the sixty-day period authorized by \u00a7 13 <em>(a). Id. </em>at 528. Here, contrary to the judge\u2019s findings, the total detention time of the defendant was not one day \u201cin excess of the maximum allowed by the statute.\u201d In addition, the defendant has not suggested that the Commonwealth\u2019s delay in filing the report hampered his counsel\u2019s ability to prepare for a potential trial, or that the delay prevented the Commonwealth from having enough time properly to evaluate the qualified examiners\u2019 report and make an appropriate decision as to whether to file a petition for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The defendant urges us to construe \u00a7 13 (a) as establishing a forty-five day deadline for the filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 report that then leads to a fourteen-day deadline for filing for trial only if the first deadline is met. He suggests that because he was detained beyond the forty-five day period without a qualified examiners\u2019 report being filed, he was deprived of his liberty interest and \u201cthere was no authority to hold [him] any longer.\u201d We reject this construction of the statute. The plain language of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a), reveals that there is an over-all sixty-day period established for commitment: \u201cIf the court is satisfied that probable cause exists ... the prisoner or youth shall be committed to the treatment center <em>for a period not exceeding 60 days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis </em>...\u201d (emphasis added). In terms of a defendant\u2019s liberty interest, the relevant period is the sixty-day time period. The forty-five day deadline for the qualified examiners\u2019 report appears intended to give the Commonwealth a full two weeks in which to file its petition for trial. Where, as here, the report is slightly late, the party adversely affected is the Commonwealth, as it must expedite its decision to seek trial and submit its petition in order to meet that requirement prior to the expiration of the sixty-day detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The defendant argues that he chose not to participate in the qualified examiners\u2019 interviews because the forty-five day deadline had passed, and so he believed that the petition had to be dismissed. He points out that, if the interviews had been timely sought, he would have cooperated, and his cooperation might have led to a different conclusion by the examiners, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>one that might have convinced the Commonwealth not to file a petition for trial. In these unique circumstances, namely that the defendant did not have the benefit of our holding today, combined with the suggestion of one of the qualified examiners that the defendant\u2019s lack of participation may have affected that examiner\u2019s recommendation, we conclude that it is appropriate to allow the defendant the opportunity to be reexamined by the qualified examiners, if requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">3. The defendant contends that it was proper to dismiss the petition because the Commonwealth did not begin the petition process \u201cuntil well within the six-month window.\u201d He posits that this court has \u201ccaution[ed] the relevant agencies to fulfil this statutory duty,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 531, and suggests that we \u201cdid not mie out deciding the case based solely on this issue.\u201d The defendant has misconstrued the <em>Kennedy </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">There is no statutory requirement that the Commonwealth file the petition six months prior to the defendant\u2019s release. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>the \u201cstatutory duty\u201d referred to is the requirement under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (a), that the relevant <em>agency </em>(in this case, the Department of Correction) \u201cshall notify in writing the district attorney of the county where the offense occurred and the attorney general six months prior to the release of such person.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 12 <em>(b) </em>in turn states only that the district attorney <em>may </em>file a petition that the prisoner is a sexually dangerous person. When \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d are used within the same section of a statute, there is a presumption that the Legislature realized the difference and was aware of their meanings. 3 N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 57:11, at 40 (6th ed. rev. 2001).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Additionally, contrary to the suggestion in the judge\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ings and order, there is no requirement that the Commonwealth provide the defendant with six months\u2019 notice of its intention to file a petition \u201cprior to the inmate\u2019s anticipated discharge date.\u201d Section 12 <em>(b), </em>unlike \u00a7 12 (a), does not require prior notification to any parties. \u201c[W]here the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\u201d 2A NJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06, at 194 (6th ed. rev. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">m. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">For the reasons stated, the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The report was technically twelve days late. The defendant concedes, however, that three of the twelve days were lost due to his request to delay the examinations until a judge had ruled on his motion to stay the proceedings. He also concedes that one additional day was lost because an additional three days would have made the new due date a Sunday. We thus consider the delay to be eight days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a), </em>requires the Commonwealth to file a trial petition within fourteen days after the filing of the report. Given that the report deadline is itself forty-five days after commitment, the trial filing deadline is designed to fall within the sixty-day detention period. The Commonwealth\u2019s filing for trial in this case was both within fourteen days of the report filing and within the sixty-day period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b848-8\">In his findings and order, the motion judge stated: the Commonwealth\u2019s eight-day delay resulted in \u201ca period of detention in excess of the maximum allowed by the statute\u201d; the district attorney\u2019s office \u201cdid not give six months[\u2019] notice prior to the inmate\u2019s anticipated discharge date [and the Supreme Judicial Court] did caution the relevant agencies to fulfill this statutory duty\u201d; and \u201c[t]he Commonwealth did not comply with [the G. L. c. 123A] standards.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The judge inquired, \u201c[W]ere there any [sentences] that imposed a period of probation?\u201d; \u201cWhat are the terms of his probation?\u201d; \u201cAre there any other terms, other than the normal terms?\u201d; \u201c[Is the probation officer] in touch with the probation department in Rhode Island at all?\u201d; and stated, \u201cI seem to recall reading . . . that he\u2019s on probation in Rhode Island for a period of five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The judge acknowledged that minor violations of G. L. c. 123A were an \u201copen issue\u201d with this court, but also stated \u201cI think that the Supreme [Judicial] Court has made it abundantly clear that I have no leeway.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We reject as unpersuasive the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the defendant was responsible for this delay by asking the Commonwealth to wait for a few days before starting the examinations. It is the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the treatment center performs the examinations in a timely manner. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527, 529-530 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Unlike in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 531, there is no evidence here that the Department of Correction failed to notify the Commonwealth within six months of the defendant\u2019s release, and thus we do not address the consequences of such a violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">We note, however, that it is possible for the G. L. c. 123A proceedings to be completed within the six-month window that begins when the agency notifies the Commonwealth. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 508 (2000), the Commonwealth stated that \u201cin future cases it should receive six months\u2019 notice of an inmate\u2019s release date and therefore could obtain the necessary evidence and even complete the final commitment hearing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>that date.\u201d We thus again remind the relevant agencies, as we did in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 531, to provide six months\u2019 notice as required by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(a), </em>and urge the Commonwealth to act reasonably promptly on receiving such notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
