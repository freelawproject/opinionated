After an evidentiary hearing, a Juvenile Court judge suppressed statements made by the juveniles to the school\u2019s assistant principal under the theory that the assistant principal\u2019s \u201cinvestigation . . . was under the guise of a governmental agency, ... no Miranda rights [were] given, [and] there was no opportunity for parental involvement.\u201d The judge subsequently dismissed the cases without prejudice on the grounds that the Commonwealth failed to comply with discovery orders. A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for interlocutory appeal from the allowance of the motions to suppress, and ordered the appeal consolidated with the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the order of dismissal then pending in the Appeals Court. We granted Ira\u2019s application for direct appellate review. Because we conclude that the assistant principal was not acting as an agent of the police or prosecution, we reverse the allowance of the motions to dismiss and the motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">1. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">The juveniles, Ira, Justin, Danny, and Andy, all thirteen or fourteen years old, were each charged with two counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a rock and a shod foot) and one count of assault and battery on the complainant. On June 5, 2001, the day of the alleged incident, the complainant\u2019s mother contacted Albert Lapan, the assistant principal of the Duggan Middle School. According to Lapan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the complainant\u2019s mother told him \u201cthat her son had been assaulted on the way home from school.\u201d The next morning Lapan spoke with the complainant who \u201csaid there were problems on the bus. When [the complainant] got off the bus and was walking home [on a city street], he was approached by some students\u201d who hit him, and other people kicked him after he fell down. The complainant identified Justin and Danny as two of his attackers.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Lapan investigated the alleged June 5 incident because he believed that it was his responsibility \u201cto look into matters from when children leave for school in the morning to when they return home at night, a term called portal-to-portal jurisdiction for school officials.\u201d He testified that it was \u201cstandard . . . when an incident like this takes place . . . [to] take statements and . . . bring the individuals down to [his] office.\u201d Lapan was clear, however, that he looked into such incidents for school disciplinary purposes, and not to gather or provide information for any potential law enforcement or court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In the course of investigating the alleged incident, Lapan spoke with the four juveniles, as well as other students who might have been on the bus. On June 6 and 7, Lapan individually \u201ccalled down\u201d the four juveniles to his office and questioned each one for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. Lapan warned each juvenile that \u201cthere would be consequences for [his] actions.\u201d It appears that Lapan also took written statements from five students: the complainant, Ira, Justin, Andy, and a student whom Justin named as being involved in the incident, but who was not charged in this case. Lapan could not remember whether he asked the fourth juvenile, Danny, to write a statement. Three of the juveniles, Justin, Danny, and Ira, admitted to Lapan that they had hit the complainant. Andy, however, maintained his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Lapan testified that it was school procedure to talk to the parents of the students involved in the incident. He further testified that he contacted each juvenile\u2019s parents after he talked with the particular student. In addition, Lapan indicated that he told the complainant\u2019s mother (in accordance with his usual practice) the \u201cnames ... of people that were involved\u201d and that she \u201c[could] further this through the court system if [she] wish[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>It appears that the police were first made aware of the alleged June 5 attack that day, when the complainant\u2019s mother reported the incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 20, 2001, Lapan gave a statement about the alleged attack to Officer Robert V. Majewski, Jr., of the Springfield police department. Officer Majewski testified that he also took a statement from the complainant, but it does not appear that he took any other statements. On June 21, 2001, complaints were issued against the four juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Three days before the scheduled trial date, Ira filed a motion to suppress \u201cany oral or written statements allegedly made to Assistant Principal Albert Lapan.\u201d The juvenile claimed that any statements he made were \u201cpursuant to an unlawful interrogation,\u201d because he was not given Miranda warnings and the statements were not voluntary. On the scheduled trial date, the judge allowed the other juveniles to join Ira\u2019s motion to suppress, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. On the same day, the juveniles each filed a motion to dismiss based on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After an evidentiary hearing, the judge allowed the motions to suppress and the motions to dismiss. Several months later, the Commonwealth filed motions to reconsider or, alternatively, to indicate whether the dismissals were with or without prejudice. Although the judge denied the motions to reconsider, she issued a written order clarifying that the cases were dismissed without prejudice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>Commonwealth appeals from the allowance of the juveniles\u2019 motions to suppress and the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">A. <em>Motions to dismiss. </em>We will uphold a judge\u2019s order to dismiss without prejudice unless there has been \u201can abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>402 Mass. 576, 579 (1988), and cases cited. \u201cOn appellate review of a claim of an abuse of discretion by a trial judge, \u2018[tjhe question is not whether we . . . should have made an opposite decision from that made by the trial judge. To sustain . . . [the claim] it is necessary to decide that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bys, </em>370 Mass. 350, 361 (1976), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>235 Mass. 482, 502 (1920). Because we conclude that nothing in the record shows it was warranted, we reverse the allowance of the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The judge allowed the juveniles\u2019 motions to dismiss because she concluded that the Commonwealth failed to comply with pretrial discovery orders. Although the judge did not specify how the Commonwealth violated the discovery orders, it is apparent that her decision was based on the prosecutor\u2019s failure to provide the juveniles with the statements taken by assistant principal Lapan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, implicit in the judge\u2019s ruling is a finding that the discovery orders required the prosecutor to give the juveniles information that was in Lapan\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The discovery orders applied to oral and written statements \u201cwithin the possession, custody, or control of the prosecutor, or . . . persons under his direction and control.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (1) (A) and (a) (2), 378 Mass. 874 (1979). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wanis, </em>426 Mass. 639, 643 (1998) (discovery orders that \u201cdirected the prosecution to produce the records . . . cannot stand\u201d when \u201cno showing that the prosecutor had access to [such] materials, or that the [possessor of the records] was obligated to provide its . . . files to the prosecution\u201d). We are guided by the interpretation of the phrase \u201cpossession or control\u201d in the context of a prosecutor\u2019s duty to provide exculpatory information. In determining the scope of a prosecutor\u2019s duty, we have concluded that \u201c[information known to an independent witness, but unknown to the prosecution, is not within the possession and control of the prosecution unless that witness has acted, in some capacity, as an agent of the government in the investigation and prosecution of the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>429 Mass. 530, 532 (1999). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 824 (1998), and cases cited (\u201cA prosecutor\u2019s obligations extend to information in possession of a person who has participated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and has reported to the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Applying these standards, we conclude that materials that were in Lapan\u2019s possession were not in the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpossession, custody, or control,\u201d and therefore the prosecutor did not violate any discovery order. In particular, there is no evidence in the record that Lapan acted as an agent of the prosecution or of the police, as discussed <em>infra. </em>Nor is there any evidence that Lapan \u201cparticipated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and has reported to the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra. </em>Contrary to Justin\u2019s contention, there is no evidence that Lapan gave the police copies of the juveniles\u2019 written statements, or that the police had any knowledge that such written statements existed. Lapan\u2019s statement to the police, which briefly describes the interviews but does not mention any written statements, was the only evidence adduced at the hearing regarding police awareness of Lapan\u2019s actions. Similarly, there is nothing in the record to indicate that prior to the day of trial, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>was aware of, or had possession of, the written statements. To the contrary, the Commonwealth represents that the prosecutor first learned of the written statements on the day of the trial, when Ira\u2019s attorney informed her of their existence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor averred that as soon as she learned of the written statements, she asked Lapan to send them by facsimile transmission and \u201cimmediately\u201d provided the statements to the juveniles\u2019 counsel. Furthermore, although the juveniles may not have known what the others had said or written, each of the three who wrote statements was aware that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Because of our conclusion that assistant principal Lapan was not an \u201cagent[] of the prosecution team,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, supra </em>at 532, and because there is no evidence that the Commonwealth was aware of the juveniles\u2019 written statements, we reject Andy\u2019s argument that the prosecutor <em>should </em>have known about the written statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, supra </em>at 823 (\u201cprosecution had a duty to inquire concerning the existence of scientific tests, at least those conducted by the Commonwealth\u2019s own crime laboratory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Because the dismissals were premised on an erroneous conclusion of law, and because there is no basis in the record for dismissal, we reverse the allowance of the motions to dismiss. Given these circumstances, we reject the juveniles\u2019 argument that the judge\u2019s orders to dismiss must be affirmed because the Commonwealth has not shown that it would be prejudiced from filing new complaints.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">B. <em>Motions to suppress. </em>A motion judge \u201cdetermin[es] . . . the weight and credibility of the testimony\u201d presented at the evidentiary hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>380 Mass. 751, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>756 (1980). In reviewing a judge\u2019s ruling on \u201ca motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), and cases cited. Although the judge\u2019s conclusions of law are also \u201centitled to substantial deference,\u201d we independently review \u201clegal conclusion[s] . . . where [they are] of constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 354 (1978), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In her findings and rulings from the bench, the judge concluded \u201cthat the investigation that took place by [assistant] principal Lapan was under the guise of a governmental agency and that toward that end, there was certainly no Miranda rights given, [and] there was no opportunity for parental involvement.\u201d Because the judge determined that it was immaterial whether the assistant principal was acting \u201cat the behest\u201d of the police, she did not make any specific findings on that issue. Rather, the judge concluded that \u201c[i]f [the assistant principal] holds himself out as law enforcement, if the young people, very young people are not free to leave, are in a custodial situation, there are due process rights. . . . When children are treated in a custodial fashion as opposed to in a school fashion, there are certain due process rights that attend and I find that none of them attended to any of these defendants today.\u201d Because we conclude that these rulings are erroneous as a matter of law, we reverse the allowance of the motions to suppress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">School officials acting within the scope of their employment, rather than \u201cas [instruments] of the police [or] as [agents] of the police,\u201d are not required to give Miranda warnings prior to questioning a student in conjunction with a school investigation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>413 Mass. 521, 532 (1992), and cases cited. The judge\u2019s ruling to the contrary is inconsistent with our precedent and cannot stand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The juveniles posit that even if we conclude, as we have, that Miranda warnings are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>automatically required when a school official questions a student about potentially criminal matters, the statements should nevertheless be suppressed because Lapan acted as an agent of the police, the juveniles were in custody, and the statements were not otherwise voluntary. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">To the extent that the judge\u2019s ruling was, as two of the juveniles argue, based on a finding that assistant principal Lapan was acting as an agent of the police, the finding was clearly erroneous. The juveniles contend that it is possible to infer that Lapan was an agent of the police or, in the alternative, that there was a school policy to provide the police with information about possible criminal activity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree. The record contains no evidence that the police directed, controlled, or otherwise initiated or influenced assistant principal Lapan\u2019s investigation of the alleged incident. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>402 Mass. 275, 278 (1988), and cases cited (\u201cfinding that [assistant director of facility under contract with Department of Youth Services] was functioning as an instrument of the police was warranted\u201d). Rather, the testimony indicated that Lapan\u2019s investigation was independent of any police investigation and that he acted reasonably as a school administrator. Even if there was evidence in the record that the school\u2019s policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>was to <em>provide </em>information in its possession to the police, that alone is insufficient to transform school officials into agents of the police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence L., post </em>817, 821-822 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, supra </em>at 532 (\u201cThe fact that the school administrators had every intention of turning the marihuana over to the police does not make them agents or instrumentalities of the police in questioning [the defendant]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Moreover, Miranda warnings were not required prior to questioning because the juveniles were not subject to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966). In the context of protecting a person\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d refers to \u201cwhen an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. In determining whether there was custodial interrogation we look at \u201chow a reasonable person in the juvenile\u2019s position would have understood his situation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 277, and cases cited. The court considers the following factors: where the interrogation took place; \u201cwhether the officers have conveyed to the person being questioned any belief or opinion that that person is a suspect\u201d; the tone and nature of the questioning; and \u201cwhether, at the time the incriminating statement was made, the person was free to end the interview by leaving the locus of the interrogation or by asking the interrogator to leave, as evidenced by whether the interview terminated with an arrest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brum, </em>438 Mass. 103, 111-112 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Groome, </em>435 Mass. 201, 211-212 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The juveniles argue that they were \u201cin custody\u201d because they were questioned individually (and three were asked to write statements) by the assistant principal, in his office, for fifteen to twenty minutes. They argue that a student summonsed to the assistant principal\u2019s office to discuss a potentially criminal matter would not feel free to leave, and that they did not consider themselves free to leave. These facts alone are insufficient to establish custodial interrogation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 385 (1996) (\u201cdefendant was interviewed in a closed room at a police station by a succession of three law enforcement officers over a period of approximately seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>hours\u201d and \u201cwas repeatedly told that she would not receive [requested mental health] help until she answered the interrogators\u2019 questions\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 277-278 (juvenile was interrogated \u201cin a detention facility ... at which he was subject to continuous supervision\u201d and \u201chad been physically restrained from leaving the premises immediately prior to his confession\u201d). A trip to the principal\u2019s office for an interview is not a \u201cformal arrest,\u201d nor does it suggest to the student that he or she faces such an arrest. It is unrealistic to expect school officials who are responsible for addressing student behavioral issues to refrain from investigating allegations of students\u2019 harming each other, and the mere fact that such officials are in positions of authority over students does not transform every interview of a student into a custodial interrogation. There is no evidence in the record that Lapan did anything other than what we would expect an assistant principal to do. See <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 350 (1985) (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201capart from education, the school has the obligation to protect pupils from mistreatment by other children\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Although Ira raised the issue of voluntariness in his memorandum in support of the motion to suppress, the issue was not specifically addressed at the evidentiary hearing and the judge did not make any findings or determinations whether the juveniles\u2019 statements were voluntary. \u201cA confession (or admission), whether made to police or to a civilian, is admissible only if it is voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>410 Mass. 506, 511 (1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>395 Mass. 448, 456 (1985). However, \u201c[a]t a suppression hearing, there is an initial presumption that the defendant\u2019s statement is voluntary, placing the burden on the defendant to produce evidence tending to show otherwise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>429 Mass. 60, 65 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 471 n.3 (1976). The juveniles posit that the statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>involuntary because the juveniles were thirteen and fourteen years old, the record is devoid of evidence that the juveniles wrote their statements free of duress, they were questioned without their parents being present, they were not given Miranda warnings, they were questioned by a person in authority, and they were told that there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d for their actions. Ira\u2019s affidavit in no way alleged that he was \u201cintimidated or coerced or that his ability to reason was in any way impaired,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, supra </em>at 531 n.9, nor did the juveniles introduce any other evidence showing that the statements were involuntary. We will not conclude that a statement is involuntary simply because it is taken by a school official who is in a position of authority. Such an approach would invalidate, on voluntariness grounds, the results of any questioning of students and thereby would wreak havoc on our schools. Thus, based on the evidence presented at the hearing on the motions to suppress, we cannot conclude that the judge, in allowing the juveniles\u2019 motions, impliedly found that the statements were involuntary. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>402 Mass. 275, 280 (1988) (\u201cimplied finding that the Commonwealth\u201d failed to meet burden of proof was warranted where \u201cno evidence in the record\u201d supported Commonwealth\u2019s position).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">3. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">For the above-stated reasons, we conclude that it was error for the judge to dismiss the complaints and to suppress the juveniles\u2019 statements. We reverse the judgments and the orders allowing the juveniles\u2019 motions to suppress, and the cases are remanded to the Juvenile Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The juveniles contend that the testimony from the hearing on the motions to suppress indicates that Lapan was the person who first made the investigating officer, Officer Robert V. Majewski, Jr., aware of the alleged June 5 incident. Given the totality of the circumstances in these cases, our conclusion is unaffected by whether Lapan contacted Officer Majewski, or Officer Majewski contacted Lapan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The record is sparse concerning how or when the juveniles\u2019 attorneys became aware of either the oral or written statements. The only information before us is as follows: the Commonwealth claims that the juveniles were informed as \u201cpart of pre-trial discovery\u201d that Lapan took oral statements because that information was contained in Lapan\u2019s written statement to Officer Majewski (which was produced); the prosecutor averred that she was unaware of the juveniles\u2019 written statements until the day of the hearing, when Ira\u2019s counsel informed her of their existence; Danny\u2019s attorney stated at the hearing that his motion to suppress was \u201cbased on some information that I just [found] out a week ago\u201d; and Justin\u2019s motion to dismiss indicates that his attorney was \u201cnever given written statements until [the day of the hearing].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The juveniles\u2019 briefs allege that the prosecutor violated the discovery orders by failing to provide the juveniles\u2019 written statements prior to trial. There is no evidence that the Commonwealth failed to provide counsel with \u201cpictures\u201d or \u201cmedical reports,\u201d as alleged in Danny\u2019s and Ira\u2019s written motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">The record appendix does not include a copy of the discovery orders. However, Danny\u2019s brief included a standard pretrial conference report form that provides for all discretionary discovery, including statements made by the juvenile or codefendant, if \u201cwithin the possession, custody or control of the prosecutor.\u201d This is consistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s representation at oral argument. We take this opportunity, however, to remind litigants and attorneys that the appellant is required to \u201cfile an appendix to the briefs\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\u201cshall contain . . . any paper filed in the case relating to an issue which is to be argued on appeal.\u201d Mass. R. A. R 18 (a), as amended, 425 Mass. 1602 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\">This information appears only in the prosecutor\u2019s affidavit in support of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to reconsider. We reject Danny\u2019s contention that it is improper to consider this affidavit. Contrary to the juvenile\u2019s claim, the record reflects that the Commonwealth <em>did </em>file notices of appeal from the judge\u2019s orders denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motions to reconsider the allowance of the dismissals of the complaints. Furthermore, the docket sheets indicate that there was a hearing on the motions to reconsider, and the judge allowed the motions in part, as she issued written orders indicating that the dismissals were without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Because we conclude that the judge\u2019s orders to dismiss the cases without prejudice were an abuse of discretion, we need not address the other grounds for reversal argued by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Because we conclude that the motions to suppress were erroneously granted as a matter of law, we decline to address the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments that the motions did not comply with the rules of criminal procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b832-8\">We decline the juveniles\u2019 invitation to overrule the portion of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>413 Mass. 521, 532 (1992), that concludes that the Miranda rule does not apply to a \u201cschool administrator who is acting neither as an instrument of the police nor as an agent of the police.\u201d We also reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Justin\u2019s argument that <em>Snyder </em>requires Miranda-type warnings in these circumstances under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as our decision in <em>Snyder </em>was grounded in the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 530-531. As in that case, the juveniles here have made no legal arguments \u201cthat we should apply different principles and reasoning under our law from those that the Supreme Court has applied in its <em>Miranda </em>opinion and subsequently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The juveniles posit that the following supports a finding that Lapan was an agent of the police: Lapan \u201cconducted an investigation\u201d of the alleged incident even though it did not occur on school property; Lapan \u201cinterview[ed]\u201d the complainant, the juveniles, and other students who might have witnessed the alleged event, and procured written statements from some of the students; Lapan informed the complainant\u2019s mother that she could seek criminal charges against the juveniles and testified that, in such circumstances, he \u201calways [told] parents\u201d they could bring criminal charges; the record does not contain any information concerning a school-related punishment of the juveniles; Officer Majewski testified that he was a member of the \u201cYouth Aid Bureau,\u201d which \u201cwork[ed] in the schools [and] with juvenile issues,\u201d and that Lapan contacted him about the alleged incident; and Lapan\u2019s statement to the police indicates that he contacted Officer Majewski.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Because we conclude that assistant principal Lapan was not required to give the juveniles Miranda warnings, it is immaterial that the juveniles were not given an opportunity to consult with their parents prior to answering questions about the alleged incident. A juvenile\u2019s opportunity to consult with an \u201cinterested adult\u201d is relevant to the validity of the juvenile\u2019s waiver of his rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
