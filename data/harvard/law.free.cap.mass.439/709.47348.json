See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The attorney, Kathy Pett Ryman, filed the appearance against the wishes of the court-appointed permanent guardian, Priscilla Claman (guardian), who is the daughter of the ward, Lon Hocker. No litigation involving either the guardian or the ward was pending when Ryman filed her appearance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the ward claims that (1) despite being adjudicated mentally incompetent, he has an ongoing right to his own counsel under Massachusetts statutory and constitutional law; (2) Ryman, as his former counsel in the guardianship proceedings, has a continuing ethical duty to represent him; and (3) he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing concerning his competency to retain counsel of his choice. We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the order of the probate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the undisputed facts contained in the judge\u2019s written memoranda on the petition for guardianship and the motion to strike Ryman\u2019s appearance. On August 17, 1999, Claman petitioned for permanent guardianship of her father on the grounds that he had become mentally incompetent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>and unable to care for himself. A judge in the Barnstable Division of the Probate and Family Court appointed Claman temporary guardian. See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 14. As temporary guardian, Claman later sought, and was granted, the authority to monitor the administration of antipsychotic medications to Hocker in accordance with a specific treatment plan, see <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489 (1983) <em>(Rogers)-, </em>she was not authorized to commit Hocker to long-term placement in a mental health or nursing home facility except on further order of the court. In accordance with the statute governing <em>Rogers </em>proceedings, the judge appointed Ry-man to represent Hocker\u2019s interests. See S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as appearing in 416 Mass. 1306 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On March 9, 2000, following a trial in which Hocker (represented by Ryman) and his son, Lon Hocker, III (son), contested Claman\u2019s appointment as permanent guardian,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judge found that Hocker, then eighty-nine years of age, suffered from multi-infarct dementia with agitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also found that Hocker \u201cwas not capable by reason of . . . mental illness of caring for himself\u201d and that he did \u201cnot have the present ability to make informed decisions regarding his psychiatric treatment, including, but not limited to, treatment with anti-psychotic medication and admission to a mental health hospital or institution.\u201d The judge appointed Claman permanent guardian of Hocker\u2019s person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He noted that Claman had served as temporary guardian \u201cwith distinction\u201d and concluded that she was \u201cthe most appropriate person to serve\u201d as permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>guardian. The judge declined, however, to give Claman permanent \u201cstand by authority\u201d to administer antipsychotic medications. The judge exhorted the family to \u201cwork together in the future to ensure that [Hocker] is able to experience the quality of life to which he is entitled.\u201d He admonished family members that they \u201cnot interfere with the guardian and care giver\u2019s ability to implement the treatment plan.\u201d There was no appeal from the guardianship decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Following Claman\u2019s appointment as permanent guardian and because Ryman had completed her duties relative to the guardianship proceeding, on June 11, 2001, the judge vacated Ryman\u2019s appointment nunc pro tune to March 9, 2000, the date of the decree of permanent guardianship. The next day, June 12, 2001, Ryman filed a notice of appearance, purportedly on behalf of the ward. No pleading accompanied the notice of appearance. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>On June 18, 2001, the ward\u2019s son filed a pro se notice of appearance. On July 5, 2001, the guardian filed a motion to strike Ryman\u2019s notice of appearance, which was opposed by the son and by Ryman.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On August 22, 2001, following a hearing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge allowed the guardian\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He concluded that Hocker, as a person adjudicated mentally incompetent and in need of a permanent guardian, was unable to think or act for himself as to matters concerning his person or property and that \u201cthe level of assessment and reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>required to make informed legal decisions, exceeds Hocker\u2019s ability as diagnosed by his physicians.\u201d He noted that any concerns regarding Claman\u2019s fitness to serve as guardian could be addressed by an action to remove Claman pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 13A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Among other things, the judge ordered Ryman to refrain from contacting or having \u201cany interactions\u201d with the ward regarding legal matters without the guardian\u2019s knowledge and consent, or further court order. On October 31, 2001, at Ry-man\u2019s request, the judge amended his order to permit Ryman to consult with the ward for the sole purpose of prosecuting this appeal, ruling that contact between Ryman and the ward should be allowed \u201cin the interest of justice and due process\u201d because the matter ultimately concerns the ward\u2019s liberty interests in managing his own affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">2. <em>Due process. </em>The ward claims that the judge\u2019s order striking Ryman\u2019s notice of appearance effectively barred him from meaningful access to the courts, in violation of his due process rights. He has \u201ca constitutionally protected liberty interest,\u201d he asserts, \u201cin being left free to retain counsel of his choice, despite a finding that he is incompetent to make ordinary medical decisions about his own care.\u201d The ward misapprehends the nature and scope of guardianship, and of his due process rights in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We reject at the outset the contention that either the scope of Claman\u2019s guardianship or the judge\u2019s determination of incompetency was limited to the ward\u2019s medical care. Nothing in the guardianship decree suggests that the guardianship of the ward\u2019s person was limited or restricted. See <em>Guardianship of Bassett, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 67 (1979) (judge could properly exercise his powers to appoint guardian \u201cfor limited purposes and with specified responsibilities\u201d). The provisions in the decree stating that the guardian could not, without further court order, commit the ward to a long-term care facility or forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to him merely restate the limits of a guardian\u2019s general power, as expressed by statute and determined by prior decisions of this court. See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>pra </em>at 491; <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 434-443 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6, Hocker was adjudicated incompetent and in need of a permanent guardian because he was determined to be (1) incapable of taking care of himself, (2) by reason of mental illness. See <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 394, 399 (1978) (error to appoint permanent guardian where individual was not found to be incapable of taking care of himself by reason of mental illness). The judge reached that determination after a trial at which Hocker and others testified on his behalf, and in which he was represented by Ryman. That Hocker\u2019s dementia and his inability \u201cto think or act for himself as to matters concerning his personal health, safety, and general welfare,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 403, were proved by a preponderance of the evidence is amply shown in the judge\u2019s detailed and specific findings, from which there has been no been appeal. See <em>Guardianship of Roe, supra </em>at 425 (detailed findings of fact must accompany determination of incompetency).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">When a person is adjudicated incompetent, as Hocker has been, \u201c[t]he necessary effect... is that the ward is in law . . . incapable of taking care of himself, as to all the world.\u201d <em>Fazio </em>v. <em>Fazio, supra </em>at 399-400, quoting <em>Leggate </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>111 Mass. 308, 310 (1873). The permanent guardian stands in the place of the ward in making decisions about the ward\u2019s well-being, and the guardian is held to high standards of fidelity in exercising this authority for the ward\u2019s benefit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Dolbeare </em>v. <em>Bowser, </em>254 Mass. 57, 61 (1925) (guardian\u2019s \u201cauthority and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>interest extend only to such things as may be for the benefit or advantage of the ward\u201d); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Mass. 102, 106 (1915) (relationship between guardian and ward is fiduciary as matter of law). To be sure, an adjudication of incompetency under G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6, does not obviate the need for a guardian or a judge to consult a ward\u2019s feelings or opinions on a matter concerning his care. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>377 Mass. 272, 279 (1979). It does not make the ward any less worthy of dignity or respect in the eyes of the law than a competent person. See <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 745 (1977). It does not deprive the ward of fundamental liberty interests. See <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>411 Mass. 512, 517-518, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>503 U.S. 950 (1992). But the rights and interests of one adjudicated to be incompetent must of necessity and \u201cfor the benefit or advantage of the ward,\u201d <em>Dolbeare </em>v. <em>Bowser, supra </em>at 61, often be vindicated in a manner different from that of the mentally competent. Few would disagree, for example, that a mentally incompetent person\u2019s freedom to travel could be determined by the guardian, or that the ward\u2019s freedom to engage in an occupation could be similarly restricted by the guardian.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Although the ward argues that the guardian could not be the \u201csole authority\u201d over the ward, and an attorney is needed to \u201cprotect\u201d the ward from harm, the judge has selected the guardian as the individual most suitable to make decisions on the ward\u2019s behalf. That selection has not been appealed. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>important to note that, contrary to Ryman\u2019s contentions, the judge\u2019s order striking her notice of appearance did nothing to limit the ward\u2019s statutory and due process rights of access to the courts. The ward and his family members remain free to challenge Claman\u2019s fitness as guardian or the ward\u2019s continued need for a permanent guardian of his person. See, e.g., G. L. c. 201, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 13, 13A.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Nor does the order deprive the ward of the ability to retain counsel as contemplated by Massachusetts law and the requirements of due process. We agree that, in certain circumstances where the guardian faces a conflict or a likelihood of conflict with a ward, Massachusetts law contemplates that the ward be represented by independent counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Those circumstances are not present here, and they do not create a generalized and continuing \u201cright to counsel of one\u2019s choosing\u201d for a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>adjudicated under our laws to be mentally incompetent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s order striking Ryman\u2019s notice of appearance merely prevents Ryman from using the cover of court imprimatur to monitor, on an ongoing basis and purportedly on the ward\u2019s behalf,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the activities of Claman as guardian. Given the judge\u2019s specific finding that the ward lacked the capacity because of his dementia to make reasoned legal decisions on his own behalf, as well as the judge\u2019s findings concerning the history of family tension over Claman\u2019s role as guardian, the judge\u2019s order was prudent. It was well within the judge\u2019s authority to shield an extraordinarily vulnerable individual from becoming an unknowing instrument to subvert the authority of the court-appointed permanent guardian. In short, when no adversary proceedings have been initiated, due process does not require that a ward be able to consult with counsel about his guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">3. <em>Attorney\u2019s ethical duties. </em>Contrary to the ward\u2019s arguments, we conclude that Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.14, 426 Mass. 1361 (1998),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> imposes no affirmative duty on an attorney appointed by a judge during guardianship proceedings to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>to represent her client after the judge has adjudicated the client to be mentally incompetent, appointed a permanent guardian for the client, and vacated the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Rule 1.14 governs a lawyer\u2019s ethical duties of continued representation to a client whose reasoning has become impaired, by mental incompetence or otherwise. Comment [2] to rule 1.14 instructs the lawyer of a client who has a guardian or legal representative to \u201cas far as possible accord the represented person the status of client, particularly in maintaining communication.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The ward argues that rule 1.14, as seen through the gloss of comment [2], contemplates the indefinite continuation of the attorney-client relationship after the appointment of a guardian. See comment [2] to rule 1.14. Manifestly, the rule does not contemplate the continuation of an attorney-client relationship where, as here, a judge has vacated his limited and specific appointment of the attorney. Moreover, the ward ignores the admonition of comment [3], which states: \u201cIf a legal representative has already been appointed for the client, the lawyer should ordinarily look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Comment [3] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>rule 1.14.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The ethical dilemma posited by the ward does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">4. <em>Evidentiary hearing. </em>We reject the ward\u2019s argument that the judge erred in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on the guardian\u2019s motion to strike Ryman\u2019s notice of appearance. The record on appeal, including the record of the hearing on the motion to strike, reveals that Ryman did not request an evidentiary hearing on the motion. She is not entitled to raise the issue for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 88 (1977); <em>Trustees of the Stigmatine Fathers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562, 565 (1976). Even if she had requested an evidentiary hearing, the record before us indicates the judge would have been well within his discretion to deny such a request. No underlying action was pending before the court. The ward did not attend the hearing on the motion to strike, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>and the rec- - ord does not disclose that any continuance was sought to allow his attendance. The only evidence proffered on behalf of the claim that the ward had regained his ability to make decisions regarding his legal affairs was a copy of an internet posting entitled \u201cNew Possibility of Brain Cell Regeneration in Alzheimers Disease\u201d by a support group, submitted as an exhibit to the son\u2019s affidavit. In his affidavit, moreover, the ward\u2019s son stated that he agreed that his father still needed a guardian, but proposed that he himself be named coguardian with his sister. Any indication of a change in Mocker\u2019s mental condition was thus \u201cskimpy\u201d and insubstantial, at best, see <em>Adoption of Marc, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 798, 800 (2000), and \u201c[w]e would be hard pressed to detect any unfairness in the manner in which the issue of relief was handled in view of the . . . failure ... to assist the judge in any meaningful way.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 590 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>432 Mass. 43 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">General Laws c. 201, \u00a7 6 (a), in pertinent part, states: \u201c[I]f, after notice as provided in section seven and a hearing, the court finds that he is incapable of taking care of himself by reason of mental illness, it shall appoint a guardian of his person and estate.\u201d The statute was amended in 2002; that amendment did not affect the applicable provision. See St. 2002, c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">At oral argument, Ryman represented that she filed the notice of appearance so that she could attend a meeting of the guardian, the guardian\u2019s attorney, and family members of the ward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b730-8\">This appeal was filed by the ward\u2019s son, Lon Hocker, HI, and Attorney Ryman, acting for the ward and on her own behalf. An appeal from an order of a judge in the Probate and Family Court is governed by G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 9, which allows appeals only by a \u201cperson aggrieved by an order, judgment, decree or denial of a probate court.\u201d The son is not an aggrieved person. Cf. <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>256 Mass. 203, 204 (1926), quoting <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>128 Mass. 592, 593 (1880) (cousin not \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by decree denying petition to remove guardian of minors because it nowhere appears she \u201chas some pecuniary interest, or some personal right, which is immediately or remotely affected or concluded by the decree appealed from\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Because the guardian has not challenged whether either Ryman or the ward is a proper party to this proceeding, we need not and do not determine that issue. We note, however, that the judge\u2019s order of June 11, 2001, vacating the appointment of Ryman as Hocker\u2019s attorney nunc pro tune to March 9, 2000, has not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Hocker\u2019s mental incompetence and need for a guardian was not contested. The parties stipulated, and the judge apparently accepted, that Hocker\u2019s wife would not be an appropriate guardian. See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 24, which provides that the guardian of a married person, \u201cunless authorized by the court for causes which the court considers sufficient, shall not have the care, custody or education of his ward, except in case of the mental illness of the spouse of such person.\u201d The ward\u2019s son resided in the State of Hawaii. Hocker and his son argued that Hocker\u2019s former daughter-in-law should be appointed Hock-er\u2019s permanent guardian.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">This type of dementia is described as \u201ca step-like deterioration in intellectual functions.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 410 (25th ed. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The order of permanent guardianship was of the \u201cperson\u201d only. Prior to the adjudication of incompetency, Hocker\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d had been placed in a trust administered by its trustees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The guardian also filed a motion for temporary orders to prevent \u201cfamily members\u201d from \u201cinterfering\u201d with her care of the ward or his medical or legal appointments. Ryman countered with a motion to restrain the guardian from further interference with the ward\u2019s \u201cattorney-client relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The ward did not attend the hearing. Ryman represented that the ward\u2019s wife had been injured in a fall the night before, and that he had chosen to stay with her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In addition to striking the notice of appearance of Ryman, the judge allowed, in part, the guardian\u2019s motion for temporary orders to prohibit family members from interfering with the guardian\u2019s plan of medical care and ordered that family members not arrange legal or medical appointments for the ward without the guardian\u2019s authorization. He denied the guardian the authority to restrict visits by social guests to the ward\u2019s home. The judge also denied the motion filed by Ryman to restrain the guardian from further interference with the ward\u2019s \u201cattorney-client relationship.\u201d While it appears from the record that either the ward, his son, or both may have attempted to appeal from some or all of these rulings, the Appeals Court determined that orders other than those that concerned Ryman\u2019s notice of appearance were interlocutory and not immediately appealable, a point that is not contested here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\">See note 13, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The powers and duties of a permanent guardian are laid out generally in G.

See G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 14 <em>if). </em>Chapter 201 does not delineate the specific duties of a permanent guardian.

L. c. 201, \u00a7 6 (c), or to commit the ward to a mental health facility, G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 6 (b). In addition, because the ward is one of the parties allowed to seek discharge of the guardianship if the ward is no longer incompetent, G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 13, or removal of the guardian for unsuitability, G. L. c. 201, \u00a7 13A, see <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>355 Mass. 785, 785 (1969), the ward may be entitled to counsel consistent with S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as appearing in 416 Mass. 1306 (1993). The interest of a guardian and a ward are perhaps at their most adverse when a petition for removal is filed, and the alleged failure of the guardian to fulfill her fiduciary duties to the ward is at issue. We need not and do not determine whether an incompetent ward could retain a lawyer himself in such circumstances. See J.H. Cross, R.D. Fleischner, &amp; J.SJ. Elder, Guardian and Conservatorship in Massachusetts \u00a7 3.18A (Supp. 2002) (\u201cInasmuch as the statute allows a ward to seek removal of his or her guardian, there should at least be a presumption that the ward has the capability to retain counsel for that purpose\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">We have long recognized that the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice is not absolute.

The lawyer may consult family members, adult protective agencies, or other individuals or entities that have authority to protect the client, and, if it reasonably appears necessary, the lawyer may seek the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator, or a guardian, as the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>may be. The lawyer may consult only those individuals or entities reasonably necessary to protect the client\u2019s interests and may not consult any individual or entity that the lawyer believes, after reasonable inquiry, will act in a fashion adverse to the interests of the client. In taking any of these actions the lawyer may disclose confidential information of the client only to the extent necessary to protect the client\u2019s interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">\u201cThe fact that a client suffers a disability does not diminish the lawyer\u2019s obligation to treat the client with attention and respect. If the person has no guardian or legal representative, the lawyer often must act as de facto guardian. Even if the person does have a legal representative, the lawyer should as far as possible accord the represented person the status of client, particularly in maintaining communication.\u201d Comment [2] to rule 1.14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Comment [3] to rule 1.14 states: \u201cIf a legal representative has already been appointed for the client, the lawyer should ordinarily look to the representative for decisions on behalf of the client. In situations involving care of the person or property of the client, if a legal representative has not been appointed, the lawyer may consult various individuals and take the specific actions mentioned in rule 1.14(b). In particular, the lawyer may consult family members even though family members may be personally interested in the situation. If reasonable inquiry discloses that the family member will act adversely to the client\u2019s interest, the lawyer may not consult that family member. Evaluation of these considerations is a matter of professional judgment on the lawyer\u2019s part.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Similarly, comment [4] discusses a lawyer\u2019s ethical obligations to prevent or rectify misconduct on the part of the guardian: \u201cIf the lawyer represents the guardian as distinct from the ward, and is aware that the guardian is acting adversely to the ward\u2019s interest, the lawyer may have an obligation to prevent or rectify the guardian\u2019s misconduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
