FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE. .1265</p>\n<p id=\"A7-\">I.FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A9x\">Abuquerque\u2019s South Valley is located about 2.5 miles south of downtown Abu-querque, west of the Abuquerque International Airport around the intersections of Woodward Avenue with Broadway Avenue and Edmunds Street. The South Valley area has been the site of manufacturing operations since at least 1948, when the Eidal Manufacturing Company operated a welding plant on Broadway Avenue. In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission, through American Car and Foundry (\u201cACF Industries\u201d), took over the property, constructed plant facilities and engaged in machining of metal parts, plating, welding and other activities related to the manufacture of nuclear weapons components. This continued until 1967, when the United States Ar Force (USAF) assumed control over the property and converted the facility into an aircraft engine parts manufacturing plant, known as U.S. Air Force Plant 83 (\u201cPlant 83.\u201d), operated by General Electric Company under a series of facilities contracts and leases. In 1984, Plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>83 was sold to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) and remains in operation today as an aircraft engine parts manufacturing facility. Other industrial facilities have been located in South Valley as well, including petroleum product pipeline and bulk distribution facilities operated by Chevron, Texaco and others, and an industrial chemical distribution facility on Ed-munds Street owned and operated by Uni-var.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">In 1979, chemical analysis of samples collected from one of the City of Albuquerque\u2019s municipal water supply wells, the San Jose 6 Well (\u201cSJ-6\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> located near the intersection of Woodward and Broadway Avenues in the South Valley, detected the presence of hazardous substances consisting of \u201cvolatile organic compounds\u201d (\u201cVOCs,\u201d mainly halogenated solvents) and petroleum hydrocarbons. Samples then taken from two other municipal supply wells, the San Jose 3 (\u201cSJ-3\u201d) and Miles No. 1 Wells, were also found to be contaminated. In 1981, after further investigation and monitoring by the Environmental Improvement Division of the New Mexico Health and Environment Department, the San Jose 3 and San Jose 6 Wells were decommissioned due to the low-level VOC contamination problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">The contamination and subsequent shutdown of SJ-6 had a significant impact upon the production of the San Jose Well Field, raising concerns among Albuquerque city officials that fire-protection water supplies in particular would be inadequate to serve the needs of the South Valley area, particularly during very dry years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">In light of these concerns, the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Division declared in June 1982 that the South Valley site was the State\u2019s number one priority for environmental cleanup, and brought the groundwater contamination problem to the attention of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Beginning in July 1982, the EPA proposed to list South Valley among the hazardous waste sites across the nation that needed remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">On August 9, 1983, the Director of the Environmental Improvement Division formally requested that EPA initiate remedial investigations and feasibility studies associated with the South Valley site, including the resolution of immediate water supply problems resulting from the shutdown of the contaminated SJ-6 well. On September 8, 1983, the EPA published a final rule listing the one-square-mile area of land surrounding the SJ-3 and SJ-6 wells on its National Priorities List pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), Pub.L. 96-510, 94 Stat. 2767, <em>codified at </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 <em>et seq. </em>(2000), designating it as the South Valley NPL Site. <em>See </em>48 Fed. Reg. 40,658 (September 8, 1983). The agency began the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study process at the South Valley Site, calling upon the Air Force and other potentially responsible parties at South Valley to conduct much of the investigative work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">The EPA established as many as six \u201cOperable Units\u201d (OU) for remediation activities at the South Valley Site:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-12\">OU1: Replacement of the water supply wells at SJ-3 and SJ-6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-13\">OU2: Plug and monitor wells at SJ-3 and SJ-6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-14\">OU3: Groundwater remediation at the Univar Edmunds Street facility</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-15\">OU4: Soil Remediation at the Univar Edmunds Street facility</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>0U5: Soil and shallow groundwater remediation at Plant 83/General Electric facility</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-4\">OU6: Deep aquifer ground water remediation at Plant 83/General Electric facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1234-5\">(EPA Site Status Summary: South Valley New Mexico (NMD980745558), at 4-5 (rev. October 7, 2003), <em>available at </em>http:// www.epa.gov/earthlr6/6sf/pdffiles/south-val.pdf.) Remedial work soon commenced, beginning with Operable Unit # 1: the replacement of SJ-3 and SJ-6 was accomplished by the installation of a new replacement city water supply well, the Burton # 4 Well, in April of 1987. <em>(Id. </em>at 4.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-6\">Second phase remedial investigations were conducted at the Univar Edmunds Street Operable Units (# 3 <em>&amp; </em># 4) and the Plant 83/General Electric Operable Units (#5 &amp; # 6). The investigation of the Uni-var Edmunds Street units led to the issuance of a Record of Decision on June 28, 1988,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> followed by the drafting and execution of a consent decree effective June 1, 1990, requiring the implementation of a groundwater extraction and treatment system. Installation of the system commenced in September of 1990; the system became operational in April 1992. <em>(Id. </em>at 3, 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-9\">Following public hearings and discussions with the State of New Mexico, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (ROD) concerning the Plant 83/General Electric Operable Units on September 30, 1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the ROD, EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d) for performance of design and construction of a remediation system to treat the contaminated groundwater. GE responded in August 1989, agreeing to comply with the Order and perform the work. GE performed the Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA), implementing the extraction and treatment remedies called for by the Plant 83 ROD, pumping, treating and reinjecting both shallow aquifer and deep aquifer water beginning in May 1994 and April 1996, respectively. <em>(Id. </em>at 3, 5.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-10\">Having the opportunity to review and comment on the EPA\u2019s proposed remedial scheme, the State of New Mexico, through the Environmental Improvement Division of the New Mexico Health and Environment Department, responded that \u201cEID concurs with the remedy outlined in the draft Record of Decision for the GE/USAF Operable Unit ... While this remedy alone does not address all potential threats to public health at the San Jose site it is an important part of the overall strategy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>do so.\u201d (Plant 83 ROD, Attachment One (September 30,1988).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) also undertook its own investigation of groundwater contamination due to hydrocarbons discharged from various petroleum facilities at South Valley. The NMED Ground Water Quality Bureau then negotiated Hydrocarbon Remediation Agreements (HRAs) with Chevron, ATA Pipeline, and Texaco in 1994, requiring the companies to treat the contaminated soil and groundwater underlying the South Valley Site using soil vapor extraction, free ' product recovery, and dissolved phase groundwater recovery systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-6\">Groundwater remediation in the South Valley Operable Units continues today, with the EPA recently observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1235-7\">the groundwater remedial systems at the South Valley Superfund Site have been very effective in recovering and treating over 2.3 billion gallons of water since the remedial systems went on-line. Almost the entire amount of this large volume of water has been returned to the aquifer from which it was extracted, allowing the groundwater to be returned back to its beneficial use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">(EPA Site Status Summary: South Valley New Mexico (NMD980745558), at 6 (rev. October 7, 2003), <em>available at </em>http:// www.epa.gov/earthlr6/6sfipdffiles/south-val.pdf.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-12\">II. BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-13\">Plaintiffs the State of New Mexico and the State of New Mexico <em>ex rel. </em>Patricia A. Madrid assert the State\u2019s ownership of all waters in the State of New Mexico, including all groundwater underlying the South Valley Site. Plaintiffs assert that pursuant to the New Mexico Constitution and laws, the State holds that groundwater in trust for the purpose of making it available for appropriation by users who will put it to a beneficial use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also assert <em>par-ens patriae </em>standing to protect the State\u2019s sovereign interests together with interests which all of New Mexico\u2019s citizens hold in common in protecting public waters against pollution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1235-14\">Originally, the plaintiffs pleaded damages claims under CERCLA as well as several state law tort theories, all arising from the persistent chemical contamination of portions of the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site allegedly resulting from the conduct of the named defendants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all damages claims arising under CERCLA in November of 2002, and now assert only New Mexico statutory and common-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-15\">Plaintiffs allege that the chemical contamination at South Valley has rendered a significant volume of that groundwater \u2014 as much as 289,500 acre-feet<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>for appropriation to its highest and best use, <em>viz., </em>as drinking water for human consumption, and has thus injured the State\u2019s interest as owner and trustee in making the water available for appropriation. Claiming a permanent loss, Plaintiffs seek an award of monetary damages to compensate the State of New Mexico for the value of the volume of contaminated groundwater thus rendered unavailable for appropriation, and damages for loss of use of that portion of the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer underlying the South Valley Site where the contaminated water may be found. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel submit that the proper measure of damages for this injury is the market value, with future losses adjusted to present value, of the volume of water affected by the contamination, together with the replacement cost of the storage capacity of the aquifer, which counsel also asserts to be permanently lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The Defendants respond that the claims now asserted by the Plaintiffs constitute an impermissible challenge to the ongoing remediation activities at South Valley because any such challenge is barred by \u00a7 113(h) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(h) (2000), which provides that no federal court \u201cshall have jurisdiction ... to review any challenges to ... remedial action\u201d under CERCLA, at least prior to the completion of the remediation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. State of Colorado, </em>990 F.2d 1565, 1576 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201cto the extent a state seeks to challenge a CERCLA response action, the plain language of \u00a7 9613(h) would limit a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction to review such a challenge\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1092, 114 S.Ct. 922, 127 L.Ed.2d 216 (1994). Moreover, because the State of New Mexico has concurred with the EPA\u2019s decisions concerning remedial action, or has itself approved remedial action pursuant to the Hydrocarbon Remediation Agreements, the Defendants assert that Plaintiffs are estopped from attacking the adequacy of the existing remediation. <em>Cf. Tiberi v. Cigna Corp., </em>89 F.3d 1423, 1429 (10th Cir.1996) (equitable estoppel defined).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">The Defendants further contend that the Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are pre-empted by federal law because \u201c \u2018under the circumstances of this particular case,\u2019 \u201d the New Mexico tort remedies \u201c \u2018stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u2019 \u201d in enacting CERCLA, <em>Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., </em>529 U.S. 861, 873, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000) (quoting <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)), particularly as implemented through the on-going remedial action overseen by the EPA. <em>See, e.g., United States v. City and County of Denver, </em>100 F.3d 1509, 1512 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">Besides preemption, the Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are barred by <em>res judicata </em>as a result of Plaintiffs\u2019 voluntary dismissal of their CERCLA claims in November 2002 because the CERCLA claims involved the same parties; they arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions; and their dismissal operates as a final judgment on the merits of those claims. <em>See, e.g., Satsky v. Paramount Communications, </em>7 F.3d 1464, 1467-70 (10th Cir.1993); <em>Clark v. Haas Group, Inc., </em>953 F.2d 1235, 1237, 1238-39 (10th Cir.1992) (the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>prohibits a party from asserting in a second lawsuit any matter that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>might have been asserted in the first lawsuit\u201d; \u201ceven though one group of facts may give rise to different claims for relief upon different theories of recovery, there remains but a single cause of action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">To the extent that Plaintiffs have, pleaded any legally viable theory of liability, the Defendants further respond that the State of New Mexico has suffered no compensa-ble injury because no volume of groundwater has been lost to appropriation from the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer due to the contamination, including the groundwater beneath the South Valley Site. First, Defendants submit, the Middle Rio Grande Basin groundwater has 'already been fully appropriated, and none remains available for new appropriation whether it is contaminated or not.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the contamination has not prevented <em>existing </em>.water rights holders \u2014 primarily the City of Albuquerque \u2014 from exercising their rights to extract groundwater and apply it to beneficial uses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At most, the city was required to move a point of diversion away from the San Jose 6 Well. While \u201cremediation is ongoing, the Middle Rio Grande Basin continues to provide all of the services it provided prior to the contamination: it receives recharge, stores water, and provides safe yield.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finally, Defendants assert, all of the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site could be used to satisfy \u2019existing rights because either it currently meets drinking water standards or could be rendered potable\u2018through existing treatment methods. \u201cAccordingly,\u201d Defendants argue, \u201cthere is a complete failure of proof on the essential element of injury.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">III. PROCEDURAL CONTEXT</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">After three years of pleadings, amended pleadings, and extensive discovery and motion practice, this action was calendared for a Final Pretrial Conference beginning September 30 through October 4, 2002.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the initial five days of the Conference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>court and counsel considered \u201cthe formulation and simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(1), as well as the resolution of any remaining discovery disputes. <em>(See </em>Minute Entry, dated September 30-October 4, 2002 (dkt. no. 900), <em>\u2022passim.) </em>The parties\u2019 Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order, received September 23, 2002, provided the working text for that effort; pending dispositive motions were also considered in the context of the Pretrial Conference, as this court had previously stated they would be. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">As the Pretrial Conference progressed, the court made several rulings on substantive issues, denying summary judgment motions by Chevron Pipeline, Chevron USA, and Texaco entities raising the CERCLA statute of limitations (dkt. nos. 523, 582, 583), granting a motion by the Chevron/Texaco Defendants for summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 lost tax revenues claim (dkt. no. 584), granting in part a motion by General Electric attacking plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cdisamenity\u201d damages theory (dkt. no. 631), and granting motions by ACF Industries and General Electric for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 punitive damages claims (dkt. nos. 597, 631). <em>(Id.) </em>The court reserved on other motions, and made a preliminary determination concerning plaintiffs\u2019 damages theories. <em>(See </em>Transcript of Hearing, dated October 3, 2002, at 736:22-737:2, 737:10-12, 738:3-5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">When the Pretrial Conference resumed on November 18, 2002, court and counsel addressed a number of motions dealing with trial, including motions <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude testimony by various expert witnesses. <em>(See </em>Minute Entry, dated November 18-20, 2002 (dkt. no. 919), <em>passim.) </em>On November 20, based upon a stipulation by counsel for all parties, this court entered an order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 CERCLA claims and the federal defendants from the action, all with prejudice.

The court heard and considered the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint, filed November 14, 2002 (dkt. no. 887), and denied the same. <em>(See </em>Minute Entry, dated January 16-17, 2003 (dkt. no. 971), at 3.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court also heard Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s earlier ruling concerning punitive damages,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which was taken under advisement. <em>(Id.) </em>Further ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>gument was heard on the Defendants\u2019 various motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 damages claims.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>at 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">The Pretrial Conference continued on February 4, 2003, resuming the colloquy concerning the Plaintiffs\u2019 damages theories and the nature of the State\u2019s interest in the groundwater in question; court and counsel addressed the question of the applicable legal standards defining the Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injury, and the court heard and considered several motions concerning expert testimony and motions in limine concerning specific evidence questions. <em>{See </em>Minute Entry, dated February 4-6, 2003 (dkt. no. 985), at 1-5.) Bifurcation of trial was also discussed. <em>{Id. </em>at 5-7.) On February 6, the court made a bench ruling concerning the legal standards defining Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injury, denying a request by Plaintiffs for certification of the question to the state courts. <em>{Id. </em>at 7-11.) A jury trial on damages issues was provisionally set for April, 2003,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the Pretrial Conference was continued until March.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">Other procedural matters arose, delaying the continued Pretrial Conference in this case until August of 2003. The conference resumed session on August 6, returning once again to the questions of Plaintiffs\u2019 damages claims and the issues that genuinely remain to be resolved at trial. <em>{See </em>Minute Entry, dated August 6-8, 2003 (dkt. no. 1014), at 2-3.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court also heard and considered Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to substitute an expert witness and defendant GE\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing concerning certain expert witnesses. <em>{Id. </em>at 4.) Court and counsel reviewed the parties\u2019 proposed witness lists in some detail, received the parties\u2019 exhibits as listed on the proposed exhibit lists, subject to particular motions to strike, and granted GE\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing concerning expert witnesses under Fed.R.Evid. 702.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>at 5-6.) On August 8, the court set new dates for submission of revised witness and exhibit lists, calendared the Rule 702 evidentiary hearing for December 9, 2003, and deferred on setting a new trial date. <em>{Id. </em>at 7-8.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> By subsequent Order, trial was provisionally set to begin February 9, 2004. <em>{See </em>Order, filed September 2, 2003 (dkt. no. 1015), at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">From December 9 through December 12,-2003, and continuing through January 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>and 8, 2004, the court heard testimony from the experts listed by counsel for the Rule 702 hearing,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> heard argument by counsel concerning experts and damages theories (as well as several recently filed motions), and took many of those matters under advisement.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>Minute Entry, dated December 9-12, 2008 (dkt. no. 1059), at 2-6; Minute Entry, dated January 7-8, 2004 (dkt. no. 1066); Transcript of Hearing, dated January 7, 2004, <em>passim; </em>Transcript of Hearing, dated January 8, 2004, passim.) The court vacated the provisional February 9, 2004 trial date, resetting the Final Pretrial Conference for that date, but on further consideration, vacated the February 9 setting altogether, deferring the calendaring of the Final Pretrial Conference and the first phase of trial pending further order of the court. <em>(See </em>Transcript of Hearing, dated January 8, 2004, at 4150:7-21 (The Court); Order, filed January 29, 2004 (dkt. no. 1063).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">IV. ISSUES ADDRESSED AT THE PRETRIAL CONFERENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Since commencing this action in October of 1999, the Plaintiffs have been creative in the number and kind of theories of liability they have pleaded and argued in this action. The Defendants in turn have proven resourceful in responding to the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, propounding an array of legal theories and factual assertions. By the time of the most recent hearing in January, the pleadings, motions and other papers filed in this action exceeded <em>thirty-seven shelf feet </em>of files in the Clerk\u2019s Office, and more filings have since been received. Together the parties have raised a multitude of issues requiring distillation and refinement in the context of the Pretrial Conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">We began our continuing discussion of this case by considering a few fundamental questions, and we have returned to those questions again and again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-10\">(1) What is the nature of the State\u2019s interest in the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-11\">(2) How has that interest been injured, and as measured by what standard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-12\">(3) What is the appropriate measure of damages to compensate that injury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-13\">A. The State\u2019s Interest in Groundwater</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-14\">According to Plaintiffs, \u201call ground waters ... belong to the public and are natural resources \u2018belonging to,\u2019 \u2018managed by,\u2019 \u2018held in trust by,\u2019 and \u2018controlled by\u2019 the State of New Mexico.\u201d (State of New Mexico\u2019s Complaint in the Consolidated Case, filed July 31, 2001 (dkt. no. 367) (\u201cConsolidated Complaint\u201d), at 5 \u00b6 13.) Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asserts that the State of New Mexico is the absolute owner of the groundwater, subject only to the rights of others under New Mexico law to seek to appropriate the water for a beneficial use, and to do so through an administrative process managed by the State Engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-15\">To define the legal interest of the State, we look first to the New Mexico Constitution: Art. XVI, Sec. 2 provides that unap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>propriated water in the State of New Mexico belongs to the public: \u201cThe unappropriated water of every natural stream, perennial or torrential, within the state of New Mexico, is hereby declared to belong to the public and to be subject to appropriation for beneficial use, in accordance with the laws of the state. Priority of appropriation shall give the better right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">The legislature echoes this language in <em>New Mexico Statutes Ann. </em>\u00a7 72-1-1 (Repl.1997): \u201cAll natural waters flowing in streams and watercourses, whether such be perennial, or torrential, within the limits of the state of New Mexico, belong to the public and are subject to appropriation for beneficial use..,\u201d In 1931, the Legislature explicitly extended this rule to much of New Mexico\u2019s groundwater: \u201cThe water of underground streams, channels, arte-sian basins, reservoirs or lakes, having readily ascertainable boundaries, are hereby declared to be public waters and to belong to the public and to be subject to appropriation for beneficial use.\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 72-12-1 (Cum.Supp.2002).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As the New Mexico Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-7\">All water within the state, whether above or beneath the surface of the ground belongs to the state, which authorizes its use, and there is no ownership in the corpus of the water but the use thereof may be acquired and the basis of such acquisition is beneficial use.... The state as owner of the water has the right to prescribe how it may be used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\"><em>State ex rel. Erickson v. McLean, </em>62 N.M. 264, 308 P.2d 983, 987 (1957) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">\u201cBeneficial use is the basis, the measure and the limit to the right to the use of the waters\u201d owned by the State, including its groundwater. N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 72-1-2 (Repl.1997).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-10\">Generally, individuals seeking to appropriate water ... are required to seek a permit from the state engineer. <em>Id. </em>Since 1931, the state engineer has declared individual groundwater basins throughout most of the state and has regulated appropriation of their waters. <em>See </em>NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 72-12-18; <em>see generally </em>Charles T. DuMars, <em>New Mexico </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number><em>Water Law: An Overview and Discussion of Current Issues, </em>22 Nat. Resources J. 1045 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\"><em>Elephant Butte Irr. Dist. v. Regents of New Mexico State University, </em>115 N.M. 229, 232-33, 849 P.2d 372, 375-76 (Ct.App.1993). <em>See also </em>N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 72-12-2 (Cum.Supp.2002) (procedure for application for use of underground water).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">The State serves as the watermaster, the gatekeeper, the overseer of the process of appropriation for beneficial use. As counsel suggests, it acts as the trustee: it owns the resource, but holds it not for itself, but for the use and benefit of the public. The commodity it \u201cowns,\u201d it cannot sell, lease or give away; it can only make it available for use by others.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. United States, </em>657 F.2d 1126, 1133 (10th Cir.1981) (\u201cThe state controls the use of water because it does not part with ownership; it only allows a usufructuary right to water.\u201d).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If the State wishes to obtain a right to appropriate water to a beneficial use, like everyone else it must make application to the State Engineer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1242-10\">Any person, association or corporation, public or private, <em>the State of New Mexico, </em>or the United States of America ... hereafter intending to acquire the right to the beneficial use of any waters, shall, before commencing any construction for such purposes, make an application to the state engineer for a permit to appropriate....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 72-5-1 (Repl.1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-12\">In this case, the Plaintiffs allege an injury to the State\u2019s interest as trustee, and not as an owner or holder of water rights, or as a beneficial user of water.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are not here as appropriators or users of water; nor are they here on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>other water rights holders or water users. The entity that once diverted groundwater from South Valley wells to beneficial use\u2014 the City of Albuquerque \u2014 is not here. The city\u2019s right to appropriate groundwater has been satisfied by changing the point of diversion to another well (the Burton #4 Well) that pumps groundwater from the same aquifer, and the city asserts no claim for damages in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">B. The State\u2019s Interest in the Middle Rio Grande Basin Aquifer</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">The Plaintiffs also claim an injury to the aquifer underlying the South Valley Site, separate and apart from the alleged injury to the groundwater located there: \u201cExperts ... agree that the aquifer, as a storage medium, is a natural resource that has economic value and can be injured through contamination by various hazardous substances.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">In contrast to the state\u2019s water resources, however, the New Mexico Constitution and statutes do not speak of permanent State ownership or trusteeship of <em>all </em>of the soils, clay, sand, gravel, rocks and minerals within the state \u2014 the geological constituents of which any aquifer is comprised. Indeed, there appears to be very little beyond the New Mexico Enabling Act\u2019s requirement that \u201cno sale or other disposal [of state land or its natural productions] shall be made for a consideration less than the [appraised true] value.\u201d ,Act of June 20, 1910, ch. 310, \u00a7 10, 36 Stat. 557, 564. The New Mexico Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[t]he State has a nondelegable duty to hold as trustee state lands and their products \u2014 as well as the proceeds from the sale of state lands and their products \u2014 for the development of state schools and other public institutions. <em>See </em>N.M. Const. art. XXIV, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>Bogle Farms, Inc. v. Baca, </em>122 N.M. 422, 429, 925 P.2d 1184, 1191 (1996). However this trust duty extends- to lands \u2014 particularly school trust lands \u2014 owned by the State that may ultimately be sold and conveyed to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">Whether the State has retained an ownership or trust interest in the minerals, including sand and gravel, underlying parcels of state land that have been sold and conveyed to others is a fact-specific determination under New Mexico law, and is not determined by a blanket state property law rule. <em>Id., </em>122 N.M. at 433, 925 P.2d at 1194 (\u201cwhether sand and gravel are \u2018minerals\u2019 as that term is used in general mineral reservations is to be answered on a case-by-case basis by examining the intent of the parties\u201d). Similarly, sand, gravel and other geological constituents of an aquifer may or may not have been reserved to the United States in lands- otherwise patented in fee simple to landowners in New Mexico. <em>See, e.g., Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 36, 103 S.Ct. 2218, 76 L.Ed.2d 400 (1983) (gravel is a \u201cmineral\u201d reserved to the United States in lands patented under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act); <em>but cf. Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co., Inc., </em>436 U.S. 604, 98 S.Ct. 2002, 56 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978) (\u201ccommon varieties\u201d of sand and gravel excluded from \u201cvaluable minerals\u201d under federal mining statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">In the extensive briefing on their damages claims, Plaintiffs cite no statutory or case authority that directly supports their assertion that the State of New Mexico <em>owns </em>the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer as a \u201cnatural resource\u201d in the same sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>that it \u201cowns\u201d the public\u2019s water. Nor have Plaintiffs cited to any cases in which damages have actually been awarded for injury to the aquifer itself.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Prior reported cases from other jurisdictions do not appear to distinguish between pollution of an aquifer and the contamination of the groundwater found in the aquifer, and the injury has been measured in terms of lost use of groundwater. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. Cudahy Co., </em>858 F.2d 1449, 1456-57(10th Cir.1988); <em>Artesian Water Company v. Government of New Castle County, </em>851 F.2d 643, 650 (3d Cir.1988). Similarly, unless the State claims some proprietary interest in the land or the aquifer\u2019s subsurface geologic materials as a landowner or title holder, then it would seem that chemical contamination of those geologic materials impacts the State\u2019s interest in groundwater only when it results in further groundwater contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Current landowners may have a claim under CERCLA and state tort law for soil pollution as against the parties responsible for that contamination, <em>e.g., Nielsen v. Sioux Tools, </em>Inc., 870 F.Supp. 435 (D.Conn.1994), but whether the State of New Mexico is a current landowner at South Valley has not been pleaded or proven in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Complaint makes no reference to the tract book in pleading the State\u2019s interest in the aquifer beneath the South Valley Site. In Defendant ACF Industries, Inc.\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 Nuisance Claims and Brief in Support of the Motion, filed July 10, 2002 (dkt. no. 606), the statement of \u201cUndisputed Material Facts\u201d avers that \u201c[t]he Site and lands adjacent to the Site are under private ownership and the State owns no land within the geographic proximity of the Site,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he State has no possessory interest in the soil near the Site or in any soil alleged to have been contaminated by ACF.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2 \u00b62.) Likewise, Chevron/Texaco set forth as undisputed the averments that \u201c[t]he Site and lands adjacent to the Site are under private ownership and Plaintiffs own no land within the geographic proximity of the Site,\u201d and that \u201cPlaintiffs have no possessory interest in ... any soil alleged to have been contaminated by Chevron, Texaco,\u201d and others. ( [Chevron/Texaco] Motion and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment on Public Nuisance Claims, filed July 10, 2002 (dkt. no. 646), at 3 \u00b6 2.)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to the Petroleum Pipeline Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary-Judgment on Public Nuisance Claims, filed September 3, 2002 (dkt. no. 735), argues that \u201c[ojwnership of the surface property is not relevant to the State\u2019s claims for nuisance; the State possesses], owns and holds in trust the water on and beneath the surface. It possesses] the State\u2019s natural resources. Such possessory interest is a matter of law, not an issue- of fact.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to ACF Industries\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on Public Nuisance Claims, filed August 30, 2002 (dkt. no. 721), does not controvert ACF\u2019s assertions concerning ownership at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">Absent proof of some possessory ownership interest in <em>land </em>at the South Valley Site \u2014 title to the surface or subsurface estate, a reservation of minerals, or the like \u2014 the State has no legally cognizable interest in the aquifer beneath the South Valley Site. Plaintiffs thus have no legal footing for their damages claim based upon injury to the aquifer itself.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">C. The Alleged Injury to the State\u2019s Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">Plaintiffs assert that the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site, and a portion of the larger aquifer in which it is found, have been injured through contamination by a list of organic chemicals, and that the ongoing remediation activities conducted pursuant to CERCLA and the State\u2019s own Hydrocarbon Remediation Agreements will neither restore the contaminated groundwater to its pristine, pre-contaminated \u201cbaseline\u201d condition, nor restore it to a condition suitable for use as drinking water: \u201cThe STATE OF NEW MEXICO has been prevented from allowing- its citizens the benefit of this natural resource. Further, even after .said remediation, the natural resource -will remain in an impaired state, unusable and/or nonpo-table, and unfit for human consumption.\u201d (Consolidated Complaint at 14-\u00b6 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">1. The Loss of Drinking Water Services</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">.Given Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of the loss of use of groundwater for drinking water purposes as their claimed injury to the State\u2019s interests in this case, the court\u2019s inquiry at pretrial was simply this: <em>under New Mexico law, what is the proper legal standard to apply in determining whether drinking water services have been lost?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">a. The NMWQCC Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">Plaintiffs point to New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission (NMWQCC) regulations found in Title 20, Chapter 6, Part 2 of the New Mexico Administrative Code, NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3101 <em>et seq. </em>and 20.6.2.4101. <em>et seq., </em>as being applicable to the question of use. NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.3101 <em>et seq. </em>governs \u201cdischarges onto or below the surface of the ground,\u201d with the goal of protecting the quality of New Mexico groundwater for future use while still allowing discharge of contaminants and \u201cdegradation of the ground water up to the limit of\u2019 the levels set by that Part\u2019s ground water standards in NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.3103. NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.3101(A), (B).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Both the New Mexico Water Quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>ty Act<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and these NMWQCC regulations promulgated under the Act seek to protect the quality of New Mexico\u2019s surface and groundwater primarily through the administration of a system of discharge permits. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 74-6-5 (discharge permits); \u00a7 74-6-5.1 (disclosure statements by permit applicants); \u00a7 74-6-10 (enforcement <em>&amp; </em>compliance orders); \u00a7\u00a7 74-6-10.1, 74-6-10.2 (civil &amp; criminal penalties). Like its federal counterpart, the New Mexico Water Quality Act seeks to maintain and improve water quality by addressing water pollution at its <em>source: </em>those who discharge contaminants into the State\u2019s waters.

The NMWQCC Regulations and Use of Groundwater</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.3101(C) expressly states: \u201cThe standards are not intended as maximum ranges and concentrations for use, and nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the use of waters containing higher ranges and concentrations.\u201d Likewise, NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.4101(C) expressly states: \u201cThe standards and requirements set forth in Section 20.6.2.4103 NMAC are not intended as maximum ranges and concentrations for use, and nothing herein contained shall be con.strued as limiting the use of waters containing higher .ranges and concentrations.\u201d The language of NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3101(C) and 20.6.2.4101(C) clearly expresses the intent that these regulations <em>not </em>be construed \u201cas limiting the use of waters containing higher ranges and concentrations\u201d of contaminants than the water quality standards set forth in those regulations. Based upon their plain meaning, these regulations do <em>not </em>govern whether a given volume of groundwater may actually be appropriated and <em>used </em>as drinking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">Generally, in the New Mexico courts, the \u201cplain language of a statute is the primary indicator of legislative intent.\u201d <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Anaya, </em>103 N.M. 72, 76, 703 P.2d 169, 173 (1985). The courts \u201c \u2018will not read into a statute or ordinance language which is not there, particularly if it makes sense as written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v.

These New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board (EIB) regulations were promulgated pursuant to provisions of New Mexico\u2019s Environment Improvement Act, N.M. Stat.

Reconciling the EIB &amp; NMWQCC Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attempts to read the NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3103 and 20.6.2.4103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>standards into these drinking water regulations, pointing to language providing that \u201c[cjompliance with this Part does not relieve a person from the obligation to comply with other applicable state and federal regulations.\u201d NMAC \u00a7 20.7.10.703.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Of course, no one would suggest that a public water system would be permitted to discharge contaminants into groundwater in excess of the standards set by NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.3103, or would be exempt as a responsible person from abatement proceedings under NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.4101 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But the obligation of a public water system to comply with NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.3101 <em>et seq. </em>as to <em>discharges </em>or NMAC \u00a7 20.6.2.4101 <em>et seq. </em>as to <em>abatement </em>does not transmute those regulations into standards governing the supply of water through public water systems for <em>use </em>as drinking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">NMAC \u00a7 20.7.10.300(A) declares that \u201c[n]o public water system shall supply drinking water to the public unless the system is operated and maintained in compliance with this Part,\u201d not with NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3103 and 20.6.2.4103. NMAC \u00a7 20.7.10.300(B)(2) empowers the Secretary of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) to require treatment of drinking water to meet the EPA\u2019s MCL standards, not the NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3103 and 20.6.2.4103 standards.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In contrast to its adoption of the EPA standards, Title 20, Chapter 7, Part 10, NMAC does not explicitly adopt .or incorporate the NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3103 and 20.6.2.4103 standards as compliance standards governing <em>use, </em>or indeed, make any reference to them at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">If in fact the State of New Mexico intended the NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.6.2.3103 and 20.6.2.4103 standards to govern the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of groundwater as drinking water, it would seem logical that the State would say so <em>somewhere </em>in the <em>New Mexico Administrative Code, </em>but to date it has not. This reflects the legislature\u2019s deliberate division of power and authority over water quality issues between different state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 74-1-1 (Repl.2000) creates the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board (EIB), making it \u201cresponsible for environmental management and consumer protection\u201d and empowering it to \u201cpromulgate rules and standards in the following areas: (1) food protection; (2) <em>water supply, </em>including ... rules authorizing imposition of administrative penalties for enforcement; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>...\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 74-l-8(A)(l), (2) (Repl.2000) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The New Mexico Water Quality Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 74-6-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Repl. 2000), on the other hand, created the New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission (NMWQCC), empowering it to \u201cadopt water quality standards for surface and ground waters of the state subject to the Water Quality Act,\u201d and to \u201cadopt, promulgate and publish regulations to <em>prevent or abate </em>water pollution in the state.... \u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 74-6-4(C), (D) (Cum. Supp.2002) (emphasis added). NMWQCC thus has been delegated the responsibility to address water pollution problems through its detailed system of discharge permits and through administrative abatement of existing pollution hazards, while the EIB remains vested with responsibility for day-to-day consumer protection and water supply and use issues.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">e. NMAC \u00a7 20.7.10.1 &amp; Loss of Drinking Water Services</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">The plain language of NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.7.10.1 <em>et seq. </em>states that public water systems may lawfully supply drinking water that meets the EPA\u2019s MCL standards as expressly adopted by the State of New Mexico. It follows that groundwater that meets those same standards has not been lost to use as drinking water. Water in which the contaminant level exceeds New Mexico\u2019s MCL standards, on the other hand, cannot be supplied as drinking water in compliance with NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.7.10.1 <em>et seq., </em>with a resulting loss of drinking water services as to that water.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-12\">Remembering that the San Jose well field supplied South Valley groundwater to a public water system serving the City of Albuquerque, it is this New Mexico drinking water standard, NMAC \u00a7\u00a7 20.7.10.100, that the court earlier concluded should be applied to determine whether there has been a loss of drinking water services involving the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">2. Plaintiffs\u2019 Theory of Injury Revisited</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-14\">According to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, \u201cthe State of New Mexico adamantly believes that this Court is in error in defining \u2018injury\u2019 in such a limited and arbitrary fashion.\u201d (Plaintiffs Further Response to General Electric Company\u2019s Supplemental Brief in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs Damage Claims,\u201d filed December 29, 2003 (dkt. no. 1043), at 10.) Yet the \u201cinjury\u201d alleged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>this case \u2014 as defined by <em>Plaintiffs </em>\u2014 is the loss of drinking water services due to chemical contamination. How else should that injury be measured?</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Arguing that a common law claim for damages \u201cis not hand-cuffed to only one standard,\u201d Plaintiffs contend that \u201cstandards promulgated by an administrative agency do not dictate, <em>as a matter of law, </em>whether a cause of action exists or the nature and extent of the injury.\u201d (Plaintiffs Reply to the Court\u2019s Ruling on \u201cInjury\u201d and Request for Reconsideration or Certification of the Question to the New Mexico Supreme Court, filed January 5, 2004 (dkt. no. 1049), at 6, 9 (emphasis in original).) Instead, Plaintiffs now assert, the groundwater \u201cmust still be considered \u2018injured\u2019 unless and until it is restored to its pre-polluted condition and fully complies with <em>ALL </em>human health standards which are applicable to water intended for public consumption.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 4 (emphasis in original).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">In effect, then, Plaintiffs now argue <em>two </em>different theories of injury: (1) that \u201c[t]he standard for drinking water quality for the groundwater involved in this lawsuit is the more stringent NMWQCC health-based toxic pollutant standard\u201d;<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and (2) that \u201cthe groundwater and aquifer will remain injured unless and until it is restored to its pre-contaminated condition.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> These two assertions, often made together,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> are not wholly congruent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">In this case, it may well be that the State of New Mexico has suffered an <em>injury </em>to its interest in the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site, notwithstanding the fact that much of the groundwater meets the New Mexico drinking water standards, but it may be that the injury is <em>not </em>the total and permanent loss of drinking water services that Plaintiffs now assert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">To date, however, Plaintiffs have proffered no significant probative evidence of any <em>diminution in value </em>of the groundwater, measured by the difference between its current condition and its formerly pristine state, apart from the alleged loss of drinking water services. No expert witness has testified as to the economic value of water that may prove to be drinkable, but still not pristine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-13\">Plaintiffs may be hoping to argue to a jury that <em>any </em>diminishment of groundwater quality has resulted in the permanent and total loss of the value of the affected volume of groundwater.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Indeed, Plaintiffs\u2019 experts have formulated opinions on damages based upon the assumption that South Valley groundwater has been permanently lost to <em>all </em>beneficial uses, including use as drinking water.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>Under New Mexico law, however, water need not be pristine to be drinkable, and use for drinking water purposes depends upon whether applicable water quality standards .are met, not whether the water yet remains in its primordial state, untouched by any of the chemical remnants of the modern age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">As this court explained a year ago, Plaintiffs\u2019 own characterization of their alleged injury selects the legal standard to be applied to measure the existence and extent of that injury. Drinkability does not equate with pristine purity under New Mexico law,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and the court remains convinced that a loss of drinking water services must be measured by applying New Mexico drinking water standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">V. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 THEORY OF DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Plaintiffs assert that the State has been deprived of the opportunity to make contaminant-free water available to others, to offer the opportunity for others to appropriate water in pristine condition, and to put it to its \u201chighest and best use\u201d as drinking water. They allege that an identifiable, quantifiable volume of groundwater has been lost to use as drinking water, and therefore has been permanently lost to any beneficial use. They claim that the State has lost both the economic value that the affected water would have were it otherwise to be extracted from the ground and put to beneficial use, and the <em>in situ </em>value of that water as it yet remains in the ground.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> They insist that the State should be compensated in money damages for the total value of the volume of water in question, measured by its replacement cost based upon purchase .or lease of existing water rights at market value, and the value of the \u201closs of the aquifer apart from market value of the quantity of water,\u201d <em>State of Utah v. Kennecott Corp., </em>801 F.Supp. 553, 566-67 (D.Utah 1992), ostensibly measured by the cost of replacing it through construction and maintenance of a large surface reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 groundwater damages theory depends upon three critical assumptions: (1) that the volume of water affected by the contamination could otherwise be made available for appropriation from the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer, but for the contamination; (2) that the volume of water has been lost to all beneficial uses; and (3) that the loss of use is permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-11\">In responding to the Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, and in proffers of proof made during the course of our extended Pretrial Conference and Rule 702 evidentiary hearing, the Plaintiffs have failed to come forward with significant probative evidence validating these assumptions, or showing that they raise a genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>issue of material fact requiring a trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">A. Loss of \u201cExtractive Services\u201d &amp; Loss of Value of <em>in situ </em>Groundwater</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">1. Alleged Loss of \u201cExtractive Services\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argue that it is undisputed that \u201ca volume of groundwater was taken out of service in 1980\u201d and \u201chas remained out of service up to the present date, and will continue to remain out of service for the foreseeable future.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> They point to a loss of services that \u201c \u2018began in the fall of 1980 with the shut-down of San Jose 6,\u2019 \u201d and, at times, equate the San Jose well field\u2019s \u201closs of capacity to provide a volume of water to the public on and after the closure of municipal well S J-6\u201d with the continuing loss of groundwater services they now assert.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Defendants respond that the loss of pumping capacity at the San Jose 6 Well does not equate with a loss of extractive groundwater services, unless the Plaintiffs can show that the total volume of groundwater that may safely be extracted from the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer without depletion, violation of the Rio Grande Compact, or other adverse effects \u2014 the aquifer\u2019s \u201csafe yield\u201d \u2014 has actually been reduced.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The State of New Mexico has lost nothing in terms of <em>use, </em>Defendants maintain, if the State may make the same total quantity of groundwater available from the same aquifer for use by appropriators, regardless of whether a particular volume of water underlying South Valley may now be extracted or not. A change in the point of diversion, by itself, is not a loss of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">The Defendants\u2019 assertion that the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer was and is already fully appropriated, leaving the State unable to make additional water available for appropriation, appears to be correct, as confirmed by the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-14\">THE COURT: Have all of the water resources in the South Valley been fully appropriated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-15\">MR. LEWIS: I believe they are fully appropriated, yes....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">(Transcript, of Hearing, dated January 17, 2003, at 1544:12-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-17\">Moreover, as noted above, in the <em>Silvery Minnow </em>litigation,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> the Plaintiffs apparently have taken the position that \u201c \u2018the waters of the Rio Grande basin have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>fully appropriated and no additional water is available for any purpose.\u2019 \u201d (Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order, received July 29, 2003, at LI-23 (quoting Response of State of New Mexico to Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 10, <em>Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Martinez, </em>Civil No. 99-1320-JP (D.N.M. filed July 7, 2000)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Plaintiffs do not assert that the State of New Mexico has lost the use of water to which it holds a water right. Nor have Plaintiffs shown that any other water rights holder has lost the use of a specific volume of water from the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer to which he or she would otherwise be entitled.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Nor, for that matter, have Plaintiffs shown that applications for extraction of any significant volume of South Valley groundwater have actually been made and denied <em>because of the contamination issue</em><footnotemark><em>59</em></footnotemark><em>- </em>\u2014 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>that any such applications are currently pending. To this extent, at least, Plaintiffs\u2019 loss of \u201cextractive services\u201d claim may simply be premature, or even speculative.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">The Defendants submit that any current restrictions imposed by the State Engineer on further appropriations from the Middle Rio Grande Basin are driven by other considerations involving the State\u2019s obligations under the Rio Grande Compact and the corresponding need to maintain stream flows in the Rio Grande River, and that those restrictions effectively limit extractive services to appropriation under existing water rights.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Plaintiffs respond that \u201c[t]he State Engineer\u2019s Office does not have responsibility for environmental compliance or the expertise to evaluate health and safety issues relating to remediation at the Site,\u201d but that the Office \u201cis prepared to further restrict access to groundwater in South Valley based on the additional information and uncertainties affecting the Site.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">If because of the contamination at South Valley, the State Engineer has in fact restricted further <em>appropriation </em>from the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer (a restriction on <em>quantity </em>rather than the depth and design of new wells), nothing that Plaintiffs point to in this record has yet made that restriction explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">Absent significant probative evidence of an actual loss of extractive services involving a volume of unappropriated groundwater that the State could otherwise have made available for appropriation from the aquifer\u2019s safe yield,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim for damages resulting from such a loss must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">2. Alleged Loss of Value of <em>in situ </em>Groundwater</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">Plaintiffs insist that the State has also lost the <em>in situ </em>value of the groundwater beneath South Valley as \u201cstock,\u201d or \u201cdrought reserve,\u201d even if the water is not currently available for extraction by appropriators for reasons other than the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>tamination: \u201cIn order to fully compensate the State of New Mexico for the groundwater lost due to the Defendants\u2019 operations, it is appropriate to analyze that loss in terms of the loss of annual safe yield and the loss of the \u2018stock- of groundwater as a drought reserve.\u201d (Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order, received July 29, 2003, at LI-45; <em>see id. </em>at LI-28 (\u201c \u2018As distinct from the annual flow of sustained yield, the highest value of the remaining stock of groundwater is as insurance against potential future extended drought conditions, i.e., its in situ services.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Dr. Ted Tomasi)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Defendants respond that the ongoing remediation activities are eliminating the chemical contamination problem, and that even if the State or its water users needed to draw upon additional groundwater in times of severe drought, they could do so at South Valley by applying wellhead treatment using the same technology that has proven successful in performing the ongoing remediation work at the South Valley Site.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-8\">3. Different Labels, Same Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">The \u201cdiminution of value\u201d of <em>in situ </em>groundwater claimed by the Plaintiffs is not- a discrete injury, different in kind from the claimed loss of \u201cextractive services.\u201d To the contrary, it reflects <em>the same loss of drinking water services involving the same water </em>projected into the future, but without any limitation by the concept of the aquifer\u2019s \u201csafe yield.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Use of South Valley groundwater as \u201cdrought reserve\u201d necessarily anticipates that at some point, the State would allow the aquifer to be \u201cmined,\u201d that is, the State in times of dire need would afford water users the benefit of \u201cextractive services\u201d beyond the limits of \u201csafe yield\u201d by allowing pumping that may far exceed the capacity of the aquifer to recharge itself.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed loss of value of <em>in situ </em>groundwater simply projects into the future the claimed loss of use of \u201ca volume of groundwater [that] was taken out of service in 1980 ... has remained out of service ... and will continue to remain out of service for the foreseeable future.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>Damages for the \u201cdiminution in value\u201d of the State\u2019s <em>in situ </em>groundwater and damages for the value of lost \u201cextractive services\u201d are simply two slices of the same pie.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Where, as here, the \u201cdiminution in value\u201d is measured <em>by </em>the \u201closs of extractive services,\u201d <em>viz., </em>the loss of use of groundwater as drinking water in the past, present and as a \u201cdrought reserve\u201d for the future, the two become indistinguishable, and whether extracted groundwater is characterized \u201cas a depletable stock or renewable flow\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> becomes a question of when and \u201chow much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Distilled to its very essence, Plaintiffs\u2019 damages theory seeks an award of damages measured by <em>loss of use </em>of a volume of <em>in situ </em>South Valley groundwater as drinking water, past present and future, treated as a total and permanent loss of the resource \u2014 regardless of the limits of the aquifer\u2019s safe yield, or other limitations on further appropriation from the Middle Rio Grande Basin having nothing to do with contamination at South Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">B. Loss of Drinking Water Services vs. Total Loss of All Beneficial Uses</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">Plaintiffs assume that if the volume of groundwater affected by contamination at South Valley cannot be extracted and used \u201cas is\u201d for drinking water purposes, it likewise cannot be extracted and put to any beneficial use and cannot be stored as a \u201cdrought reserve.\u201d Recalling that the most pressing concern arising out of the closure of the San Jose 6 Well was the loss of pumping and storage capacity to serve <em>fire protection </em>purposes at South Valley, the Plaintiffs\u2019 singular focus on drinking water services alone may miss the mark. Plaintiffs have failed to come forward with significant probative evidence that furnishes a factual footing for their sweeping assertion that regardless of the effect of the ongoing remediation activities and the availability of wellhead treatment technology, the groundwater beneath South Valley cannot be put to <em>any </em>beneficial use, agricultural, industrial, fire protection, or otherwise, either now or in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 damages experts have likewise <em>assumed </em>the loss of South Valley groundwater for all beneficial uses in applying loss of use/market value replacement cost analyses, apparently without examining the factual footing for that proposition in any detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">Damages analysis based on \u201cmarket value\u201d replacement cost necessarily assumes that there is a complete loss of the resource that has been injured, <em>see State of Utah v.

(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">In attempting to meet their burden under Rule 56(e), Plaintiffs point first to the Declaration of Dr. Dennis E. Williams, dated August 30, 2002. <em>(Id. </em>at Exh. 1.) In the portion of his Declaration cited by the Plaintiffs, Dr. Williams observes that based upon his groundwater flow and transport modeling of the contaminant plumes, \u201cthe GE pump and treat system does not remediate contaminants outside the capture radius of its extraction wells, which leaves a significant amount of the total contaminant plume unremediated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Exh. 1 at 7 \u00b6 20.) \u201cConsequently,\u201d Dr. Williams continues, \u201cthe contaminants will persist in the groundwater for at least two hundred years, or even longer, after the remediation efforts, have ceased in year 2020.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">Of course, Dr. Williams\u2019 conclusion <em>assumes </em>that nothing will be done about the contamination at South Valley beyond the existing EPA-ordered remediation in the Plant 83/General Electric Operating Units. Nothing in Dr. Williams\u2019 Declaration demonstrates that the predicted contamination \u201coutside the capture radius of its extraction wells\u201d could not be reduced or eliminated through expanded or additional remediation and treatment. Dr. Williams avers that his projected plume volumes are not currently being treated (in part at least), <em>not </em>that the existing or projected contaminant plumes mapped by his models <em>cannot </em>be treated or minimized using the available technology and economic resources.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Likewise, Dr. Williams\u2019 testimony offered at the Rule 702 evidentiary hearing reiterated and elaborated upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>plume modeling, all of which assumes that no additional remedial action will occur at the Site during the lifetime of the existing Plant 83/General Electric system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">However well-suited Dr. Williams\u2019 analysis might be to an evaluation or critique of the merits of EPA\u2019s ongoing remediation in the Plant 83/General Electric Operable Units, his work and his proffered opinions simply do not address the question whether the larger contaminant plumes that he projects are permanent\u2014 irremediable \u2014 or whether expanded or additional remedial action would reduce or minimize the contamination problem he attempts to describe through his models and maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">The Declaration of Dr. Daniel Teitel-baum, dated August 14, 2002, addresses groundwater contamination in terms of toxicology, risk management and public policy considerations \u2014 particularly those bearing upon.the EPA\u2019s MCL and MGLG standard-setting processes involving levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) in drinking water. The excerpt relied upon by Plaintiffs \u2014 the only portion of the document that speaks of South Valley groundwater\u2014 applauds the State of New Mexico and the City of Albuquerque for having \u201cacted appropriately and in accord with the precautionary principle in its decision to abandon the San Jose wash water supply.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>Exh. 30, at 15 \u00b6 14.) Dr. Teitelbaum opines that because there is insufficient information concerning the risks associated with TCE exposure, \u201cit is appropriate for the State of New Mexico to use the [Maximum Contaminant Level Goal] of zero for TCE in its calculation\u201d of risk, and given that assumption, <em>\u201cthe most prudent choice is </em>use the MCLG as the guiding value and <em>to abandon the contaminated water resource and find new potable water. \u201d (Id., </em>Exh. 30, at 16 \u00b6 15 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">One parses the Teitelbaum Declaration in vain, searching for specific facts supporting Plaintiffs\u2019 sweeping and oft-repeated assertion that the groundwater contamination at South Valley is permanent, or that this resource has been \u201crendered useless for all time.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Dr. Teitelbaum insists that there are risks inherent in exposure to TCE, but nothing in this extended dissertation on \u201cthe philosophical basis for public health policy and its scientific basis,\u201d <em>(id., </em>Exh. 30, at 7 \u00b6 1), addresses the efficacy of existing remediation technology in minimizing or eliminating risk of exposure to TCE . or other chemicals found in drinking water. Dr. Teitel-baum opines that his precautionary principle \u201crequired action like that taken by the State of New Mexico and the City of Albuquerque to seek out new water supplies and to abandon those contaminated water supplies in order to protect the public health,\u201d <em>(id., </em>Exh. 30, at 14 \u00b6 13), but does not expressly aver that <em>abandonment </em>was and is the only risk-averse remedial option available at the South Valley Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">Indeed, recalling the history of the South Valley Site, <em>the State of New Mexico did not abandon the groundwater resource at South Valley. </em>To the contrary, as recounted above, the State of New Mexico sought the assistance of the EPA in initiating cleanup actions within two years of CERCLA\u2019s enactment into law; the State conducted its own site investigation and entered into the Hydrocarbon Remediation</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>Agreements with Chevron, Texaco and other petroleum distributors \u2014 agreements that required affirmative remediation of the groundwater contamination through extraction, treatment and reinjection systems similar to the EPA remedy; the State also participated in the formulation of similar remedial action involving contamination traceable to the nearby Univar Edmunds Street facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">Only in this proceeding have the Plaintiffs taken the position that the State\u2019s remediation efforts at South Valley over the preceding quarter-century are of no moment, and that in effect, the State of New Mexico should be permitted to abandon the groundwater beneath the South Valley Site in favor of a lucrative damages award to be extracted from the defendants \u2014 all of whom, the Court notes, continue to conduct remediation activities at South Valley that have been expressly approved or required by the State of New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Whether an injury is \u201cpermanent\u201d or \u201ctemporary\u201d is necessarily a fact-driven determination, context-dependent, and inescapably empirical, based upon the nature and circumstances of the particular injury itself. Plaintiffs cannot render a natural resource injury <em>permanent </em>merely by electing to do nothing about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">As Dr. Teitelbaum suggests, abandonment of a resource is a policy <em>choice, </em>but it is not an inevitable outcome.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> His \u201cprecautionary principle\u201d appears to counsel as strongly in favor of effective remediation as it does abandonment: \u201cThe precautionary principle ... requires that in the light of scientific uncertainty, when credible evidence is put forth that a risk exists, <em>action should be taken to minimize that risk or eliminate it </em>even though absolute proof has not been obtained which quantifies the risk.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>Exh. 30, at 14 \u00b6 13 (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">If, as the Defendants assert, the contamination of South Valley groundwater is <em>temporary, i.e., </em>susceptible to effective and efficient remediation, it simply makes no sense to treat the resource as though it is permanently lost and in need of total replacement. In <em>State of Utah v. Kennecott Corp., </em>Judge Greene noted one expert\u2019s observation that \u201canalysis of the natural resources damage claim\u201d was \u201c\u2018inextricably tied to the remediation issue\u2019\u201d and rejected the parties\u2019 proposed consent decree because \u201cthe State ... failed to demonstrate ... that restoration and plume remediation is not feasible in justification of the State\u2019s determination not to require such,\u201d thus failing to show \u201cthat the remedial purposes CERCLA was intended to achieve cannot be achieved.\u201d 801 F.Supp. at 568, 569. Where use of the injured resource may be restored, the cost of restoration proves to be the most logically compelling measure of damages resulting from the injury, at least where that cost bears some reasonable relationship to the economic value of the restored resource use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-11\">To date, however, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and their damages experts have resisted the measurement of the State\u2019s damages by the cost of restoration of the resource, preferring instead to press their \u201cmarket value\u201d replacement cost theory as the proper measure of damages.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>where \u2014 as here- \u2014 the Plaintiffs \u25a0 have not demonstrated through a proffer of significant probative evidence that the claimed loss of beneficial use is permanent and use cannot be restored through cost-effective remediation, the \u201cmarket value\u201d replacement cost approach may grossly overstate the value of the injury to the State\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">D. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d concerning their claim that the volume of groundwater beneath the South Valley Site contaminated in excess of drinking water standards could otherwise be extracted and made available for appropriation from the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer, but' for the contamination. Treating the groundwater beneath South Valley as part of the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer, Plaintiffs have thus shown no quantified loss of \u201cextractive services\u201d at South Valley resulting from the contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">What remains, then, is Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of injury to the <em>in situ </em>value of South Valley groundwater as \u201cstock\u201d or \u201cdrought reserve.\u201d Plaintiffs likewise have failed to raise a triable issue concerning whether the volume of water they contend has been impacted by the contamination (toxic plumes plus the much larger \u201cbuffer zone\u201d) has been lost to <em>all </em>beneficial uses, or whether the alleged loss of use of that water is <em>permanent, </em>and incapable of further remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">The questions remaining for trial in this case bear upon the nature, location and extent of the contamination that does exist, the volume of <em>in situ </em>groundwater, if any, that has been rendered unavailable for use as drinking water (e.gas drought reserve) because of that chemical contamination, and the extent of the appropriate judicial remedy for actual injury to the State\u2019s legally protected interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">VI. THE SCOPE AND LIMITS OF PLAINTIFFS\u2019 STATE -LAW CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-15\">At this point, Plaintiffs have dismissed all of their claims pursuant to CERCLA, and are pursuing only their remaining state law causes of action: (1) common-law trespass; (2) common-law public nuisance; (3) statutory public nuisance, N.M. Stat.

The State\u2019s Affected Interests</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">As described in some detail above, Plaintiffs allege injury to the State\u2019s unique trust interest in the public waters of New Mexico as established by the New Mexico Constitution and statutes. Plaintiffs are not here as water rights holders, or as water users, or as landowners,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> or on behalf of any persons who claim to have suffered any injury caused by the chemical contamination of groundwater at South Valley. Whatever remedy Plaintiffs may be entitled to must be tailored to redress specific injury to the State\u2019s unique interest, <em>viz., </em>its opportunity to make water available for appropriation by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-7\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Current Pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-8\">As set forth in their Consolidated Complaint, Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are pleaded at the periphery of their CERC-LA claims, now dismissed: Plaintiffs seek to \u201crecover monetary damages for injuries incurred by the STATE OF NEW MEXICO\u201d to \u201cthe extent that the damages alleged herein are either not available under Section 9607(f) of the CERCLA and/or to the extent that CERCLA does not provide adequate remedies to fully compensate the STATE OF NEW MEXICO for Defendants\u2019 pollution and contamination\u201d at the South Valley Site. (Consolidated Complaint at 3 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5 (emphasis in original).)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-15\">In other words, the Complaint also seeks to recover damages to the extent that damages suffered by the STATE OF NEW MEXICO are not provided for and/or are otherwise not recoverable pursuant to CERCLA, such as those damages resulting from releases that have occurred wholly before December 11, 1980, those damages resulting from releases of substances exempted under the CERCLA petroleum exclusion, and those damages incurred in excess of the damage limitation as provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-16\"><em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 4.) That Plaintiffs seek only monetary damages is spelled out in plain terms: \u201cthis Complaint is not intended to and does not seek to impose any remediation or clean up requirements directed by any state or federal environmental agency, nor does this Complaint seek to collaterally attack any ongoing or past regulatory compliance activities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>It may be that Plaintiffs pleaded their state law claims in this fashion so as to avoid any double recovery of damages prohibited by CERCLA.

Any recovery under CERCLA must be set off against any recovery on claims under other federal or state law theories, and any CERCLA recovery must likewise be reduced by amounts received through award or settlement of other federal or state law claims. As pleaded, Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims are framed to avoid such a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">Plaintiffs have since dismissed their CERCLA claims in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">Plaintiffs may be assuming that their remaining state law claims have automatically expanded in scope to fill the space left in the Consolidated Complaint by the dismissal of the CERCLA claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony, briefing and argument concerning damages has not explicitly addressed damages in terms of relief not otherwise available to the State under CERCLA. Nevertheless, the Consolidated Complaint remains the definitive statement of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this action, as borne out most recently by the parties\u2019 stipulation that with' the reinsertion of Chevron U.S.A. as a defendant, \u201cthe Consolidated Complaint is the current operative complaint.\u201d (Stipulation and Order Re: Chevron U.S.A., Inc., filed March 16, 2004 (dkt. no. 1065).)<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">The Consolidated Complaint says what it says, and the relief sought in that pleading encompasses only those pecuniary damages that could be awarded to the State of New Mexico apart from the natural resource damages and response costs that would have been recoverable under CERCLA,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> including injuries such as contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons that CERCLA expressly cannot reach. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(14) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">C.

City and County of Den</em>ver, 100 F.3d 1509, 1511 (10th Cir.1996) (citations' omitted). ' However, CERCLA does not and was not intended to completely pre-empt the field of compensation and recovery for injury to natural resources resulting from pollution by hazardous substances. To the contrary, the language of CERCLA explicitly acknowledges the continuing existence of state law remedies for such injuries and does not super-cede them by occupying the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>a. The CERCLA Savings Clauses</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Section 114(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9614(a) (2000), provides that \u201c[njothing in this chapter shall be construed or interpreted as preempting any State from imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to the release of hazardous substances within such State.\u201d Section 302 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9652(d) (2000), further provides that \u201c[njothing in this chapter shall affect or modify in any way the obligations or liabilities of any person under other Federal or State law, including common law, with respect to the releases of hazardous substances or other pollutants . or contaminants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">CERCLA expressly preserves a variety of claims, including claims for contribution, indemnity, and subrogation.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> As the court of appeals has observed, \u201cCongress clearly expressed its intent that CERCLA should work in conjunction with other federal and state hazardous waste laws in order to solve this country\u2019s hazardous waste cleanup problem.\u201d <em>United States v. State of Colorado, </em>990 F.2d at 1575.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">Under CERCLA, federal and state hazardous waste remediation efforts may proceed side by side. In the <em>State of Colorado </em>case, for example, the Tenth Circuit held that where \u201ca state has RCRA authority over a hazardous waste site, \u00a7\u00a7 9614(a) and 9652(d) expressly preserve the state\u2019s exercise of that authority regardless of whether a CERCLA response action is underway.\u201d 990 F.2d at 1581 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">b. Conflict Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">Notwithstanding its savings clauses, CERCLA does preempt the application of state or local law to hazardous waste contamination where the state or local law is in actual conflict with CERC-LA or with a remedial order issued by the EPA. In <em>United States v. City and County of Denver, </em>the Tenth Circuit held that a municipal zoning ordinance, prohibiting maintenance of hazardous waste in an area zoned for industrial use conflicted with an EPA remedial order that required a permanent on-site remedy, <em>viz., </em>the on-site solidification of radioactive soil. As the court of appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-12\">The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, art. VI, cl. 2, invalidates state laws that \u201cinterfere with, or are contrary to the laws of [CJongress, made in pursuance of the [CJonstitution.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Pub. Intervenor v. Mortier, </em>501 U.S. 597, 604...[, 111 S.Ct. 2476; 115 L.Ed.2d 532] (1991) (quoting <em>Gibbons v.

Denver concedes that it is impossible for Shattuck to comply with both Denver\u2019s zoning ordinance and the EPA\u2019s remedial order. The zoning ordinance also stands as an obstacle to the objectives of CERCLA, whose purpose is to effect the expeditious and permanent cleanup of hazardous waste sites, and to allow the EPA the flexibility needed to address site-specific problems.

Defendants argue that state tort damages hinder CERCLA\u2019s operation by extracting large sums of money from potentially responsible parties, generating a windfall for the State\u2019s general fund that may never be applied to clean up the hazardous waste and restore the groundwater resource to use. The injury persists and the compensation for the injury is spent elsewhere, defeating the primary objective of CERCLA \u2014 the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous waste sites.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> To avoid this result, the Defendants submit, Plaintiffs\u2019 state tort claims must be \u201cpreempted to the extent they are based on any injury for which CERCLA provides a remedy.\u201d (General Electric Company\u2019s Motion and Supporting Memorandum for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 State Law Claims, filed January 8, 2002 (dkt. no. 432), at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">To the extent that Plaintiffs contend that the on-going remedial action ordered and overseen by the EPA at South Valley is insufficient to clean up the existing chemical contamination, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims also assail \u201cthe methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach this goal,\u201d <em>International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, </em>479 U.S. 481, 494, 107 S.Ct. 805, 93 L.Ed.2d 883 (1987), and would likewise be barred under conflict preemption principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">Plaintiffs respond that their state law claims are complementary to CERCLA remedies and are preserved by CERCLA\u2019s savings clauses. They assert that they are entitled to the greatest amount recoverable under any single pleaded theory that is supported by the evidence, and may seek relief under all of the state statutory and common law claims, whether relief may be available under CERCLA or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">If the Plaintiffs now seek damages <em>only </em>for those <em>injuries </em>to State interests at South Valley beyond the reach of CERCLA, <em>e.g., </em>pollution by release of petroleum products alone,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> or for injuries beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>intended scope of EPA\u2019s prescribed remedial action,<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> then there need be no conflict between the state remedies and the-purposes and objectives of CERCLA, even in the context of ongoing CERCLA remediation at South Valley. If, on the other hand, Plaintiffs now seek to use state tort claims to recover natural resource damages for the permanent loss of use of the groundwater at South Valley regardless of the ongoing remediation, or to recover additional damages from parties complying with an EPA order on the theory that the EPA\u2019s chosen remedy is somehow inadequate, a collision in this case between state tort damages remedies and the CERCLA statutory and regulatory scheme appears inevitable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-5\">Regardless of the type of tort suit brought by plaintiffs, the defendant is required by federal law ... to comply with the methodology provided in the ROD. Allowance of the suit for monetary damages [for EPA\u2019s inadequate remedy selection] would mean that the PRP could then be held liable for failing to use methods that it was prevented by law from using. Imposing a damage claim on the defendant would be a direct usurpation of the EPA\u2019s statutory authority to determine which remedies are adequate to protect human health and would conflict with a judicially enforceable order. Simply put, \u201ccommon-law damages actions are preempted to the same extent as common-law injunctive suits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUiA\">Gregory M.

The Hydrocarbon Remediation Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">As outlined aboye, the State of New Mexico in 1994 and 1995 entered into several Hydrocarbon Remediation Agreements (HRAs) with Chevron, Texaco, and other petroleum handlers and distributors located on or near the South Valley Site, requiring those parties to perform specified work to clean up groundwater contamination resulting from discharges of petroleum products into the soil and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>groundwater beneath the South Valley Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Taking the Chevron HRA as an example, in consideration for Chevron\u2019s assent to the HRAs, the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) agreed not to pursue any civil or administrative action against Chevron arising out of releases of the listed \u201cPetroleum Product Constituents\u201d at the South Valley Site, with several specific exceptions (enforcement of the HRA, future violations of law, emergency response actions), and a general limitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvDx\">NMED\u2019s release is made only for those actions that might be brought by NMED, and does not release Chevron from or otherwise limit the authority of any other state agency; including the Office of the Natural Resources Trustee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcR\">(Chevron HRA at \u00b6 54.)<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">The Chevron HRA did not require Chevron to \u201ctreat, remove, remediate, arrange for the disposal of or otherwise handle \u2018hazardous substances\u2019 as that term is defined in\u201d CERCLA \u00a7 9601(14).

If the remedy available to Plaintiffs under their common-law and statutory public nuisance claims is <em>abatement, </em>the abatement of groundwater pollution is clearly among those \u201cactions that might be brought by NMED\u201d in a \u201ccivil or administrative action against\u201d Chevron/Texaco, (Chevron HRA at \u00b6 54), and thus may come squarely within the terms of the NMED release language. <em>Cf. State ex rel. Norvell v. Arizona Public Service Co., </em>85 N.M. 165, 510 P.2d 98 (1973), discussed <em>infra. </em>NMED expressly invoked its jurisdiction pursuant to, <em>inter alia, </em>the New Mexico law of statutory and common-law public nuisance in making the HRAs themselves. <em>(See </em>Chevron HRA at \u00b68; Texaco HRA at \u00b6 7 (citing N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 30-8-1, 30-8-2, 30-8-8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">Under the terms of the HRAs, then, equitable relief seeking abatement of groundwater contamination within the scope of the HRAs may not be available to Plaintiffs in this action at least as against Chevron/Texaco, and the same may be true of damages measured in terms of the cost of abatement or restoration, at least within the scope of the existing HRA remedial actions.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">3. <em>Schwartzman, </em>Settlement and Release of the State\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">Defendants ACF Industries, Chevron and Texaco contend that they were already sued in the name of the State of New Mexico pursuant to the New Mexico public nuisance statute for injuries to public rights resulting from the contamination of groundwater at South Valley, as well as theories of trespass and negligence.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> That action was settled on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>9, 1994, pursuant to which, Defendants contend, the State\u2019s statutory public nuisance claims at South Valley were forever released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">Plaintiffs respond that \u201c[t]he principles of <em>res judicata </em>have no application here. There has been no previous natural resources damage litigation under either state law or CERCLA resulting from defendants\u2019 conduct in this case.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to the Petroleum Pipeline Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on Public Nuisance Claims, filed September 3, 2002 (dkt. no. 735), at 10; Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to ACF Industries\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on Public Nuisance Claims, filed August 30, 2002 (dkt. no. 721), at 3-4 (same).)<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">The impact of the prior public nuisance settlement may be a question of the effect of privity between the State and a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d relator in a statutory public nuisance action, and may raise <em>res judicata </em>principles at least to that extent. If the State is bound by the terms of its relator\u2019s settlement agreements with tort-feasors, then the impact of prior settlements on the State\u2019s presently asserted nuisance claims depends upon the substantive scope of the injuries and conduct encompassed by the prior settlements, which is largely a fact-driven question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">4. Avoidable Consequences &amp; Plaintiffs\u2019 Duty to Mitigate Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">Another fundamental principle of New Mexico law that may limit the damages recoverable by Plaintiffs and indeed, may counsel in favor of measuring the Plaintiffs\u2019 damages by the cost of restoration is the Plaintiffs\u2019 legal duty to mitigate tort damages. \u201cUnder the doctrine of \u2018avoidable consequences\u2019 the injured person has the duty to use reasonable diligence to mitigate damages incurred either from tort or breach of contract.\u201d <em>Acme Cigarette Services, Inc. v.

The Plaintiffs\u2019 approach presupposes that the injury .to the groundwater resource beneath the South Valley Site is total and permanent, and that a large volume of groundwater has been forever lost to beneficial use by the people of New Mexico. Plaintiffs seek an award of the cash replacement value of the affected water and the aquifer in which the water is stored.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">If the Plaintiffs\u2019 premise proves to be demonstrably <em>wrong, </em>and some, most or all of the affected South Valley groundwater may actually be used, or may be restored to use as drinking water or put to other beneficial use, then the State of New Mexico \u2014 like any state tort plaintiff \u2014 may <em>not </em>recover monetary damages for present and future valu\u00e9 of the use of groundwater that in fact has not been or need not be lost.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-7\">D.

In <em>Selma Pressure Treating, </em>a California intermediate court of appeals ruled that at the pleadings stage, at least, the State could maintain a statutory public nuisance action for damages and equitable relief resulting from releases of hazardous waste that had contaminated groundwater held by the State in trust for the public. Under the California statute, \u201cwhen the state in its representative capacity prosecutes a cause of action for a public nuisance, it is confined to seeking an abatement of the public nuisance; money damages are not available to the state.\u201d <em>Id., </em>221 Cal.

The lower court had dismissed cross-claims for indemnity among the respondents on the ground that indemnity claims would not arise where the respondents could neither be held liable in damages nor required to abate the nuisance.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal, ruling that the statute limits the State \u201conly when it acts in its representative capacity protecting the public interest generally. Where the State has a property interest which has been injuriously affected by a nuisance, the State can, like any property owner, seek damages.\u201d <em>Id., </em>221 Cal.App.3d at 1614, 271 Cal.Rptr. at 603. Given its property interest in the polluted groundwater, the State was a \u201cperson whose property is injuriously affected\u201d by the public nuisance, thereby entitling it to bring a statutory public nuisance action for damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-7\">Whether we term the State\u2019s interest here a direct usufructory interest, a mere legal interest held for the benefit of the People or an interest supported by its <em>parens patriae </em>role, the State does have a legally cognizable interest in the ground waters affected here which would suffice to support a claim for damages under [the statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\"><em>Id., </em>221 Cal.App.3d at 1618, 271 Cal.Rptr. at 606.

Nuisance Damages &amp; the \u201cSpecial Injury\u201d Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Turning once again to the <em>Restatement, </em>the Defendants respond that Plaintiffs cannot establish the \u201cspecial injury\u201d\u2014 different in kind from the injury suffered by the general public \u2014 that is a prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages on a claim of common-law public nuisance under New Mexico law. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 821C (1979).

In <em>State ex rel. Norvell v.

This court similarly stayed plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief in <em>Schwartzman </em>in favor of ongoing remediation action by the EPA and NMED: \u201cThe doctrine applies when the agency and the court entertaining Plaintiffs claims have concurrent jurisdiction, but the court ... believes it is prudent to decline to exercise its jurisdiction in favor of the expertise of the agency.\u201d <em>Schwartzman, </em>857 F.Supp. at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">Even if the primary jurisdiction doctrine applies to abatement remedies, however, Plaintiffs \u201cmay yet pursue monetary damages under the theor[y] of negligence . .\u25a0. which would include any costs necessary for cleanup,\u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>134</em></footnotemark><em> </em>assuming that Plaintiffs intend to seek further remediation of the problem they allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">4.

Injury in Fact &amp; Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">Of the four essential elements of Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim, only the element of <em>injury in fact </em>would be addressed in the first phase of the trial of this action concerning interest, injury and damages. Under New Mexico law, the existence of a duty of care and the question whether a defendant breached that duty are of no legal consequence if a plaintiff did not suffer a legally cognizable injury to a legally protected interest as a proximate consequence of a defendant\u2019s breach of duty. Proof that the State has suffered such an injury-in-fact under the circumstances alleged in this action is required before the trier of fact need decide the issues of breach of duty and causation, and is essential to the court\u2019s legal determination of the duty issue, <em>viz., </em>whether the defendants owed a duty of care to the State to avoid conduct creating a risk of this particular harm to the State\u2019s legally protected interests.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-13\"><em>Damages </em>reflect the consequences of an established injury-in-fact.

If Plaintiffs can establish an injury-in-fact, but fail to prove the economic value of that injury, the compensatory damages awarded would be nominal at best. <em>Herzog Contracting Corp. v.

Summary re: Intrinsic Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">Each of the state law causes of action now pleaded in this action imposes its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>intrinsic limitations and constraints upon the remedy available to the Plaintiffs, in particular the monetary damages they now seek: (1) absent proof of physical invasion of an exclusive possessory interest in property owned by the State, Plaintiffs are entitled to <em>no </em>judicial remedy for common-law trespass; (2) absent proof of a \u201cspecial injury\u201d to the State\u2019s interests different in kind from that suffered by the public at large, Plaintiffs may not be entitled to relief in compensatory damages for common-law public nuisance, and the special injury requirement may limit Plaintiffs\u2019 damages to its pecuniary losses reflecting costs already incurred or likely to be incurred in response to and in the abatement and remediation of the alleged public nuisance; (3) this court\u2019s precedent correctly instructs that compensatory damages are not available to the Plaintiffs for statutory public nuisance under N.M.

The Measure of Damages Under New Mexico Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Plaintiffs contend that under New Mexico law, \u201cthe State of New Mexico is entitled to be made whole-with the ultimate purpose being to fully compensate the State for all of its losses,\u201d pointing to <em>Ruiz v. Varan, </em>110 N.M. 478, 797 P.2d 267 (1990). (Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order, received July 29, 2003, at LI-44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">1. Diminution of Value &amp; Loss of Use</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">In <em>Ruiz v. Varan, </em>the New Mexico Supreme Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-9\">The measure of damages for a real property tort can be found in our Uniform Jury Instructions, SCRA 1986, 13-1802 and 13-1819. The first of these instructions, on the general measure of damages, is intended to provide for an \u201camount of money which will reasonably and fairly compensate\u201d for an injury as established by evidence. Ordinarily this is accomplished by instructing the jury to determine \u201cwhat was the value of the property immediately before the occurrence and immediately after the occurrence. The difference between these two figures is the legal measure of damages to real property.\u201d SCRA 1986, 13-1819. <em>See also Duke City Lumber Co. Inc. v. Terrel, </em>88 N.M. 299, 540 P.2d 229 (1975) (difference between \u201cbefore and after\u201d fair market values measures damage to business).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\"><em>Id., </em>110 N.M. at 481, 797 P.2d at 270. \u201cBut nothing in our case law,\u201d the court continues, \u201cprecludes substituting a \u2018lost use\u2019 measure for the standard \u2018before and after\u2019 measure set out in UJI 13-1819 where such a measure represents fair and reasonable compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Shaejfer v. Kelton, </em>95 N.M. 182, 619 P.2d 1226 (1980) (damages awarded for inability to discharge loan due to breach of contract, interest payments made while attempting to locate buyer for property, and lost use value of investment capital)). \u201cIn sum, \u2018before and after\u2019 diminution in value, compensation for lost use, and even nominal damages of the kind associated with a trespass may be awarded, depending on the proof offered to establish and quantify the harm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">In <em>Ruiz v. Varan, </em>the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to award damages for loss of use of development property where partnership held property for no specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>use and presented no evidence of actual lost use. It is thus read to stand for the proposition that \u201ca landowner may not recover lost-use damages for uses that are speculative.\u201d <em>Chenega Corp. v. Exxon Corp., </em>991 P.2d 769, 793 &amp; n. 97 (Alaska 1999) (citing <em>Ruiz v. Varan </em>and other cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">2. Cost of Restoration as a Measure of Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The cost of repairing, restoring or replacing damaged property is often an appropriate measure of damages where the injury is \u201ctemporary,\u201d that is, where restoration or replacement can actually be accomplished. <em>See, e.g., Harvey v. Bokum, </em>70 N.1VL 444, 447, 374 P.2d 500, 502 (1962) (affirming damages award of \u2018\u201c$1923.64 for the restoration of said well to a condition where it furnished water,\u2019 \u201d as \u201c \u2018the measure is the cost of repairing or restoring the same.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Cost of repair or restoration as a measure of damages for injury to property has been acknowledged by the New Mexico courts for a long time. <em>See, e.g., Mogollon Gold &amp; Copper Co. v. Stout, </em>14 N.M. 245, 261-62, 91 P. 724, 729 (1907) (suggesting that damages for destruction of property may be proved either by cost of repair or replacement, or by showing depreciation in value of real estate); <em>cf. Snider v. Town of Silver City, </em>56 N.M. 603, 613, 247 P.2d 178, 184 (1952) (\u201c \u201cWhere the building can be restored to substantially the condition it was in prior to the injury, * * * the measure of damages may be the cost of restoration, together, in a proper case, with the loss of rental, * * *\u2019 \u201d (quoting 25 C.J.S. <em>Damages </em>\u00a7 85, at 609)); <em>Springer Ditch Co. v. Wright, </em>31 N.M. 457, 247 P. 270, 274 (1925) (noting that \u201c[f]or temporary injuries to real estate it is claimed that the true measure of damages is the cost of restoration, ... \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">\u201cBecause neither the diminished value nor the repair measure is appropriate for all cases, courts choose the measure deemed most adapted to the case at hand.\u201d 1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 5.2(2), at 716 (2d ed.1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-9\">One rule sometimes adopted by courts for selecting the appropriate measure is that if the harm is \u201cpermanent,\u201d then the diminution measure rather than the repair cost measure is to be used. This automatically makes the diminished value a ceiling on recovery for any harms that are permanent, since it forecloses use of the repair-cost measure altogether. Use of the diminished value measure in turn eliminates any risk of economic waste or windfall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-10\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-11\">Under New Mexico law, \u201cThe measure of damages under a negligence theory of liability for permanent damage to real property is the difference between the fair market value of the land prior to the injury and the fair market value of the land after the full extent of the injury has been determined.\u201d <em>Amoco Production Co. v. Carter Farms Co., </em>103 N.M. 117, 121, 703 P.2d 894, 898 (N.M.1985) (citation omitted). \u201cWhere temporary damage results to the surface estate, but it can be repaired, then the damages are the cost of repair or restoration if the cost of restoration does not exceed the value of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-12\">New Mexico law appears to harmonize with the <em>Restatement </em>view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>\u00a7 929.

Concerning the restoration cost measure, the <em>Restatement </em>observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-11\">[T]he reasonable cost of replacing the land in its original position is ordinarily allowable as the measure of recovery. ... If, however, the cost of replacing the land in its original condition is disproportionate to the diminution in the value of the land ... damages are measured only by the difference between the value of the land before and after the harm....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 929 cmt. b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-13\">3. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cLoss of Use\u201d Damages Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">Plaintiffs in this case seek damages that ostensibly they would measure in at least two different ways: \u201cThe measure of damages for the State\u2019s claims is ... the diminution in value of the State\u2019s <em>in situ </em>groundwater damaged by defendants\u2019 pollution, plus the value of lost extractive services as a result of defendants\u2019 pollution, plus the value of that portion of the aquifer ... destroyed as a result of defendants\u2019 pollution.\u201d (Proposed Joint PreTrial Order, received July 29, 2003, at LI-41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">As noted above, however, these two measures address essentially the same injury, and Plaintiffs\u2019 experts evaluate both the \u201cdiminution in value\u201d of the <em>in situ </em>groundwater and the \u201clost use\u201d of extracted groundwater in essentially the same way: according to the <em>\u201cmarket value\u201d replacement cost </em>of existing water rights representing equivalent volumes of water, as well as the estimated construction cost of a large \u201creplacement\u201d surface storage reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-17\">a. Loss of Use Damages &amp; Replacement Cost</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-18\">According to <em>Ruiz v. Varan, </em>ordinarily the \u201cdiminution in value\u201d of property is measured by asking \u201cwhat was the value of the property immediately before the occurrence and immediately after the occurrence,\u201d and not by asking \u201cwhat is the \u2018market value\u2019 replacement cost\u201d of the injured property as evidenced by the purchase price of some \u201cequivalent\u201d property supposedly to be obtained elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-19\">Evaluating \u201cbefore-after\u201d diminution of value in terms of <em>replacement cost </em>makes sense only if the evidence shows that the diminution of value of Plaintiffs\u2019 interests is both <em>permanent </em>and <em>total. </em>The same is true where, as here, damages are sought to be measured in terms of a total and permanent loss of use. Natural resource damages analysis based on \u201cmarket value\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>replacement cost necessarily assumes that there is a complete loss of the resource that has been injured, <em>see State of Utah v. Kennecott Corp., </em>801 F.Supp. at 566, and may be premature, particularly where sufficient facts have not been developed to justify the conclusion that the. contaminant plumes could not be remediated. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>143</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Plaintiffs have proffered no significant probative evidence or expert opinion as to \u201cbefore-after\u201d diminution of the value of its affected interests, short of the total replacement cost estimates based on the assumption that the affected water and aquifer are totally and permanently lost to use.<footnotemark>144</footnotemark> As noted above, no expert witness has yet testified as to the relative economic value of groundwater that may be found to be drinkable, but still not pristine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">b. Proof of \u201cLoss of Use\u2019VReplacement Cost Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201clost use\u201d damages turn on the total and permanent loss of drinking water services that Plaintiffs insist has occurred at South Valley as a result of the contamination problem. As <em>Ruiz v. Var-an </em>indicates, to recover damages for this injury, Plaintiffs must show that \u201csuch' a measure represents fair and reasonable compensation,\u201d depending \u201con the proof offered to establish and quantify the harm.\u201d 110 N.M. at 481, 797 P.2d at 270. If their damages are to be measured by loss of use, Plaintiffs would be required to come forward with substantial evidence quantifying the additional volume of <em>in situ </em>groundwater in the Middle Rio Grande Basin aquifer that would otherwise' be made available for appropriation at some point in the future, but for the contamination problem at South Valley. As was the ease in <em>Ruiz, </em>Plaintiffs may not recover lost-use damages for uses that are merely speculative or conjectural.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">Plaintiffs dispute this, arguing vehemently that if they are unable to recover replacement cost damages for past, present and future loss of use of the volume of water \u201ctaken out of service\u201d by defendants\u2019 contaminants, then the defendants will not be held accountable and in effect be granted \u201ca license to pollute\u201d where the groundwater is already fully appropriated.<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> Yet when framed in terms of <em>loss of use, </em>the State\u2019s interest in making public waters available for appropriation is injured only to the extent that the <em>amount </em>of water which could otherwise be made available is reduced; <em>i.e., </em>injured by an <em>actual </em>loss of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>c. Alternative Measures &amp; the \u201cLicense to Pollute\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">Were Plaintiffs seeking damages - measured by the traditional \u201cbefore-after\u201d <em>diminishment of value </em>of the <em>in situ . </em>groundwater,<footnotemark>146</footnotemark> damages could be measured by the degradation in <em>quality </em>of contaminated water compared to water of pristine purity, and the responsible parties could be held liable for the value of that diminishment in an amount that \u201c \u2018will reasonably and fairly compensate\u2019 for an injury as established by evidence,\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Varan, </em>110 N.M. at 481, 797 P.2d at 270, without requiring proof of the impacted water\u2019s availability for appropriation. A defendant may still be held liable for causing a diminishment of water quality as a matter of property value; actual loss of use would be one of several factors bearing upon the question of value.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">As explained above, as an alternative to the diminution or lost use measures, a defendant may also be held liable for the cost of restoration of a resource, where restoration has been accomplished, is in the works, or at least appears feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">The New Mexico law of damages thus grants no \u201clicense to pollute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">In this case, however, Plaintiffs have steadfastly insisted upon substituting their loss of use/replacement cost theory for the traditional diminution measure, and have proffered <em>no </em>evidence concerning diminution of value other than as measured by a total loss of use (\u201cextractive services,\u201d \u201cdrinking water services,\u201d \u201cdrought reserve,\u201d etc.). This continues to be so even when Plaintiffs have adopted diminution-of-quality language in pressing their claims. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Plaintiffs Reply to the Court\u2019s Ruling on \u201cInjury\u201d and Request for Reconsideration or Certification of the [\u201cInjury\u201d] Question to the New Mexico Supreme Court, filed January 5, 2004 (dkt. no. 1049), at 4 (\u201cPotable groundwater, \u2018injured\u2019 by contamination, must still be considered \u2018injured\u2019 unless and until it is restored to its pre-polluted condition .... \u201d).)<footnotemark>148</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>4. Cost of Restoration vs. Replacement Cost</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Several times during the course of the Pretrial Conference, this court has raised questions concerning the possible need for further remediation of the contamination at South Valley, and the potential cost of restoration of the groundwater that Plaintiffs insist will remain affected by the existing contamination. The inquiry has been prompted by the need to decide upon a measure of damages \u201c \u2018which will reasonably and fairly compensate\u2019 for an injury as established by evidence,\u201d as New Mexico law requires. <em>Ruiz v. Varan, </em>110 N.M. at 481, 797 P.2d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Besides the fact that the reasonable costs of restoration are \u201cordinarily allowable as the measure of recovery\u201d for injuries to property interests in private tort litigation, <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 929 cmt. b, the nature of the injury and interests asserted in this case, when viewed against the background of public policy concerning natural resource protection, demands that restoration costs be taken into consideration in determining the nature of the remedy that may ultimately be available to the Plaintiffs. Indeed, as <em>State of Utah v. Kennecott Corp. </em>suggests, assessment of market value replacement cost damages for the total loss of use of a resource may be premature where restoration of use of the resource through remediation has not yet been fully examined. 801 F.Supp. at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">5. Injury and Remedy in Hazardous Waste Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">When dealing with contamination of land and water by hazardous substances, the traditional legal damages remedy measured by diminution in value, or even loss of use, may not fully redress the injury inflicted or mitigate its accompanying risks.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-10\">In some cases damage to the plaintiffs land also causes harm to others or to the public. Injunctive remedies may furnish the best relief in such cases. For example, a defendant might deposit toxic wastes on the plaintiffs land. As long as the wastes remain, they may be a source of secondary pollution that affects a neighbor\u2019s well or public waters. In such a case, the diminution in the value of the plaintiffs land does not represent all of the damage done. Instead, some of costs are externalized or placed upon other victims. Although the costs are real, many of them would be difficult to measure, even if appropriate plaintiffs could be identified. So injunctions will often be appropriate and desirable in such cases because the injunction can stop conduct that causes harms to the public at the same time it stops conduct that causes harm to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 5.2(5), at 724-25 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">It is no accident, then, that the New Mexico law of common-law and statutory public nuisance \u201chas largely evolved in the context of injunctive relief.\u201d <em>Espinosa v. Roswell Tower, Inc., </em>121 N.M. at 310, 910 P.2d at 944. Abatement of a public nuisance involving risks of public exposure to hazardous waste brings an end to the nuisance and to the risks, thus minimizing the externalized costs of the nuisance before many of those costs have been incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">Where hazardous releases have already ceased, \u201ctoxic substances may be left be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>hind that continue to cause threats\u201d and unless the defendant can \u201cremove the hazards, ... the question will be one of damages.\u201d 1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 5.2(5), at 725. \u201cBecause the costs of the pollution affect others, or the public at large, the diminished value of the plaintiffs land is no guide to the actual costs imposed by the pollution. Costs of repair or cleanup are thus appropriate, even if they exceed the diminished value of the land.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> Indeed, measuring damages by the costs of restoration \u201cis supported by analogy to environmental laws, even if those laws do not apply to the particular case.\u201d <em>Id.

Kennecott Corp., </em>801 F.Supp. at 571 (under CERCLA, \u201cIf ... restoration is feasible, the State would be obligated to follow and apply the statutory preference for restoration in assessing costs and damages, unless exceptional circumstances would warrant adoption of a different measure of damages.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">6. The State as Public Trustee/ <em>Par-ens Patriae</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">To this point, at least, Plaintiffs are not here asserting the interests of a landowner or water rights holder. As Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has persistently exclaimed, the Plaintiffs are here as the \u201c \u2018public trustee\u2019 of the public\u2019s trust in these resources,\u201d as the <em>parens patriae </em>\u2014 the \u201cparent of the country\u201d \u2014 suing \u201cto prevent or repair harm to its \u2018quasi-sovereign\u2019 interests,\u201d <em>Hawaii v.

To the extent that water has been rendered unavailable for appropriation because it is unsafe, it is the public that suffers the consequences of that loss. Like New Jersey, where, as Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asserts, the \u201c \u2018State has not only the right but also the affirmative fiduciary obligation to ensure that the rights of the public to a viable marine environment are protected,\u2019 \u201d the State of New Mexico has the standing and duty to protect the public\u2019s supply of drinking water.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">Measuring Plaintiffs\u2019 damages according to the costs of restoration of the affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>South Valley groundwater coalesces with the State\u2019s professed role in this litigation. Where \u201cthe health and comfort of the inhabitants of a State are threatened, the State is the proper party to represent and defend them,\u201d <em>Missouri v. Illinois, 180 </em>U.S. 208, 241, 21 S.Ct. 331, 45 L.Ed. 497 (1901), and presumably the State would seek and obtain the legal remedy that best addresses the threat of harm to the public by minimizing that threat and restoring public groundwater resources to public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">7. Cost of Restoration &amp; the Constraints on Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">The restoration cost measure also permits recovery of damages under a wider range of Plaintiffs liability theories.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark> Whether the Plaintiffs can recover damages for a particular type of injury or harm may depend on the legal theory of the plaintiffs claim. <em>See, e.g., First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Sanchez, </em>112 N.M. at 322, 815 P.2d at 618 (for breach <em>o\u00ed </em>contract, recovery allowed for consequential damages only if they were within contemplation of parties at time of contracting). To recover for the <em>loss of use </em>of the \u201cout of service\u201d volume of groundwater affected by the chemical contamination at South Valley, Plaintiffs must rely on their negligence claim alone, as compensatory damages for the injury to the public\u2019s common interest in that water are not available to Plaintiffs under either common-law or statutory public nuisance.<footnotemark>154</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-9\">However, if Plaintiffs\u2019 damages are measured by the cost of restoration of use of the affected groundwater as drinking water, restoration costs represent a \u201cspecial injury\u201d permitting their recovery under the common-law nuisance theory<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> as well as a recognized measure of compensatory damages available under the negligence claim. Proof of a public nuisance may be an easier burden to meet. To recover under the negligence claim, Plaintiffs must establish a duty of care, breach of that duty by each defendant (including comparative fault issues), factual and proximate causation, as well as injury-in-fact. To obtain a remedy for public nuisance, Plaintiffs need only prove the existence of the nuisance, <em>viz., </em>an \u201c \u2018unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public,\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Village of Los Ranc-hos de Albuquerque v.

The Measure of Damages in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-7\">The proper measure of damages is a question of law for the court to decide. The court may choose one of several plausible alternative measures. <em>See Sierra Life Ins. Co. v. First Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>85 N.M. 409, 414, 512 P.2d 1245, 1250 (1973) (\u201cThis Court will not attempt to second guess the trial court\u2019s determination of the proper measure to be applied for damages if the trial court had several alternatives before it supported by substantial evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-8\">In this case, should the Plaintiffs prevail on their current damages theory, the remedy thus obtained would leave the existing contamination in place at South Valley, untreated and undisturbed; it would do nothing to minimize the risk of future injury to the public health caused by that hazard beyond tying up a much larger volume of potable groundwater to be maintained indefinitely as a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d \u2014 thus <em>maximizing </em>rather than mitigating the \u201closs of use\u201d damages flowing from. the contamination.<footnotemark>156</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-9\">If, on the other hand, the plumes of contaminated water are remediated, the toxic plume volumes are thereby returned to public use for drinking or other beneficial uses, and the need for the much larger \u201cbuffer zone\u201d simply evaporates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">At the January 8, 2004 Pretrial Conference, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel framed the issue of remedy in this way: \u201cthe proper measure of injury is how do you then get that water back to where it\u2019s safe to drink.\u201d (Transcript of Hearing, dated January 8, 2004 (P.M.), at 4144:8-10 (Mr. Lewis).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">Absent significant probative evidence establishing the <em>permanent and total loss </em>of the affected volume of groundwater at South Valley \u2014 and there is none of any material consequence in this record \u2014 this court chooses the <em>cost of restoration </em>as the appropriate measure \u25a0 of compensatory damages for injury to the <em>in situ </em>groundwater beneath the South Valley Site caused by VOC.and petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. Damages thus measured would include response costs <em>(e.g., </em>site investigation costs) and similar consequential damages. Cost of restoration damages under Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining state law claims would encompass past, present and <em>future </em>remediation expenses: where toxic contamination persists in land or groundwater, a plaintiff \u201cshould be permitted to recover full restoration costs and all consequential damages that are properly established, <em>at least if he can give the court assurance that repair, restoration or cleanup will actually take place.\u201d </em>1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 5.2(5), at 725 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>157</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">By allowing recovery for <em>future </em>restoration costs, the remedy thus available under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims affords greater relief than would be available under CERCLA. CERCLA generally does not provide for the present recovery of future costs of restoration; instead it \u201cprovides for a declaratory judgment action to establish liability for <em>future </em>response costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(g)(2).\u201d <em>Stanton Road Associates v. Lohrey Enterp., </em>984 F.2d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, granted sub nom. Key Tronic Corp., </em>510 U.S. 1023, 114 S.Ct. 633, 126 L.Ed.2d 592, <em>cert, dismissed, </em>510 U.S. 1031, 114 S.Ct. 652, 126 L.Ed.2d 609 (1993); <em>In re Dant &amp; Russell, </em>951 F.2d 246, 250 (9th Cir.1991) (CERCLA requires plaintiffs \u201cto actually incur response costs before they can recover them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">According to the facts proffered in the existing record, restoration of the groundwater at South Valley may be addressed in at least two ways: (1) following CERC-LA\u2019s preference for permanent solutions,<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> remediation of the toxic plume(s) over a period of time using a groundwater extraction-treatment-reinjection system to remove the volatile organic contaminants while keeping the plume volume essentially in place; and (2) restoring the plume volume to immediate use by extracting the groundwater through wells, applying wellhead treatment technology to scrub out the chemical contaminants, and then diverting the water directly to beneficial use by one or more appropriators <em>(e.g., </em>the City of Albuquerque).<footnotemark>159</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1300-8\">The State of New Mexico has already investigated, evaluated, approved and even <em>required </em>the first method of remediation for groundwater at the South Valley Site under the terms of its existing Hydrocarbon Remediation Agreements; the same method is currently in use in the ongoing EPA \u2014 ordered remedial actions in the Plant 83/General Electric Operable Units \u2014 a remediation requested, reviewed and expressly approved by the State of New Mexico through responsible officials in the New Mexico Environment Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">Additional remedial action is available, if appropriately pursued.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>VII. SCOPE OF THE TRIAL ON INJURY AND DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">This court has often asked of counsel at pretrial, \u201cWhat is left?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">This Memorandum Opinion and Order represents the court\u2019s effort to arrive at an answer to that query. Clearly, several triable issues of fact remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-7\">Given the present scope of Plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and the constraints imposed by CERCLA itself, this court need not and will not engage in an examination of the adequacy or efficacy of the EPA\u2019s ordered remedy for the Plant 83/General Electric Operable Units in restoring groundwater to use within the intended scope of that remedial action. Plaintiffs have carefully pleaded their remaining state law claims, marking the periphery of the CERCLA remedy as their boundary, and thus avoiding the risk of an impermissible double recovery as well as potential conflict preemption by CERCLA should a state law remedy somehow frustrate CERCLA\u2019s remedial objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">To recover damages in this action, the Plaintiffs must prove an actual injury to the State\u2019s legally protected interests in the groundwater and aquifer beneath the South Valley Site \u2014 an injury beyond the intended scope of the existing CERCLA remediation, as well as prove facts supporting an award of compensatory damages. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">A. Summary Judgment &amp; Genuine Issues for Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-13\">Ordinarily, at this stage of the proceedings, based upon the proffers of proof made in summary judgment papers as well as proffers made in the context of our extended Pretrial Conference and Rule 702 evidentiary hearing, this Court would probably grant judgment dismissing the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims because of Plaintiffs\u2019 failure of proof of the essential elements of injury and damage \u2014 a failure to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">Rule 56(e) does- not ask the court to weigh each discrete piece of evidence individually, <em>e.g., </em>by determining the credibility of a particular party, witness or affidavit. Rather, the \u201cgenuine issue\u201d inquiry involves weighing the <em>probative significance </em>of a particular asserted <em>fact, </em>substantially taken as true, in the context of the entire case. \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is \u2018no genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushi-ta Elec. Indust. Co. v. Zenith Radio </em>Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587,106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).<footnotemark>161</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>As discussed above, to recover damages measured by the \u201cmarket value\u201d replacement cost as Plaintiffs urge, they must be able to prove a complete loss of the resource that has been injured, <em>see State of Utah v. Kennecott Corp., </em>801 F.Supp. at 566, that is, a <em>total and permanent loss </em>of all beneficial use of the groundwater. Yet the bare assertion that an injury is <em>total </em>because the resource\u2019s \u201chighest and best use\u201d may be impaired, or that an injury is <em>permanent </em>because it purportedly is not being treated by existing remedial systems,<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> cannot stand in the stead of significant probative evidence demonstrating the existence of genuine issues of material fact concerning total and permanent loss that require a trial.<footnotemark>163</footnotemark> <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (a \u201cplaintiff could not rest on his allegations of a conspiracy to get to a jury without \u2018any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>First National Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 290, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968))). \u201cIt is not enough that the nonmovant\u2019s evidence be \u2018merely colorable\u2019 or anything short of \u2018significantly probative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jensen v. Redevelopment Agency of Sandy City, </em>998 F.2d 1550 (10th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249-50,106 S.Ct. 2505).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">During the course of the Pretrial Conference, however, the Defendants have proffered significant probative evidence concerning the feasibility and estimated cost of restoration of contaminated groundwater at the South Valley Site, particularly with reference to the second remedial option (wellhead treatment prior to use), that is sufficient at least to raise a triable issue as to the practicality of an abatement or restoration remedy and the utility of measuring Plaintiffs\u2019 damages according to the cost of restoration.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">In light of this evidence in the record, this court declines to grant judgment at this time that would dismiss the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims for common-law and statutory public nuisance and common-law negligence in favor of resolving the remaining factual issues at trial, with Plaintiffs\u2019 damages to be measured by the cost of restoration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">B. Genuine Issues Remaining for Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">The following issues of fact remain in genuine dispute and require determination through the first phase of the trial of this action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1302-10\">1. What is the nature, location and extent (in both volume and concentra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>tion) of the chemical contamination of the groundwater underlying the South Valley Site that exists beyond the reach of CERCLA <em>(e.g., </em>petroleum hydrocarbons only) and/or outside the intended scope of the existing EPA remediation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-5\">2. What is the volume of <em>in situ </em>groundwater beneath the South Valley Site that has been injured and rendered unavailable <em>(e.g., </em>as drought reserve) for use as drinking water because of that chemical contamination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-6\">3. What is the cost of restoration of that volume of contaminated groundwater that has been lost to use as drinking water?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-7\">4. What amount of damages will reasonably compensate the State of New Mexico for the injury to its interest in that volume of <em>in situ </em>groundwater, measured by the cost of restoration, response costs, etc.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1303-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">As explained above, Plaintiffs may seek an award of damages in an amount sufficient to reimburse the State of New Mexico for site investigation and other \u201cresponse costs\u201d incurred by the State in connection with a proven injury to the State\u2019s interests at the South Valley Site, and any costs of restoration of the groundwater at South Valley already incurred by the State with respect to that injury. Plaintiffs, on behalf of the State of New Mexico in its capacity as public trustee, may also recover damages in the amount of future costs of restoration as established by substantial evidence, said damages to be held in trust for the benefit of the public, for the express purpose of paying for the actual remediation and restoration of the affected groundwater beneath the South Valley Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">If necessary, any damages recovered for future costs of restoration may be deposited in escrow and maintained in the Registry of this court, awaiting their disbursement upon further order of the court to pay remediation costs as they are incurred. Such an arrangement would serve the remedial purposes of Plaintiffs\u2019 tort liability theories as well as those of Congress in enacting CERCLA,<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> and the New Mexico Legislature in enacting the New Mexico Water Quality Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 74-6-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Repl.2000), and would ensure that the damages awarded as the cost of restoring the resource are in fact used to restore the resource for the use and benefit of the public who owns it. <em>See, e.g., </em>James R. Cox, <em>Reforming the Law Applicable to the Award of Restoration Damages as a Remedy for Environmental Torts, </em>20 Pace Envtl. L.Rev. 777, 798-809 (2003) (equitable or constructive \u201ccleanup\u201d trust as a means of ensuring that restoration cost damages are used to restore resources).</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-13\">VIII.
