On appeal, Sheriff Prine argues that Plaintiff Felicia Pellitteri\u2019s wrongful termination claims \u00e1re barred by the Eleventh Amendment. We agree. As a result, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-23\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-24\">Ms. Pellitteri is a former deputy sheriff in the Lowndes County Sheriffs Office. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>After injuring her knee during the course of her duties, Ms. Pellitteri requested that she be placed on temporary light duty. According to Ms. Pellitteri, this was an accommodation that was routinely granted to other deputies who suffered on-the-job injuries. However, Ms. Pellitteri\u2019s request was denied, and she was eventually fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In March 2013, Ms. Pellitteri filed a complaint in federal district court against Lowndes County, the Lowndes County Sheriffs Office, and Sheriff Prine (in his individual capacity and official capacity as Sheriff of Lowndes County). In her complaint, Ms. Pellitteri alleged that the defendants violated her rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111, 12112.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Sheriff Prine then filed a motion to dismiss in which he argued that Ms. Pellit-teri\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and ADA claims against him in his official capacity were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The District Court denied Sheriff Prine\u2019s motion to dismiss, relying on this Court\u2019s unpublished opinion in <em>Keene v. </em>Prine, 477 Fed.Appx. 575 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). Sheriff Prine now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Sheriff Prine\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the District Court erred when it denied him immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. According to Sheriff Prine, his law enforcement powers all derive from the State of Georgia, and the State has exclusive authority and control over the duties and affairs of his office. Thus, Sheriff Prine argues that he acts as an \u201carm of the State\u201d when exercising his power to hire and fire the deputies that enforce the laws of Georgia on his behalf. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s ruling regarding Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Abusaid v. Hillsborough Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>405 F.3d 1298, 1303 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cEleventh Amendment immunity bars suits brought in federal court when the State itself is sued and when an \u2018arm of the State\u2019 is sued.\u201d <em>Manders v. Lee, </em>338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2003) (en banc). \u201cTo receive Eleventh Amendment immunity, a defendant need not be labeled a \u2018state officer\u2019 or \u2018state official,\u2019 but instead need only be acting as an \u2018arm of the State,\u2019 which includes agents and instrumentalities of the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">In making the \u201carm of the State\u201d determination, we weigh the four factors set forth in <em>Manders: </em>\u201c(1) how state law defines the entity; (2) what degree of control the State maintains over the entity; (3) where the entity derives its funds; and (4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309. Whether a defendant was acting as an \u201carm of the State\u201d must be \u201cassessed in light of the particular function in which the defendant was engaged when taking the actions out of which liability is asserted to arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308; <em>Shands Teaching Hosp. &amp; Clinics, Inc. v. Beech St. Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe pertinent inquiry is not into the nature of [an entity\u2019s] status in the abstract, but its function or role in a particular context.\u201d). As a result, we do not ask whether a sheriff in Georgia acts as an \u201carm of the State\u201d generally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Rather, we must determine whether Sheriff Prine acts as an \u201carm of the State\u201d when exercising his power to hire and fire his deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">A. How State Law Defines the Entity</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The first <em>Manders </em>factor \u2014 how state law defines the entity \u2014 points to viewing the Sheriffs Office as an \u201carm of the State.\u201d In <em>Manders, </em>we acknowledged that sheriffs in Georgia are elected by county voters and are labeled \u201ccounty officers\u201d by the Georgia Constitution. 338 F.3d at 1312 (citing Ga. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 111(a)). After reviewing Georgia law, however, we found that the \u201cessential governmental nature\u201d of each sheriffs office in Georgia is to (1) \u201cenforce the law and preserve the peace on behalf of the sovereign State\u201d and (2) \u201cto perform specific statutory duties, directly, assigned by the State, in law enforcement, in state courts, and in corrections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1319. As a result, we concluded that sheriffs are only \u201ccounty officers\u201d in the sense that they have a limited geographic jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1312. Indeed, \u201csheriffs in Georgia derive their power and duties from the State, are controlled by the State, and counties cannot, and do not, delegate any law enforcement power or duties to sheriffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313; <em>cf. </em>O.C.G.A. 36-8-l(b) (allowing county governing bodies to create a separate county police force).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Beyond that, the <em>Manders </em>Court also observed that the Georgia Constitution designed the sheriffs office to enjoy a great deal of independence from the county that it serves. 338 F.3d at 1311. While it is true that the State requires the county to fund the sheriffs budget, <em>id., </em>Georgia\u2019s Constitution also expressly prevents counties from controlling or affecting the sheriffs office or the personnel thereof, <em>see </em>Ga. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 1(c)(1) (providing that legislative power granted to counties \u201cshall not be construed to extend to ... [ajction affecting any elective county office, the salaries thereof, or the personnel thereof, except the personnel subject to the jurisdiction of the county governing authority\u201d). The Georgia Constitution also grants the state legislature the exclusive authority to establish and control a sheriffs powers and duties. Ga. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 III(a)-(b). For this reason, the Georgia Supreme Court has explained that sheriffs cannot be considered county employees because they are subject only to the state legislature. <em>Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Randolph Cnty. v. Wilson, </em>260 Ga. 482, 396 S.E.2d 903, 903 (1990) (\u201cThe sheriff ... is an elected, constitutional officer; he is subject to the charge of the General Assembly and is not an employee of the county commission.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Turning to the specific function at issue here \u2014 hiring and firing deputies \u2014 the authority of sheriffs to employ personnel is also derived from the State. The Georgia legislature has enacted laws giving sheriffs alone the power to hire their deputies, independent of any influence from county governments. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-16-23. Deputies are also considered employees of the sheriff and not the County. <em>Warren v. Walton, </em>231 Ga. 495, 202 S.E.2d 405, 409 (1973) (recognizing that \u201cdeputy sheriffs and deputy jailors are employees of the sheriff, whom the sheriffs alone are entitled to appoint or discharge\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Brown v. Jackson, </em>221 Ga.App. 200, 470 S.E.2d 786, 787 (1996) (noting that deputy sheriffs \u201cwere employees of the sheriff and not Peach County\u201d). As a result, we conclude that the first <em>Manders </em>factor weighs in favor of immunity-</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">B. Degree of Control the State Maintains Over the Entity</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The second <em>Manders </em>factor is based on the \u201cdegree of control the State maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>over the entity.\u201d 338 F.3d at 1309. In <em>Manders, </em>for example, we were asked to determine whether sheriffs in Georgia act as an \u201carm of the State\u201d when setting force policies at their jails and training and disciplining their deputies in that regard. <em>Id. </em>at 1308-09. On this factor, we found it significant that the State required sheriffs to attend annual trainings, and state law includes \u201ccorrections practices\u201d as one of the topics for that training. <em>Id. </em>at 1320 (quoting O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-16-3). We also observed that the Governor has broad investigation and suspension powers regarding any misconduct by sheriffs in the performance of their duties. <em>Id. </em>at 1321 (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-16-26). In the same way, we conclude that the State of Georgia exercises substantial control over a sheriffs personnel decisions, especially in the hiring and firing of deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Admittedly, we stated in <em>Keene </em>that \u201csheriffs are largely independent from the State when they make personnel decisions.\u201d 477 Fed.Appx. at 578. We arrived at this conclusion by observing that sheriffs alone have great discretion in choosing who to appoint as their deputies. <em>Id. </em>Based in part on this autonomy \u2014 both from the State and the county \u2014 we concluded that sheriffs do not act as an \u201carm of the State\u201d when exercising their discretion to hire and fire deputies. <em>Id. </em>at 579-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Upon further review, however, we believe that this conclusion in <em>Keene </em>was mistaken on two fronts. First, the State of Georgia has in fact exercised a great deal of control over the hiring and firing of deputy sheriffs, especially through the certification process for peace officers. Georgia law requires that any person employed as a peace officer \u2014 including deputy sheriffs \u2014 be at least 18 years of age, be a citizen of the United States, have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent, and not have a significant criminal record. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 35-8-8(a)(l)-(4). Any applicant for peace officer certification in Georgia must also be fingerprinted and undergo a moral character investigation, as well as a physical, emotional, and mental examination by a licensed physician or surgeon. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 35-88(a)(5)-(7). And even after meeting all of these requirements, a potential deputy sheriff must still successfully complete an academy entrance examination administered by the State before he or she can be certified to serve in a sheriffs office as a deputy. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 35-8-8(a)(8). These threshold requirements for serving as a peace officer in Georgia significantly limit a sheriffs discretion when hiring potential deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The Georgia legislature has also enacted laws creating a Peace Officer Standards and Training Council to discipline peace officers \u2014 including deputy sheriffs \u2014 for misconduct. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 35-8-3, 35-8-7.1. This Council has the power to administer reprimands and limit, suspend, or revoke a peace officer\u2019s certification. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 35-8-7.1(b)(1). Thus, the Council can functionally terminate a deputy sheriffs ability to perform his or her duties, which significantly restricts a sheriffs discretion in personnel matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Finally, as we mentioned in <em>Manders, </em>Georgia\u2019s governor also has broad investigation and suspension powers to discipline a sheriff for misconduct. 338 F.3d at 1321 (citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-16-26). These disciplinary powers can be used to check sheriffs when they abuse their appointment or removal powers. Based on these facts, we conclude that Sheriff Prine\u2019s power to hire and fire his deputies is subject to a significant amount of oversight by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Second, our conclusion in <em>Keene </em>was also flawed because it strayed from the \u201ckey question\u201d of the <em>Manders </em>function-by-function inquiry, which \u201cis not what ... powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>sheriffs have, but <em>for whom </em>sheriffs exercise that power.\u201d <em>Abusaid, </em>405 F.3d at 1310 (quoting <em>Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1319 n. 35). While it may be true that sheriffs alone are authorized to appoint their deputies, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-16-23, they do not exercise that authority for themselves. Rather, sheriffs select deputies to assist them in executing their own duties, which have been delegated to them by the State. <em>See Grech v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., </em>335 F.3d 1326, 1333 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn enforcing the laws and conserving the peace, the Governor does not act alone, but necessarily acts through state agents such as sheriffs.\u201d); <em>see also Teasley v. Freeman, </em>305 Ga.App. 1, 699 S.E.2d 39, 42 (2010) (\u201c[D]eputies serve as the sheriffs agent, and deputies have no duties other than those of the sheriff.\u201d). In this sense, sheriffs exercise their power to hire deputies <em>for the State. </em>As a result, even if the State generally stays out of a sheriffs day-to-day decisions about who to hire or fire, the State still maintains a great deal of control. <em>See United States ex rel. Lesinski v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., </em>739 F.3d 598, 604 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cThat the District maintains some degree of autonomy over its day-to-day operations does not change the fact that the State of Florida ultimately retains near-total control over it.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(holding that the State maintains control because the entity \u201cderives both the authority and the obligation to exercise those powers directly from the State\u201d). We thus find that the second <em>Manders </em>factor also weighs in favor of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">C. Where the Entity Derives Its Funds</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">The third factor in the Eleventh Amendment analysis is where the entity derives its funds. In <em>Keene, </em>we found that this factor weighed against immunity because the \u201c[c]ounty is clearly the principal source of funding for the Sheriffs Office, including for personnel expenditures.\u201d 477 Fed.Appx. at 579. Here again, we recognize that our prior unpublished opinion is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s published precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In <em>Manders, </em>we observed that each county in Georgia bears the major burden of providing funds to the sheriffs office, including the salaries of the sheriff and his deputies. 338 F.3d at 1323. We did not find this fact to be dispositive, however, because it is the State that mandates that counties set a budget for the sheriffs office. <em>Id. </em>(citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 36-9-5, 42-5-2(a), 15-16-20, 45-4-7). More important, although each county sets the total budget for the sheriffs office, it cannot dictate <em>how </em>the sheriff spends those funds. <em>Id.; see McMillian v. Monroe Cnty., Ala., </em>520 U.S. 781, 791, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 1740, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997) (\u201cThe county\u2019s payment of the sheriffs salary does not translate into control over [the sheriff], since the county neither has the authority to change his salary nor the discretion to refuse payment completely.\u201d). Because Lowndes County funds the sheriffs department according to State law requirements, we cannot conclude that this factor weighs in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Ross v. Jefferson Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>701 F.3d 655, 660 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (holding that the source of funding for the Health Department does not \u201ctip the balance against immunity because state law requires the county to supply those funds\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">D. Liability for and Payment of Adverse Judgments</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Fourth and finally, we consider \u201cwho is responsible for judgments against the entity.\u201d <em>Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1309. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the \u201cimpetus\u201d for the Eleventh Amendment was the \u201cprevention of federal-court judgments that must be paid out of a State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>treasury.\u201d <em>Hess v. Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., </em>513 U.S. 30, 48, 115 S.Ct. 394, 404, 130 L.Ed.2d 245 (1994). As a result, we have stated that \u201cthe presence of a state treasury drain alone may trigger Eleventh Amendment immunity and make consideration of the other factors unnecessary.\u201d <em>Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1328 n. 51.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">On this factor, we agree with this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Keene </em>and <em>Manders </em>that the financial independence afforded the sheriffs office \u201ccreates something of a lacuna\u201d because neither the State nor the County will be required to directly pay for any adverse judgment against the Sheriffs office. <em>Keene, </em>477 Fed.Appx. at 579; <em>Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1327. Rather, any adverse judgment against Sheriff Prine will be paid out of the budget of the Lowndes County Sheriffs Office, which is composed of both County and State funds. <em>Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1327. Nevertheless, to the extent that the state treasury will be spared here from paying any adverse judgment, this factor weighs in favor of denying immunity. <em>See Abusaid, </em>405 F.3d at 1313 (\u201c[T]he fact that a judgment against the Sheriff in this case would <em>not </em>be paid out of the state treasury is, in itself, a clear marker that the Sheriff is not an arm of the state.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">As in <em>Manders, </em>the first three factors here weigh in favor of immunity, while the fourth factor weighs against immunity. On balance, we conclude that Sheriff Prine enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity against Ms. Pellitteri\u2019s wrongful termination claims brought against him in his official capacity under \u00a7 1983 and the ADA. We reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Sheriff Prine\u2019s motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-2\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A1p\">. We present the facts as alleged in Ms. Pelit-teri's complaint. At this point in the litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>tion, we must assume the facts set forth in her complaint are true. <em>See Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U.S. 451, 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 1994, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006) (stating that on a motion to dismiss, the court must \"accept as true the factual allegations in the amended complaint\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-14\">. We pause to note, however, that the fourth <em>Manders </em>factor alone is not necessarily dis-positive in any given case. Indeed, our precedent suggests that the presence of a state treasury drain is likely sufficient but certainly not necessary for a finding of immunity. <em>See Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1327 (\u201cNever has the Supreme Court required an actual drain on the state treasury as a per se condition of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d); <em>Ross, </em>701 F.3d at 660 (\u201cAs to the fourth factor, our precedent holds that liability by the state treasury is not determinative of whether a governmental entity should enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
