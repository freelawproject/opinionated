They prevailed in an action for a refund and after the government\u2019s appeal was dismissed, they obtained an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d) (1982). The government challenges the award on the grounds that the fee application filed after dismissal of the appeal was untimely, and that its position was substantially justified, even though the only appellate decision in point, one from another circuit, was contrary to its position. We affirm the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-14\">Keasler Body was in the business of fitting hydraulic hoists and truck bodies on truck chassis. For the period January 1974 to September 1975, the Internal Revenue Service assessed an excise tax on all the truck-hoist units that Keasler had assembled. The IRS contended that the assembly process constituted taxable manufacturing under I.R.C. \u00a7 4061(a)(1). This had been the IRS position since at least 1969. <em>See </em>Rev.Rul. 69-195, 1969 C.B. 276. This ruling had, however, been expressly disapproved by the Tenth Circuit in <em>Jacobs Equipment Co. v. United States, </em>574 F.2d 1040 (10th Cir.1978), a case involving facts nearly identical to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-15\">Keasler paid the assessment and sought a refund from the IRS. Although the IRS acknowledged that Keasler\u2019s position was supported by <em>Jacobs, </em>it declined to follow the case and refused the requested refund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1979, Keasler sued for a refund and the case was submitted on stipulated facts. The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted summary judgment for Keasler on October 2, 1981. The government filed a timely notice of appeal, but later dismissed the appeal on the advice of the Solicitor General. Nine days later (but more than seven months after the grant of summary judgment), Keasler moved the district court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under section 2412(d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>work before the district court and on the government\u2019s short-lived appeal. The government contested the motion on two grounds. First, it argued that Keasler\u2019s application was untimely because it was not filed within thirty days of a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d allegedly the summary judgment granted by the district court. Second, it contended that its position before the district court and on appeal was substantially justified. Keasler was awarded fees for the district court and appellate litigation. <em>Keasler v. United States, </em>585 F.Supp. 825 (E.D.Ark.1984). The government filed this appeal, and basically repeats here the arguments it made before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">The threshold question is whether Keasler filed a timely application for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred during proceedings before the district court. Section 2412(d)(1)(B) requires that an application be submitted to the court \u201cwithin thirty days of final judgment in the action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit courts have interpreted this phrase in a variety of contexts and several conflicting meanings have emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">The most persuasive view originated in <em>McDonald v. Schweiker, </em>726 F.2d 311 (7th Cir.1983). In <em>McDonald, </em>summary judgment was entered for the claimant. The government filed a timely notice of appeal but dismissed the appeal six days later. Within thirty days, the claimant moved for attorneys\u2019 fees in the district court. The court of appeals held that the motion was timely. The Seventh Circuit stated that \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d which appears 151 times in the United States Code, does not have a single fixed meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 313. Analyzing the practical consequences under the Act, the court concluded that \u201cfinal judgment\u201d means the completion of all appellate proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">On October 11, 1984, Congress passed a bill amending and extending section 2412(d). It added a definition to the EAJA providing that \u201c \u2018final judgment\u2019 means a judgment that is final and not appealable.\u201d H.R. 5479, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 2(b)(3)(G), 130 Cong.Rec. H11479 (daily ed. Oct. 4, 1984). S.Rep. No. 919, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1984), expressly approved the Seventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>McDonald. </em>The President refused to sign H.R. 5479 and it did not become law. <em>See Premachandra v. Mitts, </em>753 F.2d at 642 n. 9. Nevertheless, the bill influenced the Third Circuit when it decided <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>749 F.2d 171 (3d Cir.1984) (per curiam). In <em>Taylor, </em>the claimant prevailed on the merits in the district court and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. Within thirty days of the appellate affirmance, the claimant filed a request for fees with the district court. The Third Circuit held that the application was timely under the following construction: \u201cfee petitions under the EAJA must be filed no later than thirty days after the expiration of the time to appeal, or after the termination of the litigation by the court of last resort, or after a losing party asserts that no further appeal will be taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>Subsequently, the District of Columbia Circuit adopted the reasoning and holding in <em>McDonald. </em>In <em>Massachusetts Union of Public Housing Tenants, Inc. v. Pierce, </em>755 F.2d 177 (D.C.Cir.1985) (per curiam), the court held that EAJA applications must be filed within thirty days of the \u201ctime that a judgment becomes final because an appeal is completed or foregone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The claimants in <em>Pierce </em>had been granted summary judgment on the merits. They filed a motion in the district court for fees more than thirty days after the final judgment had been entered but less than thirty days after the sixty-day period that the government had to appeal. The court held that the application was timely. <em>Id. </em>at 179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Most recently, the Sixth Circuit approved <em>McDonald. Feldpausch v. Heckler, </em>763 F.2d 229 (6th Cir.1985). Relying also on the legislative history discussed in <em>Taylor, </em>the court held that an application for fees is timely if made within thirty days after the expiration of the time to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 232.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Two circuits have taken a different path. In <em>McQuiston v. Marsh, </em>707 F.2d 1082 (9th Cir.1983), the district court dismissed the suit as moot. Nearly three months later, the claimant moved for fees under section 2412(d). Following a brief discussion, which interpreted \u201cfinal judgment\u201d to mean the same thing under section 2412(d), Fed.R.Civ.P. 54, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court held that a request for attorneys\u2019 fees is untimely if filed more than thirty days after the district court has entered judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1084-85. In dicta, the court rejected the argument that the thirty-day period should commence upon the expiration of the time to appeal or upon termination of the action in the court of last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">In <em>Gold Kist, Inc. v. USDA, </em>741 F.2d 344 (11th Cir.1984), the claimant lost in proceedings against the government in the district court. On appeal, judgment was entered for the claimant, and it requested an award of attorneys\u2019 fees although no application had been filed with the district court. The court recognized the holding in <em>McQuiston </em>that \u201cfinal judgment\u201d means final in the district court, and agreed with its construction \u201cwhen the non-governmental party prevails below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349 (dictum). Nevertheless, it felt that requiring a party losing before the lower court to apply for fees \u201cwould be senseless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it concluded that \u201cwhen the non-government party loses in the district court but prevails on appeal, it must file its application for fees under the EAJA within 30 days of the judgment of the appellate court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">The reasoning in <em>McQuiston </em>and the dictum in <em>Goldkist </em>are too abbreviated to be persuasive. We believe <em>McDonald </em>was rightly decided and its acceptance by the other circuit underscores its strength. We also find significant the context in which section 2412(d) appears. Chapter 161, part 6 of the Judicial Code, in addition to containing section 2412, regulates the payment of judgments and compromise settlements by the government. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414 (1982) provides that \u201c[wjhenever the Attorney General determines that no appeal shall be taken from a judgment or that no further review will be sought from a decision affirming the same, he shall so certify and the judgment shall be deemed final.\u201d Because of its proximity to the statute in question, section 2414 provides one of the best indications of what constitutes a final judgment against the government. Under this definition, the government\u2019s dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>of the Keasler appeal is a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d Considering our preference for relying on the context in which a statute appears in determining its meaning, <em>see Premachandra, </em>753 F.2d at 638, section 2414 is sufficient to support the result here. We hold that the order dismissing the government\u2019s appeal is a final judgment under section 2412(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">The second issue is whether the district court erred in awarding fees against the government for proceedings at the trial level. First, the government bears the burden of showing that its \u201cposition\u201d was substantially justified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Foley Construction Co. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, </em>716 F.2d 1202, 1204 (8th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1908, 80 L.Ed.2d 457 (1984). In this circuit, the \u201cposition of the United States\u201d includes the government\u2019s position at both the prelitigation and litigation stages. <em>Iowa Express Distribution v. NLRB, </em>739 F.2d 1305, 1309 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed.2d 704 (1984). In determining the justification of this position, the question is \u201cessentially one of reasonableness in law and in fact.\u201d <em>Foley, </em>716 F.2d at 1204; <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4984, 4989. A district court\u2019s award under section 2412(d) will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. IRS, </em>735 F.2d 1277,1278 (11th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. First National Bank, </em>732 F.2d 1444, 1446-47 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">In determining the reasonableness of the government\u2019s position, the legislative history of section 2412(d) is helpful. The House Judiciary Committee stated that the \u201creasonableness\u201d standard \u201cshould not be read to raise a presumption that the Government position was not substantially justified, simply because it lost the case. Nor, in fact, does the standard require the Government to establish that its decision to litigate was based on a substantial probability of prevailing.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1418 at 11, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4990. More specifically, however, the Committee noted that \u201c[cjertain types of case dispositions may indicate that the government action was not substantially justified. A court should look closely at cases, for example, where there has been a judgment on the pleadings or where there is a directed verdict * * *. Such cases clearly raise the possibility that the Government was unreasonable in pursuing the litigation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4889-90. The district court, granted summary judgment for Keasler on the substantive issues in this suit, and this judgment is quite similar to a directed verdict or judgment on the pleadings. <em>See </em>10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2713, at 593-95, \u00a7 2713.1, at 614-16 (1983). Thus, this case is plainly one that Congress envisioned may justify fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-15\">We now explore the substantive justification offered by the government. During the tax periods in question, section 4061(a)(1) imposed an excise tax on manufacturers of truck bodies and chassis. The accompanying Treasury regulation defined \u201cmanufacturer\u201d as \u201cany person who produces a taxable article * * * from new or raw material, by processing, manipulating, or changing the form of an article, or by combining or assembling two or more articles.\u201d Treas.Reg. \u00a7 346.4(a) (1954). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>1969, the IRS determined that combining a hoist with a truck body or chassis constituted manufacturing under the Code. Rev. Rui. 69-195, 1969-1 C.B. 276. In the Tax Reform Act of 1976, however, Congress provided that section 4061(a)(1) was not to apply to resale of an article combined with loading and unloading equipment. I.R.C. \u00a7 4063(d) (1982). In commenting on this amendment, the Joint Committee on Taxation opined that under prior law, \u201cpersons who obtain bodies or chassis and certain parts or accessories from different manufacturers and combine them are considered further manufacturers.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1515, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 497, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 4118, 4200. Based on the 1976 amendments, Rev.Rul. 69-195 was declared obsolete. Rev.Rul. 78-231, 1978-1 C.B. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">. The government urges that it was justified in pressing this litigation because: (1) the legislative history and case law of section 4061(a)(1) indicate that the term \u201cmanufacturer\u201d should be given a broad construction; (2) Rev.Rul. 69-195 was valid during the years in question and entitled to judicial deference; (3) the taxpayer was independently liable on the theory that it changed the \u201ctransportation function\u201d of the vehicle it sold; (4) the legislative history of section 4063(d) indicates post-facto congressional approval of the IRS position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-10\">All of these arguments were either expressly or implicitly rejected by the Tenth Circuit in <em>Jacobs Equipment Co. v. United States, </em>574 F.2d 1040 (10th Cir.1978). On facts virtually identical to those in this case, the court held that attaching a hoist to a truck body did not constitute manufacturing for excise tax purposes. The court specifically declined to follow Rev.Rul. 69-195, noting that it represented only the latest in a series of shifting IRS positions on the subject. <em>Id. </em>at 1042; <em>see </em>Rev.Rul. 59-62, 1959 C.B. 249, 250. The court also rejected the argument that the comments accompanying the passage of section 4063(d) implied congressional approval of Rev.Rul. 69-195, interpreting them as merely recognizing the existence of the regulation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In reaching its conclusion, the Tenth Circuit relied in part on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gamble-Skog-Mo., Inc., </em>91 F.2d 372 (8th Cir.1937), interpreting it to hold that screwing a freezing unit into a cabinet refrigerator is not manufacturing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">Thus, the IRS knew that the basis for its lawsuit against Keasler had been undercut by the <em>Jacobs </em>decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>urges that its decision to proceed below was reasonable nonetheless. The question here does not involve pressing for a de novo evaluation of the propriety of Rev. Rui. 69-195. Nor is there any dispute that <em>Jacobs </em>would have been binding precedent had this case been brought in the Tenth Circuit or that <em>Jacobs </em>is not strictly controlling in this court. Rather, the issue is whether the IRS could have reasonably believed that this court would not follow <em>Jacobs. </em>We conclude that it could not. \u201cThis court has long taken the position that uniformity of decision among the circuits is vitally important on issues concerning the administration of the tax laws.\u201d <em>North American Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Commissioner, </em>533 F.2d 1046, 1051 (8th Cir.1976) (citing <em>Goodenow v. Commissioner, </em>238 F.2d 20, 22 (8th Cir.1956); <em>Birmingham v. Geer, </em>185 F.2d 82, 85 (8th Cir.1950), <em>cert. denied, </em>340 U.S. 951, 71 S.Ct. 571, 95 L.Ed. 686 (1951)). Thus, the tax decisions of other circuits should be followed unless they are \u201cdemonstrably erroneous or there appear cogent reasons for rejecting them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court has followed this rule repeatedly. <em>E.g., United States v. Armature Rewinding Co., </em>124 F.2d 589, 591 (8th Cir.1942); <em>Grain Belt Supply Co. v. Commissioner, </em>109 F.2d 490, 492 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>310 U.S. 648, 60 S.Ct. 1098, 84 L.Ed. 1414 (1940). More recently, this court has reemphasized the need for deference to the other circuits: \u201cAlthough we are not bound by another circuit\u2019s decision, we adhere to the policy that a sister circuit\u2019s reasoned decision deserves great weight and precedential value. As an appellate court, we strive to maintain uniformity in the law among our circuits, wherever reasoned analysis will allow.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Aldens, Inc. v. Miller, </em>610 F.2d 538, 541 (8th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 919, 100 S.Ct. 1853, 64 L.Ed.2d 273 (1980). <em>See generally </em>Vestal, <em>Relitigation by Federal Agencies: Conflict, Concurrence and Synthesis of Judicial Policies, </em>55 N.C.L. Rev. 123, 152-58 (1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This duty applies to the district courts in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-11\">In ruling on the merits, the district court accepted none of the IRS\u2019s contentions and adopted the reasoning and result in <em>Jacobs. </em>The court rejected the validity of Rev.Rul. 69-195, interpreting the addition of section 4063(d) as proof that Congress felt the ruling was an erroneous interpretation of section 4061(a)(1). The court also distinguished cases that the government relied upon in urging a broad interpretation of \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d <em>Keasler v. United States, </em>No. J-C-79-175, slip op. at 2-4 (E.D.Ark. Sept. 30, 1981). The district court reconsidered the merits of the government\u2019s position when ruling on the attorneys\u2019 fees motion. It found that Rev. Rui. 69-195 did not substantially justify the government\u2019s position. The court reasoned that revenue regulations deserve little deference, especially following their rejection by a circuit court of appeals. 585 F.Supp. at 838-39; <em>see Estate of Lang v. Commissioner, </em>64 T.C. 404, 407 (1975) (Tax Court dismissed revenue ruling as \u201csimply the contention of one of the parties to the litigation\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>613 F.2d 770, 776 (9th Cir.1980). Second, the court again distinguished the case law urged by the government in support of its definition of manufacturing. <em>Id. </em>at 840.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>We conclude that the government was unreasonable in pressing this litigation with the hope that <em>Jacobs </em>would be disregarded.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although it argued before the district court that <em>Jacobs </em>was erroneously-decided, its arguments show only a disagreement with the Tenth Circuit rather than that the court\u2019s rationales were demonstrably erroneous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That a case presents an issue of first impression in the forum does not ipso facto make the government\u2019s position in the litigation reasonable. <em>See Devine v. Sutermeister, </em>733 F.2d 892, 895 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Curry v. Block, </em>608 F.Supp. 1407, 1411 (S.D.Ga.1985); <em>Preston v. Heckler, </em>596 F.Supp. 1158, 1160 (D.Alaska 1984); <em>Nunes-Correia v. Haig, </em>543 F.Supp. 812, 820 (D.D.C.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-8\">The government urges that its decision to challenge <em>Jacobs </em>here was substantially justified as part of the IRS enforcement scheme. This system was succinctly described in <em>Divine v. Commissioner, </em>500 F.2d 1041, 1049 (2d Cir.1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-9\">In federal tax cases disputed questions of law are satisfactorily resolved only by U.S. Supreme Court decisions, for the Commissioner has on many occasions taken the position, as he has in this litigation, that a Court of Appeals decision with which he disagrees has no binding effect on the Service\u2019s policies in other circuits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">The Supreme Court will generally grant certiorari in tax cases only when two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>more circuits have adopted conflicting positions. <em>See </em>9 J. Mertens, <em>Law of Federal Income Taxation </em>\u00a7 51.20 (1982); S.Ct.R. 17. Thus, the government contends that it was justified in seeking to establish precedent here to conflict with the <em>Jacobs </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">The government supports this argument with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>464 U.S. 154, 104 S.Ct. 568, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984). The Court held that nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel did not apply to preclude the government from relitigating the constitutionality of certain immigration administrative procedures. The Court relied, in part, on the following reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-6\">A rule allowing nonmutual collateral estoppel against the government * * * would substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue. Allowing only one final adjudication would deprive this Court of the benefit it receives from permitting several courts of appeals to explore a difficult question before this Court grants certiorari. * * * Indeed, if nonmutual collateral estoppel were routinely applied against the government, this Court would have to revise its practice of waiting for a conflict to develop before granting the government\u2019s petitions for certiorari.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1315-7\"><em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 572 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-8\"><em>Mendozo </em>does not settle the issue here. Prohibiting the government from relitigat-ing an issue is considerably different than penalizing an unsuccessful subsequent effort with attorneys\u2019 fees liability. As the court noted in <em>Trujillo v.

The government relies on the legislative history of the current statute to validate its position under the EAJA. The Senate Finance Committee has indicated that: \u201cGenerally, the pursuit of litigation by the government to establish a conflict among the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals would not be unreasonable.\u201d Technical Explanation of Committee Amendment, 127 Cong.Rec.

First, the intent expressed by a Congress subsequent to the enactment of the statute in issue is not probative, much less controlling. <em>See Premachandra v. Mitts, </em>753 F.2d 635, 642 n. 9 (8th Cir.1985) (en banc). Second, the committee\u2019s other comments imply that section 7430 and section 2412(d) contain different substantive standards. While the former requires a showing by the taxpayer that the government acted unreasonably, the latter burdens the government with proving that its conduct was substantially justified. Facially, it would seem easier for the government to show that it acted reasonably than to prove a substantial justification. The Committee thus envisioned that the new law would make it more difficult for taxpayers to prevail. 127 Cong.Rec. at S15594; <em>see </em>Note, <em>supra </em>note 3, at 147-48. A policy of pursuing conflicts among the circuits thus may be reasonable under section 7430, yet lack substantial justification under section 2412(d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, even if pursuing such conflicts may generally be reasonable, the facts of this case show that there is little justification for seeking a conflict regarding the substantive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">The appellate review process in tax cases has been significantly criticized. <em>See </em>Commission on Revision of the Federal Court Appellate System, <em>Structure and Internal Procedures: Recommendations for Change, </em>67 F.R.D. 195, 349-54, 362-69 (1975) (hereinafter cited as <em>Hruska Report)-, </em>Carrington, <em>Crowded Dockets and the Courts of Appeals: The Threat to the Function of Review and the National Law, </em>82 Harv.L.Rev. 542, 608-09 (1969); Miller, <em>A Court of Tax Appeals Revisited, </em>85 Yale L.J. 228 (1975); Vestal, <em>supra, </em>at 124-25; <em>Divine v.

Because the Supreme Court seldom grants review in tax cases, <em>see, e.g., Leading Cases of the 1983 Term, </em>98 Harv.L.Rev. 87, 312 (1984) (only three full opinions rendered dealing with tax cases), taxpayers in different circuits are treated differently and the goal of uniformity in application of the revenue laws is not often attained. As the district court noted, however, it is not the function of the courts to dictate IRS enforcement policy. 585 F.Supp. at 841 n. 10. Nor are we confronted with the issue of whether the IRS is substantially justified in generally seeking to establish a conflict between the circuits.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under the facts of this case, however, we hold that the IRS was not so justified in seeking a conflict. As noted above, the substantive issue in this litigation has effectively been legislatively mooted for tax periods following 1976. Thus, the IRS has conceded that the resolution of the question lacks \u201csufficient administrative importance\u201d and that resolving the issue as to prior tax periods has \u201cminimal importance.\u201d <em>See </em>note 11 <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>importantly, the government\u2019s brief itself derogates the argument that this lawsuit was an important step in creating a meaningful conflict between the circuits. In explaining why the appeal on the merits in this case was dismissed, the government noted that Congress had resolved the issue in the taxpayer\u2019s favor for future years and concluded: \u201cA court of appeals\u2019 decision in such circumstances would have been of no precedential value and, consequently, there was little point in litigating what was in effect a dead issue.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">The purpose of the EAJA was to diminish the deterrent effect that attorneys\u2019 fees may have on challenges to unreasonable government action.

Summary judgment was entered for Keasler on October 2, 1981. Pending a review of the case by the Solicitor General, the government filed a notice of appeal on November 30. On December 21, the government dismissed the appeal following the Solicitor General\u2019s decision not to pursue it. The district court found that the government\u2019s actions on appeal were not substantially justified: \u201cJust because the Justice Department\u2019s internal processes are slow does not exculpate the United States from the consequences of filing frivolous appeals.\u201d 585 F.Supp. at 840. The government challenges this conclusion, arguing that the appeal was dismissed as soon as administratively practicable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-10\">The government\u2019s arguments are not convincing. First, if the trial position of the government was unreasonable, an appeal based on that position is a fortiori not substantially justified. Second, as noted above, the government has conceded on this appeal that a court of appeals decision on the merits in this case would have served \u201clittle point.\u201d The government contends, however, that \u201cit was not the intent of the [drafters of the] EAJA to penalize the Government by making it pay attorney\u2019s fees where it terminates an otherwise meritorious lawsuit for legitimate reasons.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 13-14. This statement is a mischaracterization of the issue. The government is not being penalized for terminating the appeal, but for filing it. Moreover, the suit was not \u201cotherwise meritorious,\u201d because the government\u2019s position in the district court and pre-trial was not reasonable. Finally, we recognize the channels in which admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>istrative decisions in the Department of Justice must flow. Nevertheless, the government has already received special dispensation in this regard through the federal rules. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1) gives the government twice as long as the private litigant to file notice of appeal. If the government cannot make its strategic decisions within this time and a protective notice must be filed and later dismissed, there is no reason that the private litigant should be forced to pay attorneys\u2019 fees for a meaningless appeal. We conclude, therefore, that the government\u2019s appeal was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">.

On December 15, 1981, counsel for the IRS recommended that the district court judgment here not be appealed. He stated that the \u201cquestion of further manufacturing in the factual context of this case is no longer continuing. We would prefer to litigate the further manufacturing issue in a factual context having continuing importance to avoid another <em>Jacobs Equipment Co. </em>decision holding that further manufacturing turns on the complexity and time involved in the process.\u201d Action on Decision Memorandum (Dec. 15, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1317-8\">.

Thus, our holding should not necessarily be read as contrary to decisions declining to award fees to victims of government attempts to secure changes in existing law. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number><em>e.g., Hoang Ha v.

Our holding is not in conflict with <em>Cornelia v. Schweiker, </em>741 F.2d 170 (8th Cir.1984) <em>(Cornelia II). </em>In <em>Cornelia v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978 (8th Cir.1984) <em>(Cornelia I), </em>the claimant appealed the denial of her application for attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA, prevailed on most of the legal issues, and was awarded fees. In <em>Cornelia II, </em>the issue was whether the government's position on appeal in <em>Cornelia I </em>was substantially justified. The court held that the government had acted reasonably. First, it was observed that prior to <em>Cornelia I </em>the Secretary had \u201cno guidance from this circuit\u201d in applying the EAJA to Social Security cases. 741 F.2d at 172. Second, the court found it significant that the Secretary had been defending rather than appealing. Finally, the court stated that \"merely because the issues had been decided adversely to the Secretary in other circuits does not necessarily make her position on these same issues in our court unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172 n. 3 (citing <em>United States v.

First, in light of this circuit\u2019s strong policy of avoiding conflicts with other circuits in tax cases, it cannot fairly be said that the IRS had \u201cno guidance\u201d as to whether this court would follow <em>Jacobs. </em>Second, the IRS was not simply defending its success in a judgment below, as in <em>Cornelia II, </em>but pursuing Keasler in an attempt to \u201cresurrect its own discredited version of the law.\u201d 585 F.Supp. at 839. Finally, the substantive issues in this case lack continuing vitality in light of tax law amendments, which makes further litigation less reasonable than in <em>Cornelia II.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1318-13\">.
