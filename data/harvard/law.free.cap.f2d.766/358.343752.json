After carefully reviewing the issues raised by Gant on appeal, we find that:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">(1) The district court had jurisdiction to address Gant\u2019s disparate treatment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. <em>Taylor v. Jones, </em>653 F.2d 1193 (8th Cir.1981). Accordingly, we need not decide whether there was jurisdiction for the disparate treatment claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1982, 1983, 2000d or 2000e. <em>See Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 305 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2368 n. 3, 76 L.Ed.2d 586, 594 n. 3 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">(2) The district court did not clearly err in finding that race was not a factor in NEANG\u2019s decision to revise Air National Guard Regulation (ANGR) 39-06, <em>as amended by </em>TAG-NE Supplement 1, and to \u201cnon-retain\u201d Gant under this revised regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">(3) Assuming without deciding that we have jurisdiction to review Gant\u2019s due process claim, <em>cf. Chappell, </em>462 U.S. 296, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586, the court did not err in finding that Gant was accorded all the process that was due in his non-retention \u201cwithout cause\u201d and with retirement benefits under ANGR 39-06, <em>as amended by </em>TAG-NE Supplement 1, <em>see e.g., Navas v. Gonzalez Vales, </em>752 F.2d 765, 768 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order appellee\u2019s counsel to recuse himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. Rule 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-13\">. The Honorable Robert Van Pelt, Senior District Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\">. Gant's brief on appeal suggests that he also raised a disparate impact claim. However, we agree with the district court that Gant\u2019s complaint does not present a disparate impact claim. Rather, Gant tried to prove his disparate treatment claim by showing the presence of a racially discriminatory atmosphere at NEANG.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
