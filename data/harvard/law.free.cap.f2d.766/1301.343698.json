In 1972, The Labor Management Adjustment Board, established by the parties to interpret and apply the MLA, adopted a resolution that the contractor shall pay fringe benefit contributions for \u201ceach and every\u201d hour worked by the employee, unless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaEb\">an employee is paid by salary or any other method than hourly wages, then the employee shall be presumed to have worked for a minimum of forty (40) hours during each week of such employ-. ment and payment, and the fringe bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number><em>fit </em>contributions shall be paid <em>for </em>all such hours.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-4\">Charles Minor Equipment Rental, Inc. is a California corporation bound by the MLA. Charles Minor, the president and sole shareholder of Minor Equipment, owns a piece of heavy construction equipment and rents out his services and the equipment. The work performed by Charles Minor is subject to the MLA and it is undisputed that he is paid by a method other than hourly wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">The Trusts audited Minor Equipment in February 1983 and found that it was reporting the minimum 200 hours per quarter necessary to retain benefits for Charles Minor and that, according to billing invoices, he worked in excess of the hours reported for him. The Trusts filed suit against Minor Equipment pursuant to section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), and section 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3), for $17,923.59 in unpaid fringe benefits, interest, and liquidated damages based upon the difference between the reported hours and the 40-hour presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">The trusts contended that the 40-hour presumption was conclusive. The district court, Tashima, J., held 1) that <em>Sapper v. Lenco Blade Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir.1983), controlled and therefore the LMAB resolution created a rebuttable, rather than conclusive, presumption 2) that the Trusts were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue and 3) that Minor had introduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, although it found that Charles Minor had worked more hours than had been reported to the Trusts. Accordingly, the court awarded the Trusts $4,672.13. It awarded $1,065.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(2)(D), rather than the $4,256.25 requested because of the Trusts\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to recognize \u201cthe binding effect of <em>Lenco Blade.\u201d </em>The Trusts appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-8\">Questions of law, including the principles of contract interpretation to be applied, are reviewed <em>de novo. InterPetrol Bermuda, Ltd. v. Kaiser Aluminum Int\u2019l Corp., </em>719 F.2d 992, 998 (9th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Id.; United States v. One Twin Engine Beech Airplane, </em>533 F.2d 1106, 1107-08 (9th Cir.1976). The district court\u2019s determination that Minor had introduced sufficient evidence to rebut the 40-hour presumption represents a mixed question involving \u201cthe application of law to fact,\u201d which we generally review <em>de novo. United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1200-04 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984). Because of the special need for uniform interpretation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, <em>see, e.g., Kemmis v. McGoldrick, </em>706 F.2d 993, 996-97 (9th Cir.1983), we review the court\u2019s determination that a contractor has rebutted the LMAB 40-hour presumption <em>de novo. See Sapper v. Lenco Blade, Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-12\">The district court\u2019s holding that the 40-hour presumption was rebuttable was based upon <em>Sapper v. Lenco Blade, Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir.1983), which it found to be controlling. In <em>Lenco Blade, </em>the Trusts brought suit against a contractor-sole employee for insufficient fringe benefit contributions based upon the LMAB 40-hour presumption. The employee took periodic \u201cdraws\u201d from Lenco as compensation. Both parties moved for summary judgment and attorney\u2019s fees. The district court granted Lenco\u2019s motion and awarded it attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-13\">On appeal, we held that summary judgment was inappropriate and remanded the case. <em>Id. </em>at 1071-72. We found that whether the employee \u201cwas paid by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>\u2018method other than hourly wages\u2019 \u201d \u2014 so that the 40-hour presumption applied \u2014 was disputed. We held that the presumption was rebuttable and found that whether Lenco Blade had rebutted the presumption was at issue. To reach this conclusion, we distinguished three previous decisions relied upon by the Trusts to establish that the presumption was conclusive. <em>See Waggoner v. William Radkovich Co., </em>620 F.2d 206 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Burke v. Lenihan, </em>606 F.2d 840 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Waggoner v. C &amp; D Pipeline Co., </em>601 F.2d 456 (9th Cir.1979). They were \u201cinapposite ... because they involved employees who <em>indisputably </em>worked forty hours per week.\u201d 704 F.2d at 1072. Those cases consider whether an employer must contribute for all the hours worked by a full-time employee who splits his worktime between a position subject to the MLA and a position that is not covered. <em>See Waggoner v. Dallaire, </em>649 F.2d 1362, 1369 (9th Cir.1981) (interpreting <em>Radkovich, Burke, </em>and <em>C &amp; D Pipeline).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">The Trusts argue that <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s interpretation of the LMAB resolution is dicta. This position is premised on limiting the holding to a reversal of the summary judgment because the method of payment was in dispute. In so arguing for a limiting of the holding, however, the Trusts ignore the court\u2019s direction that the district court, if it found that Sapper was paid on a basis other than hourly, next determine whether the presumption of forty hours was rebutted. This clear direction to the district court on how to proceed continues to be binding precedent, even if characterized as an alternative holding. It was based on the finding that there was a genuine issue of material fact on the question of whether Lenco had rebutted the 40-hour presumption. Even if it had been undisputed that the employee was paid by a method other than hourly wages, a remand would still have been required to determine whether Lenco had rebutted the 40-hour presumption. Conversely, if the method of payment had been undisputed and we had found the presumption to be conclusive, we could have affirmed the summary judgment without the necessity of a remand. <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s interpretation of the LMAB 40-hour presumption is res judicata. <em>See Russell v. C.I.R., </em>678 F.2d 782, 785 n. 2 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Dragor Shipping Corp. v. Union Tank Car Co., </em>371 F.2d 722, 726 (9th Cir.1967) (\u201cWhere an appellate court decision rests on two or more grounds, none can be relegated to the category of <em>obiter dictum.\u201d). </em>That interpretation is \u201cthe settled Ninth Circuit rule\u201d on the MLA provision at issue and the district court properly applied it. <em>See Dal-laire, </em>649 F.2d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">Subsequent cases have delineated the inapplicability of the <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>line of cases relied on by the Trusts to the issue whether the 40-hour presumption can be rebutted for employees who work less than full-time. <em>See Kemmis v. McGoldrick, </em>706 F.2d 993, 997 (9th Cir.1983) (citing <em>C &amp; D </em>for the limited proposition that \u201cfor <em>full-time </em>salaried employees, employers are required to contribute based on 40 hours per week\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also Dal-laire, </em>649 F.2d at 1369. <em>Kemmis </em>is particularly significant because it was decided after <em>Lenco Blade: </em>its narrow reading of <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>avoided any conflict with <em>Lenco Blade. </em>The only case in which we have addressed the question whether the 40-hour presumption is rebuttable is <em>Lenco Blade. </em>The district court did not err in holding that it controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">The Trusts alternatively contend that, assuming the presumption is rebuttable, Minor failed to produce sufficient evidence to rebut it. The Trusts assert that the presumption can only be rebutted by substantial, specific, and comprehensive evidence relying upon <em>Parsons Corp. of California v. Director, Office of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Programs, </em>619 F.2d 38, 41 (9th Cir.1980). <em>Parsons Corp. </em>involved a statutory presumption that controlled \u201cin the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary,\u201d and therefore is of no assistance in interpreting the LMAB 40-hour presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">The district court concluded that Minor\u2019s Exhibit 108, a summary of Minor\u2019s billing invoices and job tickets prepared by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>Charles Minor\u2019s wife, Sheila, and the testimony of Sheila Minor constituted sufficient evidence to rebut the 40-hour presumption. In resolving the ultimate factual issue of how many hours Charles Minor actually worked, the court noted that Minor\u2019s Exhibit 108 was \u201cnot entirely reliable.\u201d Instead, it found that the total number of hours worked by Minor was \u201caccurately reflected\u201d in the Trusts\u2019 Exhibit 20B, a month-by-month list of the minimum hours that Charles Minor could have worked, computed by dividing Minor\u2019s bank deposits by the maximum hourly rental rate obtained by Minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">Because the court found that Minor\u2019s evidence was not entirely reliable, the Trusts argue that the court should have found insufficient evidence to rebut the 40-hour presumption. To rebut the presumption the employer need only \u201cpresent evidence raising a genuine issue.\u201d <em>See Casillas v. United States Navy, </em>735 F.2d 338, 343 (9th Cir.1984); <em>National Industries, Inc. v. Republic Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>677 F.2d 1258, 1266 (9th Cir.1982); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 301, Notes of Conference Committee, House Rep. No. 93-1597 (if adverse party offers evidence contradicting the presumed fact, the trier of fact cannot presume its existence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">The trial court finding thp,t Minor\u2019s evidence did not resolve the ultimate factual issue of the actual number of hours that Minor worked does not contradict its decision that the evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption that Charles Minor worked 40 hours a week. <em>See Casillas, </em>735 F.2d at 343 (to rebut presumption of discrimination in Title VII action, employer need not \u201cpresent clear and convincing evidence,\u201d nor persuade the trier of fact). Minor worked substantially less than 40 hours a week. The district court\u2019s finding of fact that Minor worked less than 40 hours is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512-13, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">Minor Equipment characterizes the Trusts\u2019 appeal as a frivolous attempt to relitigate <em>Lenco Blade </em>and seeks attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), we have discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing employer in an appeal. <em>Carpenters Southern California Admin. Corp. v. Russell, </em>726 F.2d 1410, 1417 (9th Cir.1984). Our discretion is guided by the considerations described in <em>Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 453 (9th Cir.1980). Those considerations \u201cvery frequently suggest that attorney\u2019s fees should not be charged against ERISA plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Operating Engineers Pension Trust v. Gilliam, </em>737 F.2d 1501, 1505-06 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">We disagree with Minor\u2019s characterization of this appeal as frivolous. In addition to a question of <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s preclusive effect, there was the issue of what evidence is required to rebut the 40-hour presumption. The Trusts\u2019 counsel were not acting in bad faith. <em>See Russell, </em>726 F.2d at 1415. We make no award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1383-14\">.

The majority offers two inconsistent rationales to justify its conclusion that the MLA\u2019s 40-hour presumption is rebuttable, rather than conclusive. Neither of these is convincing, or consistent with this circuit\u2019s prior cases. The majority seems determined to circumvent our holding in <em>Waggoner v. C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>601 F.2d 456 (9th Cir.1979), where we ruled that the LMAB\u2019s 40-hour presumption is conclusive. Because I conclude that <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>controls this case, and that the discussion of the 40-hour presumption in <em>Sapper v. Lenco Blade, Inc., </em>704 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir.1983), upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>which the majority relies, is dicta, I would require Minor Equipment to pay 40 hours worth of fringe benefit contributions for every week that Charles Minor worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\"><em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>involved a salaried employee, Donald J. Stark, who divided his time between work covered by the MLA and work it did not cover. 601 F.2d at 457-58. The district court ruled that Stark\u2019s employer, C &amp; D, was obligated to pay fringe benefit contributions for only those hours during which he performed work covered by the MLA. This court reversed, holding that the LMAB resolution \u201crequire[d] employers to make contributions for <em>all </em>hours worked by employees who perform <em>any </em>work covered by the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">However, we did not remand to the district court to determine the total number of hours that Stark worked, even though this information did not appear in the record. Instead, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-6\">Because Stark was a <em>salaried employee, </em>C &amp; D was required to make contributions for Stark <em>based on a minimum of forty hours per week.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We treated the 40-hour presumption as conclusive in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline: </em>we did not provide C &amp; D with an opportunity to introduce evidence that Stark worked fewer than 40 hours per week. This interpretation of the 40-hour presumption was a holding in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>since it was necessary to the outcome of the case and controlled the amount of damages that were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">The majority seeks to avoid <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>'s holding first by claiming that in <em>Lenco Blade, </em>this court \u201cdistinguished\u201d <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>and \u201cheld\u201d the 40-hour presumption to be rebuttable in all cases. The majority quotes <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s statement that our decisions in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>and two other cases, <em>Waggoner v. Wm. Radkovich Co., </em>620 F.2d 206 (9th Cir.1980), and <em>Burke v. Lenihan, </em>606 F.2d 840 (9th Cir.1979), were \u201cinapposite [in resolving the <em>Lenco Blade </em>case] ... because they involved employees who <em>indisputably </em>worked forty hours per week.\u201d 704 F.2d at 1072 (emphasis in original). If that were an accurate characterization of the facts in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>this court would have had no need to apply the 40-hour presumption in that case. If Stark indisputably worked 40 hours per week, C &amp; D would have been required to make 40 hours worth of contributions for him without ever applying the 40-hour presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-10\">However, <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s characterization of the facts in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>upon which the majority relies, is not accurate. The decision in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>nowhere states or implies that Stark worked 40 hours per week, much less that this fact was undisputed. <em>See generally C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>601 F.2d at 457-59. Nor do the other two cases purportedly \u201cdistinguished\u201d by <em>Lenco Blade </em>indicate that the employees they involved worked 40 hours per week. <em>See generally Wm. Radkovich, </em>620 F.2d at 206-07; <em>Burke, </em>606 F.2d at 841. This court\u2019s language in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>is absolutely clear that it was <em>\u201c[bjecause Stark was a salaried employee,\u201d </em>and therefore covered by the LMAB presumption, that \u201cC &amp; D was required to make contributions for [him] based on a minimum of forty hours per week\u201d \u2014 not, as the majority and <em>Lenco Blade </em>suggest, because Stark indisputably worked 40 hours per week. 601 F.2d at 459 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s attempts to characterize <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s statements concerning the LMAB resolution as a holding, rather than dicta, are simply unconvincing. In <em>Lenco Blade, </em>the district court had granted summary judgment against the Trusts on their claims for unpaid fringe benefit contributions for Lenco Blade\u2019s sole employee and president, Mr. Cuillerier. <em>Lenco Blade, </em>704 F.2d at 1071-73. This court concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed concerning the threshold question of whether Cuillerier was paid hourly wages or on some other basis: if he was paid hourly wages, the 40-hour presumption would not apply. We remanded for a determination on that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1071-72. The additional statements in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number><em>Lenco Blade </em>concerning the 40-hour presumption were not the basis of the remand, and were intended to apply only if the district court made a specific determination \u2014i.e., that Cuillerier was paid on a non-hourly basis \u2014 after the case had been remanded. Since these statements were not necessary to the decision in <em>Lenco Blade, </em>they were merely advisory, and have no binding or precedential impact in the present case. <em>See United States v. Frue-hauf, </em>365 U.S. 146,157, 81 S.Ct. 547, 553, 5 L.Ed.2d 476 (1961). Because these advisory statements in <em>Lenco Blade </em>directly contradict our holding in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>we must apply the holding of <em>C &amp; D Pipeline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">The majority is somewhat disingenuous in referring to <em>Lenco </em>Blade\u2019s interpretation of the 40-hour presumption as \u201cthe settled Ninth Circuit rule,\u201d and citing our decision in <em>Waggoner v. Dallaire, </em>649 F.2d 1362, 1369 (9th Cir.1981) for this proposition. <em>Dallaire </em>involved completely different issues from those in the present case, and its reference to a \u201csettled Ninth Circuit rule\u201d is an allusion to <em>C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>not <em>Lenco Blade, </em>which was decided two years after <em>Dallaire. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">The majority\u2019s problems multiply when it attempts to reconcile its decision with our opinion in <em>Kemmis v. McGoldrick, </em>706 F.2d 993 (9th Cir.1983), which was issued a month after <em>Lenco Blade </em>and did not even refer to that decision. <em>Kemmis </em>involved an employee who indisputably worked full-time, <em>id. </em>at 995, and cited <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>for the proposition that \u201c[f]or full-time salaried employees, employers are required to contribute based on 40 hours per week.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 997 (citing <em>C-&amp; D Pipeline). Kem-mis </em>thus interpreted the 40-hour presumption as being conclusive, and read <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>as reaching the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">In attempting to reconcile <em>Kemmis, </em>the majority appears to concede that both <em>Kemmis </em>and <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>interpret the 40-hour presumption as being conclusive, at least in certain cases. However, the majority contends that <em>Kemmis </em>limits <em>C &amp; D Pipeline\u2019s </em>applicability to cases involving <em>full-time </em>employees, and states that <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>is not applicable \u201cto the issue whether the 40-hour presumption can be rebutted for employees who work less than full-time.\u201d Thus, the majority appears to maintain that the LMAB\u2019s 40-hour presumption is conclusive for full-time employees, as in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>and <em>Kemmis, </em>but rebuttable for those who work less than full-time, as in <em>Lenco Blade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">This proposed interpretation presents several difficulties. First, it directly contradicts the majority\u2019s own interpretation of <em>Lenco Blade </em>as establishing that the 40-hour presumption is rebuttable in all cases. Moreover, nothing in <em>Lenco Blade </em>indicates that that decision was intended to apply only to part-time employees. Second, the majority\u2019s interpretation directly contradicts its characterization of <em>C &amp; D Pipeline, </em>which it borrowed from <em>Lenco Blade, </em>as a case that did not even involve application of the 40-hour presumption. Third, the majority\u2019s proposed interpretation is completely unsupported by the wording of the LMAB resolution, which draws no distinction between full-time and part-time employees, and only distinguishes between employees paid by hourly wages and those who are not. The majority thus is imposing a distinction upon the parties to the LMAB resolution that they did not intend. Finally, nothing in the record indicates that Charles Minor would not qualify under the majority\u2019s definition as a \u201cfull-time\u201d employee of Minor Equipment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so it is possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>ble that even accepting the majority\u2019s reading of <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>and <em>Kemmis, </em>the 40-hour presumption would apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Given the wording of the LMAB resolution, it is far more reasonable to interpret the reference to \u201cfull-time\u201d employees in <em>Kemmis </em>as a reflection of <em>the specific facts in that case, </em>rather than as an attempt to introduce a new distinction into interpretation of the 40-hour presumption. Moreover, the <em>Kemmis </em>court\u2019s failure even to mention <em>Lenco Blade </em>suggests that it considered <em>Lenco </em>Blade's statements about the 40-hour presumption to be merely advisory, as contrasted to the controlling precedent in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">Because our decisions in <em>C &amp; D Pipeline </em>and <em>Kemmis </em>indicate that we have interpreted the LMAB resolution\u2019s 40-hour presumption to be conclusive both <em>before </em>and <em>after </em>our decision in <em>Lenco Blade, </em>I would conclude that we are bound to interpret the presumption as being conclusive in this case. The majority allows a little careless advice in <em>Lenco Blade, </em>which is unsupported in any of our other decisions, to distort the facts and the holdings of this circuit\u2019s cases. I find that unfortunate. I would require Minor Equipment to pay 40 hours worth of fringe benefit contributions for every week that Charles Minor worked.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">. The majority nowhere explains the meaning of the term \"full-time employee\u201d for purposes of applying the 40-hour presumption under its proposed interpretation. If the term signifies only employees who work 40 hours per week, then under the majority's interpretation, the conclusive presumption essentially is meaningless: it would simply provide that if the Trusts can establish that an employee works 40 hours per week, he will be presumed to work 40 hours per week. Moreover, it would reduce to a truism Kemmis\u2019s statement that \u201c[f]or full-time salaried employees, employers [must] contribute based on 40 hours per week.\" 706 F.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-10\">Thus, it would be more plausible to interpret the term \"full-time employee\u201d in this context as applying to some employees who work less than 40 hours per week. As a result, it is not clear from the record in this case or from the majori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>ty\u2019s opinion whether Charles Minor should be considered a \"full-time\u201d employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
