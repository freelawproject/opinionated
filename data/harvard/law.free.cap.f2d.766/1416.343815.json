The dis-positive issue on appeal is whether the administrative claim filed by the Arvayos was timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-23\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On January 30, 1979, Tina Arvayo brought Jose, Jr., then five months old, to Dr. De-Poe at the McConnell Air Force Base Hospital because he was cranky and had been suffering from a fever for nine days. After briefly examining Jose, Dr. DePoe diagnosed his condition as an upper respiratory infection (URI) \u2014 a virus \u2014 for which he prescribed Triaminic Concentrate, and directed Tina Arvayo to return with Jose in a week if his condition had not improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-24\">By 11:00 a.m. the next morning, January 31,1979, Jose\u2019s condition had worsened significantly. His eyes were crossed, and he was suffering from convulsions. Tina Ar-vayo returned with him to the McConnell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>hospital, where an emergency room physician, Dr. Pascua, immediately recognized that Jose\u2019s condition was critical. Preliminarily diagnosing Jose\u2019s condition as bacterial meningitis, Dr. Pascua transferred Jose to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, a civilian hospital, for more specialized care. At St. Joseph\u2019s several doctors examined Jose during the course of the afternoon. Their \u201cworking diagnosis\u201d of bacterial meningitis was confirmed at approximately 6:00 p.m. after Dr. Butler, who had taken Jose\u2019s history from Tina Arvayo earlier that afternoon, performed a spinal tap.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">The history taken by Dr. Butler and signed by him and Dr. Abbas, a neurologist primarily in charge of Jose\u2019s care at St. Joseph\u2019s, reveals that both doctors were aware Jose had been taken to McConnell the day before and had been given Triaminic for treatment. They also were aware that within the prior two weeks, though not the day before, doctors at McConnell had diagnosed his condition as an URL (R.Vol. 1 at 7; Vol. 15 at 370.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">By August, 1979, the Arvayos were aware that Jose had suffered significant brain damage from the meningitis. Between January, 1979, and August, 1981, however, the Arvayos made no inquiries as to the propriety, or impropriety, of Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis and treatment on January 30, 1979. Furthermore, no doctor familiar with the case volunteered such information. In August, 1981, Tina Arvayo consulted her attorney in the present case because she and her husband were dissatisfied with the government insurance coverage of Jose\u2019s medical expenses. The attorney was with a medical malpractice firm that had previously handled cases involving delayed diagnosis of meningitis. After informing Tina Arvayo of the possible connection between delayed diagnosis of meningitis and mental retardation, the attorney and his firm were retained to handle the case. Thereafter, on December 16, 1981, the Arvayos filed their administrative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-6\">After their administrative claim was denied, the Arvayos brought suit in federal district court alleging that Dr. DePoe\u2019s failure to timely diagnose and treat the meningitis was the cause of Jose\u2019s retardation. Rejecting as biased the testimony of Government doctors that Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis and treatment had not fallen below prevailing community standards, the district court found that Jose was suffering from meningitis on January 30, 1979, that the standard in the community would have been to diagnose the condition, and that had the condition been diagnosed and treated the day before, Jose probably would not have suffered the severely disabling injuries he now lives with. Memorandum and Order, United States District Court for the District of Kansas (February 23, 1984), at 19 [hereinafter \u201cMemorandum Opinion\u201d]. Further, the district court found that \u201cthe [Arvayos] were never timely apprised of any reason to suspicion the significance of the event with Dr. DePoe on January 30, 1979, until [Tina Arvayo] visited an attorney in the summer of 1981.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36. This finding was based upon the court\u2019s observation of the Arvayos and conclusion that they were \u201cquite young, wholly trusting of authority, particularly medical persons,\u201d and that \u201c[n]o one has suggested any relationship between the child\u2019s plight and a delay in diagnosis. It is doubtful if any of the treating physicians had even heard of Dr. DePoe, the estent of his care and treatment; and most assuredly, no one had volunteered a relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court thus ruled that the cause of action accrued in August, 1981, when the Arvayos were informed of the significance of delay in the diagnosis of meningitis cases. <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-9\">The purpose behind 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) \u2014 the limitations provision of the FTCA \u2014 \u201cis to require the reasonably diligent presentation of tort claims against the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. at 111, 123, 100 S.Ct. at 352, 360, 62 L.Ed.2d at 259 (1979). Section 2401(b), like statutes of limitations generally, represents a \u201clegislative judgment that it is unjust to fail to put the adversary on notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>defend within a specified period of time,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 117, 100 S.Ct. at 356, and that \u201cthe right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\u201d <em>Railway Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, </em>321 U.S. at 342, 349, 64 S.Ct. at 582, 586, 88 L.Ed. at 788 (1944). Furthermore, because the statute waives the sovereign immunity of the United States, courts should be mindful to construe it in a manner which neither extends nor narrows the waiver Congress intended. <em>Kubrick, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 117-118, 100 S.Ct. at 356-357, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">Unfortunately, however, the legislative history to \u00a7 2401(b) is silent as to the meaning of \u201caccrues.\u201d <em>See Kubrick, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 119, 100 S.Ct. at 357. Consequently, the Court in <em>Kubrick </em>adopted the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d prevailing among the circuits at the time that a cause of action accrues under the FTCA when \u201cthe plaintiff has discovered both his injury and its cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120, 100 S.Ct. at 358. Kubrick\u2019s cause of action was held to have accrued when he was informed by a civilian doctor that the neomycin treatment prescribed by a VA doctor for treatment of a femur infection following surgery had caused his hearing loss. Accrual, according to the Court, did not await Kubrick\u2019s awareness that prescription of neomycin for the infection was improper (a negligent act). Once Kubrick was aware of these \u201ccritical facts\u201d underlying his injury and its cause, reasoned the Court, he could inquire in the medical and legal community as to whether his injury had been negligently inflicted. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 100 S.Ct. at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-6\">Both the Government and the Arvayos rely on <em>Kubrick </em>for their respective positions. Although they agree as to the injury in this case \u2014 mental retardation\u2014 they disagree as to the \u201ccause\u201d of the injury. The Government argues that the cause of Jose\u2019s retardation was bacterial meningitis. Because the Arvayos were informed by doctors as early as January 31, 1979, that Jose was suffering from meningitis, and because those same doctors informed the Arvayos throughout Jose\u2019s treatment at St. Joseph\u2019s of the probability of brain damage as a result of the meningitis, the Government contends that the claim accrued no later than August, 1979, when the Arvayos were informed that Jose had in fact suffered brain damage. The Government asserts that such a result is dictated by this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gustavson v. United States, </em>655 F.2d 1034 (10th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-8\">The Arvayos, on the other hand, argue that the Government\u2019s chacterization of the cause of the injury is overly simplistic. They contend that the cause of Jose\u2019s retardation was not simply the meningitis; the cause of his injury was also Dr. De-Poe\u2019s failure to diagnose his condition as meningitis and to treat it appropriately on January 30, 1979. The Arvayos assert that there is a basic theoretical distinction between malpractice cases involving a \u201ccommission\u201d \u2014 an affirmative act which results in clearly identifiable injuries \u2014 and malpractice cases involving an \u201comission,\u201d i.e., a failure to diagnose, treat, or warn. <em>Kubrick, </em>the Arvayos assert, involved a situation in which the neomycin treatment \u2014 an affirmative act \u2014 administered by the VA doctors resulted in Kubrick\u2019s clearly identifiable hearing loss. Such is a case of \u201ccommission,\u201d argue the Arvayos, and should be distinguished from cases in which a plaintiff is aware of the bare medical cause of his or her injury, but is unaware of the omissions, or misdiagnoses, on the part of the treating physicians that exacerbated a previous condition. In fact, argue the Ar-vayos, the Supreme Court recognized such a distinction in <em>Kubrick:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1481-9\">That [a plaintiff] has been injured in fact may be unknown or unknowable until the injury manifests itself; and the facts about causation may be in the control of the putative defendant, unavailable to the plaintiff or very difficult to obtain. The prospect is not so bleak for a plaintiff in possession of the critical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflicted the injury. He is no longer at the mercy of the latter. There are others who can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>tell him if he has been wronged, and he need only ask.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">444 U.S. at 122, 100 S.Ct. at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">We agree with the Arvayos insofar as they interpret <em>Kubrick\u2019s </em>use of the word \u201ccause\u201d to mean more than mere awareness of the medical cause in cases involving a failure to diagnose, treat, or warn. To a certain extent <em>Kubrick, </em>even though a case of commission, supports such a conclusion. There, the Court described the cause of Kubrick\u2019s hearing loss as \u201cthe neomycin treatment <em>administered </em>by the hospital.\u201d 444 U.S. at 114, 100 S.Ct. at 355. (Emphasis added.) Although Kubrick\u2019s hearing loss was caused directly by neomycin, both the drug itself and the hospital\u2019s affirmative action in administering that drug could be said to be \u201ccauses\u201d of Kubrick\u2019s injury. In other words, more than one factor can be viewed as the \u201ccause\u201d of an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-6\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, we believe that this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gus-tavson, supra, </em>provides direct support for the proposition that the term \u201ccause\u201d in these' cases includes more than just the medical cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. As a child, the plaintiff in <em>Gustavson </em>had seen several military doctors for what his parents believed to be unrelated ailments. He consulted some of these doctors for a severe bedwetting problem; others were consulted concerning a painful mass in his neck and a fever. All of these military doctors failed to diagnose these ailments as symptoms of vesico-ureteral reflux and the infection associated with it. In 1973 the plaintiff finally consulted with civilian doctors who correctly diagnosed and treated the condition by reimplanting his ureters. These civilian doctors also informed the plaintiff that the operation could have been done years before and that his kidneys had been damaged as a result of the long-continued reflux. <em>Gustavson, supra, </em>655 F.2d at 1036. Four years later, in 1977, the plaintiff filed his administrative claim. Not long thereafter, following kidney failure and dialysis treatment, he died as a result of complications associated with his kidney failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-9\"><em>Gustavson </em>was thus a case involving multiple misdiagnoses \u2014 multiple omissions. For present purposes, however, <em>Gustavson </em>is important for the manner in which this court described the plaintiff\u2019s injury and its cause. There, applying the <em>Kubrick </em>definition of the word \u201caccrues,\u201d we held that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued when he \u201cknew of the injury (damage to his kidneys) and the cause (failure to correct his ureter disorder at an earlier stage).\u201d 655 F.2d at 1036-1037. <em>Gustavson </em>thus recognized that the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s kidney damage was not simply vesico-ureteral reflux and its associated infection; the cause of his condition was also the military doctors\u2019 \u201cfailure to correct his ureter disorder at an earlier stage.\u201d <em>Accord Waits v. United States, </em>611 F.2d 550, 552 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cIt is not enough to trigger the statute of limitations that the claimant is aware of his injury if he is unaware of the act or omission which caused the injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-10\">Applying <em>Gustavson </em>to the facts of the present case, we must reject the Government\u2019s contention that \u201cbacterial meningitis\u201d was the sole cause of Jose\u2019s injuries. The district court found that had Dr. De-Poe properly diagnosed and treated Jose\u2019s condition on January 30, 1979, Jose would not suffer from the disabling injuries he now endures. There is thus a direct link between Dr. DePoe\u2019s misdiagnosis and Jose\u2019s injuries. This is not to say, however, that Dr. DePoe\u2019s omissions were the sole cause of Jose\u2019s injuries. Had Jose not been suffering from meningitis at the time Dr. DePoe examined him, there could be no \u201comission\u201d on Dr. DePoe\u2019s part on which to premise liability. There were therefore two causes which combined together to produce a single injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1482-11\">That we have concluded the district court correctly determined that Dr. DePoe\u2019s misdiagnosis was a cause of Jose\u2019s injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>does not, however, end the inquiry. We must further determine whether, under the circumstances of this case, the Arvayos had a duty to inquire as to the cause of Jose\u2019s injuries earlier than the date they consulted their attorney upon another matter. Although the imposition of a duty to inquire as to causation may appear to be a departure from the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kubrick </em>that once a plaintiff is aware of the existence of his or her injury and its cause, he or she is under a duty to make inquiries as to whether the injury was a result of <em>negligence, </em>in the context of failure to diagnose, treat, and warn cases such an extension of the duty seems unavoidable. The mere characterization of the \u201ccause\u201d of an injury in cases of this type as a \u201cfailure\u201d or an \u201comission\u201d implies in a very real sense that the doctor did not do something that he or she had a duty to do. Although, as a theoretical matter, a doctor\u2019s failure to detect an illness does not necessarily mean community standards of due care have been breached, we conclude that in the context of determining when a cause of action accrues any attempt to distinguish the two concepts would be largely futile. The existence of this dilemma was recognized by the dissenters in <em>Kubrick: </em>\u201cIn my judgment a fair application of [the \u201cblameless ignorance\u201d] rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> forecloses the Court\u2019s attempt to distinguish between a plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the cause of his injury on the one hand and his knowledge of the doctor\u2019s failure to meet acceptable medical standards on the other,\u201d 444 U.S. at 127, 100 S.Ct. at 361 (Stevens, J. dissenting); arguably, this dilemma was also implicitly recognized by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1483-5\">As the dissent suggests ... we are thus in partial disagreement with the conclusion of the lower courts that Kubrick exercised all reasonable diligence. <em>Although he diligently ascertained the cause of his injury, </em>he sought no advice within two years thereafter as to whether he had been legally wronged. The dissent would exeuse the omission. For statute of limitations purposes, we would not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1483-8\">444 U.S. at 123, n. 10, 100 S.Ct. at 360, n. 10. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-9\">Nevertheless, it is unnecessary for us to speculate on whether such an extension of the <em>Kubrick </em>duty to inquire is warranted, because such an extension has already occurred in this circuit. That is, the potential plaintiff already has the duty to inquire as to both \u201ccausation\u201d and \u201cnegligence\u201d in light of our holding in <em>Gustavson. </em>In <em>Gus-tavson, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s personal representative sought \u201cto avoid application of the statute on the grounds that [the plaintiff] reasonably failed to draw a causal link between his injury and some of the negligent diagnoses by military doctors until within two years of the date of filing____\u201d 655 F.2d at 1035. The causal connection that the plaintiff arguably reasonably failed to draw was between the misdiagnosis concerning a mass in his neck and his kidney problems. It was argued that the statute did not begin to run as to this misdiagnosis in 1973 because in 1973 the civilian doctors advised the plaintiff only of the probable connection between his bed-wetting problems and his kidney damage; they did not advise him of the probable connection between the lump in his neck and his kidney problems. We held, however, that once the plaintiff was informed as to the probable connection between his bedwetting \u2022 and his kidney damage, \u201cthe burden was upon him to ascertain in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>instances his condition should have been recognized.\u201d 655 F.2d at 1037. Inasmuch as the plaintiff in <em>Gustavson </em>was not explicitly informed as to a possible connection between the lump in his neck and his kidney problems in 1973, this court implicitly placed a burden upon him to discover not only whether these doctors breached a duty to him, but also to discover in the first instance whether there was a causal connection between their actions, or inactions, and his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-4\">The question whether a plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in inquiring as to the cause of his injury will of course vary with the facts of each particular case. In the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s parents never made any inquiries whatsoever. The district court found their failure to inquire reasonable, even though in a twenty-four hour time span they were told by one doctor that their son had a mere URI and to bring him back in a week if he did not improve, and the next day informed that their son was in critical condition, possibly suffering from meningitis, with the likelihood of brain damage. As we read the district court\u2019s opinion, it excused the Arvayos\u2019 failure to inquire for essentially two reasons: first, because they were a young couple, \u201cwholly trusting of authority, particular medical persons\u201d; second, because any inquiries the Arvayos\u2019 might have made would have been fruitless because none of the doctors at St. Joseph\u2019s were aware of Dr. DePoe and his diagnosis the day prior, and therefore were unaware of any delay in treatment. Memorandum Opinion at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-5\">In our view, the district court\u2019s reasoning is flawed on both points. First, the quote describing the Arvayos, as well as a general reading of the district court\u2019s opinion, convinces us that the court applied a subjective standard rather than an objective standard to what the Arvayos\u2019 duty of inquiry was under the circumstances; the question whether the Arvayos were \u201creasonably diligent\u201d is of course an objective one. Second, the court\u2019s reasoning fails because it would excuse the Arvayos\u2019 failure to inquire on the basis of its findings that doctors at St. Joseph\u2019s probably did not know of Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis the previous day. In effect, what the district court would require is a duty of <em>disclosure </em>on the part of doctors, rather than a duty of <em>inquiry on </em>the part of plaintiffs. The question is not whether, in hindsight, the Arvayos\u2019 inquiries would have been fruitless because the St. Joseph\u2019s doctors did not know of Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis and the subsequent delay in treatment. The question is simply whether a reasonable person in the Arvayos\u2019 position, with the knowledge of two drastically different diagnoses in a twenty-four hour period, with the concomitant likelihood of brain damage, would have made <em>some </em>type of inquiry. We must hold that under these circumstances it was unreasonable for the Arvayos to make no inquiries whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-7\">We stress the fact that there is no issue of concealment on the part of any of the doctors or hospitals involved. <em>See, e.g., Waits, supra, </em>611 F.2d at 553 (alternative holding). None of the critical facts in this case changed between January 31, 1979, and August, 1981, when Tina Arvayo fortuitously learned from her attorney that a delay in diagnosis of meningitis could lead to brain damage. The Arvayos\u2019 contention that a cause of action does not accrue under the FTCA in a failure to diagnose, treat, or warn case until they are aware\u2014 informed \u2014 of a possible connection between a misdiagnosis and an injury could possibly toll the statute indefinitely. We conclude that such a construction would be an unwarranted, unintended extension of the meaning of the word \u201caccrues\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 2401(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-8\">We do not intend to imply that in every failure to diagnose, treat, or warn case the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrues at the time the plaintiff receives a diagnosis different from a previous diagnosis and is aware that he or she has been injured. Nor do we decide the precise questions the Arvayos should have asked under these circumstances. We decide only that under these circumstances, a reasonable person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>the Arvayos\u2019 position would have made some type of inquiry as to whether Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis had been correct, and if they had become suspicious that it had not been correct, whether the mistake may have contributed to Jose\u2019s brain damage. As even the dissenters recognized in <em>Kubrick: </em>\u201cA plaintiff who remains ignorant through lack of diligence cannot be characterized as \u2018blameless.\u2019 \u201d 444 U.S. at 128, 100 S.Ct. at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-4\">It is with regret that our decision prevents any recovery by Jose and Tina Ar-vayo on behalf of their son, Jose, Jr. The damage to Jose, Jr. and the continuing pain and trauma for the entire family, is a tragedy, not to speak of the financial hardships they must surely endure unless private relief can be obtained, as we sincerely urge, through Congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-5\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1479-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) (1982) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1479-16\">A tort against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim <em>accrues </em>or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.

Although we conclude in this opinion that the Arvayos were not \"blamelessly ignorant,\u201d we stress that under the appropriate circumstances the rule could excuse the failure to make any inquiries as to causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1485-6\">McKAY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANl\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-7\">The issue in this case is whether the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s medical malpractice claim was timely filed is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-8\">The relevant facts are uncontroverted. The mother of the infant plaintiff brought him to a military hospital on January 30, 1979, complaining of a nine-day fever and crankiness. After briefly examining the plaintiff, the family practitioner on duty, Dr. DePoe, diagnosed his condition as an upper respiratory infection, prescribed Triaminic Concentrate, and instructed plaintiff\u2019s mother to return with her child within a week if his condition did not improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-9\">Because plaintiff\u2019s condition had deteriorated significantly by the next day, his parents brought him to the emergency room of the military hospital. The emergency room physician, Dr. Pascua, preliminarily diagnosed plaintiff\u2019s condition as bacterial meningitis and transferred him to a civilian hospital for specialized care. There, the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was confirmed and appropriate treatment was administered. Plaintiff was treated for meningitis through March of 1979, at which time he exhibited signs of brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-12\">On August 19, 1981, plaintiff\u2019s parents sought legal advice concerning the government\u2019s insurance coverage of their son\u2019s medical and therapy expenses. It happened that the attorney they consulted had had experience with medical malpractice cases involving the delayed diagnosis of meningitis. He informed plaintiffs parents that Dr. DePoe\u2019s failure to diagnose and treat bacterial meningitis was possibly the cause of plaintiff\u2019s brain damage. Plaintiff\u2019s parents proceeded to investigate the possibility of negligence and thereafter filed their FTCA claim on December 16, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-13\">At trial, plaintiff\u2019s attorney argued that plaintiff was suffering from the initial stages of bacterial meningitis when Dr. DePoe examined him on January 30, 1979, and that the doctor\u2019s failure to diagnose and treat the disease caused his injuries. The government lawyers argued that plaintiff was not suffering from meningitis at the time of Dr. DePoe\u2019s examination, and that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory infection was appropriate. The government also contended that plaintiff\u2019s administrative claim was not timely filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) (1982), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1485-14\">A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim <em>accrues </em>or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a8n-dedup-0\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-15\">The trial court found that the claim was timely filed, that the government was negligent in failing to diagnose and treat the bacterial meningitis on January 30, 1979 and that, had the disease been properly diagnosed and treated on that date, plaintiff quite probably would not have suffered the brain damage and retardation that now afflict him. The court awarded damages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>the amount of $1,950,000, of which $1,000,-000 was for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-4\">On appeal, the government does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding of negligence, but argues only that the administrative claim was not timely filed. The government does not contend, as part of its statute of limitations argument, that plaintiff's parents actually knew that the delayed diagnosis was a cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Indeed, the government does not contest plaintiff\u2019s claim that no physician who treated plaintiff during his hospitalization informed his parents that Dr. De-Poe\u2019s failure to diagnose the meningitis on January 30, 1979 and the resulting delay in treatment might have caused his brain damage. Nor does the government contest plaintiff\u2019s claim that Dr. Pascua, a colleague of Dr. DePoe who was retained by plaintiff\u2019s parents to treat plaintiff after his discharge from the hospital, did not inform them that Dr. DePoe\u2019s failure to diagnose and treat the meningitis might have caused plaintiff\u2019s brain damage. Rather, the government argues that the administrative claim was not timely filed because plaintiff\u2019s parents should have known of their cause of action more than two years prior to the date on which they filed this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-5\">The definition of the word \u201caccrues\u201d in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b) has been the source of considerable judicial discussion. In <em>United States v. Kubrick, </em>444 U.S. 111, 120, 100 S.Ct. 352, 358, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979), the Supreme Court held that a cause of action accrues under the FTCA when \u201cthe plaintiff has discovered both his injury and its cause.\u201d I agree with the majority that under our holding in <em>Gustavson v. United States, </em>655 F.2d 1034 (10th Cir.1981), the \u201ccause\u201d of plaintiffs injury for purposes of statute of limitations analysis was not merely the disease of bacterial meningitis, but also the delayed diagnosis of this disease. I do not, however, agree with the majority\u2019s decision to overturn the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s parents were reasonably diligent in ascertaining the cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-6\">The majority finds that the district court incorrectly arrived at a finding of reasonableness because it applied \u201ca subjective standard rather than an objective standard to what the Arvayos\u2019 duty of inquiry was under the circumstances,\u201d Maj.Op. at 1422, and because it excused \u201cthe Arvayos\u2019 failure to inquire on the basis of its findings that doctors at St. Joseph\u2019s probably did not know of Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis the previous day.\u201d Maj.Op. at 1422. In my view this misconceives the district court\u2019s opinion. It is true, as the majority notes, that the district court refers to the plaintiff\u2019s parents as a young couple, \u201cwholly trusting of authority, particularly medical persons.\" This does not necessarily mean, however, that the court was applying a subjective standard as to the diligence required of plaintiff\u2019s parents. The court\u2019s characterization of plaintiff\u2019s parents in this regard is certainly relevant to the first tier of statute of limitations analysis\u2014 whether they <em>actually </em>knew of the causal import of the delayed diagnosis. Moreover, the fact that the court uses the phrase \u201creasonably diligent claimant\u201d in his opinion, 580 F.Supp. at 755, indicates that he was aware that the standard to be applied in the second tier of the analysis was an objective one. Further, I disagree with the majority\u2019s assessment of the trial court\u2019s finding that any inquiry would have been futile. Whether or not the likely futility of making inquiries of the doctors at the civilian hospital was relevant to the issue of plaintiff\u2019s parent\u2019s reasonableness, in my view the district court\u2019s finding that inquiry would have been futile was merely peripheral to its independent finding that plaintiff\u2019s failure to inquire was reasonable. Thus, the district court applied the correct standard in its statute of limitations analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-7\">The question before the district court was whether it was reasonable for plaintiff\u2019s parents to believe that Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis on January 30, 1979 was not a contributing cause to their son\u2019s brain damage and to fail to inquire into the accuracy of the belief. The question before us is not whether the plaintiff's parents were rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>sonable in their conduct but, rather, whether the district court\u2019s finding that they were reasonable is so implausible as to merit reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-5\">It is well-established that the question of when a claim accrues, for purposes of the FTCA limitation period, is a matter of federal law. <em>Exnicious v. United States, </em>563 F.2d 418, 420 n. 6 (10th Cir.1977); <em>Stoleson v. United States, </em>629 F.2d 1265, 1268 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Williams v. United States, </em>405 F.2d 234, 235 n. 5 (5th Cir.1968). The issue of when a plaintiff knew or with reasonable diligence should have known of a cause of action is a question for the finder of fact. <em>See, e.g., Maughan v. SW Servicing, Inc., </em>758 F.2d 1381 (10th Cir.1985); <em>Lundy v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>695 F.2d 394 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Ballew v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>688 F.2d 1325 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Renfroe v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>686 F.2d 642 (8th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-6\">The Supreme Court recently made clear the standard we are to apply in reviewing a trial court\u2019s factual findings in <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemmer City, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-10\">This standard plainly does not entitle a reviewing court to reverse the finding of the trier of fact simply because it is convinced that it would have decided the case differently. The reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under Rule 52 if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court. \u2018In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues <em>de novo.\u2019 </em>... If the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-15\">This is so even when the district court\u2019s findings do not rest on credibility determinations, but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1487-16\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-17\">In my view, the majority misconceives our role as a reviewing court. Not only is the district court better equipped to find facts, but fairness dictates that those findings be overturned only with great circumspection. As the Court noted in <em>Bessemer City:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-18\">the parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much. As the Court has stated in a different context, the trial on the merits should be \u2018the main event\u2019 ... rather than a \u2018tryout on the road.\u2019____ For these reasons, review of factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard \u2014 with its deference to the trier of fact \u2014 is the rule, not the exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1487-20\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1487-21\">I cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s findings as to plaintiff\u2019s parent\u2019s reasonableness were so implausible as to merit reversal. Certainly, the view that Dr. De-Poe\u2019s diagnosis was not a contributing cause because plaintiff was not suffering from bacterial meningitis at the time of Dr. DePoe\u2019s diagnosis was not so unreasonable as to prevent the government from arguing it at trial. Even had plaintiff\u2019s parents believed that their child was suffering from the disease at the time of the diagnosis, it is far from clear that it would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>unreasonable for them to have believed that the injuries suffered by their son were the inevitable consequence of bacterial meningitis and that a mere day\u2019s delay in diagnosis had no affect on the extent of those injuries. Under these circumstances, a finding that a reasonable plaintiff would not have inquired further into the effect of the delayed diagnosis is not implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1487-11\"> In addition, we should not further burden our overburdened dockets by conducting exhaustive review of such fact-bound determinations. <em>Cf. California v. Carney, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 10S.Ct. 2066, 2071, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cBy promoting the Supreme Court as the High Magistrate for every warrant-less search and seizure, this practice has burdened the argument docket with cases presenting fact bound errors of minimal significance.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
