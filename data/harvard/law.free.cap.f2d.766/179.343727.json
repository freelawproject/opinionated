Norman R. Spears invoked 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against the director and several employees of the Texas Department of Corrections, alleging that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by being required to perform work beyond his physical capacity, and that his medical needs had not received proper attention. Both Spears and the appellees demanded a jury trial. The case was referred to a United States Magistrate for an evidentiary hearing, without a jury, after which the magistrate recommended that the case be dismissed. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the suit. We perceive no difficulty with the magistrate conducting a hearing to determine the specificity of Spears\u2019 claim leading to a recommendation of dismissal of the defined claim as frivolous. Finding that dismissal fully justified, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">Spears objects to the magistrate\u2019s evidentiary hearing on grounds that the magistrate decided the case on its merits in contravention of his jury demand. Spears relies in part on our statement in <em>Ford v. Estelle, </em>740 F.2d 374, 380 (5th Cir.1984), where we stated that \u201c[s]ection 636(b)\u2019s provision for reference of \u2018conditions of confinement\u2019 petitions must be limited to authorize designation of magistrates to hold evidentiary hearings only for the determination of nonjury issues.\u201d That statement assumes, however, a case in which we are presented with a discernible and critical question of fact. If a prisoner\u2019s petition relating to conditions of confinement contains only conclusionary allegations, notwithstanding a timely prayer for a jury trial reference to a magistrate to determine the factual basis of such allegations may be proper. Thus, if a prisoner\u2019s section 1983 petition alleges gross inadequacy of attention to his serious medical needs, he has alleged a factual issue, albeit in the form of a conclusion. It would be inappropriate to refer that case to a magistrate for a trial over the prisoner\u2019s objections. But the trial court <em>may </em>refer the ease to a magistrate to dig beneath the conclusional allegations; to reduce the level of abstraction upon which the claims rest; to ascertain exactly what scenario the prisoner claims occurred, as well as the legal basis for the claim. We find support for reference to magistrates in such situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">The magistrate properly may be asked by the district court to investigate whether a prisoner\u2019s motion for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>should be denied on grounds of frivolity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00a7 1915(d). Such motions should be denied as frivolous where the legal points lack arguable merit. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). To determine whether a complaint is frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court must inquire whether there is an arguable \u201cfactual and legal basis, of constitutional dimension, for the asserted wrong.\u201d <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 892 (5th Cir.1976). This inquiry perforce involves focusing precisely on a prisoner\u2019s factual allegations, puncturing the conclusion balloon in which they may at first be lodged.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The facts of this case pointedly illustrate the imperative of requiring greater specificity from prisoners who allege constitutional deprivations. Spears was dissatisfied with the medical treatment he received for about a year, beginning in the summer of 1980 when he first entered the Texas Department of Corrections. His testimony before the magistrate reflected that he was given progressively lighter work duties because of his complaints, and that finally, on July 10, 1981, he was withdrawn from assignment to any work whatever. Moreover, during that period he was examined by no fewer than five doctors, x-rayed three times, and was seen more than 40 times by TDC medical personnel. The magistrate concluded that Spears\u2019 claim of \u201cdeliberate indifference to his medical needs\u201d meant merely that he disagreed with his doctors and was unhappy with the results of his medical treatment. We join the district court and the magistrate in viewing that as the essence of Spears\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We have stated that a district court need not specifically term a prisoner\u2019s suit \u201cfrivolous\u201d to merit dismissal under \u00a7 1915(d). The word contains no magic legal elixir:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyD\">The district court did not expressly state that Irving\u2019s claims were \u201cfrivolous. \u2019 However, since the court could not determine the merits of Irving\u2019s complaint prior to service without concluding that the complaint was \u201cfrivolous\u201d under \u00a7 1915(d), we treat the court\u2019s conclusion as a \u00a7 1915(d) determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aec\"><em>Irving v. Thigpen, </em>732 F.2d 1215, 1216 n. 2 (5th Cir.1984). Stripping this record to legal essentials, we perceive that the district court referred this case to the magistrate for disposition, including, upon the development of Spears\u2019 claim, use of the authority vested by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) to recommend that Spears be denied pauper status if his suit be found frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">We believe other grounds would support reference for a \u00a7 1915(d) determination. For a number of years the courts have used questionnaires to assist trial judges to bring into focus the factual and legal bases of prisoners\u2019 claims. We have referred to such questionnaires as being \u201cin the nature of a motion for more definite statement\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(e). <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d at 892. The prisoners\u2019 answers to such questionnaires elaborate on the allegations contained in their complaints under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), and do not constitute an independent pleading. <em>See Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d at 892. This practice of having the prisoner state with more definiteness the form and substance of his claim occurs before service of process is required. <em>Id. </em>at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">We see no reason why a district court may not, in lieu of such questionnaires, refer the case to a magistrate to hold an evidentiary hearing \u201cin the nature of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>motion for more definite statement.\u201d The magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations should prove of greater aid than a prisoner\u2019s written answers on a questionnaire, in the determination whether a claim is frivolous. We are aware of neither constitutional nor statutory infirmity in such a procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Upon development of the actual nature of the complaint, it may also appear that no justiciable basis for a federal claim exists. Spears contends that since Magistrate Botley concluded his recommendation with language to the effect that even if all the facts alleged in favor of Spears\u2019 complaint were true he could not demonstrate a violation of civil rights under \u00a7 1983, the magistrate was impermissibly recommending dismissal on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion. We are persuaded of no error; the standard for determining the legal sufficiency of a complaint is the same under either Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). <em>Bienvenu v. Beauregard Parish Police Jury, </em>705 F.2d 1457 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The federal courts continue to wrestle with the myriad problems presented by prisoners\u2019 cases, the volume of which mounts daily. Almost a decade ago Judge Bell of this court addressed the \u201cdifficult task facing the courts of winnowpng] out the wheat from the unusual amount of chaff necessarily presented in a system which fosters <em>pro se </em>litigation.\u201d <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d at 890. In the intervening years the task has become more unmanageable, our winnowing fans are seemingly impotent when applied to the mountains of chaff before us. We must take advantage of every tool in our judicial workshop. The district courts should use with greater frequency the device of referring prisoners\u2019 cases to magistrates for \u00a7 1915(d) determinations and for Rule 12(b)(6) review of specific claims. To do so will not be adverse to meritorious prisoners\u2019 claims. To the contrary, limited judicial resources might then be utilized more timely and more efficaciously to resolve those cases in which relief should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-12\">. Indeed, if the motion has already been provisionally granted, the trial court may direct the magistrate to recommend whether pauper status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>should be revoked, if it appears that the suit is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\">. The statute reads in part: \"The court may ... dismiss the case ... if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-14\">. Likewise here, the magistrate did not expressly term Spears\u2019 claims \"frivolous.\u201d We find the language of his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficiently demonstrative of the frivolity of Spears\u2019 claims, although the form is inappropriate. Magistrate Botley stated at the outset that a \"pro se plaintiff [must] be required to establish that his claims have sufficient prima facie merit to justify the expense of litigation. This is especially true where plaintiffs have filed a complaint <em>in forma pauperis.\" </em>This invites a consideration and ruling under \u00a7 1915(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
