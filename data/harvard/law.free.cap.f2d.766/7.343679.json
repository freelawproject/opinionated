The evidence introduced at trial, viewed in a light favorable to the government, <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>644 F.2d 890, 893 (1st Cir.1981), was sufficient for the jury to find the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-25\">John Yiscardi owns the Cafe Mews, a restaurant and lounge in North Conway, New Hampshire. In February 1980 Viscar-di hired Albert Ferguson, a disc jockey, to play recorded music for dancing in one part of the Cafe. Ferguson, with the help of his wife Kristin and various assistants, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>hit at the Cafe Mews; and he began to offer additional and similar entertainment at a new club called Daisey\u2019s. One Peter Sgro approached Ferguson, threatened to hurt him, and told him not to work at a club that competed with Viscardi\u2019s. Late on the night of August 14, 1980, Peter Sgro, the appellant Crooks, and one or two other men went to Daisey\u2019s and threatened to harm the Fergusons. Later that night they, and the Fergusons, all went to the Cafe Mews, where Crooks and others again threatened the Fergusons with physical harm. Crooks threw a glass at Kristin, hurting her badly enough to require a trip to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">A grand jury indicted Crooks, Viscardi, and Sgro, charging them with both extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion. Sgro, who did not appear at trial, is presently a fugitive. Crooks and Viscardi were tried. The jury found Crooks not guilty of extortion, but guilty of conspiracy; it found his co-defendant Viscardi not guilty on both counts. Crooks now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Crooks\u2019 arguments on this appeal have required us to examine the record with care, measuring the facts and events it shows against well-established legal principles. Having done so, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s rulings were legally correct. Since the appeal presents no novel legal issue, we see no need to describe the underlying facts and arguments in detail. Instead, we shall write only enough to indicate the reasoning that underlies our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">1. Crooks\u2019 most important arguments arise out of the fact that his codefendant Viscardi introduced evidence designed to show that he (Viscardi) was not the instigator, but a victim, of the threats. Viscardi did not directly deny that Crooks did what the government charged, but he argued that any threats were part of a plan involving the missing Sgro and another man called Polcari to take over the Cafe Mews. This fact, says Crooks, requires a new trial for 1) it shows a serious \u201cvariance\u201d between the crime charged and the crime proved, and 2) it shows that Viscardi should have been tried separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Crooks first points out that he was indicted for having made threats as part of a \u2018Viscardi-instigated conspiracy against Ferguson,\u2019 not as part of a \u2018Poleari-instigated conspiracy against Viscardi.\u2019 He says that the evidence showed the latter at worst and that we should not tolerate so large a variance between the conspiracy charged and the conspiracy shown. <em>See United States v. Flaherty, </em>668 F.2d 566, 582 (1st Cir.1981) (\u201cVariance in the proof is grounds for reversal ... when it affects the defendant\u2019s \u2018substantial rights\u2019 ... that he have sufficiently specific information about the charges against him so that he can prepare an effective defense and will not be surprised at trial ____\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The flaw in Crooks\u2019 claim lies in the fact that, contrary to Crooks\u2019 contention, the evidence was sufficient for the jury reasonably to have found that Crooks\u2019 threats were made</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">in order to induce the said Albert Ferguson to cease rendering disc jockey services to Daisey\u2019s Restaurant and Lounge and to provide such services only to the Cafe Mews</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">\u2014precisely the conspiracy charged. Ferguson, for example, testified that Sgro said that he didn\u2019t like Ferguson\u2019s working anywhere but the Cafe Mews and that he had paid Crooks and the others to break up Daisey\u2019s and Ferguson\u2019s equipment. Ferguson added that during the meeting at the Cafe Mews Crooks said to him: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re smiling about, but you\u2019re not going to like me by the time this night is over.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s wife, Kristin, added that Sgro asked her why Ferguson wasn\u2019t working at the Cafe Mews and that Sgro said that if he heard that Ferguson was working anywhere but the Cafe Mews \u201cthere would be no more talking.\u201d She added that Crooks and the other men acted at Sgro\u2019s command, and that Crooks had said \u201cWe came here to take care of [Ferguson].\u201d The jury might have believed this evidence, disbelieved any contrary evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>dence, and on this basis convicted Crooks of the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Crooks\u2019 real claim is that, although the jury <em>might </em>have believed this evidence, it did not believe it in fact. And, the proof that it didn\u2019t lies in the fact that it acquitted Viscardi. Why, says Crooks, would the jury have acquitted Viscardi unless it thought the conspiracy was aimed at him, instead of his being its instigator? And, he adds, an \u201canti-Viscardi conspiracy\u201d is not the conspiracy that the indictment against both him and Viscardi charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We reject this claim, however, for two reasons. First, Viscardi\u2019s acquittal is not inconsistent with Crooks\u2019 conviction. As a matter of pure logic, Sgro might have wanted <em>both </em>to keep Ferguson from working at Daisey\u2019s (or anywhere but the Cafe Mews) <em>and </em>to take over the Cafe Mews. The jury\u2019s doubt about the extent of Viscardi\u2019s participation does not logically require one to doubt Sgro\u2019s immediate object in threatening Ferguson or Crooks\u2019 participation. Second, in any event, courts do not hold juries to a standard of strict logical consistency when they convict one co-conspirator while acquitting codefendants. <em>Harris v. Rivera, </em>454 U.S. 339, 345, 102 S.Ct. 460, 464, 70 L.Ed.2d 530 (1981) (per curiam); <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87,101, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2899, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>United States v. Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 279, 64 S.Ct. 134, 135, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943); <em>United States v. Cyr, </em>712 F.2d 729, 732 (1st Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Rios Ruiz, </em>579 F.2d 670, 677 (1st Cir. 1978). Such inconsistency in and of itself no more proves equal innocence than equal guilt. And, a rule requiring absolute consistency could at least sometimes lead juries to convict \u201cborderline\u201d eodefendants despite doubts rather than free defendants who are undoubtedly guilty. Regardless, as we have just said, the evidence aimed at proving Viscardi himself a victim was not strong enough to require the jury to acquit Crooks of being part of a conspiracy to threaten Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Crooks also argues that the proViscardi evidence created a conflict between him and his codefendant Viscardi sufficient to require the judge to sever his trial from that of Viscardi. Whether to grant such a severance, however, is up to the trial court. <em>United States v. Cox, </em>752 F.2d 741, 746 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Bautista, </em>731 F.2d 97, 99-100 (1st Cir. 1984); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>623 F.2d 188, 194 (1st Cir.1980). We will set aside the district court\u2019s decision only on a \u201cstrong showing of prejudice,\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>752 F.2d at 746 (quoting <em>United States v. Lochan, </em>674 F.2d 960, 967 (1st Cir.1982)); <em>United States v. Arruda, </em>715 F.2d 671, 679 (1st Cir.1983), only where it deprives a defendant \u201cof a fair trial, resulting in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Arruda, </em>715 F.2d at 679; <em>United States v. Davis, </em>623 F.2d at 194. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Viscardi sought to establish the existence of an anti-Viscardi conspiracy; he did not claim that Crooks was part of it. His defense was not consistent with the government\u2019s case against both defendants, but a jury could have believed some, or most, of it without that fact making them more likely to convict Crooks. Indeed, Viscardi testified that he could not recall seeing Crooks before the trial \u2014 testimony that, if believed, would have helped Crooks. The conflict between the defenses presented by Crooks and Viscardi was not so severe that it \u201calone establishes the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Arruda, </em>715 F.2d at 679. Nor were the defenses basically \u201cso inconsistent that the jury would have to believe one defendant at the expense of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The added Viscardi defense made the trial more complex. And, it increased the likelihood that the jury would confuse which evidence was admissible as to which defendant. But, these sorts of factors are precisely those that the trial court is charged with weighing. We have found in the record no prejudice to Crooks sufficient to overturn the considered judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">2. Crooks claims that the government violated the Constitution\u2019s due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>process clause because it did not indict him until January 1984, three and one-half years after the crime was committed. U.S. Constit. Amend. V. An indictment brought within an applicable statute of limitations period is, constitutionally speaking, late only if the delay significantly prejudices the defendant and the government \u201cintentionally delayed\u201d the indictment \u201cto gain an unfair tactical advantage or for other bad faith motives.\u201d <em>United States v. Marler, </em>756 F.2d 206, 215 (1st Cir.1985). Crooks\u2019 claim of prejudice consists of the fact that a witness, now dead, might have testified that he went to North Conway for innocent reasons. Having examined the offer of proof in light of the record, we doubt that the delay significantly prejudiced Crooks. Regardless, the record does not indicate that the government delayed the indictment for \u2018bad faith\u2019 reasons. The government states, without contradiction from Crooks, that any delay resulted from its efforts to discover all those who participated in the conspiracy and to try them together. And, this reason, in context, provides a legitimate explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">3. Crooks argues that statements that he made to an FBI agent, prior to his arrest, should have been suppressed as the \u2018products of coercion.\u2019 <em>Hutto v. Ross, </em>429 U.S. 28, 30, 97 S.Ct. 202, 203, 50 L.Ed.2d 194 (1976); <em>Beckwith v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 347-48, 96 S.Ct. 1612, 1616-17, 48 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976). The issue here is purely factual; and it depends wholly on credibility. Crooks says the agent threatened to tell others he was cooperating with the police \u2014 a rumor that might have led to Crooks\u2019 death. The FBI agent denies making any such threat. The district court, while disbelieving a portion of the FBI agent\u2019s story, believed his denial. We find no basis in the record to overturn this credibility conclusion. <em>See United States v. Kimball, </em>741 F.2d 471, 474 (1st Cir. 1984). That being so, the finding of \u2018no coercion\u2019 has adequate record support.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">4. Crooks claims that the evidence that he and Sgro were coconspirators was insufficient to allow the government to introduce Sgro\u2019s hearsay statements against him. <em>United States v. Ciampaglia, </em>628 F.2d 632, 637 (1st Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Petroziello, </em>548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977). We do not agree. One independent witness, Debbie Kneeland, testified that on August 14 Crooks, Sgro and two other men met in Massachusetts, drove in two cars to North Conway, and met there again. Kristin Ferguson testified that at the Cafe Mews meeting on the night of August 14 Crooks said (referring to Ferguson): \u201cWe came here to take care of him. Let\u2019s do it and get the fuck out of here.\u201d A third witness, FBI agent Jordan, testified that Crooks told him that a friend had asked Crooks to go to North Conway to stand by someone so that that person could have his way in a particular matter. This evidence, in context, was sufficient to show, more likely than not, that Crooks and Sgro were part of the same conspiracy. In addition, Sgro indicated to Albert and Kristin Ferguson that he had to pay Crooks and the other men to break up Albert\u2019s sound equipment, that the men would \u201ctake care\u201d of Albert, that one of the men was a \u201cpro\u201d marksman, and that one of the men there would break Albert\u2019s arms or fingers or shoot him if ordered to. These statements, though hearsay, may also be taken into account in deciding whether the <em>Petroziello-Ciampaglia </em>tests are met. <em>United States v. Martorano, </em>557 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 922, 98 S.Ct. 1484, 55 L.Ed.2d 515 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">5. Crooks claims that Sgro\u2019s statements should not have been admitted because the government did not make a \u201cgood faith effort to obtain his presence at trial.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 74, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2543, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). But, Sgro was a fugitive and the government had issued a warrant for his arrest. Those facts adequately refute Crooks\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">6. Crooks argues that the trial court should have granted immunity to a \u201cMr. X\u201d who would have provided exculpatory information. The government opposed the grant on the grounds 1) that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>generally opposes grants of immunity, and 2) that to be more specific, it had to know who \u201cMr. X\u201d is. Under the circumstances revealed in the record, these grounds of opposition adequately support the trial court\u2019s decision to deny immunity. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>623 F.2d 188, 193 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">7. Crooks points to several instances of what he characterizes as prosecutorial misbehavior, which, taken together, he says, deprived him of a \u201cfair trial.\u201d <em>See United States v. Maccini, </em>721 F.2d 840, 846 (1st Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Capone, </em>683 F.2d 582, 585-87 (1st Cir. 1982). The most serious examples consist of instances in which the prosecutor made statements describing Crooks as an \u201cenforcer,\u201d a \u201cmuscle man,\u201d or in one instance as seen in \u201can area where there\u2019s crime.\u201d In his brief, Crooks lists three instances in which such statements were made (leaving aside characterizations not pertaining to Crooks or made out of the presence of the jury): a) Following defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the local police chief about the failure of the police to question people at the Cafe Mews, the prosecution asked the police chief whether his department was used to \u201cdealing with muscle men or enforcers.\u201d b) In closing argument, the prosecuting attorney referred to Crooks \u201cand his enforcer friends ____ The guys who got into the car with the ENFORCER license plates.\u201d c) In closing argument, the prosecuting attorney stated that it was natural for agent Jordan to be in the \u201cCombat Zone\u201d of Boston (where he saw Crooks) because that is \u201can area where there\u2019s crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In the first two instances, however, the characterizations were not so obviously improper as to require a conclusion of prose-cutorial \u2018bad faith.\u2019 Crooks\u2019 car, for example, had the word \u201cEnforcer\u201d written on its front license plate, and the prosecutor referred to that fact in identifying the car and its occupants. This type of characterization was at least arguably relevant as well to show the state of mind of those at the Cafe Mews meeting or to explain an apparently inadequate state police investigation. In the third instance (and in other instances, in which characterizations were not relevant or were overly prejudicial), the trial court sustained objections and cautioned counsel. For example, the court excluded testimony that would have associated Crooks and the word \u201cMafia.\u201d Given the cautionary instructions, and the arguable relevance, we cannot find that the characterizations actually used were either deliberate or prejudicial to the point of showing severe prosecutorial misconduct or unfairness requiring a new trial. <em>United States v. Cox, </em>752 F.2d at 745. Crooks points to certain other instances of what he calls \u201cmisconduct,\u201d but they are trivial, and, when added to the \u2018characterizations,\u2019 do not change the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">8.

Crooks\u2019 other claims, which we find insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">For these reasons, the .judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
