We, therefore, certify the question to the Supreme Court of Florida for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">On January 26, 1982, Steven Allen Paul was killed instantly when his automobile collided with a Mack tractor driven by ap-pellee, Eddie Johnson, and owned by appel-lee, AAA Cooper Transportation, Inc. (AAA). At the time of his death, Paul was 25 years of age and unmarried. Paul left no survivors dependent upon him for support or services, or otherwise entitled to recover damages for his death under Florida\u2019s Wrongful Death Act, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 768.16-768.27 (West Supp.1985). Paul is, however, survived by his natural mother, Nancy C. Vildibill, and his natural father, Charles Eugene Paul, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-19\">As personal representative of Paul\u2019s estate, Vildibill brought this wrongful death action seeking recovery of the estate\u2019s loss of prospective net accumulations under Fla. StatAnn. \u00a7 768.21(6)(a). <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-20\">Section 768.21(6)(a) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-21\">(6) The decedent\u2019s personal representative may recover for the decedent\u2019s estate the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-22\">(a) Loss of earnings of the deceased from the date of injury to the date of death, less lost support of survivors excluding contributions in kind, with interest. Loss of the prospective net accumulations of an estate, which might reasonably have been expected but for the wrongful death, reduced to present money value, may also be recovered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-23\">(1) If the decedent\u2019s survivors include a surviving spouse or lineal descendants; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-24\">(2) If the decedent is not a minor child as defined in s. 768.18(2) and does not have survivors as defined in s. 768.18(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-25\">Vildibill contends that the state of Florida did not intend to preclude recovery under section 768.21(6)(a) in a case such as this. She asserts that the state\u2019s intent in amending section 768.21(6)(a) to include subsection (2) was to permit the estate of a deceased adult to recover damages so long as there were no survivors who would be entitled to recover damages in their own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Paul is survived only by his parents, neither of whom was dependent upon him for support or services, or is otherwise entitled to recover damages in their own right for his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We believe that the issue of whether the reference in section 768.21(6)(a)(2) to \u201csurvivors\u201d means only \u201csurvivors\u201d who were dependent upon the decedent, is appropriate for resolution by the highest court of the state of Florida. We, therefore, certify to the Supreme Court of Florida the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">Whether an adult decedent\u2019s estate may recover loss of net accumulations where the decedent is survived only by parents who were not dependent upon him for support or services, and who are not otherwise entitled to recover damages for his death in their own right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We do not intend the particular phrasing of this question to limit the Supreme Court of Florida in its consideration of the problems posed by the entire case. In order to assist consideration of the case, the entire record, along with the briefs of the parties, shall be transmitted to the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b544-26\"> Vildibill filed the action against appellees, Johnson, AAA, and Transport Insurance Co. in state court on January 10, 1983. Upon the ap-pellees\u2019 request, the state court action was removed to the federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
