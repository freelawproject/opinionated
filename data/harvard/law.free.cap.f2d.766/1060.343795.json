We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-20\">In 1972 and 1977, Congress amended the Clean Water Act (\u201cAct\u201d) in an effort to control water pollution and \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (1982). The Act presently provides that direct dischargers \u2014 those who expel wastewater directly into navigable waters \u2014 must comply with the \u201cbest practicable control technology currently available\u201d by July 1, 1977, to limit pollutants within their wastewater discharge, commonly referred to as effluent. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(1)(A). The Act further provides that by July 1, 1984, the direct dischargers must comply with the more stringent standard of \u201cbest available technology economically achievable\u201d in regulating effluent pollutants. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(2). In addition, the Act provides that indirect dischargers \u2014 those whose wastewater passes through a publicly owned treatment works plant (\u201cPOTW\u201d)\u2014 pretreat their wastewater discharge before passing it along to the POTW for further treatment. Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of the Act, and in this capacity, the EPA is to establish \u201cpretreatment standards for introduction of pollutants into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>treatment works ... which are publicly owned for those pollutants which are determined not to be susceptible to treatment by such treatment works or which would interfere with the operation of such treatment works.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1317(b)(1). Congress instructed the EPA to \u201cestablish national pretreatment standards for toxic pollutants based on the best available technology economically achievable, or any more stringent effluent standards____\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 830, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 87, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4326, 4424, 4462.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">The requirement that indirect dischar-gers remove pollutants from their effluent through pretreatment procedures, before introducing such wastewater into the POTW, creates the potential for unnecessary, duplicative wastewater treatment procedures if the POTW is capable of efficiently removing those same pollutants. Thus, in an effort \u201cto avoid treatment for treatment\u2019s sake,\u201d <em>see </em>Senate Comm, on Environment and Public Works, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977, at 343 (Comm. Print 1978), the Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-7\">\u201c[i]f, in the case of any toxic pollutant under subsection (a) of this section introduced by a source into a publicly owned treatment works, the treatment by such works removes all or any part of such toxic pollutant and the discharge from such works does not violate that effluent limitation or standard which would be applicable to such toxic pollutant if it were discharged by such source other than through a publicly owned treatment works, and does not prevent sludge use or disposal by such works in accordance with section 1345 of this title, then the pretreatment requirements for the sources actually discharging such toxic pollutant into such publicly owned treatment works may be revised by the owner or operator of such works to reflect the removal of such toxic pollutant by such works.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1317(b)(1). This statutory removal credit program allows indirect dis-chargers to modify the pollutant levels within their wastewater discharge based upon the degree of pollution reduction achieved by the POTW. In effect, the indirect dischargers, when pretreating their wastewater, are not required to remove those pollutants that can be efficiently treated and removed by the POTW. The statutory removal credit program ensures that the combination of pretreatment by the indirect discharger and further treatment by the POTW achieves \u201cat least that level of treatment which would be required if the industrial source were making a direct discharge.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 830, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 87, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4424, 4462.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">In June 1978, the EPA promulgated regulations implementing the general waste-water pretreatment standards for indirect dischargers and setting forth the guidelines to be followed by indirect dischargers and POTWs in qualifying for removal credits. <em>See 43 </em>Fed.Reg. 27,736 (1978), amended 46 Fed.Reg. 9404 (1981), codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 403.1-403.16 (1984). The EPA, in accord with Congressional intent, designed the comprehensive regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">\u201c(a) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into POTWs which will interfere with the operation of a POTW, including interference with its use or disposal of municipal sludge; (b) to prevent the introduction of pollutants into POTWs which will pass through the treatment works or otherwise be incompatible with such works; and (c) to improve opportunities to recycle and reclaim municipal and industrial wastewaters and sludges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aaa-dedup-0\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.2 (1984). The regulations require that pollutants introduced into POTWs by indirect dischargers \u201cshall not Pass Through the POTW or Interfere with the operation or performance of the works.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.5(a). The regulations direct POTWs \u201cwith a total design flow greater than 5 million gallons per day (mgd) and receiving from Industrial Users pollutants which Pass Through or Interfere with the operation of the POTW ... to establish a POTW Pretreatment Program....\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.8(a). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>EPA defines pretreatment as \u201cthe reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewa-ter prior to or in lieu of discharging or otherwise introducing such pollutants into a POTW.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.3(q). Thus, the POTW must formulate a pretreatment program to ensure that the pollutant levels within the wastewater discharge of those industrial facilities who use the POTW are in compliance with the EPA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The regulations further provide that the POTW may revise the pretreatment program for an industrial user in order to reflect the POTW\u2019s removal of pollutants. To qualify for these \u201cremoval credits,\u201d the POTW must have an EPA-approved pretreatment program and must submit periodic data to the EPA concerning the quantity and quality of the POTW\u2019s normal in-fluent and effluent flow. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.7(b), (d). The EPA will approve the revised pretreatment program and grant removal credits only where \u201cthe POTW demonstrates Consistent Removal of each pollutant for which the discharge limit in a categorical Pretreatment Standard is to be revised----\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.7(b). Indeed, the removal credit will be granted only for the actual removal of the pollutant mass by the POTW, not for a reduction in the concentration of the pollution through dilution of the wastewater. <em>See </em>Senate Comm, on Environment and Public Works, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977, at 461 (Comm.Print 1978). <em>See also </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.6(d). If the POTW\u2019s pretreatment standards meet with EPA approval and the POTW establishes that it is capable of removing pollutant mass from the wastewa-ter of an indirect discharger, the POTW is authorized to issue revised effluent pollutant limitations for the indirect discharger. This revised discharge limit is calculated through a mathematical formula; dividing the EPA\u2019s pretreatment standard for a given pollutant by the sum of one minus the POTW\u2019s consistent removal rate of that pollutant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, if the EPA\u2019s pretreatment standard is one pound of pollutant discharge for every thousand pounds of mass used in the manufacturing process, and the POTW can remove 75% of that pollutant, then the revised discharge limit for the indirect discharger would be four pounds of pollutant discharge for every thousand pounds of mass used in the manufacturing process. The POTW would remove 75%, or three of the four pounds of the pollutant, thus bringing the wastewater into compliance with the EPA\u2019s pretreatment standard of one pound of pollutant for every thousand pounds of discharged mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">The EPA regulations also provide that each industrial discharger of water pollutants within the United States will be classified within an industrial category. The EPA is to promulgate individual pretreatment standards for each industrial category, specifying the quantity and concentration of pollutants that indirect dischargers may release to their respective POTWs. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.6. Realizing that \u201cit may be necessary on a case-by-case basis to adjust the limits in categorical Pretreatment Standards, making them either more or less stringent, as they apply to a certain Industrial User,\u201d the EPA included \u201ca fundamentally different factors\u201d (\u201cFDF\u201d) variance for each industrial category. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13(b). According to the EPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArxC\">\u201c[a]ny interested person believing that factors relating to an Industrial User are fundamentally different from the factors considered during development of a categorical Pretreatment Standard applicable to that User and further, that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit than specified in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>dard, may request a fundamentally different factors variance under this section or such a variance request may be initiated by the EPA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\"><em>Id. </em>The factors to be considered in determining whether to grant a FDF variance include, <em>inter alia, </em>the nature and quality of the pollutant; the volume of wastewater discharge; the environmental impact; the energy requirements; the age, size, and land availability of the industrial facility; and the cost of compliance with control technology. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13(d). The factors that are expressly <em>not </em>to be considered in granting a FDF variance include, <em>inter alia, </em>the feasibility of installing pretreatment equipment; the inability to pay for the waste treatment; and the impact of the discharge upon the quality of the POTW\u2019s receiving waters. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13(e). In addition, the indirect discharger, in order to obtain a FDF variance, must show that the cost of implementing the EPA\u2019s pretreatment standard is \u201cwholly out of proportion\u201d with the removal cost projected by the EPA or, in the alternative, that the impact upon the environment would be \u201cfundamentally more adverse\u201d than the impact projected by the EPA. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13(e)(2)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">On August 15, 1983, the EPA issued the pretreatment standards and effluent limitations for the direct and indirect dischargers within the copper-forming industry. According to the EPA, \u201c[t]he Agency considered a number of factors to determine whether subcategorization is needed in the copper forming category. After consideration of these factors, the Agency has determined that the copper forming category is most appropriately regulated as a single subcategory.\u201d 48 Fed.Reg. 36,944 (1983). The EPA based this conclusion upon the fact that the 176 copper-forming facilities within the United States perform five basic operations \u2014 hot rolling, cold rolling, extrusion, drawing, and forging \u2014 that utilize water, oil-water emulsions, or soluble oil-water mixtures as lubricants that are included within the wastewater discharge. The EPA\u2019s thorough and exhaustive study of the copper-forming industry revealed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR_\">\u201c[pjollutants found in significant amounts in copper forming waste streams include: chromium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc; toxic organics; and suspended solids, pH, and oil and grease. In addition, the sludges generated by treatment of these wastewaters usually contain large quantities of toxic metals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeo\">There are 176 facilities in the copper forming category; these facilities employ a total of 43,000 people. Total production capacity is approximately 3.5 million kkg/yr. Within the category, 37 facilities discharge to navigable wastewaters, 45 facilities discharge to POTW\u2019s and 94 plants do not discharge wastewater.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ6\"><em>Id. </em>at 36,945. The EPA found that in the copper-forming industry, the POTWs were ineffective in treating the toxic pollutants \u2014 including chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and toxic organics<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 present in the wastewater of copper-forming facilities. According to the EPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-10\">\u201c[i]n the copper forming category, the Agency has concluded that the toxic metals regulated under these standards (chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc) pass through the POTW. The nationwide average percentage of these same toxic metals removed by a well-operated POTW meeting secondary treatment requirements is about 50 percent (ranging from 20 to 70 percent), whereas the percentage that can be removed by a copper forming direct discharger applying the best available technology economically achievable is about 90 percent. Accordingly, these pollutants pass through a POTW.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 36,947. Thus, the EPA issued pretreatment regulations requiring, <em>inter alia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>flow reduction techniques and \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d pre-discharge treatment in the form of \u201c[cjhemical reduction of chromium; chemical precipitation of metal ions using hydroxides or carbonates; removal of precipitated metals by settling; pH control; oil skimming; chemical emulsion breaking; \u25a0and filtration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36,945. In effect, the EPA regulations placed numerical limitations upon the toxic pollutant mass that could be discharged from copper-forming facilities. The EPA concluded that these pretreatment regulations \u201cwill not result in any closures [or] job losses\u201d for the forty-five indirect dischargers within the copper-forming industry. <em>Id. </em>at 36,949. The EPA added, of course, that these pretreatment standards for the copper-forming industry were \u201csubject to the \u2018fundamentally different factors\u2019 variance and credits for pollutants removed by POTW.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36,955. In compliance with section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1317(b)(1), the EPA required indirect dischargers in the copper-forming industry to comply with the pretreatment standards within three years of their promulgation. Thus, the forty-five indirect dischargers in the copper-forming industry must have wastewater pretreatment programs that comply with the \u201cbest available technology economically achievable\u201d in operation by August 15, 1986. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 468.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">In September 1983, the Third Circuit ruled in <em>National Ass\u2019n of Metal Finishers v. EPA, </em>719 F.2d 624 (3d Cir.1983), <em>(\u201cMetal Finishers\u201d), </em>that \u201cFDF variances for toxic pollutant discharges are forbidden by the [Clean Water] Act.\u201d 719 F.2d at 646. In response, the EPA withdrew the FDF variance provision from its regulations in February 1984. <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. 5131 (1984), codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13(b)(2). Recently, the Supreme Court, in <em>Chemical Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Natural Res. Defense Coun., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985) <em>(\u201cChemical Manufacturers\u201d), </em>overturned the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling and held that \u201cit is thus important that EPA\u2019s nationally binding categorical pretreatment standards for indirect dischar-gers be tempered with the flexibility that the FDF variance mechanism offers, a mechanism repugnant to neither the goals nor the operation of the [Clean Water] Act.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 1112. Thus, in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Chemical Manufacturers, </em>the EPA may continue, if it so chooses, to permit indirect dischargers of toxic pollutants to obtain FDF variances from their categorical pretreatment standards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the EPA may continue to grant removal credits to indirect dischar-gers that pass their wastewater along to a POTW capable of treating and removing a percentage of the industrial user\u2019s toxic pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">Turning to the facts in the present case, the record reveals that the petitioner, Cerro Copper Products Co., (\u201cCerro\u201d) is a copper-forming facility located in Sauget, Illinois, that manufacturers seamless copper tubing for plumbing, industrial, and refrigeration uses. The EPA classifies Cerro as an indirect discharger of toxic organic pollutants as well as the toxic metal pollutants of chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc. The co-petitioner, Village of Sauget, Illinois, owns and operates the Sauget POTW, which treats the wastewater discharge of Cerro and various other industries within Sauget and the surrounding area. The Sauget POTW was built in the early 1970\u2019s after a study by the local industries revealed that the most cost-effective treatment of industrial wastewater would be through the construction and operation of a centrally located POTW. The record reveals that the local industries within the Sauget area contributed $7,870,000 to the $8,670,000 construction cost of the POTW, while the Village of Sauget and the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Government funded the remainder of the costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the EPA, the Sauget POTW is not presently in compliance with the EPA\u2019s regulations concerning effluent pollutant limitations for \u201csecondary treatment\u201d POTWs. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(1)(B). Moreover, the EPA claims that the Sauget POTW\u2019s removal of toxic pollutants discharged by Cerro is not at the level of \u201cbest available control technology economically achievable\u201d as required by the EPA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">The petitioners respond that construction of a regional wastewater treatment plant to serve southwestern Illinois is in progress and upon completion in 1986, the regional plant will treat Cerro\u2019s wastewa-ter discharge to the degree necessary to comply with the EPA standards. The costs for this regional POTW are being funded in large measure (85%) through Federal Government monies, with the remaining funds being secured through the issuance of revenue bonds guaranteed by the local industries of Sauget, including Cerro. This regional POTW, when completed, will treat sewage from cities and municipalities in southwestern Illinois as well as industrial wastewater that has already passed through the Sauget POTW. The petitioners argue that in view of the local Sauget POTW, and soon to be completed regional pollution control system in southwestern Illinois, they present a unique situation that merits special consideration by the EPA. According to the petitioners, the Sauget POTW is a reasonable alternative to installing pretreatment equipment at Cerro\u2019s manufacturing plant because the Sauget POTW will pretreat the wastewater discharge before passing it along to the soon to be completed regional POTW. The petitioners, in effect, argue that Cerro\u2019s pretreatment of its wastewater discharge will be unnecessary and wasteful once the regional treatment facility is completed and in full operation in the immediate future. The petitioners claim that the EPA failed to take these unique circumstances into account when it formulated uniform, national pretreatment standards for the copper-forming industry. The petitioners further contend that the EPA regulations implementing the removal credits program are invalid because they do not address the unique situation presented in this case where the Sauget POTW, and the soon to be completed regional POTW, will successfully remove the toxic pollutants discharged by Cerro.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">This court has jurisdiction to review the regulations promulgated by the EPA for the pretreatment of wastewater discharge from industrial copper-forming facilities pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1) which provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXD\">\u201c[r]eview of the Administrator\u2019s action (A) in promulgating any standard of performance under section 1316 of this title, ...

EPA, </em>574 F.2d 367, 373 (7th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">The basic issue before this court is whether the EPA, in promulgating national wastewater pretreatment standards for facilities within the copper-forming industry, failed to adequately account for the petitioners\u2019 alleged unique situation. The petitioners argue that Cerro\u2019s wastewater discharge is presently treated at the Sauget POTW and that in the near future the effluent flowing from the Sauget POTW will be treated at the soon to be completed regional POTW. The petitioners claim that following completion of the regional POTW, the wastewater discharged from that facility will satisfy the \u201cbest available control technology economically achievable,\u201d as required by the EPA. According to the petitioners, once the regional POTW is completed, the Sauget POTW will become a pretreatment facility and the regional POTW will become the POTW, within the meaning of the Clean Water Act. The petitioners contend that in view of the present stage of development and the contemplated completion date of the regional treatment plant, there is no need for Cerro to install additional pretreatment equipment at its manufacturing plant. The petitioners claim that the EPA failed to consider this alleged unique situation when it promulgated uniform, national wastewater pretreatment standards for the copper-forming industry. We believe it important to note that the petitioners presented this very same argument to the EPA in 1981, claiming that their situation differed substantially from that of the average copper-forming facility and thus Cerro should not be subject to the uniform, national regulations for the copper-forming industry. The EPA responded that, \u201cthe standards being promulgated establish national pretreatment standards. Issues relating to individual POTWs are not addressed by this rule-making.\u201d The petitioners, not satisfied with the EPA\u2019s response to their claim, now raise their \u201cunique situation\u201d argument before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">We summarily dispose of the petitioners\u2019 attack upon the EPA\u2019s uniform, national pretreatment standards for the copper-forming industry as the legislative history of the Clean Water Act clearly reveals that Congress intended the EPA to promulgate wastewater pretreatment standards on a nationwide basis. The House Report provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1147-13\">\u201c[i]t should be understood that the pretreatment standards established under this section would be <em>national in scope </em>and addressed to the most significant pretreatment problems. The Committee expects that the standards would vary with the broad type of treatment processes used, but <em>the Committee does not intend that each individual treatment works would have its pretreatment </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number><em>standards set up by the Administrator.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">H.R.Rep. No. 911, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 113 (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>Senate Comm, on Public Works, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, at 800 (Comm.Print 1973) (emphasis added). Thus, Congress expressly intended that the EPA, when establishing national wastewater pretreatment standards for the various industrial categories, not take into account the individual characteristics of each industrial facility and POTW. Congress realized that due to the many variables existing throughout the wide range of industries, it would be impossible for the uniform, national pretreatment standards to accommodate each and every facility within an industrial category. According to the Senate Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-5\">\u201c[a]nother reason for minimizing the consideration of removals in the development of national pretreatment standards is that the performance of treatment works on industrial waste, except in those few cases where the system is specifically designed to treat a certain type of industrial waste, is extremely variable. Data that have [sic] been presented to this committee indicate that secondary treatment removal efficiency for metals varies from between 10 and 70 percent. Variability of such magnitude makes the assumption of specific level of removal, when setting national standards, almost impossible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">S.Rep. No. 370, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 58, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4326, 4383. In view of the variety of industrial facilities and POTWs subject to the uniform, national pretreatment standards, Congress enacted the removal credit program to allow indirect dischargers to modify the pollutant levels within their wastewater discharge based upon the degree of pollution reduction achieved by the POTW. The House Conference Report provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1148-7\">\"in applying these pretreatment standards through its pretreatment program, the owner or operator of the municipal treatment works could modify the requirements applicable to individual classes of sources introducing that pollutant into the treatment works to reflect the degree of reduction of that pollutant achieved by the treatment works.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 830, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 87, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4424, 4462. Accordingly, the legislative history of the Clean Water Act reveals that Congress intended the EPA to promulgate uniform, national wastewater pretreatment standards and then permit modification of these standards through the removal credits program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">In the present case, the EPA conducted a thorough and exhaustive study of the copper-forming industry. <em>See </em>48 Fed. Reg. 36,942-67. The EPA solicited information from all 176 facilities within the industry concerning the copper-forming processes used; the mass pollutant content of the wastewater discharge; the size, age, and land availability of the facility; and the existing pollution treatment devices in use. Based upon this industry-wide study, the EPA found that the wastewater discharge of all facilities within the copper-forming industry contained toxic organic pollutants as well as toxic metal pollutants, including chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc. The EPA found that the average POTW was unable to remove these toxic pollutants from the wastewater at the required level of \u201cbest available control technology economically achievable.\u201d Thus, the EPA promulgated uniform, national pretreatment standards, requiring copper-forming facilities to use pretreatment procedures to remove toxic pollutants from their waste-water before passing such water along to the POTW. In view of Congress\u2019 mandate to promulgate uniform, national pretreatment standards and the EPA\u2019s exhaustive review of the copper-forming industry, we uphold the EPA\u2019s wastewater pretreatment regulations for the copper-forming industry as a fair, reasonable, and proper embodiment of clear Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>The petitioners further claim that the EPA\u2019s removal credit program is invalid because its application requires Cerro to pretreat its wastewater discharge before passing it along to the Sauget POTW. The petitioners argue that Cerro\u2019s pretreatment amounts to nothing more than \u201ctreatment for treatment\u2019s sake\u201d because the Sauget POTW and the soon to be completed regional POTW are capable of removing pollutants to satisfy the EPA\u2019s pollutant discharge limitations. The Clean Water Act provides that the Federal Court of Appeals may review the EPA regulations implementing the removal credit program only if the petitioner filed a petition \u201cwithin ninety days from the date of such determination, approval, promulgation, issuance or denial, or after such date only if such application is based solely on grounds which arose after such ninetieth day.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1). In the present case, the EPA regulations for the removal credit program were promulgated and available to the public in January 1981, but the petitioners failed to challenge the regulations until November 1983, when they filed a petition for review before this court. The petitioners concede that their failure to satisfy the ninety day filing requirement bars a challenge of the removal credit program at this late date. Nevertheless, the petitioners argue that their challenge lies against the pollutant limitations that result from <em>application </em>of the removal credit formula, not against the removal credit formula itself. Despite the petitioners\u2019 assertion to the contrary, we are unable to discern any difference between a challenge to the removal credit formula and a challenge to the application of that very same formula. Indeed, the EPA\u2019s sole purpose in implementing the removal credit formula was to <em>apply </em>the formula on a case by case basis. The petitioners failed to challenge the removal credit formula within the ninety day statutory period, and we believe that it contravenes the principles of fairness and equity to permit the petitioners to circumvent this limitation, some three years later,' by attempting a collateral challenge upon the very same removal credit formula. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to address the petitioners\u2019 claim concerning the validity of the EPA\u2019s removal credit program when applied to the copper-forming industry. <em>See, e.g., Granite City Steel Co. v. EPA, </em>501 F.2d 925, 926 (7th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">We do note that the EPA\u2019s removal credit program is an integral component of the Clean Water Act and is vital to the EPA\u2019s implementation of the Act. The removal credit program, enacted by Congress and administered by the EPA, allows industrial facilities to modify the pollutant levels within their wastewater discharge based upon the degree of pollution reduction achieved by the POTW. Thus, in reviewing the uniform, national pretreatment standards promulgated by the EPA for the copper-forming industry, we must also examine the removal credits program which permits qualifying POTWs and indirect dis-chargers to revise the EPA pretreatment standards. The EPA\u2019s removal credit regulation consists of a forula that permits indirect dischargers to receive credit for the POTW\u2019s removal of pollutants. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.7(d)(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The POTW must actually remove the pollutant mass from the wastewater and removal credits are not to be granted for simple dilution, i.e., increasing the volume of water and thereby decreasing the number of pollutants per unit of water. Congress, in enacting the Clean Water Act, intended above all to remove pollutants from the Nation\u2019s waters, not to dilute the pollutants by introducing them into larger bodies of water. According to the House Report, \u201c[i]n promulgating national pretreatment standards the Administrator shall include a provision recognizing the option of [a POTW] to modify the requirements to reflect the degree of <em>reduction </em>achieved by the treatment works.\u201d H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 830, 95th Cong., 1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>Sess. 88, <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4424, 4463 (emphasis added). The removal credit program promulgated by the EPA allows indirect dischargers to modify the pollutant levels of their waste-water discharge if the POTW properly removes toxic pollutants from the wastewa-ter within the guidelines specified by the EPA. The EPA\u2019s removal credit program effectuates Congressional intent to remove pollutants from our Nation\u2019s waters and thus we hold that the program is a proper implementation of the Clean Water Act. <em>See, e.g., Metal Finishers, </em>719 F.2d at 646-650, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">We address the petitioners\u2019 final claim that the EPA improperly withdrew the FDF variance for toxic pollutants. It is important to note that at the time this case was briefed and orally argued, the EPA had withdrawn the FDF variance for toxic pollutants in view of the Third Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Metal Finishers, </em>that \u201cFDF variances for toxic pollutant discharges are forbidden by the Act.\u201d 719 F.2d at 646. The effect of the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling and the EPA\u2019s withdrawal of the variance regulation was to remove FDF variances entirely for copper-forming facilities as all of their wastewater pollutants are toxic. The petitioners claim that the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion and the EPA\u2019s decision to withdraw the FDF variance regulation for toxic pollutants, <em>see </em>49 Fed.Reg. 5131, were in error. Recently, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Chemical Manufacturers, </em>reversed the Third Circuit opinion and held that.the FDF variance for toxic pollutants is consistent with Congressional intent in enacting the Clean Water Act. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that the EPA's FDF variance regulation \u201cfairly understood, is not inconsistent with the language, goals, or operation of the Act. Nor does the administration of EPA\u2019s [FDF variance] regulation undermine the will of Congress.\u201d <em>Chemical Manufacturers, </em>105 5. Ct. at 1112. In so holding, the Court emphasized the importance of FDF variances to the regulatory scheme of the Clean Water Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-11\">\u201cThe nature of FDF variances has been spelled out both by this Court and by the Agency itself. The regulation explains that its purpose is to remedy categories which were not accurately drawn because information was either not available to or not considered by the Administrator in setting the original categories and limitations. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13(b). An FDF variance does not excuse compliance with a correct requirement, but instead represents an acknowledgement that not all relevant factors were taken sufficiently into account in framing that requirement originally, and that those relevant factors, properly considered, would have justified \u2014 indeed, required\u2014 the creation of a subcategory for the discharger in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1110. As a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Metal Finishers, </em>the EPA may grant FDF variances for toxic pollutants. In a supplemental brief filed with this court, the EPA stated that in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chemical Manufacturers, </em>it \u201cplans to reinstate soon the regulatory provision that provided, for all categorical pretreatment standards, an FDF variance procedure for toxic pollutants.\u201d It is thus obvious that at the time the EPA reinstates the FDF variance provision for toxic pollutants, the petitioners will have an opportunity to present their claim of alleged unique circumstances to the EPA in an attempt to satisfy the requirements of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 403.13 and obtain a FDF variance. In the meantime, the petitioners must comply with the EPA\u2019s pretreatment standards for the copper-forming industry by August 15, 1986. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 468.-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">We deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">.
