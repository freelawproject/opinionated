MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) dismissing Sandella Spears\u2019 (\u201cSpears\u201d) appeal, 21 M.S.P.R. 535 (1984). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b601-25\">Spears was a Claims Authorizer with the Mid-America Program Service Center, Social Security Administration, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\u201cSocial Security\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> until she was removed effective June 22, 1979. This adverse action was appealed to the MSPB on July 3, 1979, without a claim of discrimination. On November 6, 1979, the Presiding Official issued his initial decision sustaining Spears\u2019 removal. Spears\u2019 petition for review by the full MSPB was denied on November 25, 1980, and no further appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-26\">At the time of her removal, Spears had a discrimination complaint pending before Social Security which was filed in October, 1978, and which alleged that management would not reassign her to another work area because of her race. After the completion of its investigation, Social Security indicated it proposed to hold that there was no discrimination. On July 13, 1979, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Spears requested a hearing and alleged that her removal was in reprisal for her discrimination complaint. In a letter, dated July 27, 1983, Thomas S. McFee, Director, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Health and Human Services, stated that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) had remanded the reprisal allegation to Social Security, pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613, because the complaint pertained to a mixed case (defined <em>infra), </em>part of which had previously been before the MSPB. After reviewing the complaint, Social Security decided that Spears had not been the subject of reprisal and advised her that she could petition the MSPB for review of its previous decision pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.404.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Spears filed a petition with the MSPB on August 19, 1983, alleging that \u201c[t]he penalty of removal was discriminatory and an act of reprisal.\u201d After Social Security moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Presiding Official issued an order referring Spears\u2019 petition to the full MSPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">On July 2, 1984, the full MSPB granted Social Security\u2019s motion to dismiss, because 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702 (1982)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides the MSPB with jurisdiction to decide discrimination issues only when they are the basis for an action appealable to the MSPB. Because there was no appealable action pending before it, the MSPB held that it lacked jurisdiction. The procedures set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.404 were deemed to be unauthorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) (1982), the Federal Circuit is without jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions on the merits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702. <em>Williams v. Department of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485, 1491 (Fed.Cir.1983). However, in such cases, this court has jurisdiction to review decisions on threshold issues such as the MSPB\u2019s jurisdiction or, in this case, <em>res judicata. See Ballentine v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>738 F.2d 1244, 1246-47 (Fed.Cir.1984). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a), the MSPB has jurisdiction over mixed cases which involve an adverse ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>tion normally appealable to the MSPB and an allegation that a basis for the action was discrimination. <em>Williams, </em>715 F.2d at 1487. Section 7702 permits employees to challenge adverse actions on both discrimination and nondiscrimination grounds or solely on discrimination grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1487 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Spears\u2019 most recent appeal to the MSPB challenges her removal on the ground of discrimination. Therefore, the MSPB had jurisdiction over this appeal even though it was Spears\u2019 second appeal to the MSPB on her removal. The only difference between Spears\u2019 appeals to the MSPB is that the second was based on discrimination while the first was not. Having previously appealed her removal to the MSPB on nondiscrimination grounds and lost, Spears is barred by <em>res judicata </em>from subsequently challenging her termination on the allegation of discrimination. <em>Cf. United States v. Utah Construction &amp; Mining Co., </em>384 U.S. 394, 421-22, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 1559-60, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966). Although the MSPB actually dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, it would be wasteful to remand the case based on <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), because any action by the MSPB would not involve policymaking or discretion. <em>See Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>684 F.2d 155, 158 n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Chae-Sik Lee v. Kennedy, </em>294 F.2d 231, 234 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 926, 82 S.Ct. 362, 7 L.Ed.2d 190 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Although 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.404 would appear to authorize Spears\u2019 second appeal to the MSPB, it is well settled that regulations promulgated by an agency must be consistent with statutory provisions enacted by Congress. <em>Commissioner v. South Texas Lumber Co., </em>333 U.S. 496, 501, 68 S.Ct. 695, 698-99, 92 L.Ed. 831 (1948); <em>Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 375, 378, 51 S.Ct. 144, 145, 75 L.Ed. 397 (1931). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a)(1), an adverse action involving a mixed case can be appealed to the MSPB, which then has 120 days to decide the discrimination issue and the appealable action. Section 7702(a)(2) also permits such mixed cases to be brought before the agency, whose decision is judicially reviewable unless that decision is appealed to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a)(1). Within 30 days of the MSPB\u2019s decision, the employee or applicant may petition the EEOC to consider the MSPB\u2019s decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(b)(1). The MSPB\u2019s decision becomes judicially reviewable if no petition is filed or if the EEOC refuses to consider the MSPB\u2019s decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a)(3). If the EEOC chooses to consider the MSPB\u2019s decision, the EEOC has 60 days either to concur with the MSPB or to issue a new decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(b)(3). The decision of the MSPB becomes judicially reviewable if EEOC concurs, while a different decision by the EEOC is immediately referred to the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(b)(5)(B). The MSPB can then either concur with the EEOC\u2019s decision, which is judicially reviewable, or reaffirm its initial decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(c). If the MSPB takes the latter action, the matter is certified to a special panel described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(d)(6). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(d)(1). The decision of the special panel is judicially reviewable. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(d)(2)(A). Thus, the statutory scheme does not authorize the MSPB first to review an adverse action without considering discrimination and then to accept another appeal on the same adverse action where discrimination is alleged. Although 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(e)(2) permits an employee who has filed a complaint with the agency under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a)(2), and has not received a judicially reviewable action after 120 days, to appeal to the MSPB, the statute does not additionally provide for subsequent MSPB review after the agency reaches a final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In view of the foregoing, the MSPB\u2019s dismissal of Spears\u2019 appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-15\">.
