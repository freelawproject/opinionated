It is</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">FURTHER ORDERED by the court, on its own motion, that the district court order, 603 F.Supp. 1053 (D.D.C.1985), granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss the complaint as moot. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Munsingwear, </em>340 U.S. 36, 39-40, 71 S.Ct. 104, 106-107, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950); <em>Associated Third Class Mail Users v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>662 F.2d 767, 771 &amp; n. 37 (D.C.Cir.1980) (per curiam). Appellant McIntyre sought to be conditionally seated pending the House of Representatives\u2019 resolution of the disputed election. Appellant Robertson \u2014 a resident of Indiana\u2019s Eighth Congressional District \u2014 sought to have that District represented in the House. The decision of the House of Representatives to seat a candidate from that District renders it impossible for a court \u2014 assuming <em>arguendo </em>authority to entertain the claims asserted \u2014 to provide appellants with any meaningful relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-21\">The Clerk is directed to issue a certified copy of this order to the district court in lieu of mandate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
