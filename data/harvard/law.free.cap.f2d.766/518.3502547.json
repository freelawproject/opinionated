MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQcU\">This appeal is from the decision and judgment of the United States Claims Court that Dynamics Corporation of America (\u201cDCA\u201d) is entitled, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498, to a total payment, as reasonable royalty plus delay damages (to and including May 31, 1984), in the amount of $11,-529,195; and that from June 1,1984, to and including the date of payment of the judgment, DCA is further entitled to additional delay damages of $1,403 per day. The payment and damages are based on unauthorized manufacture and use of the invention of Rawley D. McCoy covered by Patent No. 2,967,997.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">On the basis of its opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the Claims Court in all respects except in its use of simple rather than compound interest in calculating delay damages as part of \u201creasonable and entire compensation.\u201d On this issue, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">The Claims Court properly observed that an award of delay damages under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498 is an attempt \u201cto repay the patentee for the loss of money to which it had a right.\u201d It concluded that \u201cdelay interest rates should be set to adequately compensate the patentee for the lost use of its money during the relevant accounting period\u201d (1976 forward),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> citing <em>Lam, Inc. v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>718 F.2d 1056, 1066, 219 USPQ 670, 676 (Fed.Cir.1983) (prime interest rates approved), and <em>Bendix Corp. v. United States, </em>676 F.2d 606, 616 (Ct.Cl.1982), in which the Court of Claims approved use of the prime interest rate computed under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6621(b) (for interest on tax deficiencies or overpayments).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">As to DCA\u2019s argument that compound interest rather than simple interest should be used in calculating delay compensation, the Claims Court noted that this court recently affirmed a district court\u2019s judgment which included compounded prejudgment interest in a patent infringement case under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, <em>Railroad Dynamics, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>Inc. v. A. Stucki Co., </em>727 F.2d 1506, 1510 n. 1, 220 USPQ-929, 934 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 220, 83 L.Ed.2d 150 (1984). Nevertheless, the Claims Court concluded that the statutory standard of \u201creasonable and entire compensation\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498 is the equivalent of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \u201cjust compensation\u201d in which interest is not awarded as such, but, rather, is considered to be a part of the \u201ccompensation,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that \u201c[traditionally, it has always been limited to simple interest,\u201d citing <em>Bendix Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>where simple prime rate interest was approved, and <em>Calhoun v. United States, </em>453 F.2d 1385, 172 USPQ 438 (Ct.Cl.1972), where the court stated that \u201csimple interest (as part of just compensation) is to accrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">We are persuaded that, based on the facts and circumstances in a particular case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> compound interest may more nearly fit with the policy \u201cto accomplish complete justice as between the plaintiff and the United States\u201d under the just compensation clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Waite v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 508, 51 S.Ct. 227, 75 L.Ed. 494 (1931). Moreover, we do not consider that what may have been \u201ctraditional,\u201d without a clear holding by one of our predecessor courts that delay 'damages cannot include compound interest, is binding precedent on this court under <em>South Corporation v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 1368, 215 USPQ 657 (Fed.Cir.1982). However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(3) appears to require the Claims Court to allow compounded interest on judgments, but is silent on prejudgment interest. We note that no reference is made in the Claims Court\u2019s opinion to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 and its effect on delay damages from and after judgment herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Accordingly, the decision and judgment of the Claims Court are affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. On remand, the Claims Court should consider (1) whether, taking into account this opinion and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, \u201creasonable and entire compensation\u201d may include compounded interest in calculating prejudgment interest for purposes of delay damages,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) if so, whether it should be allowed under the facts and circumstances of this case. Recomputation of delay damages from judgment date and thereafter appears to be indicated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-11\">. Reported at 5 Cl.Ct. 591 (1984). The liability phase of this case is reported <em>sub nom. Rel-Reeves, Inc. v. United States, </em>534 F.2d 274 (Ct.Cl.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">. The Claims Court noted that the parties were in agreement on the rate of delay interest damages for the years 1961 through 1975. The Government argued for a rate of 8% per annum for 1976 forward. DCA argued for 9.6% for 1976 through 1980, 12% for 1981, and 20% for 1982 until payment of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b906-18\">. The Claims Court also cited <em>General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., </em>461 U.S. 648, 103 S.Ct. 2058, 76 L.Ed.2d 211 (1983), in which the Supreme Court stated that both the background and language of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 are evidence of the fundamental purpose of Congress to afford patent owners \"complete compensation\u201d and that \"in the typical case\" prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded \u201cto ensure that the patent owner is placed in as good a position as he would have been in had the infringer entered into a reasonable royalty agreement.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">. <em>See Leesona Corp. v.

DCA\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Enrique Arzac, Professor of Finance and Economics and head of the Finance Department at Columbia Union College School of Business, testified without rebuttal that the appropriate method for calculating delay damages to make DCA whole would be by using compound interest and showed the inequity of using simple interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b907-17\">. We note that the legislative history of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, in commenting on the necessity for awarding prejudgment interest to compensate a plaintiff, uses an example showing application of compounded interest.
