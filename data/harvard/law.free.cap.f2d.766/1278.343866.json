The district court, 576 F.Supp. 798 (D.S. D.1983),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that NHIC had failed to hon- or the insurance agreement, and awarded summary judgment for Triple U for $338,-125.35, which represented the amount the Heppers had been awarded against Triple U by the South Dakota jury, plus $51,-895.35 Triple U had spent in defense of the Heppers\u2019 suit. NHIC appeals, contending that (1) it had no duty to defend Triple U; and (2) the district court erred in holding it liable for the amount of the state court judgment. We affirm in part, but remand for further consideration of the amount of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">The policy in question, a \u201cFarmer\u2019s Comprehensive Personal Liability\u201d policy, provided under \u201cCoverage L \u2014 Personal Liability that NHIC would pay on behalf of Triple U \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.\u201d, \u201cOccurrence\u201d was defined as an \u201caccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in ... property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The policy defined \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property ... including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom.\u201d The policy excluded coverage for property damage to products sold, distributed, or handled by the insureds. Coverage L specifically stated that NHIC had the \u201cright and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such ... property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-14\">Triple U, a corporation engaged in farming and ranching in South Dakota, arranged in 1978 and early 1979 to sell the Heppers a total of 650 head of buffalo. The policy was in force at the time the sales were made. The Heppers planned to breed the buffalo. Unfortunately, some, or all, of the buffalo sold were infected with brucellosis, a disease characterized by abortion, reduced fertility, and lowered, milk production. The Heppers eventually sued Triple U for breach of warranty and fraudulent misrepresentation. Although Triple U requested NHIC to undertake defense of the suit, NHIC refused to involve itself, and Triple U was obliged to obtain representation on its own. Subsequently, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the Heppers for $286,232.00 on the breach of warranty claim, and in favor of Triple U on the fraudulent misrepresentation claim. Triple U then instituted the present suit against NHIC with results hereinabove described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-15\">\n<em>1. Duty to Defend.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-16\">In analyzing the question whether NHIC had breached its duty to defend Triple U, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>the district court noted that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend becomes operative if a complaint or petition filed against the insured states allegations which might fall within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>See Haugan v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>86 S.D. 406, 197 N.W.2d 18 (1972). The Heppers state complaint had alleged numerous types of damage, most of which the district court recognized were excluded under the NHIC policy. The court did conclude, however, that allegations in the Heppers\u2019 complaint of damage to calves later born of the buffalo had described \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the policy. The district court also concluded that the Heppers\u2019 complaint had alleged an \u201coccurrence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7A\">[Triple U], as sellers, provided warranties to the buyers regarding the fitness of the buffalo for breeding. The result flowing from the sale of the allegedly diseased buffalo was an unexpected, unforeseen and fortuitous event. Moreover, if proven, the allegations in Hep-pers\u2019 complaint showed that the calves born were subjected to a continuous and repeated exposure to the diseased condition of the bulls and cows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\"><em>Triple U Enterprises v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>576 F.Supp. 798, 808 (D.S.D.1983) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the district court held that the Heppers\u2019 complaint had stated allegations which might fall within Coverage L of the policy, and that NHIC therefore had had a duty to undertake defense of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">On appeal, NHIC argues that the Heppers\u2019 complaint had described neither \u201cproperty damage\u201d nor an \u201coccurrence\u201d; that exclusion (a) of Coverage L of the policy made Coverage L inapplicable to the liability alleged in the Heppers\u2019 complaint; and that the only possibly applicable portion of the policy, Coverage N (entitled \u201cPhysical Damage to Property\u201d), also excluded coverage. Because we agree, substantially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, <em>Triple U Enterprises, </em>576 F.Supp. at 808, that the Heppers\u2019 complaint could reasonably be read to describe both \u201cproperty damage\u201d and an \u201coccurrence,\u201d we forego further discussion of those issues. We do address NHIC\u2019s other arguments regarding the existence of a duty to defend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-8\">Exclusion (a) of Coverage L of the policy states: \u201cThis coverage does not apply: (a) to ... property damage arising out of any act or omission in connection with premises (other than the insured premises) owned, rented, or controlled by an in-sured____\u201d NHIC contends that since its policy does not specifically provide for products liability coverage, and since certain kinds of products liability insurance exclude coverage for property damage occurring off of the premises owned by the insured, this court should interpret exclusion (a) as limiting Coverage L to accidents, injuries and occurrences that take place entirely on the insured premises. NHIC contends that a narrower interpretation of exclusion (a) would be anomolous, because it would permit a policyholder who had not paid a premium for products liability insurance to obtain broader coverage than a policyholder who had paid such a premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">Examination of so much of NHIC\u2019s policy as has been incorporated into the record does not persuade us that Coverage L is limited to events that occur entirely on insured premises. It is appropriate to give the language used in an insurance policy its ordinary meaning, and to construe exclusion clauses narrowly. <em>Shepard v. Milbank Mutual Ins. Co., </em>437 F.Supp. 744, 748 (D.S.D.1977), <em>modified, </em>579 F.2d 477 (8th Cir.1978); <em>Grandpre v. Northwestern National Life Ins. Co., </em>261 N.W.2d 804, 807 (S.D.1977). On its face, exclusion (a) appears only to preclude coverage for property damage that is in some manner related to uninsured premises which the insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>owns or controls.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>But see National Farmers Union Property and Casualty Co. v. Western Casualty and Surety Co., </em>577 P.2d 961 (Utah 1978). No evidence on the present record suggests that any \u201cact or omission\u201d connected with either the sale of the diseased buffalo, or the subsequent infection of the buffalo calves, took place on uninsured premises owned, controlled or rented by Triple U. Nor is there evidence that Triple U declined to purchase products liability insurance, or that Triple U ought to have been aware the NHIC \u201ccomprehensive personal liability\u201d policy would exclude coverage for property damage caused by Triple U\u2019s products. <em>Cf. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Three \u201cD\u201d Sales, Inc., </em>518 F.Supp. 305 (D.N.D.1981) (size of premium inappropriate test for determining whether personal liability policy would cover seller\u2019s liability for property damage resulting from breach of warranty). In these circumstances, we reject NHIC\u2019s contention that exclusion (a) precludes coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">NHIC also contends, however, that property damage of the sort involved here should be considered in the context of Coverage N of the policy, rather than that of Coverage L. Coverage N applies to \u201cproperty physically injured or destroyed during the endorsement period by any insured,\u201d and requires the insurance company to either pay the \u201cactual cash value\u201d of the property, or repair or replace the property. NHIC notes that Coverage N excludes any coverage for property damage arising out of \u201cbusiness pursuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">This argument has no merit. Coverage L, like Coverage N, refers to \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Moreover, Coverage L, unlike Coverage N, is clearly directed at liability resulting from a judicial proceeding. The policy nowhere states that recovery under Coverage N would preclude recovery under Coverage L; indeed, the policy states the contrary: \u201cNo other insurance afforded by this policy shall apply to ... property damage with respect to which insurance is afforded under Coverage L____\u201d In the circumstances of this case we see no justification for holding that Coverage N precludes Triple U from recovering under Coverage L.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">We conclude the district court did not err in holding NHIC had a duty to defend Triple U against the Heppers\u2019 state suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">\n<em>2. Damages for Breach of Duty to Defend.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">More troubling is the district court\u2019s treatment of the damage issues posed. As mentioned, numerous items of damage not within the policy\u2019s coverage were submitted by the Heppers to the state jury. The district court, indicating that it was unable to determine what portion, if any, of the jury award would be covered by the policy, held NHIC liable to Triple U for the full amount of the award. Citing <em>Space Conditioning, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>294 F.Supp. 1290 (E.D.Mich.1968), aff'<em>d, </em>419 F.2d 836 (6th Cir.1970), the court reasoned that a lesser award against NHIC would permit NHIC to profit from its wrongful refusal to defend. <em>Triple U Enterprises, </em>576 F.Supp. at 811. NHIC contends the district court\u2019s damage award was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-14\">Although South Dakota courts apparently have not yet addressed computation of damages in situations of this kind, cases from other jurisdictions provide general guidance. A liability insurer who breaches a contractual duty to defend will be liable to the insured for all damages caused by the breach. <em>See Luke v. American Family Mutual Ins. Co., </em>476 F.2d 1015, 1020 n. 7 (8th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 856, 94 S.Ct. 158, 38 L.Ed.2d 105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>(1973). Indeed, in some circumstances, the extent of the insurer\u2019s liability for damages awarded against the insured will be determined without regard to contractual provisions designed to limit this liability. <em>Cf. North River Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>600 F.2d 721, 724 (8th Cir.1979) (if insurer wrongfully and in bad faith foils efforts to settle suit between third party and insured, insurer will be liable for amount of subsequent judgment, without regard to policy limits); <em>Maynard v. Sauseda, </em>121 Mich.App. 644, 329 N.W.2d 774, 779-80 (1982) (where insured suffered a default judgment, and insurer who wrongfully refused to defend fails to establish insured had had means to obtain representation, insurer is liable for entire award). As a general rule, however, the amount of the insurer\u2019s liability will be limited by the policy\u2019s coverage provisions. <em>See Alabama Farm Bureau Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. Moore, </em>349 So.2d 1113, 1116 (Ala.1977); <em>Hogan v. Midland National Ins. Co., </em>3 Cal.3d 553, 564-66, 91 Cal.Rptr. 153, 160-61, 476 P.2d 825, 832-33 (1970); <em>Keller Industries, Inc. v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>429 So.2d 779 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983); <em>Timberline Equipment Co. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>281 Or. 639, 576 P.2d 1244 (1978); <em>Waite v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>77 Wash.2d 850, 467 P.2d 847 (1970). The burden of proving coverage in this latter instance lies with the insured, as a part of his burden of proving the extent of his damages. <em>Thomas v. Western World Ins. Co., </em>343 So.2d 1298, 1303 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.), cer<em>t. dismissed, </em>348 So.2d 955 (Fla.1977); <em>Waite v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>467 P.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">Here, there has been no showing that NHIC acted in bad faith, or that Triple U lacked effective representation during the state proceedings. It app\u00e9ars that the detriment to Triple U caused by NHIC\u2019s failure to defend was limited to the cost of the defense, plus the amount of NHIC\u2019s liability, if any, to Triple U under the terms of the policy. Because the general verdict obscures the jury\u2019s actual findings regarding damages, the rationale of the <em>Space Conditioning </em>case \u2014 that an insurer should not be permitted to profit from a wrongful refusal to defend \u2014 convinces us NHIC should be liable for the maximum amount the state jury could properly have awarded on the basis of the evidence before it concerning items of damage covered by the policy. At the same time, the general verdict does not relieve Triple U of its burden of proving the extent of its damages; nor would it justify an assumption the jury based its award on speculation rather than evidence. Therefore, the district court\u2019s computation of damages must be modified unless Triple U established that the instructions and evidence presented to the jury would have permitted an award of $286,232.00 for items of damage within the coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">The district court recognized that of the six instructions given the state jury regarding possible damage awards, only one concerned damages for which NHIC might be liable under the policy. That instruction stated that the jury might compensate the Heppers for the \u201closs of any calf crop that was the proximate result of the breach of any warranty of the defendant.\u201d Evidence presented to the jury in support of this instruction evidently suggested, in varying detail, three types of damages involving calves: (1) a three year history of reduced calf crops; (2) loss of calves through abortions; and (3) diminution in value of calves surviving. The district court noted that any award by the jury for the first type of damage would not be covered under the NHIC policy, since the policy\u2019s \u201cphysical injury to tangible property\u201d language is generally understood to exclude coverage for loss of profits or similar economic injuries. <em>See, e.g., Giddings v. Industrial Indemnity Co., </em>112 Cal.App.3d 213, 169 Cal.Rptr. 278 (1980); <em>Ludwig Candy Co. v. Iowa National Mutual Ins. Co., </em>78 Ill. App.3d 306, 33 Ill.Dec. 605, 396 N.E.2d 1329 (1979); <em>Wyoming Sawmills, Inc. v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>282 Or. 401, 578 P.2d 1253 (1978). The court concluded, however, that the jury might have awarded damages for the other two types of injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>to calves, and that such injuries were covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">NHIC argues that the \u201closs of any calf crop\u201d instruction would not support an award attributable to damage covered by the policy. Had the district court determined the instruction would encompass an award purely for diminution in value of calves born to diseased cows, we might tend to agree with NHIC. But we do not read the district court\u2019s opinion as so holding. Rather, that court found coverage under both the policy and \u201closs of any calf crop\u201d instruction for calves born, dead or alive, injured by infection with brucellosis. <em>Triple U. Enterprises v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>576 F.Supp. at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">In an unpublished memorandum subsequent to its published opinion, the district court on November 2, 1983 reiterated its holding of damage, and coverage, for physical injury, a disease, to tangible property, the calves that were born dead or alive. It was in that unpublished opinion also that the court found that it could not determine what portion of the general verdict of $286,232.00 was attributable to the claim for damages to calves born and consequently held NHIC liable for the full amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-7\">We have concluded that an award for the full amount can be justified here only if there was evidence in the state court record from which the jury could have found without speculation that covered damage to calves born equalled or exceeded the amount of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">Appellant argues with some force that that evidence shows at most coverage of $25,500.00 to calves born alive plus to which presumably would be added $18,-900.00 for thirty stillborn calves at $630.00 per head, said to have been seen by Ward Hepper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">However, this appeal arose from summary judgment. We do not know from the record before us, and the opinions of the district court do not reflect, the extent to which credible evidence of the dollar amount of covered damage was presented to the jury. We recognize that the evidence before the district court regarding damages to calves born may have been sketchy. Nevertheless, an effort must be made to establish the extent to which a jury award lawfully could have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-11\">In these circumstances, we must vacate the judgment and remand for further consideration of the amount of the damage award. In doing so, we emphasize that we intimate no view as to the ultimate amount of judgment to be entered, other than to say that it must include the amount of $51,893.35 for defense of the state action as originally awarded by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">.
