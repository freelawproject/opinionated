Connolly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, No. BN07528210088, in which the board vacated the initial decision of its presiding official and sustained Connolly\u2019s removal by the United States Department of Justice, United States Marshals Service. 18 M.S.P.R. 39 (1983). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b588-22\">The Department of Justice removed Connolly, a Deputy United States Marshal (DUSM) for over IOV2 years, for events which occurred on April 19, 1981. At approximately 6:30 p.m. Connolly observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>two individuals using a screwdriver and wire coathanger in an attempt to open a door of a 1980 Lincoln in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn in Falmouth, Massachusetts. Connolly was off duty at the time. He assumed that a felony was being committed and that there was insufficient time to call the local police. He approached the individuals and identified himself as a DUSM. When Connolly requested the individuals to produce identification and proof of car ownership, they turned toward him. Thinking that one of the individuals had a gun, Connolly drew his automatic pistol and announced that both were under arrest. One of the individuals, later identified as Raymond J. Gonsalves, called out to his girlfriend, who was sitting in a nearby car, to telephone the police. The other individual, later identified as Daniel L. Pacheco, stated that his brother owned the Lincoln. Notwithstanding the arrest at gun point, Connolly permitted Pacheco to enter the Holiday Inn to get his brother. When they returned, Robert Pacheco identified himself by showing Connolly his driver\u2019s license. He stated that he owned the Lincoln and because the keys were locked inside he had asked Daniel to open it. However, he did not present the vehicle registration which was apparently also inside the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Patrolman (Ptl.) David F. Cusolito of the Falmouth Police Department arrived at the scene. Ptl. Rufino L. Gonsalves, brother of Raymond Gonsalves, arrived a few minutes later. Ptl. Cusolito examined and returned Connolly\u2019s government credentials and took possession of his pistol. In order to file reports, all parties were advised to go to the nearby Falmouth police station. Connolly rode to the police station in Ptl. Cusolito\u2019s cruiser, at which time he complained to Cusolito that he had arrested Daniel Pacheco and Raymond Gonsalves but that Cusolito had released them. After obtaining tools to open the car, Raymond Gonsalves and the Pacheco brothers arrived at the police station approximately one hour later. Ptl. Gonsalves took his brother Raymond and Daniel Pacheco to the Alert Room, where they wrote their statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Sgt. Paul J. Poulos telephoned the Marshals Service in Boston to verify that Connolly was a United States Marshal. After learning what happened at the Holiday Inn, Sgt. Poulos informed Connolly that he knew Raymond Gonsalves and Robert Pacheco and asked Connolly if he wanted to pursue the matter. Connolly responded affirmatively, saying that he had not seen proof of ownership of the Lincoln. After speaking with the police chief, who told him that it was Connolly\u2019s arrest, Poulos informed Raymond Gonsalves and Daniel Pacheco that the U.S. Marshal had arrested them. They were booked and locked in cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">At some point thereafter during the evening, Connolly became satisfied that Robert Pacheco owned the Lincoln and dropped the charges. Unknown to Connolly, the police had already released the two men on $10 bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">During the course of events at the police station, Connolly threatened to file a complaint against Ptl. Cusolito if Cusolito confiscated his gun and credentials. In threatening Ptl. Cusolito regarding his possible appearance in court, Connolly used obscene language that was insulting and abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">On September 28, 1981, the United States Marshals Service, Boston, Massachusetts, notified Connolly of his proposed removal, giving the following reasons for the adverse action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">(1) false arrest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">(2) misconduct off duty (misuse of official authority); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-13\">(3) disrespectful conduct (use of insulting, abusive, or obscene language to or about others).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">The Marshals Service removed Connolly, effective December 11, 1981. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 562 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">On appeal, and after a hearing at which Connolly did not testify or produce witnesses in his behalf, the presiding official found that Connolly had probable cause for arresting Raymond Gonsalves and Daniel Pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>checo. Accordingly, he determined that the Marshals Service had failed to support its charge of false arrest by a preponderance of the evidence as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(c)(1)(B) (1982). The presiding official considered reasons (2) and (3), above, to be separate charges for the same offense, the confrontation with Ptl. Cusoli-to. Rule 16 of the Marshals Service\u2019s Table of Offenses and Discipline (misconduct off duty which would adversely affect the reputation of the Department of Justice), gives \u201carrest\u201d as an example of an offense covered by reason (2), which the presiding official presumed to refer only to the arrest of a Marshal. Thus, he found that the Department of Justice did not prove its misconduct off-duty charge because the rule was inapplicable. The presiding official found that the Marshals Service proved reason (3) by a preponderance of the evidence. He found however that the removal penalty was too harsh and therefore mitigated the adverse action to a 15-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The Department of Justice appealed the decision to the board, asserting that the presiding official (1) erroneously interpreted Rule 16 concerning misconduct off duty and (2) erred in finding that it had failed to prove the charge of false arrest. The board agreed with the Department of Justice and held that the agency had proved each of the three charges and that the penalty of removal was authorized and \u201cwithin the parameters of reasonableness.\u201d Accordingly, the board vacated the presiding official's initial decision and sustained the removal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In this appeal Connolly makes two basic arguments for reversal of the board. First, he claims that the board improperly entertained the petition for review when it allowed the issue of whether the agency had failed to prove the charge of false arrest to be grounds for appeal. Second, he claims that the penalty of removal was disproportionate to the offenses sustained and that his conduct did not impair the efficiency of the service. Connolly challenges, as an abuse of discretion, the full board\u2019s alleged failure to give \u201cproper weight\u201d to the findings by the presiding official in its reinstatement of the agency\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(e)(1), a party may petition the board to review the initial decision of the presiding official. Here, Connolly contends that the board abused its discretion because it granted the Department of Justice\u2019s petition for review in violation of an implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115 (1984), which provides: the Board <em>may </em>grant a petition for review when it is established that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">(a) New and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record was closed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-16\">(b) The decision of the presiding official is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or regulation. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">Connolly refers us to no authority which has construed this regulation to limit the board\u2019s authority of review only to these conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Law and logic point the other way. The presiding official\u2019s initial decision becomes the decision of the board if review is denied, or if the board does not open the case sua sponte. The regulation simply spells out two circumstances under which review may be granted. But, the board\u2019s authority to review is plenary as to those actions made appealable to it by law. <em>Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>759 F.2d 9 (Fed.Cir.1985). The presiding official\u2019s initial decision is a part of the record the board may review, but it may make its own record. The regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>contain other language which provides for reopening of the case by the board, oral arguments, and the filing of briefs. The board may \u201c[t]ake any other action necessary for final disposition of the case,\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.116(a)(4), or it \u201cmay affirm, reverse, remand, modify or vacate the decision of the presiding official, in whole or in part. Where appropriate, the Board shall issue a final decision and order a date for compliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1201.116(b). It is further provided in section 1201.117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">The Board may reopen and reconsider a decision of a presiding official on its own motion at any time, notwithstanding any other provisions of this part. <em>[Cf. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(e)(1)(B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">It is the final decision of the board we are now called upon to review. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.118.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">While we have not been called upon before to address the issue of whether a petitioner can invoke 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115 to prevent review by the board, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did so in <em>Dunning v. National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration, </em>718 F.2d 1170, 1173 (D.C.Cir.1983). There Judge Scalia said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">While setting forth the showings on the basis of which \u201cthe Board may grant a petition for review,\u201d \u00a7 1201.115 does not explicitly provide that review will not be granted in any other circumstance. Moreover, any negative implication that might ordinarily arise is eliminated by the second following section, which provides that \u201c[t]he Board may reopen and reconsider a decision of a presiding official on its own motion at any time, notwithstanding any other provision of this part.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.117. (It is clear that \u201creopening\u201d does <em>not </em>require that the presiding official\u2019s decision first become final through expiration of the specified period without filing of an appeal. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(a).) That provision makes it clear beyond doubt that \u00a7 1201.115 is not a categorical restriction upon the Board\u2019s review authority, but only sets forth the most common situations in which review will ordinarily be entertained. Or to put the point another way: If, in entertaining this appeal, the Board was acting beyond the specified limits of \u00a7 1201.115, it was clearly acting within its reserved discretion under \u00a7 1201.117. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">The <em>Dunning </em>court also found some support in the history of the regulation for its determination that an expansive reading of section 1201.115 is the better-reasoned approach. <em>Id. </em>at 1173 n. 1. We agree. It would be anomalous to assume that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(j) the board would prescribe one regulation limiting its authority to grant a petition for review, only to prescribe another regulation providing itself with absolute review authority. A regulation which by its own definition is permissive, not precatory, cannot be a mandatory restriction. <em>See generally Dawson v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>712 F.2d 264, 266-67 (7th Cir.1983) (discussing the board\u2019s authority to reopen a case). Accordingly, we hold that the board <em>may </em>grant a petition for review on grounds not falling within the ambit of section 1201.115(a) or (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such a holding is consonant with the broad policy considerations discussed in <em>Bookman v. United States, </em>453 F.2d 1263, 1265, 197 Ct.Cl. 108 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Turning now to the second prong of the appeal, Connolly also asserts that the board abused its discretion by giving insufficient weight to the presiding official\u2019s assessment of the facts. In order to address the merits of this assertion properly, we must make further reference to the standard by which the board should review its presiding official.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Although the board has the power to determine questions of fact and law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the first instance, it may refer any case appealed to it to a presiding official. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(b); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1201.4(a), 1201.41. A presiding official does not have an independent statutory basis for his jurisdiction. He hears only those cases referred to him by the board. The decision of a presiding official is merely \u201can initial (or recommended) decision.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.111. Such decision becomes final if a petition for review is denied or if a party to the appeal or the Special Counsel or the Director of the Office of Personnel Management does not petition the board for review within 30 days after receipt of the decision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(e)(1), or within 35 days after issuance of the decision, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1201.113, 1201.114, unless time is waived, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.12, or if the board does not reopen and reconsider the case on its own motion. In any case reviewed or reopened, the \u201c[bjoard may affirm, reverse, remand, modify or vacate the decision of the presiding official, in whole or in part.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.116(b). Given such a statutory and regulatory scheme, it is inappropriate to assume that the board is guided by customary standards of appellate review. <em>See Weaver v. Department of the Navy, </em>2 MSPB 297, 298, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1980), <em>petition for review denied, </em>669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir.1982). To the contrary, the board is free to substitute its judgment for that of one of its presiding officials, <em>Curran v. Department of the Treasury, </em>714 F.2d 913, 915 (9th Cir.1983); <em>McDon-ough v. United States Postal Service, </em>666 F.2d 647, 648 n. 1 (1st Cir.1981), with deference of course to the presiding official on any issues of credibility. <em>Griessenauer v. Department of Energy, </em>754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">When an employee who is adversely affected by a final decision of the board, such as Connolly, files a petition for review, this court is required to\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ama\">review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">(3) unsupported by substantial evidence[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). The initial (or recommended) decision of the presiding official is part of the record which this court reviews. When, as here, the decision of the full board differs from that of its presiding official, this court will engage in a more searching scrutiny of the record. <em>See Cur-ran, </em>714 F.2d at 915 and cases cited there.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">In the case now on appeal to us, the board and its presiding official agreed on the basic facts underlying the charges against Connolly. With respect to credibility, the determinations of the presiding official cut against Connolly\u2019s case. The presiding official found that Connolly\u2019s argument that the Falmouth police officers had made the arrests was not credible. Although Connolly denied using obscene language, the presiding official found to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">Pursuant to our statutorily prescribed standard of review, we must determine whether the board properly concluded that, whatever Connally\u2019s good intentions were, he did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the two men he arrested were committing a federal felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Connolly charged the two men with \u201c(1) tampering with a motor vehicle and (2) false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>identification displaying a weapon upon valid arrest.\u201d Even assuming that Connolly had reasonable grounds to believe the two men were committing these acts, Connolly has not cited any federal law which classifies either of them as a felony or as an offense against the United States. Thus, the full board properly reversed the presiding official and sustained the agency\u2019s charge of false arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Both the presiding official and the board concluded that Connolly was off duty when the incident occurred. The presiding official concluded that the second charge, misconduct off duty (misuse of official authority), was not sustained because Rule 16 of the agency\u2019s Table of Offenses and Discipline was by its terms inapplicable to the charge. The board, however, sustained the second charge, finding that Connolly\u2019s action adversely affected the Department of Justice and, thus, implicitly impaired the efficiency of the service. We agree with the the board. The presiding official\u2019s narrow reading of the rule referred to in the background portion of this opinion was an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Connolly\u2019s conduct in this bizarre fiasco was not only improper and in excess of his authority, but his rash behavior impinged on the working relationship between the Marshals Service and the local authorities and adversely affected the reputation of the Department of Justice and its Marshals Service. He demonstrated questionable judgment in drawing his weapon and in later refusing to back down in pursuing his charges when it should have been apparent to a reasonably prudent man that there were no reasonable grounds to believe the accused were guilty. The local police were called at the request of the accused who readily identified themselves and their conduct was explained by the owner of the car, a brother of one of those arrested. However, Connolly apparently \u201cgot his back up,\u201d insisted that his suspects be booked and charged, and refused to admit his error until the affair had dragged on unreasonably long, even though the local police were unconcerned with the incident and sought to reassure Connolly by vouching for the suspects. On the evening of the incident, Connolly\u2019s supervisor was informed over the telephone by the Falmouth police, that he \u201cwas on the borderline of being in protective custody for being intoxicated.\u201d This information later entered into the agency\u2019s decision to bring the removal charges. Finally, there was no excuse for his use of threatening, abusive, obscene language toward Ptl. Cusolito, the third reason for his discharge, sustained by both the presiding official and the board. <em>See Hayes v. Department of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1539 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Masino v. United States, </em>589 F.2d 1048, 1057, 218 Ct.Cl. 531 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The charges against petitioner which caused his removal were all sustained in the board\u2019s final decision now on appeal. Connolly made a false arrest, he engaged in misconduct off duty and in disrespectful conduct towards others. Connolly\u2019s contention that the board violated its regulation, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115, is without merit. It was not restricted by that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">As to petitioner\u2019s attack on the harshness of the penalty, and the board\u2019s failure to agree with its presiding official on this matter, we simply note, that the board was entirely within its legal rights to disagree and that the table of penalties authorized the punishment imposed for the offenses committed, as charged. Penalty decisions are discretionary and not for the courts to overturn absent an abuse of discretion or violation of applicable statute or regulation. <em>Schapansky v. Department of Transportation, </em>735 F.2d 477, 484 (Fed.Cir.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 432, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984); <em>Weston v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>724 F.2d 943, 949 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Petitioner makes the point that the board opinion does not discuss or reweigh factors which should be considered in mitigation, as set forth in <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), and approved in our various opinions. The agency considered factors in mitigation. The presiding official also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>sidered these factors in detail, and the board rejected his conclusions, so how can it be said they were not considered? The board cited <em>Douglas, </em>which showed its awareness of the factors involved. Perhaps its opinion could have been more artfully written. But, it is not per se reversible error for the board not to address the <em>Douglas </em>factors specifically. <em>See generally Devine v. Sutermeister, </em>724 F.2d 1558, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1983) (reviewing an award by an arbitrator). \u201cWhether the guidelines established in <em>Douglas </em>were followed is but one factor to be noticed in our review.\u201d <em>Nagel v. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>707 F.2d 1384, 1387 (Fed.Cir.1983). But, it has been held that \u201cfailure to consider a significant mitigating circumstance constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>VanFossen v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development, </em>748 F.2d 1579, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1984). <em>Douglas </em>states, \u201c[ojnly if the Board finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors, <em>or </em>that the agency\u2019s judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness, is it appropriate for the Board then to specify how the agency\u2019s decision should be corrected to bring the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness.\u201d 5 MSPB at 333, 5 M.S. P.R. at 306. (Emphasis added.) As stated in <em>Hunt v. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>758 F.2d 608, 611 (Fed.Cir.1985):</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Our statutory scope of review is narrow. Determination of an appropriate penalty is a matter committed primarily to the sound discretion of the employing agency. <em>Miguel v. Department of the Army, </em>727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed.Cir.1984). Whether we would have chosen a different penalty is irrelevant. The court\u2019s responsibility is to determine whether the action taken was an abuse of discretion, arbitrary, capricious, in violation of statute, regulation or authorized procedure, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (1982). If the penalty imposed can pass these tests, it will be upheld as having a rational and lawful basis. <em>Hayes v. Department of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We are satisfied, upon a careful review of the record, the arguments of the parties, and relevant statutes, regulations, and case law, that there is no legal basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-13\">. By order of the court on May 22, 1985, George Miller, Esq., Administrator of the Estate of Paul Connolly, was substituted as party petitioner. Mr. Miller's motion therefor advised the court that he had been duly appointed administrator of petitioner\u2019s estate by the Barnstable County, Massachusetts Probate Court.
