Gray, Senior United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-5\">GRAY, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This is an appeal from the summary judgment granted by the district court to defendant Fort Wayne Community Schools on appeallant\u2019s claim, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for alleged racial and sexual discrimination in her employment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The appellee discharged the appellant from her position as \u201cliaison aide\u201d at the appellee\u2019s \u201copportunity school\u201d located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, assertedly because of her insubordination and her excessive tardiness or absenteeism. The appellant contends that she was discharged because her supervisor \u201cdid not like to work with black women,\u201d and that she had been subjected to harassment on account of her race and sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The district court held that Ms. Trigg\u2019s complaint clearly stated a claim for employment discrimination, for which the remedy is found in Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and that she was bound by Title VII\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirements, including the filing of a charge of discrimination with the EEOC and the receipt of notice of a right to sue in federal court. The plaintiff had not accomplished these exhaustion requirements in pursuing her \u00a7 1983 claim, and the district court accordingly granted summary judgment against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The appellant contends that as a state government employee, she can base her \u00a7 1983 claim on the alleged violations of her Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, irrespective of whether the ap-pellee\u2019s conduct also violated Title VII. The appellee asserts that the appellant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights are not independent of the rights provided her under Title VII, and that Congress intended Title VII to preempt \u00a7 1983 in the area of public employment discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race or sex. The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause prohibits intentional discrimination based on membership in a particular class, <em>see Huebschen v. Department of Health and Social Services, </em>716 F.2d 1167, 1171 (7th Cir.1983), including acts of employment discrimination. <em>Cf. Davis v. Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 234-35, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 2271-72, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979)(The Fifth Amendment prohibits invidious sexual discrimination).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not by itself confer substantive rights, <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 618, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1916, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979). To bring an action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must cite a deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities \u201csecured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d <em>Huebschen, </em>716 F.2d at 1170. The appellant contends that the substantive basis of her \u00a7 1983 action is the appellee\u2019s violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-18\">The appellee contends that \u00a7 2 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103, which extended the protection of Title VII to state and local government employees, was intended to make Title VII the exclusive remedy for public sector employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>discrimination. For that proposition, the appellee cites <em>Brown v. GSA, </em>425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976) and <em>Great American Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association v. Novotny, </em>442 U.S. 366, 99 S.Ct. 2345, 60 L.Ed.2d 957 (1979). <em>Brown, </em>however, discussed \u00a7 llof the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, which extended Title VII protection to federal employees. The Court made it clear that Congress had been persuaded that federal employees had no effective judicial remedy for employment discrimination, and it inferred from Congress\u2019s silence that the congressional intent was to create an exclusive federal remedy to redress federal employment discrimination. <em>Brown, </em>425 U.S. at 827-29, 96 S.Ct. at 1965-66. By contrast, the legislative history of \u00a7 2 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, clearly indicates that \u00a7 2 was not intended to displace the existing \u00a7 1983 remedy for Fourteenth Amendment violations for <em>state </em>employees. H.R.Rep. 92-238, <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2137, 2154.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Sixth Circuit recently inferred from this Report that the rights of state government employees to sue under \u00a7 1983 for violations of their Constitutional rights were left intact. <em>Day v. Wayne County Board of Auditors, </em>749 F.2d 1199, 1204 (6th Cir.1984). <em>See also Novotny, </em>442 U.S. at 377 n. 21, 99 S.Ct. at 2351 n. 21 (majority opinion) and 395 n. 19, 99 S.Ct. at 2361 n. 19 (White, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\"><em>Novotny </em>considered whether a person injured by a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII can sue under \u00a7 1985(3). Mr. Novotny claimed that he was discharged for supporting the rights of female employees. The Court held that if a plaintiff could assert a Title VII action through \u00a7 1985(3), he could \u201c... completely bypass the administrative process, which plays such a crucial role in the scheme established by Congress in Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 99 S.Ct. at 2351.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">The critical distinction is that <em>Novotny </em>involved private discrimination, while this appeal involves alleged discrimination by a state employer. Mr. Novotny could not assert two independent rights, because although Title VII conferred rights to the plaintiff, \u00a7 1985(3), a purely remedial statute, did not. <em>Id. </em>at 376-78, 99 S.Ct. at 2351-52.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A state government employee has rights conferred by Title VII; such employee also has rights conferred by the Fourteenth Amendment because of the state action. Importantly, two Justices in the <em>Novotny </em>majority wrote separately to suggest that Mr. Novotny\u2019s employment discrimination claim based on \u00a7 1985(3) would have been legally sufficient if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>could have asserted <em>Constitutional </em>violations. <em>See id. </em>at 379-81, 99 S.Ct. at 2352-54 (Powell, J., concurring) and 383-8599 S.Ct. at 2354-56 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The Court further noted that Mr. Novot-ny\u2019s asserted right under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3, \u201cdid not even arguably exist before the passage of Title VII,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 376-77, 99 S.Ct. at 2351-52, and so Title VII could not have impliedly repealed any previously existing rights. By contrast, as discussed <em>supra, </em>a discharged state employee\u2019s right to sue under \u00a7 1983 for violations of the Equal Protection Clause was well established before the passage of Title VII, and the legislative history suggests that Congress intended that \u00a7 1983 would not be impliedly repealed in the employment discrimination context.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">From the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VII have granted public sector employees independent rights to be free of employment discrimination. A plaintiff may sue her state government employer for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment through \u00a7 1983 and escape Title VII\u2019s comprehensive remedial scheme, even if the same facts would suggest a violation of Title VII. This holding is consistent with the great weight of authority. <em>See Day v. Wayne County Board of Auditors, </em>749 F.2d 1199, 1205 (6th Cir.1984); <em>Meyett v. Coleman, </em>613 F.Supp. 39 (W.D.Wis.1985); <em>Storey v. Board of Regents, </em>600 F.Supp. 838, 840 (W.D.Wis.1985); <em>Zewde v. Elgin Community College, </em>601 F.Supp. 1237, 1244-46 (N.D.Ill.1984); <em>Skadegaard v. Farrell, </em>578 F. Supp. 1209, 1218 (D.N.J.1984); <em>Woerner v. Brzeczek, </em>519 F.Supp. 517, 519 (N.D.Ill.1981). <em>But see Torres v. Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, </em>592 F.Supp. 922, 929-30 (E.D.Wis.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-12\">.

The House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">In establishing the applicability of Title VII to State and local employees, the Committee wishes to emphasize that the individual\u2019s right to file a civil action in his own behalf, pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1870 and 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, is in no way affected____ Title VII was envisioned as an independent statutory authority meant to provide an aggrieved individual with an additional remedy to redress employment discrimina-tion____ The bill, therefore, by extending jurisdiction to State and local government employees does not affect existing rights that such individuals have already been granted by previous legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">H.R.Rep.
