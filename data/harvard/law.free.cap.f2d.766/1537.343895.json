No. 97-261, 96 Stat. 1102 (1983) (\u201cBRRA\u201d). In proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, Greyhound sought and was granted additional route authority throughout the Nation for regularly scheduled intercity bus service in the face of protests by various Greyhound competitors. Having lost before the ICC, the protestants now seek review of the agency\u2019s adverse decision. For the reasons that follow, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-7\">The BRRA is designed to reduce substantially federal regulation of the intercity bus system. In fashioning the BRRA, Congress anticipated that decreased regulation would, by creating competition in market situations where service by only one carrier had previously existed, increase carrier efficiency and enhance service to the public. Before the BRRA\u2019s passage, it was virtually impossible for a bus company either to enter a route already served by another carrier or to discontinue a route which the company was then serving. By virtue of the BRRA, it became substantially easier for a carrier either to obtain a new route or to discontinue an unprofitable route.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-8\">At the same time, the BRRA did not work total deregulation of the intercity bus system. Under current law, if a carrier desires to enter a route served by another carrier, the new carrier must tender a \u201cpublic interest\u201d application under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c) (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By virtue of the pro-competitive BRRA regime, the Interstate Commerce Commission is obliged to grant the application if the applicant can show that it is fit, willing, and able to serve the route, unless a protestant comes forward and affirmatively demonstrates that granting the application would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining whether a protestant has carried its burden of proof, the Commission is, \u201cto the extent applicable,\u201d to consider four factors enumerated in the statute. Those factors provide the benchmarks for our analysis, and we therefore set out the pertinent statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1601-13\">(A) the [national] transportation policy [as set forth in] section 10101(a) of [Title 49];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1601-14\">(B) the value of competition to the traveling and shipping public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1601-15\">(C) the effect of issuance of the certificate on motor carriers of passenger service to small communities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1601-16\">(D) whether issuance of the certificate would impair the ability of any other motor common carrier of passengers to provide a substantial portion of the regular-route passenger service which such carrier provides over its entire regular-route system____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1601-18\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c)(3) (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each of the four enumerated factors is to be given equal weight by the Commission in ruling on an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-20\">Greyhound Lines is the dominant carrier of passengers in the intercity bus industry, having \u201ccaptured up to 71 percent of the regular route or scheduled intercity bus transportation market, whereas its only national competitor, Trailways, Inc., has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>market share of about 21 percent.\u201d <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 One <em>Hundred Fourteen Routes, </em>No. MC-1515 (June 29,1983), App. B. at 1, J.A. at 1, 18 [hereinafter cited as AU Decision]. Trailways is a member of the National Trailways Bus System (\u201cNTBS\u201d), an association of forty-nine independent carriers that coordinate schedules, share a common trade name, and cooperate to offer nationwide service. Petitioner Carolina Coach Company is also a member Of NTBS, as are intervenors Seashore Transportation Company, Capital Motor Lines, and Colonial Trailways.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1602-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-5\">This case began in January 1983 when Greyhound filed applications to serve 147 new routes. In response, petitioners<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed discovery requests with the ICC for information and documents on Greyhound, as well as interrogatories, which they deemed relevant to the BRRA\u2019s four public-interest criteria,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as set out above. The Commission, however, remained mute in the face of these discovery requests as of the date on which protests to Greyhound\u2019s applications were due to be filed. The petitioners thereupon filed in a timely manner protests to twenty-nine of the proposed routes; the other 118 routes were automatically granted, as provided for under the BRRA\u2019s pro-entry provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-6\">In its response to the protests, Greyhound set forth its proposed schedules for the new routes, representing that its planned service was modest in extent, namely on the order of one to four buses a day for most routes. J.A. at 1188-89. Greyhound\u2019s applications were thereupon referred for decision to an Administrative Law Judge; in an ensuing prehearing conference, the AU ordered Greyhound to produce (1) its revenue projections on the proposed routes; (2) information on the ownership of bus terminals; and (3) information as to which carriers were allowed to use those terminals. J.A. at 2249. Greyhound provided the full panoply of information as to bus terminals, but at a conference in June 1983, Greyhound informed the AU that it had neither formulated revenue projections nor conducted market research or surveys with respect to the proposed routes. J.A. at 2269-70. It would appear that Greyhound did not develop such data because the routes under protest were, as the AU stated, \u201cdesigned to mesh with existing operations\u201d of Greyhound. AU Decision, J.A. at 4. Moreover, addition of the new routes did not require any capital investment by Greyhound. J.A. at 2271.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-11\">Greyhound further represented during the June 1983 conference that, in preparing its applications, it had relied principally upon the operating experience and business judgment of its Senior Director of Operations, Ernest Simmons. J.A. at 2270. The AU offered the petitioners the opportunity to depose Mr. Simmons during the prehear-ing conference. J.A. at 2246. However, the protestants did not seek to interrogate Mr. Simmons apparently because, in their view, they needed more documentation from Greyhound before they could mount a meaningful examination of the prospective witness. Petitioners\u2019 Brief at 12 n. 21. The AU thereupon denied all of the protestants\u2019 discovery requests. J.A. at 2291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-12\">As to the substantive issues, the protestants attempted through written submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>sions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to demonstrate that approval of Greyhound\u2019s applications would not be in the public interest as defined by the four statutory factors. Invoking the third and fourth factors in particular, petitioners argued that if Greyhound\u2019s applications were approved, each protestant would suffer a diversion of its own traffic sufficiently grave as to force each competing carrier both to reduce greatly the level of service to small communities and to cut back substantially on its entire system. Furthermore, the protestants argued that the AU could not properly evaluate the impact of Greyhound\u2019s expansion on the dominant carrier\u2019s competitors unless a more comprehensive analysis were first undertaken of the long-term effects on competition in the intercity bus system which would be wrought by the new authority. Specifically, the protestants argued that, by virtue of Greyhound\u2019s dominant position in the industry, each incremental increase in market share by Greyhound rendered problematic the competitive situation of non-dominant carriers, all of which are considerably smaller than Greyhound; thus, the argument ran, any new grant of authority to Greyhound would be destined to result in a diminution of competition. In the competitor\u2019s view, a global study of the industry, if undertaken by the Commission, would demonstrate that, were Greyhound continually awarded small increases in route authority, the result at day\u2019s end would be the virtual elimination of competition. In this respect, petitioners invoked this court\u2019s decision in <em>Trailways v. United States, </em>673 F.2d 514 (D.C.Cir.1982), rendered prior to the BRRA\u2019s passage; in <em>Trailways, </em>this court had held that the ICC was obligated to determine whether any detrimental impact on the public interest would be occasioned by granting Greyhound authority that had an incrementally adverse effect on Trailways\u2019 competitive position. <em>Id. </em>at 522. The ICC had never made such a <em>Trailways </em>-mandated determination, and the protestants argued to the AU that the ICC was still obliged to do so notwithstanding the supervening event of Congress\u2019 passage of the BRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-8\">In his June 1983 decision, the AU embraced the proposition that a study of the long-term competitive situation of the intercity bus industry was fully warranted; however, in contrast to the position championed by Greyhound\u2019s competitors, the AU believed that the study should not be part of the route-request proceeding at hand. In the AU\u2019s view, Greyhound enjoyed the BRRA-granted right to take advantage of the relaxed rules governing carrier expansion into new routes; the proposed study, however efficacious it might prove to be as a general matter, would unduly delay Greyhound\u2019s exercise of that right. The AU further opined that the study would best be performed under a Commission order of investigation, not an individual route-request proceeding, and proffered the recommendation to the ICC that just such an investigation be instituted. AU Decision, J.A. at 3. Having expressed this felt need for an industry-wide examination, the AU went on to grant Greyhound authority for all twenty-nine contested routes, based on his determination that the protestants had not demonstrated that granting Greyhound\u2019s application would be incompatible with the BRRA-defined \u201cpublic interest.\u201d J.A. at 9-10. In determining the effect of Greyhound\u2019s new service, the AU expressly relied upon Greyhound\u2019s proposed bus schedules in the face of the competitors\u2019 protestations that those schedules were rendered unreliable by Greyhound\u2019s historically aggressive operating practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-9\">Both sides appealed the AU\u2019s determination to the ICC. The protestants claimed that they were improperly denied discovery and that the AU should either have refused Greyhound\u2019s route requests or awaited completion of the proposed study before handing down his decision. Greyhound, in contrast, claimed that the proposed industry-wide study was unnecessary but that in all other respects the AU\u2019s decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>unimpeachable. A division of the ICC<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> upheld the AU on the discovery issue, but reopened the proceedings to permit the protestants to file rebuttal statements. <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 One <em>Hundred Fourteen Routes, </em>No. MC-1515 (Sept. 23, 1983), J.A. at 2303. In the reopened proceedings, Trailways and Carolina argued once more that Greyhound\u2019s claims with respect to its proposed schedules should not be accepted, and that the ICC should instead use what the protestants claimed was Greyhound\u2019s historic practice when it enters a new route of outscheduling its competition by a margin of two-to-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-4\">In a February 1984 decision, the full Commission held that the protestants had not sustained their burden of proof and upheld the AU\u2019s grant of the new route applications. The Commission decided that, based on Greyhound\u2019s proposed schedules, insufficient evidence had been adduced to show that granting the requested routes would cause substantial impairment of the protestants\u2019 business or harm to bus service to small communities. But the ICC at this juncture parted company with the AU; the Commission determined that the in-depth study of the bus industry which had intrigued the AU was unnecessary for the simple reason that Congress had already amply considered those issues during the course of crafting and enacting the BRRA. <em>Greyhound Lines, Inc., Extension </em>\u2014 One <em>Hundred Fourteen Routes, </em>No. MC-1515 (Feb. 6, 1984), J.A. at 24, 33-34 [hereinafter cited as ICC Decision]. Trailways and Carolina now petition for review of that decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1604-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-6\">Petitioners\u2019 first complaint is directed at the ICC\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cvalue of competition,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c)(3)(B), the second of the four statutorily prescribed factors which the ICC must take into account in evaluating an application. In its decision, the ICC interpreted that factor as strongly favoring approval of an application for entry. <em>See </em>ICC Decision, J.A. at 29; ICC Brief at 27. Petitioners argue that the ICC, when considering the value of competition, must look not only at the benefits which competition will bring, but also at the possibility that by allowing a dominant carrier into the smaller competitor\u2019s henhouse, the likely long-term result will be the destruction of nationwide competition in the intercity bus industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-10\">We begin with the elementary principle that in reviewing a statutory interpretation by an agency charged with administering the statute, courts are obliged first to determine whether Congress \u201chas directly spoken to the precise question at issue\u201d; if Congress\u2019 intent is clear, the court \u201cmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (footnote omitted). If on the other hand Congress\u2019 intent is unclear, the court \u201cmust conduct the \u2018narrower inquiry into whether the [agency\u2019s] construction was \u201csufficiently reasonable\u201d to be accepted by a reviewing court.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>742 F.2d 1561, 1567 (D.C.Cir.1984) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>FEC v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., </em>454 U.S. 27, 39, 102 S.Ct. 38, 46, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981)) (footnote omitted); <em>see Chemical Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 1108, 84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-15\">We are persuaded that the ICC\u2019s view of the value-of-competition factor faithfully reflects Congress\u2019 intent. The National Legislature believed that increased competition would result in a more efficient bus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>system that would better serve the American people. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 411, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 2308, 2322. (\u201c[I]f regulatory barriers to entry into the intercity bus industry are eliminated, the threat of entry would provide incumbent carriers with the incentive to provide efficient operations at the lowest rates consistent with the quality of service that consumers prefer.\u201d). At the same time, Congress recognized the possibility that the free rein of competitive forces in this particular industry could enervate smaller carriers with the consequence that a monopoly or virtual monopoly would result. This perception of possible detrimental effects flowing from unleashed competition led Congress to require the ICC to consider as a separate factor whether new entry would result in system-wide impairment of a competitor\u2019s service. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c)(3)(D). Systemwide impairment provides a regulatory check against what Congress considered could prove to be, in some circumstances, the undesirable effects of competition. It is unlikely in the extreme, and there is no evidence whatever to suggest, that Congress intended the ICC to consider the possible negative effects of competition under the impairment factor, only then to have the Commission consider those effects all over again under the value-of-competition factor. We find no evidence in the statute or the legislative history to support petitioners\u2019 latter-day theories of double counting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1605-4\">In connection with their value-of-competition argument, petitioners maintain, as they did unsuccessfully before the Commission, that under <em>Trailways v. ICC, </em>673 F.2d 514 (D.C.Cir.1982), \u201ca thorough study of competitive issues in the intercity bus industry is necessary before the ICC can reach <em>any </em>reasoned decision with respect to additional Greyhound route requests.\u201d Reply Brief at 11 (emphasis in original). To be sure, this court strongly suggested that the ICC conduct such a study before it could appropriately award Greyhound any new route authority. 673 F.2d at 522. That case, however, was decided before Congress\u2019 passage of the BRRA, when entry was considerably more difficult. Under the pre-BRRA regime, a carrier could not be granted a new route unless the ICC determined that the service which would thereby be provided was <em>required </em>by the public convenience and necessity. <em>Id. </em>at 518. Congress, when it passed the BRRA and greatly eased entry, was plainly aware of Greyhound\u2019s dominant position and the competitive problems which that carrier potentially posed for its smaller competitors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is most unlikely that in restructuring the entire federal regulatory scheme for the bus industry, Congress would intend that the ICC conduct an in-depth, time-consuming study before Greyhound would be allowed any entry, and yet fail somehow to state anywhere in the BRRA that such a study be undertaken. Not surprisingly, there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that Congress had any such exercise in mind. Rather, it would appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>that Congress intended the systemwide-im-pairment factor to be employed to treat the problem of Greyhound\u2019s market dominance, a legislative policy choice which implicitly supersedes the pre-BRRA requirements articulated in <em>Trailways.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1606-4\">The second difficulty with petitioners\u2019 call for a court-mandated ICC study is that the purpose to be served by such a study is not at all evident. If we hypothesize, favorably to Greyhound\u2019s competitors, that the conclusion of any such study would be that Greyhound so dominates the bus industry that each new entry by that carrier constitutes another step toward monopoly power, petitioners would then presumably argue that Greyhound should not be allowed any new entry until market conditions have been ameliorated from the current situation, as they perceive it, of a very large fish in a relatively small pond of competitors. But this result or a similar conclusion could not, it seems to us, be reconciled with the terms and intent of the BRRA. For better or worse, Congress plainly intended that entry be eased for <em>all </em>carriers. It would fly in the teeth of Congress\u2019 intent for the ICC, through a post-BRRA study, to bar new route authority to a carrier for an indefinite period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If on the other hand the study concluded that Greyhound\u2019s expansion entailed no substantial competitive problems, then the study would have been an academic exercise, with no practical effect on the BRRA\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-7\">Our interpretation of the value-of-competition factor finds modest support in the legislative history of the BRRA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In discussing the impairment factor, the Senate Report observed that this factor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASgG\">[i]s not intended to undercut or undermine the basic policy objectives ... to ease entry into the intercity bus industry. In fact, it should be noted that this impairment standard is only one of four factors to be considered by the ICC in making its public interest determination. The other factors, <em>including the value of competition, </em>are to be given equal consideration by the ICC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1606-8\">S.Rep. No. 411, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (emphasis added), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2308, 2324, 2324. The implication of this brief passage is clear: the value-of-competition factor, on the one hand, and the impairment factor, on the other, pull in opposite directions. Since the systemwide-impairment factor, when it is established by a protestant, weighs against the ICC\u2019s permitting entry, the value-of-competition factor must, in our view, argue contrariwise in favor of permitting the new route authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>IY</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-4\">In its decision, the Commission determined that Greyhound\u2019s applications would not impair petitioners\u2019 ability to provide a substantial portion of their regular-route passenger service. The Commission concluded that Greyhound\u2019s proposed schedules were limited, and thus would not divert enough passengers from the protestants\u2019 routes to work a substantial impairment of their respective systems. Petitioners claim that the ICC committed two fatal errors in reaching this finding. First, they contend that the ICC should have allowed discovery into Greyhound\u2019s scheduling practices in general and into its overall route restructuring program.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, they maintain that in the absence of such information the ICC should not have accepted Greyhound\u2019s unsupported assertions as to its proposed schedules, but instead should have assumed that Greyhound would outschedule its competition by a two-to-one ratio, as they claim Greyhound had done when it was granted new routes in the bygone, pre-BRRA days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-5\">With regard to the latter claim, the ICC did not, as petitioners would have it, blindly accept Greyhound\u2019s representations. Rather, the AU and the ICC determined that, given the routes in question and the financial incentives involved, the most logical conclusion to be drawn was that Greyhound would engage only in limited scheduling on these new routes. As we have already seen, the AU observed that \u201c[a]ll of the routes sought by Greyhound are designed to mesh with existing operations of the carrier.\u201d AU Decision, J.A. at 4. This led the AU to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1607-6\">Abstractly speaking, [Greyhound] does have the ability to overschedule any of the sought routes, but [it] is restrained by practical considerations. It simply makes no economic sense for Greyhound to eliminate successful existing schedules. Of course, many marginal schedules will be shifted to the sought routes and will capture traffic from the protestants. However, in order for Greyhound to \u201cover-schedule\u201d the new routes, it must be assumed that the carrier would foresake [sic] a large share of its existing profitable patronage in order to engage protestants in a war of attrition. I find no basis herein for reaching a conclusion of that kind ... as to any of the disputed routes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1607-10\">J.A. at 8. In its opinion, the ICC adopted the AU\u2019s conclusions in this respect. ICC Decision, J.A. at 29. In thereafter denying petitioners\u2019 request for a stay, the ICC expressly observed once more that \u201cthe AU concluded that although overschedul-ing was possible in theory, Greyhound was unlikely to do so because it would mean forsaking some existing successful operations along other routes to engage protestants in a war of attrition.\u201d ICC Stay Decision, J.A. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-11\">Thus, the AU and the ICC did not take Greyhound\u2019s word on faith. To the contrary, the Commission took cognizance of prevailing market conditions and determined that economically the most likely course of conduct was that Greyhound would indeed engage in the limited scheduling it had proposed, rather than the sort of profligate, cut-throat scheduling which protestants claimed would result. This conclusion is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Quite to the contrary, the ICC\u2019s conclusion in this respect seems quite logical in light of the changes to the industry wrought by the BRRA. Perhaps it made economic sense in the past for Greyhound to overschedule a route by running twice as many buses as its competitors since, after driving a competitor off the route, it was presumably difficult for new competitors to enter by virtue of the then-extant, highly restrictive entry provisions. But un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>der the BRRA, even if Greyhound managed to drive a competitor off a route by over-scheduling, at the point Greyhound sought to enjoy the fruits of its victory and reduce its schedule to a profitable level, another carrier could promptly enter the route and begin competing. For Greyhound to drive out the competition and keep the competitive field all to itself would seemingly require Greyhound to keep its routes over-scheduled, and thus, unprofitable. In the real world, a world understood better by an expert agency charged with administering the federal regulatory apparatus than the generalist judiciary, the ICC could reasonably conclude that the spectre of a wolfish Greyhound driving everyone else off the road was singularly unlikely.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1608-4\">We also cannot disagree with the Commission\u2019s decision not to allow the broad-based discovery which petitioners had requested.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> First, the conduct and extent of discovery in agency proceedings is a matter ordinarily entrusted to the expert agency in the first instance and will not, barring the most extraordinary circumstances, warrant the Draconian sanction of overturning a reasoned agency decision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Second, petitioners already had access to the documents that specifically related to the routes in question; their discovery desires went far beyond the route authority in question, however, and wandered intrusively into Greyhound\u2019s systemwide operations. Third, discovery into Greyhound\u2019s historic practices could reasonably have been determined by the agency as being of little utility, inasmuch as the present route applications represented the first time that Greyhound had beseeched the ICC for new authority in a significantly deregulated environment. Furthermore, since Greyhound\u2019s proposed scheduling plans logically meshed with its financial incentives, the ICC could reasonably have determined that the broad-based information petitioners wanted would not, at the end of the day, have convinced the ICC to reject Greyhound\u2019s proposed schedules. In an age of discovery run riot, the Commission was simply not required to allow a dragnet, expensive exercise of discovery into Greyhound's business when that discovery was seen by the agency as most unlikely to affect its decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>Our conclusion that the ICC\u2019s use of Greyhound\u2019s proposed scheduling was reasonable leads us similarly to conclude that the Commission\u2019s findings as to the business impairment of Trailways, Carolina and Peter Pan are reasonable as well. In their submissions, these three protestants all assumed that history would repeat itself, with Greyhound heavily scheduling the protested routes; armed with this premise, the protestants claimed that these aggressive scheduling practices would result in the diversion of fifty percent of their customers to Greyhound. J.A. at 671, 756-57, 894-95. The ICC could reasonably determine, however, that it was highly unlikely that the limited number of buses that Greyhound planned to run could divert enough passengers to impair substantially the ability of these three protestants to run their regular routes. Indeed, when Trailways and Carolina responded to Greyhound\u2019s proposed scheduling, they did not attempt to prove that such scheduling would cause substantial impairment; they argued, more modestly, merely that Greyhound\u2019s representations were unreliable. J.A. at 2527-31, 2637-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-5\">In contrast to Trailways and Carolina, Peter Pan advanced a far more focused claim of impairment, namely that a diversion of only fifteen percent of traffic from its Boston-Springfield operation could cause Peter Pan to cut back severely on all its regular route operations. J.A. at 2656. This contention suggested that a relatively modest loss in passenger traffic could have dire consequences for this small carrier striving, in the face of a powerful Captain Hook of the highways, to maintain its humble market share. But whatever its merit in the abstract, Peter Pan\u2019s contention foundered on the shoals of evidentiary failure. Peter Pan presented no evidence taht the three buses per day that Greyhound proposed (two from Springfield to Boston, one from Boston to Springfield, J.A. at 1278, 1488) would divert fifteen percent of the traffic from the twenty-five buses Peter Pan operates each day. J.A. at 1278. Peter Pan argued only that it would be \u201cdifficult to imagine that Greyhound would not be able to divert this amount of traffic\u201d even at the frequency of three buses per day. J.A. at 2656. Suppositions and speculation will not do; \u25a0 a lively imagination filled with economic hobgoblins is simply insufficient to meet the BRRA\u2019s requirement that <em>evidence </em>be adduced to show impairment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-10\">Peter Pan was not the only protestant which failed to meet its burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>proof. Seashore, Capital and Colonial also failed to adduce evidence upon which the Commission could reasonably have found substantial impairment. Indeed, in their joint protest, Capital and Colonial with admirable candor stated that they could not predict how much diversion Greyhound\u2019s new authority would cause or whether there would be substantial impairment of their regular route service. J.A. at 942-43. And Seashore claimed only that the \u201cdiversion of just a few passengers could easily tip the scales, and threaten Seashore\u2019s ability to provide a substantial portion of the regular route service which it currently conducts.\u201d J.A. at 1010. Specific evidence, not vague, apocalyptic visions of an economic Doomsday, was necessary in order for Seashore to prevail on this point; that evidence was not forthcoming.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1610-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1610-5\">As we have seen, one of the four enumerated factors that the ICC is to take into account in permitting entry is whether the grant of authority would have an adverse effect on service to small communities. It is in the Commission\u2019s treatment of this factor that petitioners discern yet another fatal defect in permitting the industry\u2019s dominant carrier to garner additional routes. Trailways and Carolina argued before the ICC that while their respective services to major cities and small towns were currently profitable, if Greyhound could freely enter and serve only high-volume traffic points, then overall service on these lines would become unprofitable for the two smaller carriers. In contrast to Trailways and Carolina, the other protestants claimed outright that their service to small communities operated in the red, but that they continued their operations to these communities out of a commendable, Jeffersonian sense of duty to small-town America. This <em>pro bono publico </em>tack of faithfully serving unprofitable routes was made possible, it was argued, by the higher</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>volume, profitable routes\u2019 cross-subsidizing of the small-town routes. These protestants maintained that Greyhound\u2019s entry would drain revenues from their profitable routes, with the unfortunate upshot that they would no longer be able to continue the unprofitable service to the Nation\u2019s small towns. In response to these arguments, the Commission concluded that the protestants had not demonstrated as a factual matter that any small communities would, in fact, lose service if Greyhound were granted the routes in question. The ICC also emphasized that the BRRA looked strongly with disfavor on cross-subsidies, so that the protestants\u2019 cross-subsidization arguments were built on a legal foundation of sand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-5\">We uphold the ICC\u2019s determination in this respect, principally because the protestants once again failed to sustain their burden of proof. Only Carolina and Peter Pan were able to point to any small communities that, in the protestants\u2019 view, would lose service if Greyhound\u2019s routes were granted, and we will turn to their positions in a moment. As for the other protestants, those carriers uniformly came forward with only generalized claims that service to some unidentified small towns might have to be curtailed in the wake of Greyhound\u2019s entry. The Commission could reasonably conclude that more detailed evidence would have to be forthcoming, not speculation and surmise, before any adverse effect on service to smaller communities would be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-6\">The carriers (Carolina and Peter Pan) which surmounted this threshold evidentia-ry failure did indeed come forward with specific claims of loss of service,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> but the two carriers\u2019 positions must ultimately fail for they grounded their claims on the defective premise which we have seen recurring in these proceedings, namely that Greyhound would heavily schedule the routes in question, which would thereby (1) cause heavy diversion of traffic to Greyhound; (2) render Carolina\u2019s and Peter Pan\u2019s operations unprofitable; and (3) force the latter two carriers to curtail their service to small towns. But as we have already seen, the Commission reasonably concluded that Greyhound was unlikely to schedule heavily the protested routes. With a more modest scheduling of only a few buses per day, the ICC determined that the diversion of traffic from Carolina or Peter Pan which would occur would not be sufficient to force them to abandon their presently served small towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-9\">In addition to the perceived lack of proof showing a curtailment of small-community service, the ICC relied upon what it deemed to be the BRRA\u2019s disaffinity for cross-subsidies so as to perpetuate unprofitable service on backwater routes. In this respect, petitioners object to the ICC\u2019s statement that \u201can inelutable tenet of the Bus Act is that all cross-subsidies are to be reduced or avoided and should not be used as a defense by protestants for continued entry protection.\u201d J.A. at 30. Such an ironclad opposition to cross-subsidies, protestants argue, is nowhere to be found in the BRRA. We need not resolve this question, since regardless of the BRRA\u2019s application in this respect the petitioners\u2019 claims fall short of establishing actual loss of service to small communities. By virtue of that failure of proof, we need not plumb the theoretical and practical depths of the BRRA\u2019s relationship to cross-subsidies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-10\">At the same time, the Commission erred, in our view, when it treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number>Trailways\u2019 and Carolina\u2019s arguments as involving cross-subsidies. An examination of the protests of those two carriers demonstrates that they did not argue they were sustaining losses in their own service to small communities; instead, they argued that the grant of Greyhound\u2019s applications would result in operating losses in their small-town services, with the carriers, in consequence, having to discontinue such service. This argument is in no way precluded by the BRRA; indeed, if the small-communities factor is to have any meaning, it is precisely this type of argument which the ICC should entertain. However, the Commission\u2019s failure to give credence to the arguments of Trailways and Carolina was harmless in this case because of the recurring shortcoming in these proceedings, namely the protestants\u2019 failure to come forward with evidence to support their small-communities argument. <em>See supra </em>pages 24-25.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-5\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1601-9\">.

Petitioners also argue that the systemwide-im-pairment factor covers only the immediate effects of entry into a specific market, whereas the value-of-competition factor encompasses the possible long-range effects that one entry can have when combined with other, future entries. However, we still find it highly unlikely that Congress would specifically require the ICC to consider some of the negative effects of competition under the impairment standard, and then require the ICC and the courts to deduce other negative effects under the value-of-competition factor. Also, nothing in the systemwide-impairment factor limits it to short-range concerns. If the evidence shows that a grant of authority would not lead to substantial impairment in the short run, but would in the long run, then substantial impairment will have been demonstrated. But it does seem true that the question is whether granting a particular route will lead to substantial impairment, not whether granting that route will lead to substantial impairment when combined with route authority that might be granted in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1605-7\">.

However, the Second Circuit was there interpreting section 208(b) of the Staggers Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10713(b) (1982), which specifically required the disclosure of the essential terms of such contracts. 722 F.2d at 1032. The BRRA contains no similar provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1609-7\">. Before making the present application, Greyhound already was running two buses per day from Albany to Boston and one from Boston to Albany; indeed, Greyhound had maintained approximately the same level of service between those two points for a quarter century. J.A. at 888, 1488. However, Greyhound was prohibited under the old, heavily regulated regime from stopping at Springfield, <em>which was directly on the route which Greyhound travelled. </em>The BRRA allows a carrier to remove \"automatically\u201d such restrictions in an expedited proceeding authorized by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(i)(4). Such a removal could be prohibited only if the elimination of such restrictions would have a harmful impact on commuter bus operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-8\">Greyhound did not apply for the removal of restrictions under the expedited proceeding provisions, however; instead, it chose to apply under the \"public interest\u201d provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c). Nonetheless, the Commission stated that \"[w]hen an applicant seeks to consolidate authority for existing routes or to complete authority for existing services which are subject to restrictions, it is proper to require an even greater showing from a protestant objecting to the accomplishment of such modest goals.\u201d J.A. at 32-33. Petitioners object that nothing in the BRRA allows the ICC to increase the burden of proof in \"public interest\u201d proceedings. They argue that even if Greyhound could have had its restrictions automatically lifted through the provisions for expedited proceedings, since Greyhound chose to use the \"public interest\u201d proceeding, it must proceed under the more stringent requirements of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-12\">Petitioners are quite right that nothing in section 10922(c) specifically provides that any greater showing is required by a protestant when an applicant seeks intermediate point authority. On the other hand, quite aside from the deference appropriately owed by the courts to an agency's interpretation of the statute, see <em>supra </em>page 10, we stated only last year in <em>Trailways, Inc. v. ICC, </em>727 F.2d 1284 (D.C.Cir.1984), that the provisions of section 10922(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1610-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>are functionally equivalent to a judgment that it will always be in the public interest for a carrier to be permitted to make intermediate stops along a route it is already serving. Underlying this judgment is a principle that the energy conservation and efficiency gained by permitting intermediate stops on certificated routes will usually outweigh any detriments\u2014 such as competitive harm suffered by competing carriers \u2014 that new service to intermediate points could cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1610-7\">727 F.2d at 1290. These considerations lead to the conclusion that at least the first factor of section 10922(c) \u2014 the transportation policy of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(a) \u2014 argues strongly for granting intermediate point authority. Thus, at least in that respect, a protestant would seemingly have to make a stronger showing to prove its case, because one factor would be weighing heavily in favor of granting the application. But since the ICC\u2019s reasoning in this respect is not crystal clear, we pursue this issue no further and do not rest our holding upon the propriety of demanding a stepped-up showing. Rather, we quite narrowly conclude that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the ICC erred as a matter of law, the agency\u2019s error does not alter our substantive conclusion by virtue of the protestants\u2019 failure to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that Greyhound\u2019s applications were not in the public interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1610-8\">. Petitioners claim in this regard that the ICC construed the \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d test too strictly, by requiring protestants to prove that their businesses would be destroyed by the granting of the applications before impairment could be found. We quite agree with petitioners that a carrier could sustain impairment of its entire regular-route system, within the cognizance of the BRRA, without experiencing outright destruction of its business. However, we are unable to agree with petitioners' fervent claim that the ICC in fact applied a \"business destruction\u201d test in gauging impairment <em>vel non. </em>To be sure, the Commission did state that it had to \"consider whether [Greyhound's] competition is likely to have an impact so great as to be destructive of the only nationwide competition it has within the intercity bus industry.\u201d ICC Decision, J.A. .at 31. But the ICC went on to state that <em>\"[ejven if the protestants\u2019 gloomy predictions of diversion prove correct, </em>we find no adequate basis for their contention that their businesses will be destroyed.\u201d J.A. at 31-32 (emphasis added). Fairly viewed, the ICC was not imposing a test that required a showing of business destruction, but was, instead, responding to the protestants\u2019 claims of business destruction. The Commission evidenced its appreciation of the correct standard when it stated that \u201d[t]he standard we must consider is whether these [competitive] impacts are so severe as to materially jeopardize the ability of the protesting carriers to provide a substantial portion of their entire systems of regular-route passenger service.\u201d J.A. at 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1611-7\">.

The ALJ likewise appeared to have fallen into error when, in discussing the small-communities factor, he stated that not only was there no showing that any small community would lose service from the granting of Greyhound\u2019s application, but that it was also possible that \"new carriers ... may emerge to meet passenger needs abandoned by applicant and protestants.\" ALJ Decision, J.A. at 9. As we stated in a slightly different situation in <em>Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n v. United States, </em>749 F.2d 841 (D.C.Cir.1984), the ICC cannot make its public-interest finding by relying on a \u201cspeculative \u2018belief\u2019 that a low cost carrier might someday provide alternative bus service to the affected communities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 854. The ALJ had to have some evidence that there were in fact carriers likely to institute service to the affected communities before he could invoke such a possibility to justify granting the applicaftions. Otherwise, the small-communities factor becomes meaningless, for the ICC could always idly speculate that if a protestant abandons a community, another carrier might come in and save the day. However, due to the protestants' lack of proof in this case, the ALJ\u2019s error is, when all is said and done, harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
