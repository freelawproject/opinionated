For the reasons stated below, we agree with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that it was without authority to impose such conditions in an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d \u00a7 10905 sale; the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">The facts of this dispute may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">In January 1982, the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Company (\u201cIllinois Central\u201d) filed a notice of intent to abandon approximately 13V2 miles of railway line between Cisco and Green\u2019s Switch, Illinois. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903. A complete application for abandonment was filed by Illinois Central in February 1982. In May 1982, the ICC issued its decision granting Illinois Central\u2019s abandonment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">Under \u00a7 10905, however, after the ICC approves an abandonment of a line, any \u201cfinancially responsible person\u201d who will provide continued rail service over the line may file within 10 days of the ICC\u2019s approval an offer to purchase the line. Cisco Cooperative Grain Company (\u201cCisco\u201d) did in fact file such an offer within the time period and was found by the Commission to be \u201cfinancially responsible.\u201d The ICC then postponed the issuance of the certificate of abandonment to allow Illinois Central and Cisco either to negotiate a price or to request that the Commission set the terms of the sale. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10905(d). The parties were unable to come to an agreement; Cisco then petitioned the Commission to establish the terms. The ICC did in fact determine the values of the properties involved, but on appeal that decision was remanded by this court for reconsideration. <em>Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>717 F.2d 408 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-13\">When this action was again before the Commission on remand, petitioner Simmons \u2014 the Illinois Legislative Director for the United Transportation Union, which is the collective-bargaining representative for the majority of persons employed by Illinois Central in freight-train service \u2014 filed a petition on November 21, 1983, to intervene for the purpose of seeking the imposition by the ICC of labor-protective conditions in the proposed \u00a7 10905 purchase. In an order dated February 13, 1984, the Commission denied the petition to intervene and cited its decision in <em>Illinois Central Gulf Railroad Co. </em>\u2014 Abandonment, 366 I.C.C. 911 (1983), <em>aff'd sub nom. Simmons v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>760 F.2d 126 (7th Cir.1985) <em>(\u201cSimmons I\u201d), </em>in which the agency ruled that it was without authority to impose labor-protective conditions in a \u00a7 10905 transaction. The Commission then redetermined the value of the properties and Cisco ultimately accepted these terms. Accordingly, the ICC in an order dated March 12, 1984, approved the transfer of the line to Cisco and dismissed the abandonment application. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10905(e). No labor-protective conditions were imposed. Simmons now seeks review of the Commission\u2019s denial of his petition to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-15\">A. Denial of Petition to Intervene</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-16\">Simmons first argues that the Commission improperly denied his petition to intervene. We initially note that Simmons sought to intervene solely for the purpose of seeking the imposition of labor-protective conditions in the impending \u00a7 10905 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>transaction. As we read its order, the Commission reached the merits of the intervention petition and concluded that the agency was without authority to impose such conditions. Because the ICC found itself unable as a matter of law to provide petitioner with the relief he sought, any further proceedings on the question of labor-protective conditions would have been an exercise in futility; accordingly, the petition to intervene was denied. We add, however, that Simmons\u2019s petition was denied on this narrow ground alone. Thus, we do not understand the Commission\u2019s denial to extend any further than the question of the imposition of labor-protective conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\">In considering the propriety of the Commission\u2019s denial of the petition for intervention, we must first determine whether the agency was correct in its conclusion that it was without authority to impose labor-protective conditions in a \u00a7 10905 transaction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the agency was correct, then no further administrative proceedings are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">B. Commission\u2019s Authority to Impose Labor-Protective Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">In denying the petition, the Commission relied on its decision in <em>Simmons I </em>for the conclusion that it was without authority under \u00a7 10905 to impose labor-protective conditions. As indicated above, that decision was recently upheld by this court. Thus, it is clear that, in the case of a \u201cvoluntary\u201d sale under \u00a7 10905, the ICC is unable to impose such conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue then in the instant case is whether the reasoning of <em>Simmons I </em>applies to a \u201cforced\u201d or \u201cinvoluntary\u201d sale under the statute. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the Commission that it does.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">The history and procedures of \u00a7 10905 have been discussed elsewhere,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and will not be reiterated here. For the purposes of the instant dispute, however, it should be noted that in the original version of \u00a7 10905, <em>see </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 la(6) (1976), the Commission was not empowered to set the terms of compensation in the event that the parties were unable to come to an agreement. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, P.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>No. 96-448, \u00a7 402(c), 94 Stat. 1895, 1942-45 (\u201cStaggers Act\u201d), made two fundamental changes in \u00a7 10905. First, in response to \u201chold out\u201d and other problems created by the original statute, <em>see Hayfield Northern Railroad Co. v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Transportation Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 5. Ct. 2610, 2615-16, 81 L.Ed.2d 527 (1984), Congress authorized the ICC on request from either party to determine \u201cthe price and other terms of sale,\u201d \u00a7 10905(f)(1)(C), if the parties initially fail to agree on these terms. In no case, however, is the Commission to set a price that is below the fair market value of the line. The terms established by the ICC are binding on the \u201cseller,\u201d although the \u201cbuyer\u201d may withdraw its offer to purchase within 10 days of the Commission\u2019s decision. Second, \u00a7 10905(e) now provides that, if the buyer and seller enter into an agreement, the Commission \u201cshall approve the transaction and dismiss the application of abandonment or discontinuance.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">The first argument of the Commission, which was upheld in <em>Simmons I, </em>is that the mandatory requirements under \u00a7 10905(e) of both approval of the transaction and dismissal of the abandonment certificate demonstrate that the labor-protective conditions attached to the agency\u2019s approval of the abandonment, <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7 10903(b)(2), do not come into play when a \u00a7 10905 transaction is completed. <em>See also </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.27(f)(2), (h)(6) (1984); <em>cf. Abandonment of Railroad Lines &amp; Discontinuance of Service, </em>365 I.C.C. 249, 259-61, 272 (1981). However, these requirements \u2014 without more \u2014 do not determine whether labor-protective conditions may be imposed under \u00a7 10905. Nonetheless, they do show that any authority the Commission may have to condition a transaction under other provisions does not \u201ccarry through\u201d in a \u00a7 10905 transaction. As a result, \u00a7 10905 is an independent and discrete procedure, and any authority to impose such conditions must be derived from that provision alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">After <em>Simmons I, </em>it is clear that, in the context of a \u201cvoluntary\u201d sale, the Commission cannot impose labor-protective conditions. Thus, the question presented by the instant petition for review is whether the Commission\u2019s ability to set the \u201cprice and other terms of sale\u201d under \u00a7 10905(f)(1)(C) allows it to impose labor-protective conditions in an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d sale. Certainly the language of \u00a7 10905 does not expressly state that the Commission has this authority. As we found in <em>Simmons I, </em>760 F.2d at 129, a common-sense reading of \u00a7 10905(f)(1)(C) does not suggest that it refers to labor-protective conditions. Furthermore, as the Commission forcefully asserted in its second argument of <em>Simmons I, see </em>366 I.C.C. at 913-14, other provisions of the Staggers Act stand in stark contrast to \u00a7 10905(f)(1)(C), because they specifically refer to the protection of employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>The language of these contemporaneous amendments indicates that Congress simply does not use the phrase \u201cprice and other terms of sale\u201d to refer to labor-protective conditions. Petitioner has not referred this court to any contrary indications in the legislative history. Indeed, the committee reports discussing \u00a7 10905 are silent on the subject of labor protection. <em>See </em>H.Conf.Rep. No. 1430,. 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 125 (1980), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1980, pp. 3978, 4110; S.Rep. No. 470, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 40 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">In his reply brief, Simmons acknowledges that labor-protective conditions are not \u201cterms of sale,\u201d but rather that they are \u201cimposed by the I.C.C. as a condition to the agency\u2019s approval of a transaction.\u201d Thus, petitioner in fact acknowledges that these conditions would not ordinarily be imposed when the Commission sets the terms of the transaction under \u00a7 10905(f)(1)(C), but only when it subsequently approves the sale and dismisses the initial abandonment certificate. Consideration of the provisions of the Staggers Act that specifically refer to the protection of employees, <em>see supra </em>note 7, confirms that such protection is indeed imposed by the Commission as a condition of the final <em>agency approval </em>and not as a condition of the underlying sale. Section 10905, however, allows the Commission to determine only the conditions of the underlying sale. Thus, petitioner has in fact conceded that \u00a7 10905 does not expressly authorize the Commission to impose labor-protective conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">Therefore, in the context of \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d as well as \u201cvoluntary,\u201d sales, \u00a7 10905 is silent on the Commission\u2019s authority to impose labor-protective conditions. This lacuna implicates all the concerns we identified in <em>Simmons I, </em>760 F.2d at 129-31, with regard to a judicial construction of \u00a7 10905 that would allow for the imposition of such conditions. When the silence of \u00a7 10905 is considered in the light of the extensive consideration given to labor protection in the Staggers Act and the provisions of that Act that refer specifically to employee protection, we cannot say that the Commission\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable. As we stated in <em>Simmons I, </em>760 F.2d at 131, \u201c[i]f the statute is to be supplemented, it should be done by Congress or by the Commission, not by us.\u201d <em>Cf. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2792-93, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-14\">In view of this disposition, we need not consider the Commission\u2019s argument, <em>see </em>366 I.C.C. at 913, that Congress \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the agency\u2019s post-1980 interpretation of \u00a7 10905. However, we will briefly consider a type of congressional \u201cacquiescence\u201d argument advanced by petitioner. As we noted in <em>Simmons I, </em>760 F.2d at 130, the Commission, prior to the Staggers Act, had interpreted \u00a7 10905 to allow for the imposition of labor-protective conditions. Petitioner argues that Congress in essence \u201cratified\u201d these administrative interpretations in 1980 with the passage of the Staggers Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-15\">We initially note that reliance on the chimerical concepts of congressional \u201csilence\u201d or \u201cinaction\u201d as a basis for \u201cacquiescence\u201d or \u201cratification\u201d is dubious at best. Nonetheless, we do not have to delve into these conundrums, as it is clear that Congress did not simply reenact \u00a7 10905 in 1980. To the contrary, the Staggers Act calls for the mandatory dismissal of the abandonment certificate and approval of the transaction when the parties agree to a \u00a7 10905 sale. In addition, the Act allowed the Commission in the case of an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d sale under \u00a7 10905 to set only the \u201cprice and other terms of sale,\u201d while it expressly amended other provisions to provide for labor protection. Thus, no \u201cratification\u201d of previous administrative inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>pretations can be inferred from congressional \u201csilence\u201d when the statutory scheme has been so fundamentally altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">Because the Commission correctly concluded that it had no authority to impose labor-protective conditions in an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d sale under \u00a7 10905, further administrative proceedings would be of no value. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">. At oral argument, counsel for petitioner maintained that the circumstances of this dispute had changed because Cisco was not operating the line. However, any questions arising from this alleged failure to provide continued rail service were not considered by the Commission in its order denying petitioner leave to intervene; thus, the issue is not properly presented to this court. As we noted above, the Commission\u2019s denial of intervention was limited solely to the question whether the agency had the authority to impose labor-protective conditions in a \u00a7 10905 purchase. This ruling does not in any way prejudice the rights that petitioner may have in the event that Cisco does not operate the line.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">. The parties have devoted considerable attention to questions relating to our standard of review. However, as we noted in <em>Simmons I, </em>760 F.2d at 129, recent pronouncements from the Supreme Court indicate that, without regard to questions of administrative expertise, the judiciary should, as a matter of course, accord great weight to statutory interpretations rendered by the agency responsible for the statute\u2019s enforcement if Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue and if the agency\u2019s interpretation is not unreasonable. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>- U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The reasoning of <em>Chevron </em>is controlling in this case, because \u00a7 10905 is indeed silent on the question of labor-protective conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1259-14\">. In this opinion, the term \"voluntary sale\u201d refers to a transaction in which the parties agree on the price and other terms of sale without the aid of the Commission. The terms \"forced sale\u201d and \"involuntary sale\u201d refer to a transaction in which the Commission, pursuant to \u00a7 10905(f)(1)(C), determines the price and other terms of sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1259-15\">. Petitioner argues that the instant dispute may be distinguished from <em>Simmons I </em>because Cisco is not a \"carrier.\u201d We disagree. Section 10905 does not require that the purchaser be a \"carrier,\u201d but only a \u201cfinancially responsible person\u201d who will provide continued rail service over the line. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10905(d), (e); <em>see also </em>1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(17). Thus, Cisco\u2019s status as a \"non-carrier\u201d is not a relevant consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1259-16\">. <em>See, e.g., Hayfield Northern Railroad Co. v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Transportation Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2610, 2615-16, 81 L.Ed.2d 527 (1984); <em>Simmons I, </em>760 F.2d at 128-29; <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>678 F.2d 665, 666-68 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">. A superficial reading of \u00a7 10905(e) may suggest that the ICC is only required to dismiss the abandonment certificate in the case of a \"voluntary\" sale. However, the language of \u00a7 10905(e) makes no distinction between \"voluntary\u201d and \"involuntary\u201d sales, and consideration of \u00a7 10905 <em>in toto </em>supports the Commission's interpretation that it must dismiss the certificate without regard to the character of the underlying sale. <em>Compare, e.g., </em>\u00a7 10905(e) <em>with </em>\u00a7 10905(f)(2); <em>cf. </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905(b) (Supp. II 1978).
