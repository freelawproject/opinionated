In the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (LSC Act), Pub.L. No. 93-355, 88 Stat. 378 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2996-29961 </em>(1982)), Congress provided for an eleven-member Board of Directors \u201cappointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, no more than six of whom shall be of the same political party.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996c(a). The Corporation, Congress instructed, was to serve the need in our nation for high-quality civil legal assistance to poor persons, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2996; \u201cto preserve [LSC\u2019s] strength,\u201d Congress specifically stated, the Corporation \u201cmust be kept free from the influence of or use by it of political pressures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2996(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">When President Reagan took office in January 1981, plaintiff-appellants were serving as LSC directors. Although their terms expired \u2014 in five cases on July 13, 1980, and in the remaining cases on July 13, 1981 \u2014 they retained their directorships pursuant to Congress\u2019 \u201choldover\u201d directive that \u201c[e]ach member of the Board shall continue to serve until the successor to such member has been appointed and qualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2996c(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-17\">On December 30, 1981, and January 22, 1982, while Congress was in recess, the President named replacements for plaintiff-appellants. 17 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1431-32 (Dec. 31, 1981); 18 Weekly Comp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Pres. Doc. 69 (Jan. 22, 1982). Their replacement in this manner, plaintiff-appellants maintained, was illegitimate and invalid. They reasoned as follows. Congress created the Corporation not as an arm of government but, to secure LSC\u2019s independence, as a private nonprofit corporation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996b(a). LSC Board members, Congress declared, \u201cshall not ... be deemed officers or employees of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2996c(c). Because LSC directors are not \u201cofficers of the United States,\u201d plaintiff-appellants continued, their appointment is controlled entirely by statute \u2014 the LSC Act \u2014 and is not subject to the President\u2019s power, under article II, section 2, clause 3 of the Constitution, \u201cto fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d The statute, as plaintiff-appellants read it, authorized displacement of holdover directors only by persons both nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. A recess appointee named by the President but unconfirmed by the Senate, plaintiff-appellants concluded, does not rank as a person who has \u201cqualified,\u201d as that term is employed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996c(b), to succeed a holdover Board member.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The district court granted summary judgment for defendant-appellees. It found no clear indication that Congress, when it passed the LSC Act, had even adverted to the prospect of recess appointments to the LSC Board. Recess appointment authority is a traditional accoutrement of the executive\u2019s appointment function; it should be implied, the district court essentially held, absent demonstration of an explicit decision by Congress to exclude such authority. <em>McCalpin v. Dana, </em>No. 82-542 (D.D.C. Oct. 5, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Nominations to the LSC Board were made in March and April of 1982, 18 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 272-73, 526 (Mar. 1 &amp; Apr. 19, 1982); in October and November of 1983, 19 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1406, 1550 (Oct. 7 &amp; Nov. 8, 1983); and in March of 1984, 20 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 423 (Mar. 19, 1984). The 1982 nominations were withdrawn by the President, 18 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 1608 (Dec. 8, 1982); the 1983 and 1984 nominations were not acted upon before the Senate adjourned <em>sine die, </em>first on November 18, 1983, and, the next time, on October 12, 1984. For close to three and one-half years, the Corporation was in fact headed by a succession of recess appointees. <em>See </em>Appellees\u2019 Updated Statement of Facts (Dec. 12, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The Executive\u2019s repeated recourse to recess appointments to the LSC Board, <em>id., </em>was matched by Congress\u2019 repeated resort to appropriations riders restraining change in the Corporation\u2019s operations pending the advent of directors confirmed by the Senate. <em>See National Senior Citizens Law Center v. Legal Services Corp., </em>751 F.2d 1391 (D.C.Cir.1985). With the political branches engaged in these thrusts and parries, we did not rush to judgment. Although we did not regard the case as off limits to the judiciary, <em>cf. </em>Henkin, <em>Is There a \u201cPolitical Question\u201dDoctrine?, </em>85 Yale L.J. 597 (1976), we hesitated to resolve a conundrum Congress had become aware of and was best suited to address in the first instance. <em>Cf. Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute, </em>448 U.S. 607, 672, 100 S.Ct. 2844, 2879, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in the judgment) (\u201cCongress, the governmental body best suited and most obligated to make the choice confronting us in this litigation, has improperly delegated that choice to the Secretary of Labor and, derivatively, to this Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">On January 3, 1985, the President nominated eleven persons to be members of the LSC Board. 21 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 19-20 (Jan. 3, 1985). On June 12, 1985, the Senate confirmed the President\u2019s nominees. That Senate action terminates plaintiff-appellants\u2019 claim to status as holdover directors. Because the case has become moot, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the complaint. <em>See United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S.Ct. 104, 106, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).
