MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) denying Guadalupe Saldana\u2019s (\u201cSaldana\u201d) request for an award of attorney fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">At all times relevant to this appeal, Sal-dana has been employed by the Environmental Protection Agency as an Equal Employment Opportunity Specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-19\">On March 20, 1980, Saldana was invited to meet with President Carter to discuss issues of importance to the Hispanic community. At that time, Saldana was National Chairman of the American G.I. Forum, a national Hispanic organization. The meeting lasted about 10 minutes, and then a press conference was held at which Salda-na made a statement noting the historical significance of the meeting and mentioning some issues which warranted future discussion. Just prior to the meeting, Ruben Treviso, the Executive Director of the American G.I. Forum, had given Saldana a press release (for issuance after the meeting) which indicated that Saldana was endorsing President Carter for reelection. However, Saldana rejected this press release and it was never issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">On June 11, 1982, the then Special Counsel for the MSPB (\u201cSpecial Counsel\u201d) filed a complaint with the MSPB pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that Saldana engaged in prohibited political activity in violation of the Hatch Act, <em>5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 7324 <em>et seq., </em>by endorsing President Carter during their meeting. Saldana denied the Special Counsel\u2019s allegation, and, on October 13, 1982, a hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge Heifetz (\u201cAU Heifetz\u201d), in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1207.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>AU Heifetz issued a Recommended Decision on December 21, 1982, in which he found that there was no credible evidence that Saldana endorsed President Carter\u2019s reelection during their meeting. Accordingly, the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Saldana\u2019s motion for an award of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was granted by AU Heifetz. He held that the MSPB\u2019s authority to award attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) was not limited to MSPB appeals pursuant to chapter 77 of the Civil Service Reform Act but applied to any case where, as here, an employee or applicant for employment is involved, citing <em>Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>672 F.2d 150 (D.C.Cir.1982). Finding that the Special Counsel\u2019s complaint was clearly without merit, that Saldana was innocent of wrongdoing, and that the Special Counsel should have known he would not prevail on the merits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> AU Heifetz held that an award of attorney fees and costs, totaling $5,369.45, was in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The Special Counsel filed Exceptions to AU Heifetz\u2019s Recommended Decision with the full MSPB. There was no objection to the dismissal of the complaint, but the Special Counsel did, <em>inter alia, </em>except to the award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The full MSPB, 20 M.S.P.R. 308 (1984), adopted AU Heifetz\u2019s findings and conclusions that the Special Counsel did not present sufficient evidence to establish that Saldana engaged in prohibited political activity. As to the award of attorney fees, the MSPB stated that the conduct subject to Special Counsel complaints under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206, such as prohibited political activity, is different in kind from employee misconduct or performance failures appealed to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701. Further, it was stated that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1207 specifies the rights of employees in detail without mentioning attorney fee awards, making it doubtful that Congress intended to authorize such awards in cases arising from Special Counsel complaints against employees. In view of Congress\u2019s failure to clearly waive sovereign immunity, the MSPB denied Saldana\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">It is well settled that attorney fees cannot be awarded against the Federal Government unless specifically authorized by a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>Williams v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>718 F.2d 1553, 1556-57 (Fed.Cir.1983). Such statutory authorization must be express and specific; it cannot be extended beyond the statute\u2019s literal terms and it cannot be implied. <em>Nibali v. United States, </em>634 F.2d 494, 497, 225 Ct.Cl. 8 (1980). Here, Saldana relies on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) for an award of attorney fees. However, before considering the merits of Saldana\u2019s motion for attorney fees, it must first be determined whether 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) authorizes an award of attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ney fees in cases arising from Special Counsel complaints alleging prohibited political activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Saldana, relying on <em>Frazier, </em>672 F.2d at 168, argues that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) is not limited to appeals brought under chapter 77 but extends to \u201cany case.\u201d This assertion is said to be buttressed by the House Conference Report which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">[Section 7701(g)(1) ] authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees in cases where employee prevails on the merits and the deciding official determines that attorneys\u2019 fees are warranted in the interest of justice, including a case involving a prohibited personnel practice or where the agency\u2019s action was clearly without merit. Reference to these two types of cases is illustrative only and does not limit the official from awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in other kinds of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">H.Conf.Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong.2d Sess. 142, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2723, 2876. Thus, this case, like <em>Williams, </em>raises the issue of how \u201cfar afield\u201d from section 7701 actions does 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) authorize an award of attorney fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">By refusing to award attorney fees in a physical disability retirement ease under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1), the panel in <em>Williams </em>clearly declined to adopt the broad holding in <em>Frazier, </em>672 F.2d at 170, that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) authorizes such awards in \u201cany case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party.\u201d The test is whether there is clear statutory language connecting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) to the section covering the underlying action. <em>See Williams, </em>718 F.2d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">In <em>Frazier, </em>such a connection existed between 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the Special Counsel\u2019s action against the agency under the latter statute was for a prohibited personnel practice which the former statute expressly covers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Williams, </em>718 F.2d at 1556. Although the Special Counsel\u2019s complaint against Saldana was also brought under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206, this action (taken pursuant to subsection (g)) differs significantly from that in <em>Frazier. </em>In <em>Frazier, </em>672 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>156, the Special Counsel brought an action <em>against the employing agency </em>for taking retaliatory action against whistleblowers. In this case, the Special Counsel\u2019s action <em>against Saldana </em>was for engaging in prohibited political activity. Therefore, the action against Saldana does not fall within the \u201cany case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency\u201d provision of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Although attorney fees may also be awarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) in \u201cany case in which the agency\u2019s action was clearly without merit,\u201d we are not persuaded that this provision possesses the breadth Saldana suggests. <em>See Williams, </em>718 F.2d at 1555. Saldana has not cited specific statutory language clearly connecting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) to complaints under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(g). On the contrary, provisions in Title 5 indicate otherwise. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1207(a), employees against whom complaints are filed by the Special Counsel have various procedural rights, including: a reasonable time to answer the complaint, a hearing on the record, representation by counsel, and a written decision. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701 gives employees and applicants for employment many of these same procedural rights and, additionally, authorizes attorney fee awards. By setting forth overlapping procedural rights in both these statutory provisions, it is apparent that Congress did not intend to permit employees who prevail in actions by the Special Counsel to supplement their rights, specifically provided for by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1207(a), with those separately provided for under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701. Accordingly, we are satisfied that Congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity by extending the provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) to complaints by the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(g).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In view of the foregoing, the decision of the MSPB is affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlWB\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-12\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(g) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the Special Counsel determines that disciplinary action should be taken against any employee\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">(A) after any investigation under this section, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">(B) on the basis of any knowing and willful refusal or failure by an employee to comply with an order of the Merit Systems Protection Board,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">the Special Counsel shall prepare a written complaint against the employee containing his determination, together with a statement of supporting facts, and present the complaint and statement to the employee and the Merit Systems Protection Board in accordance with section 1207 of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-17\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1207.

ALJ Heifetz relied on the guidelines set forth in <em>Allen v. United States Postal Service, </em>2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980), which this court approved in <em>Sterner v. Department of the Army, </em>711 F.2d 1563, 1569-70 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">. In <em>Williams, </em>this court concluded that voluntary physical disability retirement cases are reviewed by the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1), not 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a), citing <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>718 F.2d 391, 393, 398-99 (Fed.Cir.1983). <em>Williams </em>at 1554. The panel then proceeded to determine whether there was a connection between 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(d)(1) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) so that attorney fees could be awarded. <em>Id. </em>Although the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Lindahl </em>that there was no judicial review of MSPB decisions involving physical disability retirement cases, <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had no effect on the holding in <em>Williams </em>that the MSPB only had authority to award attorney fees if there was a nexus between 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1) and the statutory provision under which the case is appealed to the MSPB. It is unnecessary to decide whether the conclusion in <em>Williams </em>that there is no nexus between sections 7701(g)(1) and 8347(d)(1) is still correct in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lindahl.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\"><em>. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-11\">(1)(A) If, in connection with any investigation under this section, the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken which requires corrective action, the Special Counsel shall report the determination together with any findings or recommendations to the Board, the agency involved, and to the Office, and may report the determination, findings, and recommendations to the President.

Likewise, a connection exists in appeals to the MSPB from reductions in force where the basis for such appeals is 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a). <em>See Keely v.
