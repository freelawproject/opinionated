The district court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Section 1915(d) authorizes a court to dismiss an in forma pauperis action if it is satisfied that the action is \u201cfrivolous.\u201d The district court held this action frivolous because it found that under <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), Neary failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Under <em>Parratt </em>a taking is not unconstitutional if it is not \u201ca result of some established state procedure,\u201d and if the state provides a \u201cmeaningful post deprivation hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916. The district court found that Florida provides an opportunity for a post-deprivation hearing and that plaintiff had not alleged that the taking was the result of an established state procedure. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">Neary\u2019s complaint alleges that his personal property was seized under the guise of a \u201cMass Security Search for Weapons.\u201d It further alleges that \u201cunder existing policy\u2019s [sic] property seized is to be stored in the institutional property room for thirty (30) days and if not disposed of by the inmate, then the property may be disposed of by the institution pursuant to policy memorandum <em># </em>66.\u201d Examining Neary\u2019s pro se complaint under less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), we find that these allegations sufficiently charged that the taking was the result of an established state procedure. Accordingly, <em>Parratt </em>was improperly relied on. It cannot be said \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Green v. City of Montezuma, </em>650 F.2d 648, 651 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
