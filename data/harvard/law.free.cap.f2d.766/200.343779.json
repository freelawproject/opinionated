In his petition for review, King argues principally that the Board\u2019s action was unreasonably delayed and that the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-21\">On March 11, 1983, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (the Administrator) issued an order revoking King\u2019s airman\u2019s certificate on grounds that, <em>inter alia,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on December 1, 1980, King acted as pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft carrying approximately twenty bales of marijuana aboard, in violation of 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.12(a) (1985),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when the aircraft crash-landed near the Corpus Christi, Texas, International Airport. On March 30, 1983, King appealed the Administrator\u2019s order to the Board. Thereafter, the Administrator filed his order of revocation as his complaint before the Board pursu\u00e1nt to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.31(a) (1984). King moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>for dismissal of the complaint because of the delay between the date of the alleged offense, December 1, 1980, and the date of his notification of proposed certificate action by the Administrator, August 4, 1981. Following a hearing on August 10, 1983, an administrative law judge (AU) affirmed the order of revocation. In its opinion and order issued on April 25, 1984, the Board adopted as its own the findings by the AU and affirmed the revocation of King\u2019s airman\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The \u201cstale complaint rule,\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33 (1984), provides that a respondent may move to dismiss a complaint against him if the complaint states allegations of offenses which occurred more than six months prior to the Administrator\u2019s notice to the respondent of a proposed action to revoke his certificate. The rule specifically excepts, however, complaints of lack of qualification of the airman. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 821.33(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior decisions by the Board have held that the carriage of drugs in an aircraft in violation of section 91.12(a) is an offense which demonstrates lack of qualification and warrants certificate revocation. <em>E.g., Administrator v. Franklin, </em>Order EA-1123, March 31, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">King does not dispute that the complaint in the instant case alleged lack of qualification. Instead, he urges this Court to invoke its review powers under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 to set aside the Board\u2019s action as unreasonably delayed. Assuming that section 706 \u201ccreates mandatory duties on administrative agencies sufficient to set aside agency action as unlawful if \u2018unreasonably delayed,\u2019 \u00a7 706 further requires ... a showing of prejudice before agency action can be set aside for its lack of punctuality.\u201d <em>Chromcraft Corp. v. EEOC, </em>465 F.2d 745, 747 (5th Cir.1972); <em>accord EEOC v. Exchange Security Bank, </em>529 F.2d 1214, 1216 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Our review of the record in the instant case leads us to conclude that King was not unduly prejudiced by the delay in the Board\u2019s action. King was arrested on criminal charges shortly after the December 1980 plane crash. Eight months later, in August 1981, the Administrator notified him of the FAA\u2019s proposed action. In October 1981, a Texas state trial court convicted King on charges of possession of marijuana arising from this same incident. Thereafter, the FAA notified King that his airman\u2019s certificate was in jeopardy as a result of his conviction. King then suggested to the FAA in a January 1982 letter that further action by the FAA might be premature in light of the fact that he was in the process of appealing his conviction and that the appeal process could take from one to three years. The Administrator subsequently notified King that further action on the proposed revocation of his certificate would be suspended pending the outcome of King\u2019s appeal in the Texas state courts. It would thus appear that the prejudice, if any, suffered by King due to the unavailability of witnesses and/or the destruction of evidence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> can be attributed in large degree to King himself. Furthermore, the twenty-seven-month delay between the date of the offense, December 1, 1980, and the date of the Administrator\u2019s order of revocation, March 11, 1983, does not constitute the \u201cslothfulness, lethargy, inertia or caprice\u201d condemned in <em>Chromcraft. </em>465 F.2d at 748. <em>But cf. In re French v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>603 F.2d 1158, 1168 (5th Cir.1979) (seven-year delay between submission of petition for special relief and agency\u2019s decision denying relief <em>per se </em>unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>King also maintains that substantial evidence does not support the Board\u2019s finding that he was the pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft carrying marijuana, in violation of 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.12(a). The findings of fact by the Board or the Administrator, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(e). \u201cAs an appellate court reviewing an administrative order, it is not [this Court\u2019s] function to reevaluate the weight of the evidence or to reexamine credibility choices made by the finder of fact.\u201d <em>Stern v. Butterfield, </em>529 F.2d 407, 409 (5th Cir.1976). The record in the instant case reveals that at the hearing before the AU, the Administrator presented the live testimony of a Corpus Christi police officer who investigated the plane crash and that of an eyewitness to the accident. The officer identified, as King\u2019s, the voice of the pilot who was communicating with the Corpus Christi Airport Approach Control on the tape recording of communications with the aircraft. The eyewitness, Brian Schmidt, testified that he observed King on the wing of the crashed aircraft, attempting to calm the crowd that was gathering at the crash site. Based on this observation, Schmidt formed the \u201cmental impression\u201d that King was the pilot. The Administrator also introduced documentary evidence showing that King owned the aircraft in question, that King\u2019s fingerprints were found on the plane, and that King had been convicted in Texas state court for possession of marijuana in connection with the same incident. In addition, the Administrator introduced an affidavit by one William Einhaus relating that King told Einhaus that he was piloting the plane when it crashed. Clearly, this evidence is sufficient to support the Board\u2019s finding that King was the pilot-in-command of a civil aircraft carrying marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In its decision, the Board held that the Administrator\u2019s authority to revoke a certificate and the Board\u2019s authority to review and affirm such revocation are not subject to any time limitation. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429. In this petition for review, King argues that this holding is in conflict with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 555, 706. Because we conclude that the Board\u2019s action in the ease <em>sub judice </em>was not unreasonably delayed, we do not reach this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The order of the Board revoking King\u2019s airman\u2019s certificate is affirmed. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-13\">.

The order also stated as additional grounds for revocation that the aircraft was operated in a careless and reckless manner and that the plane crashed as a result of fuel exhaustion. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 91.9, 91.22(a)(1) (1985).
