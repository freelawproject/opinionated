The action originally named state, county, and prison officials. The claims against all defendants except J.P. Campbell, a prison official at San Quentin State Prison, were dismissed at an earlier stage of the proceedings, either through settlement or rulings on motions. The district court granted a summary judgment on liability against Campbell; the parties stipulated to $5,000 for damages, and a final judgment was entered for the Nakaos and against Campbell in that amount. Campbell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">The facts of this case are well set forth in prior published opinions of the district court, <em>Nakao v. Rushen, </em>542 F.Supp. 856 (N.D.Cal.1982) and <em>Nakao v. Rushen, </em>580 F.Supp. 718 (N.D.Cal.1984). We will only briefly summarize the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">The Nakaos were married on June 2, 1981. At that time, Mr. Nakao was an inmate at San Quentin Prison, and Mrs. Nakao was a social worker employed by the Contra Costa County Social Service Department. On June 8, 1981, the assistant director of the County Social Service Department, wrote a letter to George Sumner, the warden at San Quentin, in which he expressed concern about a possible conflict of interest arising from the Nakaos\u2019 marriage. He requested Warden Sumner to supply him with copies of all correspondence received by Mr. Nakao on Contra Costa County stationery.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">Warden Sumner requested his assistant, J.P. Campbell, to investigate the matter. On June 22, 1981, Campbell ordered a search of Nakao\u2019s cell, with instructions to seize all correspondence with Contra Costa County letterhead. Nakao was not permitted to observe the search. Campbell read all of the material taken from Mr. Nakao\u2019s cell, made copies of the correspondence and had them mailed to Contra Costa County officials. Thereafter, Helen Nakao\u2019s employment with Contra Costa County was terminated, allegedly because of the correspondence supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">The district court ruled that Campbell violated Mr. Nakao\u2019s fourth amendment rights by ordering the search of his cell and Campbell\u2019s liability was based on this ruling, <em>Nakao, </em>580 F.Supp. at 723. Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>quent to the district court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court held that, because a prisoner does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his prison cell, the fourth amendment\u2019s proscription against unreasonable searches does not apply to the confines of a prison cell. <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3202, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). Thus, the judgment of the district court cannot be upheld on the grounds specified by the district court. The plaintiffs also raised in the district court claims for violation of first amendment rights and various state law claims. The district court did not rule on these claims. The judgment of the district court is vacated and remanded for consideration of the remaining claims of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
