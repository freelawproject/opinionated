Concluding that the district court did not err in granting the motion for summary judgment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">Prior to 1974, members of Local 355 of the Hotel, Motel, Restaurant and Hi-Rise Employees Union (the local) established an insurance fund and a pension fund pursuant to two corresponding trust agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">On October 31, 1974, the appellee, Biscayne Yacht &amp; Country Club (the club), and the local entered into a contract for wages and benefits for certain club employees. The portions of the contract that give rise to the present dispute are sections 1, 8, and 9 of Article XX.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-18\">Section 1. There is presently in operation an insurance fund designed to provide life, accident, health and hospitalization insurance to employees, known as HOTEL ASSOCIATION-HOTEL EMPLOYEES INSURANCE FUND, administered by HOTEL ASSOCIATION-HOTEL EMPLOYEES UNION TRUSTEES. Said Trust Fund has been established pursuant to Section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Section 186, hereinafter the Act. The trustees of said Fund have been duly appointed and qualified pursuant to the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-19\">Section 8. Commencing December 1st, 1974, Employer will make contributions of five dollars and fourteen cents ($5.14) per month for each eligible employee <em>for a dental plan.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-20\">Section 9. Commencing November 1st, 1976, Employer will make contributions of six dollars and twenty-four cents ($6.24) per month for each eligible employee <em>for employee\u2019s pension benefits (retirement or pension fund).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-21\">(Emphasis supplied.) Although the club apparently made the payments of $5.14 per employee to the insurance fund until 1977, the trust agreement establishing that fund made no specific mention of the dental plan referred to in \u00a7 8 until the agreement was amended in 1977. The trust agreement for the pension fund mentioned in \u00a7 9, however, did provide, at the time the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>was signed in 1974, a detailed basis for making payments. Apparently, the pension fund trust agreement always contained a provision for annual audits of the funds, equal representation of employees and employer in the administration of the funds, and for arbitration in case of deadlocked vote. The 1974 collective bargaining contract did not expressly include such provisions, nor did the insurance fund trust agreement until it was amended in 1977, three years after the execution of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The club stopped paying into the funds in 1977. The fund trustees sued to compel payment of obligations for 1977 through 1979, as well as auditing costs and other incidental expenses. The appellee moved for summary judgment on all counts. The trial court granted the motion with respect to the appellants\u2019 claims for dental plan payments and pension plan payments, but denied summary judgment on the claim for the payments described in section 1 of the contract. The club does not appeal the latter ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">A grant of summary judgment is proper when, taking all the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the court finds that no material issue of fact remains and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>E.g., Clark v. Union Mutual Life Insurance Co., </em>692 F.2d 1370 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Sections 302(c)(5)(B) and (C) of the Labor Management Relations Act create an exception to Congress\u2019 otherwise sweeping prohibition against employer payments to union funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The objective behind this general prohibition was to prevent the misappropriation and dissipation of monies due the workers by union officials. Courts consequently require strict compliance with the \u00a7 302(c) exception. <em>E.g., Bricklayers Local 15 v. Stuart Plastering Co., </em>512 F.2d 1017, 1025 (5th Cir.1975). \u00a7 302(c) provides that an agreement by an employer to make benefit payments to union funds is enforceable only if the union representative carries the burden of showing that the written agreement requires that (1) the money paid be held in trust for the worker\u2019s benefit only, (2) payments be made in accordance with a schedule or other detailed basis for calculating amounts due, (3) the fund or trust be audited annually, (4) the employer and union be equally represented in the management of the trust and (5) arbitration be invoked in the event of a deadlock vote in the management of the fund. <em>Stuart. </em>The 1974 collective bargaining contract lacks these safeguards, and therefore the contract standing alone does not furnish a basis for the enforcement of the club\u2019s promises contained in \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8 and 9 of Article XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\"><em>Stuart </em>establishes, however, that if the bargaining contract specifically incorporates the trust agreement of the fund to receive the payments, and that trust agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ment itself satisfies \u00a7 302(c), then the employer\u2019s promise to pay is enforceable. In <em>Stuart, </em>the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment even though such trust agreements existed at the time of the suit, but did not exist at the time of the execution of the collective bargaining. The court reasoned that it was impossible to satisfy \u00a7 302(c) via an \u201cincorporation by reference\u201d approach if the trust agreements allegedly incorporated did not come into existence until after the employer-union collective bargaining contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In this case, \u00a7 8 merely refers to \u201ca dental plan\u201d and does not, on its face, satisfy the \u00a7 302(c) protections. The insurance fund trust agreement, which the appellants urge was incorporated by reference in the 1974 contract, did not provide for any dental payments or plan until 1977. Just as in <em>Stuart, </em>the subsequent amendment of the insurance fund trust agreement could not possibly have been incorporated when the parties drafted the earlier collective bargaining contract. The trust agreement existing in 1974 arguably could have been meant to apply to the dental plan payments, but it did not comply with the statutory requirements. Finally, although some dental plan payments were made by the club to the insurance fund between 1974 and 1977, <em>Stuart </em>holds that the mere fact that some payments were made cannot \u201csupply the element of definiteness that Congress prescribed.\u201d 512 F.2d at 1029. By contrast, \u00a7 1 of the 1974 contract explicitly incorporates the insurance fund trust agreement, which in 1974 specifically provided the necessary safeguards for the insurance payments promised in \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The district court also correctly granted summary judgment on the claim for pension plan payments under \u00a7 9. Although the 1974 pension fund trust agreement contained the provisions required by \u00a7 302(c), the club introduced uncontradicted evidence that the parties to the 1974 agreement did not intend such an incorporation. The depositions of both the employer and union representatives who drafted the contract were before the district court. They stated that in 1974 they did not intend to incorporate the pension trust agreement. Such testimony is not surprising, because \u00a7 9 of the collective bargaining contract falls far short of the explicit language of \u00a7 1, incorporating by reference the insurance fund agreement. This suggests that the parties knew the mechanics of incorporating the pension trust agreement into \u00a7 9 but decided against such action. In the face of this strong evidence, the appellants offer nothing more than the bald assertion that \u00a7 9 did achieve an incorporation. The appellants simply have not created a material issue of fact concerning the parties\u2019 intent in 1974 with respect to the incorporation of the pension trust agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">.
