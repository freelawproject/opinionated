When Rakestraw discussed this with DCS Superintendent Claude Schindler in February 1979, Schindler \u201cinstructed Mr. Rakestraw to write Mrs. Hoskinson a letter stating to her that because of our desire to have a mother home with pre-school age children, that she would not be issued a contract for the upcoming school year.\u201d On February 20, 1979, Rakestraw wrote such a letter to Hoskinson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-17\">After learning that she would not be rehired for the next school year, Hoskinson consulted an attorney who wrote to DCS threatening legal action for violation of state and federal statutes proscribing employment discrimination. On March 14, 1979, Hoskinson was terminated because she had consulted an attorney. In a letter dated March 27, 1979, the DCS Board rescinded the February 20 letter in which the Board declined to rehire Hoskinson and instead discharged her for failing to follow the Biblical Chain-of-Command.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-18\">On March 28, 1979, Hoskinson filed a charge of sex discrimination with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC) alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>that the reason for her termination \u201cwas the school\u2019s belief that during the early years of a child\u2019s growth, the mother\u2019s place is in the home.\u201d On April 18, 1979, the OCRC requested information on the matter from DCS, and on May 14, 1979, informed DCS that a formal investigation had begun. On October 24, 1979, OCRC informed DCS that a hearing would be held on November 16 and requested information including employment data on Hoskinson, blank employment applications, employee handbooks and rules and regulations, job descriptions and model contracts, information about employee pregnancies, employee grievance procedures, and complete personnel files for more than a dozen DCS employees. On January 28, 1980, OCRC informed DCS that the Commission had found probable cause to believe that DCS had engaged in unlawful discrimination. The Commission found that \u201c[ejvidence does not indicate that the Ohio Civil Rights Commission lacks jurisdiction over Respondent because it is a religious institution.\u201d Further, the Commission concluded that \u201c[cjomplainant\u2019s discharge, and the reasons given for it by Respondent, were directly linked to the February 20, 1979 memo which stated that she would not be offered a contract because \u2018if there are pre-school age children in the home we recommend the mother stay there and do not accept her application.\u2019 \u201d The Commission further suggested that the parties enter into a Conciliation Agreement and Consent Order. On April 18, 1980, the Commission issued a complaint against DCS and DCS answered asserting lack of jurisdiction due to the religious basis for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">On October 1, 1980, plaintiff-appellants, Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., Patterson Park Church, Christian Tabernacle, DCS Superintendent Claude Schindler, parents Stephen and Camillia House, and DCS teacher Paul Pyle brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the OCRC, five commissioners, the Ohio Attorney General, OCRC directors and two assistant attorney generals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that enforcement of the Ohio Civil Rights Act against DCS violated the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments and an injunction to enjoin interference with plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise of their religious beliefs. Plaintiffs also argue that the State\u2019s attempt to exercise jurisdiction over the school and its hiring practices violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 6, the district court granted a temporary restraining order restraining the OCRC from proceeding with a public hearing concerning DCS employment practices. The parties agreed to consolidate trial on the merits with a hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a permanent injunction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a)(2). A one-day trial was held on December 8, 1980, and, on January 6, 1984, the district court entered an order dismissing the case and denying plaintiffs relief. On July 30, 1984, the district court entered an order granting plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction pending appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 62(c). 604 F.Supp. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Our consideration of appellants\u2019 constitutional claims requires review of the facts regarding the nature of Dayton Christian Schools, the exercise of religion implicated in the OCRC\u2019s actions, and the statutory scheme from which DCS claims exemption. Of course, we recognize that \u201c[fjindings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Fed.R.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Roemer v.

We make no effort to \u201cduplicate the role of the lower court,\u201d but only consider whether \u201cthe district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">The district court found that DCS has \u201ca dominant religious purpose which permeates both the administrative and substantive aspects of the school.\u201d 578 F.Supp. at 1008-09. Further, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-9\">[e]very aspect of the school\u2019s operation is geared toward exposing and educating the students on how to lead a Christian life by understanding what the members consider to be the guidance and direction provided by the Bible. As revealed in the testimony at the hearing on this matter and in the exhibits accepted into evidence, the teachers at DCS are selected because of their ability to blend their avowed religious beliefs into every lesson and school activity. Teachers are required to be born again Christians and to carry with them into their classes the religious fervor and conviction felt necessary to stimulate young minds into accepting Christ as savior. Because of the emphasis placed on the religious education of the students, the school demands that teachers conform both in thought and conduct to the tenets and principles felt essential to leading a Christian life. The belief system espoused by the members of DCS touches every aspect of their life: work, interpersonal relationships, family and recreational activities. Deviation in any way from what is felt to be the proper religious way of life may cast doubt on a teacher\u2019s ability to perform his or her critical role and may, therefore, be grounds for dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-16\">578 F.Supp. at 1018-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">DCS stated as its purposes \u201cto teach all subjects in a manner to create in each student an awareness of God\u2019s Supreme authority over all creation\u201d and \u201cto train and prepare youth for worthy contributions to the Cause of Christ in the home, church and community.\u201d DCS Certificate of Consolidation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe major distinction of DCS is the fact that all truth is related and interpreted from God\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d Cover letter to applicants for employment. Both teachers and parents of DCS students must subscribe to the DCS Statement of Faith.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Schindler confirmed that applicants who did not subscribe to the Statement of Faith would not be considered for employment. Further, Superintendent Schindler testified that \u201c[o]ne parent in the family must be a professing Christian, must be born again. And the student in the school must be a Christian, or professing Christian.\u201d Testimony in the district court indicated that the parents\u2019 obligation to educate their children in accordance with Christian principles is biblically based.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">The religious focus of the school is reflected in the teacher selection process and concomitant role of the teacher in the school. Schindler testified that \u201c[t]he teacher\u2019s relationship with Jesus Christ and their life style is crucial to their subsequent employment at Dayton Christian Schools.\u201d Further, \u201c[w]e feel that a teaching position is so crucial in our school and so vital to the performance of our ministry, that ... [b]efore we make the recommendation to the Board to hire our teachers, we must be in total harmony about that teacher\u2019s commitment to Christ and her life style and her ability to teach in our system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-23\">Teacher Paul Pyle testified regarding his experience as a teacher at DCS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-24\">Then I begin each class with prayer. Sometimes I begin each class with a devotional thought, something that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>fresh to me from the Scriptures that I have gotten that day or just recently. However, if I were to tell you that that would \u2014 was the extent of the religious activities during the day, that would be misleading. In my opinion, and in my endeavors in the classroom, the entire class period is given over to religious activities. I try to make sure that everything I do in someway adheres to Biblical principles that I have learned from the Bible through my being taught at Dayton Christian and through my own Bible studies. Could I go on and give an example?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-4\">Q Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-5\">A For instance, when we are studying any literature, the thing I stress with my students in literature is all human thought can be tested within the absolute standards of the Scriptures. So we go through and discover the theme of that story in detail, to use the answer, test that to decide whether its true or false. And you can see that my putting the Scripture up as the ultimate authority comes through in the classroom day after day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">These facts support the district court\u2019s conclusion that DCS is a pervasively religious institution in which religious considerations permeate all aspects of the educational process, govern the teacher selection process, and dictate parents\u2019 entrustment of their children\u2019s education to the school.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">The Ohio Civil Rights Commission\u2019s complaint of discrimination implicates two asserted religious beliefs of appellants: the belief that a mother\u2019s place is in the home and the belief in a Chain-of-Command for resolving disputes among church members. We review the role of these beliefs in the appellant\u2019s religion to instruct our assessment of the constitutionality of the Ohio Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-11\">Superintendent Schindler testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-12\">We believe that the Bible teaches that even though we are equal in the sight of God, our role is different, the role of the female is different than that of the male. The Scripture teaches that in I Peter, Chapter 3; I Timothy, Chapter 2, Titus, Chapter 2, just to mention a few passages of the Scripture. And in those passages it spells out the role of a woman. And my counseling with Mr. Rakestraw is based upon those principles in God\u2019s words. And we felt they directly related to a woman being home with her pre-school age children. We rescinded the letter because after counseling we found that we had not adequately explained this to our faculty and to our staff. And thus Mrs. Hoskinson was not fully aware of the convictions of the administration and of the School Board relative to this particular Biblical principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-13\">Q Was there any change on the school\u2019s position on this issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-14\">A No, sir. We fell as strongly today about the Biblical principle as we did before rescinding this letter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">While Hoskinson was not aware of the church belief regarding teachers with preschool age children and such philosophy was not specifically delineated, 578 F.Supp. at 1012, the philosophy, although biblically rooted, was known to Schindler primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>from previous experiences with the school board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Schindler testified that he instructed Rakestraw to write the letter to Hoskinson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-4\">[bjecause on further \u2014 past experiences I had been denied applications that I had presented to the Board where there was a mother with pre-school age children. I knew their philosophy and I knew it well, and I knew what their counsel would be to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-5\">Q Was it your testimony that you had presented employment candidates to the Board on prior occasions but your recommendations were turned down because they had pre-school age children at home?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">A Yes, one specific application, yes sir. The district court found that \u201cthe record supports the conclusion that, at least in the mind of Mr. Schindler, the nonrenewal of Mrs. Hoskinson\u2019s teaching contract was an act consistent with and compelled by religious beliefs.\u201d 578 F.Supp. at 1012. Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-7\">[t]he Court cannot accept Defendants\u2019 contention that the initial decision not to renew Mrs. Hoskinson\u2019s contract was prompted solely by Mr. Schindler\u2019s personal philosophy and that, therefore, OCRC review of that decision could not even raise potential first amendment concerns. Though the belief may not be documented or as well known or accepted as other precepts discussed during the proceeding, the evidence clearly establishes that Mr. Schindler\u2019s conduct was based upon religiously founded principles. The Court does not feel it proper to relegate this personally held religious belief to an artificial lesser status of \u201cpersonal philosophy\u201d simply because the belief might not have been a clearly articulated tenet at DCS. The Court finds, therefore, that the initial decision not to renew Mrs. Hoskinson\u2019s teaching contract was founded on religious precepts and therefore falls within the ambit of the first amendment\u2019s protection afforded to the free exercise of religion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap3\"><em>Id. </em>at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">The Chain of Command is a biblically based authority structure which depends on the internal peaceful resolution of differences.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Chain of Command concept is related to the concept of giving a good report.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hoskinson\u2019s contract included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>The teacher agrees to follow the Biblical pattern of Matthew 18:15-17 and Gala-tions 6:0 and always give a good report. All differences are to be resolved by utilizing Biblical principles \u2014 always presenting a united front.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Further, Hoskinson wrote on her application for employment that \u201c[o]bedience to those in authority over you is clearly stated in the Bible. I believe in God\u2019s chain of command.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The district court found that \u201cHoskinson was aware of the requirement that all teachers follow the Chain of Command pri- or to consulting her attorney and prior to her discharge.\u201d 578 F.Supp. at 1012. \u201cThe eventual discharge of Mrs. Hoskinson stemmed from the fact that she contacted an attorney in response to actions taken by the school regarding her employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1013.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court found that the Chain-of-Command concept \u201cis both well articulated and generally held and ascribed to by the DCS staff and administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-7\">Thus, when the Board made the determination that Mrs. Hoskinson\u2019s contract should be terminated because of \u201cphilosophical differences\u201d stemming from her taking her complaint about the nonre-newal of her contract to an attorney, this decision was consistent with the Board\u2019s expressed and established religious belief that disputes be resolved internally and in accordance with the Biblical Chain of Command.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>15</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">The Ohio Civil Rights Act, effective July 29, 1959, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-17\">It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice: (A) For any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, age or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-18\">Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.02(A).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Act also makes it unlawful</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>[f]or any person to discriminate in any manner against any other person because that person has opposed any unlawful practice defined in this section, or because that person has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in any investigation, proceeding or hearing under sections 4112.01 to 4112.07 of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.02(1).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-12\">(K) Nothing in division (H) of this section shall bar any religious or denominational institution or organization, or any charitable or - educational organization that is operated, supervised, or controlled by or in connection with a religious organization, or any bona</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-20\">fide private or fraternal organization, from giving preference to persons of the same religion or denomination, or to members of the same religion or denomination, or to members of such private or fraternal organization, or from making such selection as is calculated by such organization to promote the religious principles or the aims, purpose, or fraternal principles for which it is established or maintained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The Act establishes the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, section 4112.03, to \u201c[r]eceive, investigate, and pass upon written charges made under oath____\u201d Section 4112.-04(A)(6). The statute empowers the OCRC to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and to require the production of books and papers. Section 4112.-04(B)(3). The Act further obligates the Commission, prior to a formal hearing, to \u201cattempt, by informal methods of persuasion and conciliation, to induce compliance with\u201d the Act. Section 4112.05(A). The Act authorizes the Commission, upon the filing of a charge, to initiate a preliminary investigation. Section 4112.05(B).

However, this rule of construction does not \u201clicense a court to usurp the policy-making and legislative functions of duly-elected representatives.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Mathews, </em>465 U.S. 728, 104 S.Ct. 1387, 1396, 79 L.Ed.2d 646 (1984). In seeking an alternative construction we must determine first, whether the exercise of jurisdiction by the OCRC \u201cwould give rise to serious constitutional questions,\u201d and, second, if so, whether there is clear expression of affirmative legislative intent to so extend the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 U.S. at 501, 99 S.Ct. at 1319; <em>Tony and Susan Alamo Fdn. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1953, 1960 n. 18, 85 L.Ed.2d 278 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Although the parties plainly cannot consent to jurisdiction, the parties agree, and the district court had little trouble concluding, that exercise of jurisdiction by the Commission implicates serious constitutional questions. While we need not resolve the merits of the constitutional claims at this preliminary stage of inquiry, we note that \u201c[t]he values enshrined in the First Amendment plainly rank high \u2018in the scale of our national values.\u2019 \u201d <em>Catholic Bishop, </em>440 U.S. at 501, 99 S.Ct. at 1319. The facts of this case set against the governing principles and objectives of neutrality and accommodation inherent in the First Amendment\u2019s protection of religious belief reveal the \u201csignificant risk that the First Amendment will be infringed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 99 S.Ct. at 1319. With respect to appellants\u2019 Free Exercise Clause claim, the Court has repeatedly recognized parents\u2019 special interest in guiding and providing the education of their children consonant with their own religious beliefs. <em>Norwood v. Harrison, </em>413 U.S. 455, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973); <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). While the state\u2019s interest in eliminating employment discrimination based on sex is entitled to deference and respect, <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3253-55, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984), important state interests have historically yielded to the limitations of the First Amendment, <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (state interest in educated populace). Further, the highly intrusive nature of the remedies available to the Commission, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.05(G) (backpay, reinstatement) and the probing and inquiry into decisions regarding religious activities made on religious grounds highlight the need for a careful consideration of whether there are less burdensome means by which the state might further even a concededly substantial interest. Accordingly, it is clear that the Commission\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction implicates a serious constitutional question with respect to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">Likewise, there is a serious question regarding whether the state\u2019s inquiry into a religious school\u2019s decision on the religious qualifications of a religious instructor constitutes impermissible entanglement of the state in religious affairs in violation of the Establishment Clause. The Court has recognized the high likelihood of impermissible entanglement in state interaction with pervasively religious elementary schools, <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman (Lemon I), </em>403 U.S. 602, 616, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2113, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), especially when that interaction leads to the continuing surveillance implicated by the conciliation agreement proposed by the Commission, <em>Lemon I, </em>403 U.S. at 619, 91 S.Ct. at 2114. Further, the specter of impermissible entanglement arises when the state, as in this case, seeks to monitor or evaluate decisions or activities of the school which necessarily implicate religious doctrine. <em>See Volunteers of America-Minnesota-Bar None Boys </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number><em>Ranch v. NLRB, </em>752 F.2d 345, 349 (8th Cir.1985), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 3502, 87 L.Ed.2d 633 (1985) (no entanglement). Accordingly, in light of these serious constitutional questions, we consider whether the Ohio General Assembly intended to regulate the employment decisions of religious institutions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">While the Act reflects no so-called \u201caffirmative\u201d expression of intent to include religious schools within the purview of the statutory proscriptions, to interpret the Act as inapplicable to religious schools would render illusory the plain meaning of its words and provisions. It is clear that the Ohio General Assembly exempted discrimination based on religion from those portions of the statute deemed desirable. With respect to some of the statutory prohibitions, the legislature provided that an employer might obtain a certification that religion was a bona fide occupational qualification, and, therefore, discriminate on the basis of religion. Section 4112.02(E). Further, with respect to housing discrimination, the legislature exempted religious institutions from the statutory prohibition \u201cfrom giving preferences to persons of the same religion ... or from making such selection as calculated by such organization to promote the religious principles or the aims, purposes, or fraternal principles for which it is established or maintained.\u201d Sections 4112.02(H), (K). The acts with which DCS is charged fall within neither of these exemptions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Act\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is broad and all-inclusive, indicating no intent to exempt religious employers. <em>See Tilton, </em>403 U.S. at 677, 91 S.Ct. at 2095 (absence of statutory reference to religious affiliation or nonaffiliation indicates that \u201cinstitutions of higher education\u201d includes churcn-related institutions). Accordingly, the statute asserts a clear expression of intent to apply the prohibitions at issue in this case to all employers, including religious institutions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Even under the analysis of <em>Catholic Bishop, </em>we cannot avoid the constitutional questions posed here. Therefore, we consider whether the Act may be applied to DCS consist-, ent with the commands of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">First among the amendments to our Constitution is the admonishment that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d These prohibitions apply equally to the states and their legislatures as part and parcel of the cherished liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Chaplinsky v.

Second, \u201c[t]he state may justify a limitation on religious liberty by showing that it is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. at 257-58, 102 S.Ct. at 1055; <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 214, 92 S.Ct. at 1532. Inherent in determining whether the limitation is essential to the governmental interest is consideration of whether accommodation by the state would \u201cunduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest,\u201d <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. at 259, 102 S.Ct. at 1056, and whether the governmental regulation is the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of promoting the governmental interest, <em>Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana Employment Security, </em>450 U.S. 707, 718, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981); <em>Braunfeld v. Brown, </em>366 U.S. 599, 607, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 1148, 6 L.Ed.2d 563 (1961). Accordingly, we consider the burden placed on appellants\u2019 religious beliefs by allowing the OCRC to exercise jurisdiction, the state\u2019s interest in enforcement of the Ohio Civil Rights Act, and the necessity of regulating DCS employment practices in order to promote the state\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Several factors compel a conclusion that the burden on appellants\u2019 exercise of their religious beliefs by allowing the state to regulate the employment practices of a pervasively religious school is great.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Foremost, perhaps, are the fundamental rights of Stephen and Camillia House, as parents, to choose the manner in which their children will be educated, especially with regard to religious values. This fundamental right has been recognized in circumstances where First Amendment concerns were not predominant. <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925). In <em>Pierce, </em>the Court held that government, pursuant to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, may not compel attendance in public, as opposed to private, schools. \u201cThe child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 45 S.Ct. at 573. These \u201cadditional obligations\u201d \u201cmust be read to include the inculation of moral standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good citizenship.\u201d <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 233, 92 S.Ct. at 1542. The contemporary Court has found that <em>\u201cPierce </em>stands as a charter of the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This parental interest is particularly compelling combined with a free exercise claim.

Similarly, when the state penalizes particular hiring practices with respect to an individual employed to provide religious instruction and act as a religious role model when the employment is governed by religious principles, a burden on religion exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Our assessment of the burden placed on appellants by the OCRC\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction begins with examination of the Commission\u2019s preliminary actions in this case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In response to the filing of Hoskin-son\u2019s charge, the Commission sought from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>DCS blank employment applications, employee handbooks and rules and regulations, DCS written policy on disciplinary actions, employee pregnancies, employee evaluations, performance standards, contract renewal, grievance procedure, job descriptions, detailed information regarding all DCS employees who were pregnant from January 1, 1977 to date of request, similar information regarding all employees who were discharged and suspended, minutes of specific DCS Board meetings, and eompl\u00e9te personnel files for 14 DCS employees. The Commission, in fact, early in the case used its investigative powers and asserted jurisdiction as coercive tools to compel appellants to relinquish the mandates of their consciences. In a letter of May 14, 1979, the OCRC Regional Director Rebecca Haley warned Schindler that \u201cwe encourage you to reconsider adjustment of this matter in lieu of a potentially costly and time consuming investigation.\u201d <em>See </em>note 31 <em>supra. </em>The OCRC likewise attempted to coerce DCS into acceptance of a Conciliation Agreement and Consent Order following the Commission\u2019s finding of probable cause. On January 28, 1980, Haley wrote, \u201cthe enclosed proposed Conciliation Agreement and Consent Order has been prepared to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices and their efforts [sic] and to assure your voluntary compliance with Ohio\u2019s Laws Against Discrimination.\u201d Further, \u201c[y]our refusal to meet with us as suggested ... shall result in a determination being made by the Commission that conciliation efforts have failed. Such a failure will require the Commission to initiate formal proceedings against you or your organization.\u201d <footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The Proposed Consent Order required that DCS bind itself and its successors and to stipulate \u201cthat the Commission has full and complete jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter herein.\u201d While noting that the employer does not admit to unlawful conduct, the Consent Order required that Hoskinson be fully reinstated with back pay, that DCS agree not to discharge Hos-kinson without \u201cjust cause,\u201d and that DCS not retaliate against Hoskinson. The order required DCS to further agree to administer its policies without regard to its employees\u2019 religion and that it not seek information about its employees\u2019 religion. The order also provided that \u201c[respondent shall post in a conspicuous place or places on its premises, the Commission\u2019s mandatory notice which sets forth excerpts of Chapter 4112, Ohio Revised Code, and other relevant information.\u201d The order further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-8\">the Commission may conduct such compliance reviews during Respondent\u2019s normal business hours as the Commission believes to be warranted during the three (3) years subsequent to the issuance of this PROPOSED ORDER. Respondent agrees to furnish whatever information is required by the Commission in order to implement such reviews, and understands that upon failure to fully comply with any of the terms and conditions of this PROPOSED ORDER the Commission may initiate further action including, but not necessarily limited to, the filing of a complaint for enforcement of this ORDER in an appropriate Court of Common Pleas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">It is clear that this relief not only collides with the principles underlying appellants\u2019 asserted religious beliefs, but could not be constitutionally compelled without running afoul of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">Appellants have few options. They can abandon their religious beliefs by placing their children in public schools, compromise their hiring practices to conform with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>state\u2019s secular interests rather than appellants\u2019 religious commands, or leave Ohio and seek another jurisdiction in which appellants can maintain schools consistent with their religious principles.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The Ohio statute \u201caffirmatively compels them, under threat of criminal sanction, to perform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of their religious beliefs.\u201d <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 218, 92 S.Ct. at 1534;<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Sherbert, </em>374 U.S. at 402, 83 S.Ct. at 1792.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The OCRC\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction is burdensome on all parties to this action. While DCS primarily bears the expensive and time-consuming burden of answering the OCRC\u2019s charges, this burden is indirectly borne by the parents and churches which support DCS. Further, the congregations and parents are faced essentially with either supporting a school staffed by faculty who flout basic tenets of their religion or abandoning their support of Christian education altogether. The burden on the parents\u2019 exercise of religion is particularly onerous in light of the heightened parental interest in their children\u2019s education. Likewise, teacher Pyle, as an adherent of the school\u2019s educational and religious philosophies, finds his exercise of religion as a member of the faculty burdened by the OCRC\u2019s intrusion into the faculty-selection process and the imposition of secular guidelines for faculty retention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">The coercion inherent in the Ohio statute and the attendant OCRC exercise of jurisdiction is certainly more affirmative and compelling than that in <em>Bob Jones University v. United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983). In <em>Bob Jones, </em>the Court upheld denial of tax exempt status to an institution which denied admission to those engaged in interracial dating. In weighing the school\u2019s free exercise claim, the Court observed that \u201c[djenial of tax benefits will inevitably have a substantial impact on the operation of private religious schools, but will not prevent those schools from observing their religious tenets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 103 S.Ct. at 2034-35. In the instant case, however, appellants do not have the luxury of simply declining a public benefit. While Bob Jones University is free to continue to practice its religious beliefs free of state intervention, appellants only have the option of either conforming their religiously based employment practices to the secular guidelines promulgated in the Ohio statute or face continued harassing prosecution by the OCRC. This result is inevitable in light of the absence of a statutory exemption in the Ohio statute, <em>see </em>note 18 <em>supra, </em>and the Commission\u2019s rejection of the religious interests as bars to exercise of its remedial powers.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the OCRC\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the complaint against DCS affirmatively and coercively burdens appellants\u2019 exercise of their religious beliefs and their attempts to instill such in their offspring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">The state, in pursuit of a compelling interest, may burden religious practices. <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. at 257, 102 S.Ct. at 1055; <em>Roemer, </em>426 U.S. at 745, 96 S.Ct. at 2344; <em>Gillette v.

Although the absence of legislative history hampers our assessment of the state\u2019s interest, the statute equally prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, handicap, sex, age and national origin. In <em>Roberts, </em>the Court found that the \u201cstigmatizing injury, and the denial of equal opportunities that accompanies it\u201d is as serious when the discrimination is based on sex as when it is based on race, <em>Roberts, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3254, and that the government has a compelling interest in eliminating \u201cdiscrimination in the distribution of publicly available goods, services, and other advantages,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3255.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Accordingly, we recognize the state\u2019s interest as substantial and compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">The state also asserts its interest in prohibiting conduct encompassed by the statute\u2019s prohibition on discriminating against an employee who opposes unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>actions.

This state interest is likewise compelling since, if employees were prohibited from opposing discrimination, the effectiveness of the employment discrimination laws would be substantially impaired.

As we construe it, the First Amendment provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people ... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d Of course, the right to petition, even as part of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, applies only to actions by federal or state government which abridge the right to petition and does not reach private actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Finally, we note that although the asserted state interests may be compelling, the state is not constitutionally compelled to enact the statute at issue here. The Constitution prohibits neither private sex discrimination nor private abridgment of the First Amendment right to petition. The state interests at issue here differ markedly from those asserted in <em>Bob Jones. </em>In that case, the Court found that \u201cthe governmental interest is in denying public support to racial discrimination in education.\u201d <em>Bob Jones University, </em>461 U.S. at 604 n. 29, 103 S.Ct. at 2035 n. 29. Certainly, denial of public support to discrimination is a more compelling interest than eliminating discrimination in the private sector, for the Constitution, through the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments, <em>Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954), affirmatively compels denial of governmental aid to discrimination, <em>Norwood v. Harrison, </em>413 U.S. 455, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973)<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> (state aid to private schools that discriminate violates fourteenth amendment.). Accordingly, the governmental interest in <em>Bob Jones </em>was greater than in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">The Ohio Civil Rights Act places a heavy burden on appellants\u2019 exercise of their religious beliefs, and, although the state\u2019s interest is substantial, that interest does not justify such a broad and onerous limitation. The state legislation must be \u201cessential,\u201d \u201cnecessary,\u201d and the least drastic means to further the state\u2019s interest. <em>Minersville School District v. Gobitis, </em>310 U.S. 586, 595, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 1013, 84 L.Ed. 1375 (1940) (overruled in Barnette) (\u201cessential\u201d); <em>Sherbert, </em>374 U.S. at 407, 83 S.Ct. at 1795; <em>McCurry v. Tesch, </em>738 F.2d 271, 275-76 (8th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1180, 84 L.Ed.2d 328(1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">Just as the principle of neutrality guides our inquiries pursuant to the Establishment Clause, accommodation distinguishes our consideration of Free Exercise claims. <em>Lynch v. Donnelly, </em>465 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1359, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984) (Constitution \u201cmandates accommodation, not merely toleration\u201d);<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Girouard v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>328 U.S. 61, 68, 66 S.Ct. 826, 829, 90 L.Ed. 1084 (1946). Accommodation of the religious beliefs in this case would not significantly interfere with the state\u2019s fulfillment of its goal of eradicating discrimination in employment. The state would still be able to regulate all employment practices of non-religious institutions and would be able to regulate the employment practices of religious institutions except where religious belief is implicated. Further, it is clear that less burdensome alternatives such as the denial of tax exemptions as in the <em>Bob Jones University </em>case or denial of the use of public school bus transportation are available to help the state accomplish its goal while reducing interference with the exercise of religion. While the record reveals that bus transportation is the only public benefit DCS claims to receive, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 3327.01, it is clear that state law provides several other benefits such as textbooks, speech and hearing diagnostic services, physician, nursing, dental and optometric services, and diagnostic psychological services, Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3317.02.4(P), 3317.06. Likewise, while the record does not detail DCS tax status, the Ohio tax code provides several possible tax exemptions. Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 5709.04, 5709.07, 5709.12. Accordingly, the state might further its interest in eliminating sex discrimination by conditioning receipt of these benefits on compliance with the Ohio Civil Rights Act. Therefore, the state could advance its own compelling interest while imposing a lesser burden on appellants\u2019 religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">We hold that allowing the OCRC to assert jurisdiction over the instant complaint against DCS when such complaint is based on conduct pursuant to admittedly sincerely held religious beliefs and where the Ohio Civil Rights Act makes no provision for accommodation of those beliefs, unduly burdens the plaintiffs\u2019 right to free exercise of religion. This heavy burden and the coercion that naturally results compels the conclusion that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to DCS. The fact that the Houses\u2019 religious beliefs conflict with important secular tenets does not require a different result, for \u201cfreedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order.\u201d <em>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, </em>319 U.S. at 642, 63 S.Ct. at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">We note the admonition of the Court that \u201cin safeguarding conscience we are dealing with interests so subtle and so dear, every possible leeway should be given to the claims of religious faith.\u201d <em>Gobitis, </em>310 U.S. at 594, 60 S.Ct. at 1012; <em>Braunfeld, </em>366 U.S. at 605, 81 S.Ct. at 1146 (making accommodation is a \u201cdelicate task\u201d); <em>Braunfeld, </em>366 U.S. at 610, 81 S.Ct. at 1149 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he rights of conscience are, in their nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear the gentlest touch of governmental hand.\u201d I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Annals of Cong. 730 (Remarks of Rep.

Concluding that this is the most compelling of such circumstances, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Appellants also contend that application of the Ohio Civil Rights Act to DCS violates the Establishment Clause. Noting that the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses are but two aspects of one essential freedom, we consider appellants\u2019 assignment of error. At the outset, we note that appellants\u2019 religious beliefs are sincerely held and that DCS discharged Hos-kinson because of those beliefs. These facts, not appealed by the OCRC as clearly erroneous, were found by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">The Court has eschewed rigidity in Establishment Clause analysis.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that the prohibitions which the clause represents apply equally to government benefits to and burdens on religion. <em>Lynch, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1362; <em>Bob Jones University, </em>461 U.S. at 604, 103 S.Ct. at 2035; <em>Pacific Press Publishing Co., </em>676 F.2d at 1281; <em>Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, </em>651 F.2d at 286; <em>Mississippi College, </em>626 F.2d at 486. The Court has enunciated the guidelines for implementing the clause\u2019s purpose as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-7\">In each case, the inquiry calls for line drawing; no fixed, <em>per se </em>rule can be framed.

The line between permissible relationships and those barred by the Clause can no more be straight and unwavering than due process can be defined in a single stroke or phrase or test. The Clause erects a \u201cblurred, indistinct, and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship.\u201d In the line-drawing process we have often found it useful to inquire whether the challenged law or conduct has a secular purpose, whether its principal or primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion, and whether it creates an excessive entanglement of government with religion____ But, we have repeatedly emphasized our unwillingness to be confined to any single test or criterion in this sensitive area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\"><em>Lynch, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1361-62 (citations omitted); <em>Alamo Foundation, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1964; <em>Mueller v.

With little hesitation, we can affirm the district court\u2019s conclusions that the statute has a secular purpose and does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion. However, a secular purpose and facial neutrality are not sufficient to avoid conflict with the Establishment Clause. <em>Stone v.

Therefore, our inquiry focuses on whether the statute fosters excessive entanglement between religion and government.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">\u201cEntanglement is a question of kind and degree.\u201d <em>Lynch, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1364. \u201c[T]he questions are whether the involvement is excessive, and whether it is a continuing one calling for official and continuing surveillance leading to an impermissible degree of entanglement.\u201d <em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 675, 90 S.Ct. at 1414. In assessing entanglement, we consider the character of the institution affected, the type of burden placed upon that institution, and the resulting church-state relationship. <em>Lemon I, </em>403 U.S. at 615, 91 S.Ct. at 2112. These considerations mirror the three levels at which religion is involved in this case. First, the institution, the school, is pervasively religious. Second, the activity being burdened \u2014 the teaching of students and hiring of teachers \u2014 are in this case pervasively religious activities. Third, the point at which the state attempts to interject itself, thereby creating the church-state relationship, is in the hiring decision, a decision which the school superintendent testified is made using almost exclusively religious criteria. We consider each of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">First, as we have discussed fully above, DCS is a pervasively religious school, admits only Christians, applies religious criteria in hiring faculty, and includes indoctrination of students as a substantial purpose of its existence. <em>Tilton, </em>403 U.S. at 686-87, 91 S.Ct. at 2099-2100; <em>Lemon I, </em>403 U.S. at 616-618, 91 S.Ct. at 2113 (\u201cThe substantial religious character of these church-related schools gives rise to entan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>gling church-state relationships____\u201d); <em>Everson, </em>380 U.S. at 33, 67 S.Ct. at 520 (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (\u201cdaily religious education commingled with secular is \u2018religion\u2019 \u201d); <em>Volunteers of America-Minnesota-Bar None Boys Ranch v. NLRB, </em>752 F.2d 345, 348-49 (8th Cir.1985), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>53 U.S.L.W. 3759 (April 23, 1985). \u201c[T]he degree of entanglement arising from inspection of facilities as to use varies in large measure with the extent to which religion permeates the institution.\u201d <em>Hunt v. McNair, </em>413 U.S. 734, 746, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2875, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973); <em>Meek v. Pittenger, </em>421 U.S. at 366, 95 S.Ct. at 1763. Therefore, the religious permeation of DCS indicates that state intervention is likely to result in a high degree of entanglement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">Second, the character of the activity the state seeks to affect \u2014 the employment of the teaching staff \u2014 necessarily involves the state in regulating ideological resources of the school. <em>Tilton, </em>403 U.S. at 687, 91 S.Ct. at 2100. The fact that the state seeks to regulate teachers necessarily implicates religious concerns.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>Lemon I, </em>403 U.S. at 617, 91 S.Ct. at 2113. If anything, the Court\u2019s decisions regarding state aid to parochial schools establish that teachers are not religiously neutral. <em>Id. See New York v. Cathedral Academy, </em>434 U.S. 125, 98 S.Ct. 340, 54 L.Ed.2d 346 (1977);<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>Meek, </em>421 U.S. at 372, 95 S.Ct. at 1766; <em>Levitt v.

Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School, </em>623 F.2d 818, 822 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 996, 101 S.Ct. 1698, 68 L.Ed.2d 196 (1981) (\u201cIt is the commitment of the faculty to religious values no matter what subject in the curriculum is taught and the obligation to propagate those values which provides the risk of entanglement.\u201d). <em>See Donovan v. Central Baptist Church, Victoria, </em>96 F.R.D. 4 (S.D.Texas 1982). Therefore, this element of the entanglement inquiry indicates that a high degree of entanglement is likely. <em>Compare Donovan v. Tony and Susan Alamo Fdn., </em>722 F.2d 397, 402 (8th Cir.), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1953, 85 L.Ed.2d 278 (1985) (\u201cThese [record keeping] requirements apply only to commercial activities undertaken with a \u2018business purpose,\u2019 and would therefore have no impact on petitioners\u2019 own evangelical activities or on individuals engaged in volunteer work for other religious organizations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">Third, as long as DCS is in existence, the OCRC may exert jurisdiction over employment disputes, thereby creating a continuing relationship, rather than a one-time state-church encounter. <em>Tilton, </em>403 U.S. at 688, 91 S.Ct. at 2100. This fact, along with the types of records the OCRC seeks and the Commission\u2019s subpoena power, create the likelihood that allowing the Commission to exercise jurisdiction will result in the \u201ccomprehensive, discriminating, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>continuing state surveillance\u201d of which the Court disapproved in <em>Lemon I, </em>403 U.S. at 619, 91 S.Ct. at 2114. Further, the fact that the Commission will often be required to decide questions of intent, motive, causation, and pretext necessarily involves the state in assessing religious decisions. Such state involvement \u201cis fraught with the sort of entanglement that the Constitution forbids. It is a relationship pregnant with dangers of excessive government direction of church schools and hence of churches.\u201d <em>Lemon I, </em>403 U.S. at 620, 91 S.Ct. at 2114. In <em>Walz, </em>the Court, in upholding a property tax exemption for property used for religious worship, rejected, on grounds of entanglement, conditioning such exemption on social welfare work by the churches.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acx\">To give emphasis to so variable an aspect of the work of religious bodies would introduce an element of governmental evaluation and standards as to the worth of particular social welfare programs, thus producing a kind of continuing day-to-day relationship which the policy of neutrality seeks to minimize. Hence, the use of a social welfare yardstick as a significant element to qualify for tax exemption could conceivably give rise to confrontations that could escalate to constitutional dimensions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\"><em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 674, 90 S.Ct. at 1414.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <em>See Wolman v. Walter, </em>433 U.S. 229, 254, 97 S.Ct. 2593, 2608, 53 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">The conclusion that the Commission\u2019s assessment of DCS teacher employment decisions is impermissibly entangling is compelled particularly by cases assessing the constitutionality of applying labor relations statutes to parochial schools. In <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago v. NLRB, </em>559 F.2d 1112 (7th Cir.1977), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>440 U.S. 490, 99 S.Ct. 1313, 59 L.Ed.2d 533 (1979), the court concluded that exercise of jurisdiction by the NLRB over labor disputes among parochial school teachers fosters impermissible entanglement. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-8\">We are unable to see how the Board can avoid becoming entangled in doctrinal matters if, for example, an unfair labor practice charge followed the dismissal of a teacher either for teaching a doctrine that has current favor with the public at large but is totally at odds with the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith, or for adopting a lifestyle acceptable to some, but contrary to Catholic moral teachings. The Board in processing an unfair labor practice charge would necessarily have to concern itself with whether the real cause for discharge was that stated or whether this was merely a pretextual reason given to cover a discharge actually directed at union activity. The scope of this examination would necessarily include the validity as a part of church doctrine of the reason given for the discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1125 (if the reason for discharge were invalid under church doctrine, this would indicate that the reason asserted for discharge, the religious belief, was pretex-tual).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Further, the Supreme Court, although affirming on different grounds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>found that application of the statute to parochial schools presented a significant risk of infringing the First Amendment. The Court found that \u201c[i]nevitably the Board\u2019s inquiry will implicate sensitive issues that open the door to conflicts between clergy-administrators and the Board, or conflicts with negotiators for unions.\u201d 440 U.S. at 503, 99 S.Ct. at 1320. Noting that the schools involved had argued that \u201ctheir challenged actions were mandated by their religious creeds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 502, 99 S.Ct. at 1319, the Court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1J\">The resolution of such charges by the Board, in many instances will necessarily involve inquiry into the good faith of the position asserted by the clergy-administrators and its relationship to the school\u2019s religious mission. It is not only the conclusions that may be reached by the Board which may impinge on rights guaranteed by the Religion Clauses, but also the very process of inquiry leading to findings and conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The district court\u2019s factual findings and much of its analysis compels us to find excessive entanglement in this case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-8\">Should an individual ... charge that the religious reasons given for dismissal were but a pretext for sex, race, or some other form of unlawful discrimination, then the Commission would have to evaluate the subjective sectarian decision to determine if it was properly made or if the real reason for dismissal was some form of prohibited discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-9\">Within this procedural framework exists the potential for the Commission to evaluate sectarian decisions, in the context of hearings and investigations, to prohibit adherence to, or at least actions based upon religious tenets, and, in fact, to require the posting of antidiscrim-ination statements that may run contrary to the members\u2019 religious beliefs. In a school which attempts to permeate every lesson and activity with its religious principles and values, such potential intrusion by the state squarely presents a risk of impermissible state entanglement and interference with the members\u2019 religious beliefs and practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">578 F.Supp. at 1022-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">The Establishment Clause \u201cprohibition was designed comprehensively to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>those official involvements of religion which would tend to foster or discourage religious worship or belief.\u201d <em>Abington, </em>374 U.S. at 234, 83 S.Ct. at 1577 (Brennan, J., concurring.). The statute in this- case, as applied by the OCRC, clearly operates to discourage the practice of religious belief. The district court discounted this prospective state/church entanglement on the ground that only a hearing was involved at this point. However, the OCRC\u2019s aggressive pursuit of DCS raises a \u201crealistic likelihood,\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>413 U.S. at 747, 93 S.Ct. at 2876, that not only are the impermissible entanglements of the hearing itself implicated, but, rather, the entire panoply of statutory entanglements from the proposed consent order to the spector of judicial enforcement proceedings must be considered.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Entanglement is all the more likely in light of the OCRC\u2019s preliminary finding of probable cause. The district court also rejected appellants\u2019 claims by finding that the OCRC will only rarely be required to involve DCS in Commission proceedings. However, \u201c[t]he prospect of church and state litigating in court about what does or does not have religious meaning touches the very core of constitutional guarantees against religious establishment, and it cannot be dismissed by saying that it will happen only once.\u201d <em>Cathedral Academy, </em>434 U.S. at 133, 98 S.Ct. at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that allowing the OCRC to exercise jurisdiction over employment discrimination charges against DCS necessarily results in an excessive state/church' entanglement due to the issues of good faith and motivation necessarily raised in such proceedings, the pervasively religious nature of the Christian school, the particularly sensitive role of the teacher in explicitly and implicitly fostering the religious beliefs and values that appellant-parents seek for their children, and the fact that religious considerations pervade the hiring scheme employed by DCS.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that application of the Ohio Civil Rights Act in this context impermissibly entangles the state in issues of faith in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">V.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-10\">To be entitled to permanent injunctive relief from a constitutional violation, a plaintiff must first establish the fact of the violation____ He must then demonstrate the presence of two elements: continuing irreparable injury if the injunction does not issue, and the lack of an adequate remedy at law____ If the plaintiff makes such a showing, the court may grant injunctive relief, but the relief must be no broader than necessary to remedy the constitutional violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW62\"><em>Newman v.

That command is given to parents. And we feel that the primary responsibility for the education is a parental responsibility.

We believe that is crucial, that a Christian becomes like Him. And thus, He becomes the focus in everything we do in our school. In fact, we believe that the Scriptures, in Proverbs 19:27, and many other passages, that I feel this way myself as a parent, but that I have no choice but to put my children into Christian schools where God is made paramount, that to do anything other than that would be a sin and would be wrong for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-29\">See also testimony of DCS Board Member Hen-kle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">.

The nature of the institution is sufficiently spelled out above and in the district court's opinion to allow consideration of the religious interests without reference to whether a church or school, or a teacher or minister is involved.

Further, the section exempts religious institutions from actions for religious discrimination alone and not other types of actions for discrimination. <em>Dolter, </em>483 F.Supp. at 269. It has been held that when an act of discrimination might constitute both religious and a non-exempt form of discrimination, the court may inquire whether a religious or non-religious basis for the discrimination existed. <em>Id. </em>at 270. This view is premised on the notion that separate and distinct causes for a single act can be isolated and does not comprehend the facts of the pending case wherein the alleged act of discrimination is taken pursuant to a religious belief and the state infers from that act a non-exempt form of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">The pending case is distinguished from the Title VII cases heavily relied on by the district court due to the absence of a parallel exemption in the Ohio statute and the particular facts of this case, involving an admittedly religious institution, engaged in a pervasively religious activity, and an asserted religious basis for the challenged employment practices. <em>See EEOC v.

The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment are not the most precisely draw portions of the Constitution. The sweep of the absolute prohibitions in the Religion Clauses may have been calculated; but the purpose was to state an objective not to write a statute. In attempting to articulate the scope of the two Religion Clauses, the Court\u2019s opinions reflect the limitations inherent in formulating general principles on a case-by-case basis. The considerable internal inconsistency in the opinions of the Court derives from what, in retrospect, may have been too sweeping utterances on aspects of these clauses that seemed clear in relation to the particular cases but have limited meaning as general principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\"><em>Walz, </em>397 U.S. at 668, 90 S.Ct. at 1411.

However, the instant case falls in neither of these categories but instead involves state interference in the religious activities of religious schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">. The Court has frequently recognized this parental interest in both religious and non-religious contexts. In <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 </em>U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), the Court held that a state law forbidding, in any school, the teaching of any language other than English to a child who has not passed the eighth grade, violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of liberty. The Court found that \"education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto,\u201d and that the teacher\u2019s \"right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are within the liberty of the Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 43 S.Ct. at 627. This due process right of parents existed independent of religious considerations. In <em>Pierce, </em>the Court invalidated a statute requiring that children attend public schools as interfering with \"the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\u201d 268 U.S. at 534-35, 45 S.Ct. at 573. Further, in <em>Prince v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 165, 64 S.Ct. 438, 441, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944), the Court reiterated \u201c[t]he rights of children to exercise their religion, and of parents to give them religious training and to encourage them in the practice of religious belief, as against preponderant sentiment and assertion of state power voicing it.\u201d The function of the parent includes \"preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\" <em>Id. </em>at 166, 64 S.Ct. at 442. See also <em>Quick Bear v. Leupp, </em>210 U.S. 50, 81-82, 28 S.Ct. 690, 699-700, 52 L.Ed. 954 (1908) (\u201cwe cannot concede the proposition that Indians cannot be allowed to use their own money to educate their children in the schools of their own choice because the Government is necessarily undenominational.\u201d). The Court has more recently found the parental right of child rearing and education in the implied right of privacy, <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 152-53, 93 S.Ct. 705, 726, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>(1973), while expressing confusion regarding the source of such right, <em>Runyon v.

In <em>Runyon, </em>the Court found that \"a parent\u2019s decision concerning the manner in which his child is to be educated may fairly be characterized as exercises of familial rights and responsibilities\u201d and that \"parents have a constitutional right to send their children to private schools and a constitutional right to select private schools that offer specialized instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 96 S.Ct. at 2598. In <em>Yoder, </em>the Court emphasized that \u201cwhen the interests of parenthood are combined with a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this record, more than merely a \u2018reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the State\u2019 is required to sustain the validity of the State\u2019s requirement under the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 233, 92 S.Ct. at 1542.

Further, \"high school attendance with teachers who are not of the Amish faith \u2014 and may even be hostile to it \u2014 interposes a serious barrier to the integration of the Amish child into the Amish religious community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211-12, 92 S.Ct. at 1531.

I was exposed day after day to several teachers who loved God and who loved His word. And that influenced the way I love God and love His word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">Superintendent Schindler testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-12\">We believe very strongly that the teacher\u2019s role in education is paramount. In fact, in the Bible, in Luke, Chapter 6, verse 4, it says that after the student has been fully taught, the student will be like the teacher. And that is not just head knowledge, that is life style. In fact, educationally speaking, we feel strongly that more education takes place, more learning takes place in the life style of the teacher than does the curriculum itself. And because of that, we are very, very strongly devoted to getting the right persons in the classrooms teaching to our students, especially if you look at our philosophy. And if I, as a parent, am responsible for my kids and their education, and I am going to be judged accountable some day for that, that it\u2019s important as a parent that I am confident that the teacher has control of the minds of my kids and that their philosophy is compatible with mine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">Also, Schindler testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-17\">[T]he life style of a person is so crucial and important to what is taught and picked up in the classroom. Some educators have stated that better than ninety percent of the learning that takes place in the classrooms comes from the life style of the teacher. It\u2019s also been stated that no one lives out of or functions out of a philosophical vacuum, that we base every decision and the way we live based upon certain principles and certain authorities. And because of this, because it is so crucial, we take extra pains. In fact, I feel that one of my major responsibilities in the Dayton Christian School, as superintendent, is to make certain that the people selected to be on our staff are people whose life styles, whose commitment to Christ is compatible with what we want our kids to be taught.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">.

While concluding like other courts that the Free Exercise Clause may in some circumstances compel an exemption to employment discrimination laws, <em>EEOC v.

We reject this danger for two reasons. First, exceptions necessary to vindicate free exercise rights have overwhelmingly been upheld despite Establishment Clause concerns in light of the important values protected by the Free Exercise Clause. <em>Id.; Sherbert, </em>374 U.S. at 409, 83 S.Ct. at 1796; <em>Ab-ington, </em>374 U.S. at 295, 83 S.Ct. at 1610 (Brennan, J., concurring); <em>Selective Draft Law Cases, </em>245 U.S. 366, 390, 38 S.Ct. 159, 165, 62 L.Ed. 349 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">Second, due to the burden on religion necessary to prove a free exercise claim, the granting of an exception invariably involves less entanglement between church and state than does application of the statute to the religion, absent such an exception. <em>Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 269-70, 102 S.Ct. 269, 274, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>(1981); <em>Nyquist, </em>413 U.S. at 793, 93 S.Ct. at 2975 (property tax exemption \"was a product not of any purpose to support or to subsidize, but of a fiscal relationship designed to minimize involvement and entanglement between Church and States\u201d). In this case, as we establish <em>infra </em>at 961, application of the statute to DCS with the necessary inquiries into the difficult factual questions of intent, belief, pretext, and motivation involves substantial entanglement between religion and the state. While an exemption for action taken on religious grounds by religious institutions with respect to religious activities may require some entanglement, the degree of entanglement is certainly less than if the statute and the OCRC's full panoply of investigative and remedial powers were applied full force. The Establishment Clause prevents only excessive entanglement. The accommodation reflected in such an exemption is nothing more than the neutrality that the Establishment Clause compels. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. at 234-35 n. 22, 92 S.Ct. at 1542-43 n. 22.

That same history showed that many people had lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the support of government to spread its faith.

A conclusion at odds with <em>Catholic Bishop, </em>was reached by the Second Circuit in <em>Catholic High School Association of Archdiocese of New York v. Culvert, </em>753 F.2d 1161 (2d Cir.1985) in concluding that the First Amendment did not prohibit a state labor relations board from exercising jurisdiction over labor relations between parochial schools and their lay teachers. <em>Culvert, </em>a 2-1 decision, is factually distinguishable because no religious belief was implicated. The court rested its conclusion that entanglement was not excessive on the fact that Board orders were not self-enforcing, and the Board could not compel parties to agree but only to bargain in good faith. <em>Id. </em>at 1167. However, when a refusal to bargain is based on a religious belief in one's bargaining stance on a particular issue, the state will necessarily be required to inquire into issues of good faith and the validity of a party\u2019s interpretation of their religious belief. This is the type of inquiry disapproved in the <em>Catholic Bishop </em>cases. To hold that a state may constitutionally compel parties to bargain in derogation of religious beliefs seems a particularly peculiar construction of the First Amendment. The court further reached the inexplicable conclusion that although \u201cthe First Amendment prohibits the State Board from inquiring into an asserted religious motive to determine whether it is pretextual,\" the Board \u201cis still free to determine, using a dual motive analysis, whether the religious motive was in fact the cause of the discharge.\u201d 753 F.2d at 1168. Since pretext is essentially an inquiry into causation, this appears to be a distinction without a difference. Nevertheless, even if some principled distinction can be drawn, we fail to see that this would appreciably diminish the level of likely entanglement. Once the OCRC is denied the authority to inquire into issues such as pretext it becomes a \"toothless tiger\u201d rendering any exercise of jurisdiction illusory since such jurisdiction would be meaningless. Any inquiry into causation in the particularly compelling religious environment of this case involves excessive state/church entanglement in light of the fact that almost all DCS employment decisions are made on religious grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">.
