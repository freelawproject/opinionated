Leo Glasser, Judge, dismissing defendants OH Industries (\u201cOH\u201d), a Japanese manufacturer of forgings for striking tool (sledge hammers, mauls) heads, and Nan-nen American Manufacturing Corporation (Nannen), a Pennsylvania distributor of such forgings. OH was dismissed because it had never been properly served with process, and Nannen was dismissed because it lacked the minimum forum-state contacts necessary to sustain in personam jurisdiction under New York law or federal constitutional law. We affirm the dismissal of OH; we reverse and remand for further findings in respect to the dismissal of Nannen.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The action was brought by plaintiff Joseph Montalbano to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained on or about November 3, 1981, while using a sledge hammer in combination with a wood-splitting maul. The suit alleges negligence, breach of warranty and strict liability on the part of the original defendants Easco Tool, Inc. (\u201cEasco\u201d), and The Moore Company (\u201cMoore\u201d), an affiliate of Easco, which were alleged to be the manufacturers of the sledge hammer. Easco and Moore filed third-party complaints to im-plead OH Industries (\u201cOH\u201d), the alleged manufacturer of the sledge head; Nannen, the alleged distributor of the sledge head; The Stanley Works (\u201cStanley\u201d), also a distributor of striking tools and the alleged manufacturer of the wood-splitting maul; and Rickies Home Centers (\u201cRickies\u201d), the alleged New York vendor of the sledge hammer. Eventually, the plaintiff amended his complaint to assert direct claims against the four third-party defendants, and all of the defendants have asserted cross-claims against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) and (d)(3) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Easco attempted to serve process upon OH by mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to Nannen, which was assumed by Easco to be OH\u2019s agent. Responding to Easco\u2019s third-party complaint, as well as to Montalbano\u2019s amended direct complaint and the cross-claims of the other defendants, OH and Nannen pleaded as affirmative defenses a lack of personal jurisdiction, with OH also pleading improper service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">After reviewing the procedural background of the case and the respective activities of OH and Nannen, the district court concluded that the service on OH by mail in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>care of Nannen was not sufficient to subject OH to the jurisdiction of the court and therefore found it unnecessary to decide whether OH\u2019s contacts with the forum state rendered it amenable to the in person-am jurisdiction of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The court dismissed the claims against OH conditionally, \u201cuntil such time as Easco or another party has perfected service upon it of a summons and complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">With respect to Nannen, the district court reviewed each provision of N.Y.Civ. Prac.Law \u00a7 302 (McKinney 1972 &amp; Supp. 1984),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the New York long-arm statute, that was alleged as a basis for jurisdiction. It summarily rejected claims for jurisdiction based upon transaction of business within the state, and upon ownership, use, or possession of real property within the state. It also rejected Easco\u2019s claim for jurisdiction based upon the commission outside the state of a tort that causes injury within the state, where the tortfeasor regularly does or solicits business in New York or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed within the state; the court found no basis for jurisdiction on this ground even though Nannen\u2019s principal, Jack Nannen, had been affiliated with other corporations that solicited business in New York, because none of those corporations had marketed tools while in New York and none were currently transacting business of any kind in New York. Finally, the court refused to grant jurisdiction based upon the commission of a tort outside the state which causes injury within the state, where the tortfeasor expects or should reasonably expect such act to have consequences in New York and derived substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce. Although finding that Nannen did derive substantial revenue from interstate commerce, the court concluded that Easco had \u201cfailed to allege facts to suggest that Nannen could reasonably anticipate being haled into a New York court as a consequence of the sale of its product to Easco\u2019s plant in Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">\n<em>Jurisdiction Over OH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">OH, a corporation organized under the laws of Japan, maintains its offices and manufacturing plant at Higaski-Osaka, Japan. It makes forged steel products, including sledge heads, for sale in Japan and in the international market. It has no office, manufacturing plant, manufacturer\u2019s representatives or other facilities in the United States, no bank accounts or other assets in New York or any other state, and does not advertise in any United States publication or maintain a telephone listing in the United States; furthermore, OH has no corporate subsidiaries in the United States, nor is it affiliated with other corporate organizations doing business in the United States. It sells exclusively through Japanese trading companies located in Japan and ships by water to various ports other than the port of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">Easco\u2019s principal argument as to OH is that, where there are other means to effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>proper service pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(i),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an action should not be dismissed for failure to serve. <em>See Alexander v. Unification Church of America, </em>634 F.2d 673, 675 (2d Cir.1980); <em>Hill v. W. Bruns &amp; Co., </em>498 F.2d 565, 568 (2d Cir.1974); <em>Grammenos v. Lemos, </em>457 F.2d 1067, 1071 (2d Cir.1972). Easco also points out that the recently adopted Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which requires dismissal without prejudice if service is not made within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, expressly states that it \u201cshall not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (i)\u201d of the same rule. It argues that, given Rules 4(i) and 4(j), dismissal was inappropriate since it reasonably believed that it had served OH\u2019s American agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We cannot agree with either of Easco\u2019s arguments. Where service of process is insufficient, \u201c[t]he courts have broad discretion to dismiss the action or to retain the case but quash the service that has been made on defendant,\u201d 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1354, at 585 (1969) (footnote omitted), even though service will ordinarily be</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">quashed and the action preserved where \u201cthere is a reasonable prospect that plaintiff ultimately will be able to serve defendant properly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 586 (footnote omitted). <em>Accord Novak v. World Bank, </em>703 F.2d 1305, 1310 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Alexander, </em>634 F.2d at 675. Here, the district court did not contravene subdivision 4(j) even though it did not preserve the action. Subdivision 4(j), with its foreign country exception to the 120-day period for service, is simply inapplicable here, because Easco never attempted to serve process in a foreign country under subdivision (i); the 120-day time limit imposed by Rule 4(j) seems therefore perfectly proper,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> especially since Easco has not exactly bent over backward to effect service. So saying, we hold the dismissal of OH for failure to make service is proper, noting that such dismissal is, in any event, conditional. We need not reach the question whether OH was amenable to personal jurisdiction in New York State.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">\n<em>Jurisdiction Over Nannen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQb\">Nannen is a Pennsylvania corporation importing, inter alia, sledge heads from Japan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>and other Far East countries. On behalf of Easco, Nannen located and placed orders with OH for sledge-head forgings made pursuant to Easco\u2019s specifications. Nan-nen\u2019s customers include Easco, which has its headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, and three other companies located in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Florida, respectively. Nannen is not an exclusive sales representative of OH, and OH does not assert any authority over the conduct of Nannen\u2019s business, both companies being entirely independent of each other. Nannen does not sell OH products directly in New York and asserts that it does not know what disposition is made of the OH forgings after they are imported from OH and sold to its customers. Easco\u2019s purchase orders for OH sledge-head forgings originated at Easco\u2019s Reading, Pennsylvania, facility and were issued to Nannen at its office in the same city.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">In connection with the issue of in person-am jurisdiction over Nannen, Easco\u2019s claim on appeal rests on its allegation that Nannen committed \u201ca tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state ... [and] ... expect[ed] or should reasonably [have] expect[ed] the act to have consequences in the state [while] derivpng] substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce,\u201d N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 302(a)(3)(h). As former Dean, now Judge, Joseph M. McLaughlin\u2019s Supplementary Practice Commentaries indicate, N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \u00a7 302, at 37 (McKinney Supp.1984), \u201cit is apparent that the New York courts are construing the foreseeability requirement of subparagraph 3(ii) with an eye on the Supreme Court decision in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\u201d </em>444 U.S. 286, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). This being true, it is perhaps best to examine <em>WorldWide Volkswagen </em>before we consider eases construing the New York statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\"><em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>it will be recalled, was a products liability action instituted in an Oklahoma state court to recover for personal injuries sustained in an accident involving an automobile, purchased by New York residents in New York, that was being driven through Oklahoma at the time of the accident. Among the defendants were the retailer, from whom plaintiffs purchased the automobile, and its wholesaler \u2014 both of which were New York corporations that did not conduct business in Oklahoma. In finding that the Oklahoma court lacked in personam jurisdiction over the New York defendants, the Supreme Court held that, as a constitutional prerequisite to the exercise of in personam jurisdiction, a defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state must be such that maintaining the lawsuit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, with the relationship between the defendant and the forum making it \u201c \u2018reasonable ... to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there.\u2019 \u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 292, 100 S.Ct. at 564 (quoting <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316-17, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court stated that \u201cforeseeability\u201d alone had never been a sufficient benchmark under the due process clause, <em>id. </em>444 U.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. at 566, even though that \u201cis not to say ... that foreseeability is wholly irrelevant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 297, 100 S.Ct. at 567. The relevant notion of foreseeability is not the mere likelihood that the product will find its way into the forum state but rather \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State ... such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>into court there,\u201d <em>id., </em>for example, by \u201c \u2018purposefully availing] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 1239, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The crucial aspect of <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>for this case is the Court\u2019s statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-5\">if the sale of a product of a manufacturer or distributor ... is not simply an isolated occurrence, but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve, directly <em>or indirectly, </em>the market for its product in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise has there been the source of injury to its owners or to others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, under the due process clause, the question presented by the district court\u2019s dismissal of Nannen is whether Nannen sought to serve \u201cdirectly or indirectly, the market for its product\u201d in New York, a state adjoining Pennsylvania. This is a question the district court simply did not answer to our satisfaction, in saying only that because Nannen sold OH products to just four areas \u2014 Pennsylvania, Georgia, Maryland and Florida \u2014 it \u201ccould hardly have foreseen that these items would have come to rest in New York,\u201d especially in light of Nannen\u2019s knowledge that the sledge heads it sold to Easco would be assembled into tools that Easco would distribute at retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Examination of the New York cases is instructive. In <em>Martinez v. American Standard, </em>91 A.D.2d 652, 457 N.Y.S.2d 97, 98 (1982), <em>aff'd mem., </em>60 N.Y.2d 873, 470 N.Y.S.2d 367, 458 N.E.2d 826 (1983), Martinez sustained personal injuries as a consequence of the alleged malfunctioning of an American Standard air-conditioning unit in which a compressor manufactured by Teeumseh Products Co had been installed. Tecumseh in turn sought indemnification or contribution from Vitreous State Products, which had manufactured and sold terminal pins used in Tecumseh\u2019s compressors. The court reversed a finding of jurisdiction that had been based on a \u201cstream of commerce\u201d analysis whereby a manufacturer would be deemed to have foreseen the consequences of an allegedly defective product by having placed that product on the market for general distribution. <em>Id., </em>91 A.D.2d at 654, 457 N.Y.S.2d at 99. Following <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>it found the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum state to be an insufficient basis for jurisdiction, the foreseeability requirement itself being restricted by a \u201cpurposeful affiliation requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Turning to the facts of the case before it, the court held that jurisdiction could not be exercised over Vitreous because the record revealed \u201cno tangible manifestation\u201d indicating that Vitreous knew or should have known where Tecumseh\u2019s compressors were destined or that Vitreous was attempting to reach a New York market through Tecumseh. <em>Id., </em>91 A.D.2d at 654, 457 N.Y.S.2d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\"><em>Martinez </em>is worth comparing with <em>Darienzo v. Wise Shoe Stores, Inc., </em>74 A.D.2d 342, 427 N.Y.S.2d 831 (1980). There, personal injuries were allegedly sustained when a high heel separated from the shank of a shoe, causing the plaintiff to fall from the platform of an elevated train station to the tracks below; plaintiff brought suit against Wise Shoe Stores, Inc., a shoe retailer, and Gutman-Kesslyn Shoes, Inc., a shoe manufacturer and distributor. <em>Id. </em>at 343-44, 427 N.Y.S.2d at 832. Wise and Gutman-Kesslyn then filed a third-party complaint against Selbern Shoe Co., Inc., a New Hampshire shoe manufacturer. Selbern, 5% of whose annual sales of approximately 500,000 pairs of shoes reached New York retailers, had originally manufactured the shoes in question on an order placed with it by Gutman-Kesslyn, also a New Hampshire company, which in turn had solicited the order from Wise. The shoes were shipped by Selbern directly to Wise\u2019s Nashville, Tennessee, location, and then reshipped by Wise to its retail store in Kings County, New York. <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 427 N.Y.S.2d at 832-33. Selbern moved to dismiss the third-party complaint against it for lack of personal jurisdiction, claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>that it had no contacts with New York since its sales were based exclusively on orders from Gutman-Kesslyn and were therefore intrastate. The court rejected Selbern\u2019s claim, holding that, because Gut-man-Kesslyn and Selbern shared officers and had virtually identical shareholders, Selbern\u2019s expectation of forum consequences in New York could be inferred from the fact that Selbern\u2019s principals, serving also as Gutman-Kesslyn\u2019s principals, had knowledge of Gutman-Kesslyn\u2019s New York market. <em>Id. </em>at 345-47, 427 N.Y. S.2d at 833-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Although in personam jurisdiction was found lacking in <em>Martinez </em>but present in <em>Darienzo, </em>both cases are consistent with the principal, articulated in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>that there is more to \u201cminimum contacts\u201d than mere foreseeability. The defendant was dismissed in <em>Martinez </em>after the record had been unsuccessfully searched for evidence of \u201ctangible manifestations\u201d of even indirect efforts to reach a New York market. The defendant remained a party to the action in <em>Darienzo, </em>despite the absence of direct sales by defendant to New York customers, because the record revealed, to use the language of <em>Martinez, </em>defendant\u2019s \u201cpurposeful affiliation\u201d with a distributor that served an interstate market that included New York. Both <em>Martinez </em>and <em>Darienzo, </em>therefore, suggest that in the ease before us, something more than evidence that Nannen directly serviced only a four-state non-New York market is necessary to support Nannen\u2019s claim that it is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the district court. Easco and Nannen do not, of course, have common shareholders and officers; nevertheless, Nannen may well have known about the range of Easco\u2019s business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record is simply insufficiently developed to permit a finding that Easco failed to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction over Nannen.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We note that in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>the Court cites with apparent approval <em>Gray v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>22 Ill.2d 432, 176 N.E.2d 761 (1961), where an Illinois court was found to have jurisdiction over an Ohio safety valve manufacturer, one of whose safety valves was installed in Pennsylvania into a hot water heater that eventually caused injury in Illinois to an Illinois consumer. We also note <em>Nelson by Carson v. Park Industries, Inc., </em>717 F.2d 1120, 1124-26 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1278, 79 L.Ed.2d 682 (1984). <em>Nelson by Carson </em>holds that the relevant scope of the foreseeable market is \u201cgenerally broader with respect to manufacturers and primary distributors of products who are at the start of a distribution system and who thereby serve, directly or indirectly, and derive economic benefit from a wider market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1125; <em>see also id. </em>at 1126 (citing other cases). So, too, was Nannen an \u201cearly actor[ ] in a distribution system which places and moves the product in the stream of commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1126. And just as the critical factor for the Seventh Circuit was \u201cwhether [the distributor and manufacturer] were aware of [the retailer\u2019s] distribution system,\u201d <em>id., </em>so, too, the question here is whether Nannen was aware of the nature and extent of Easco\u2019s distribution system. That question remains unanswered.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Affirmed as to OH, and reversed and remanded as to Nannen. No costs to either party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">.

Siegel, Practice Commentaries U.S.C.A. Rule 4, at 54 (West Supp.1985) (citing <em>Grammenos v. Lemos, supra, </em>with approval). According to Sie-gel, because the 1983 amendment to Rule 4 removed the marshal as the exclusively authorized process server, it was thought advisable to put some stated cap on the time for serving the summons, hence the 120 day limit, which, Sie-gel states, seems more than enough time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-5\"><em>. </em>The Court, identifying some of the affiliating circumstances whose existence might have supported the Oklahoma exercise of jurisdiction, noted that the defendants had not conducted sales or service operations in Oklahoma, did not obtain the benefits of Oklahoma law, had not solicited Oklahoma business either through a sales force or advertising directed to reach Oklahoma, and did not regularly sell cars either at wholesale or retail to Oklahoma customers or residents. <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. at 566.
