We hold that the government had no such obligation, as there was sufficient oral evidence to establish the existence and content of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was convicted of unlawfully carrying a firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), and unlawfully possessing ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(/z). On appeal, he claims that (1) his motion to suppress evidence should have been allowed; and (2) the trial judge\u2019s jury instruction on constructive possession was erroneous. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Facts. </em>At a hearing conducted pursuant to the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, the following facts were established. Shortly after midnight on September 19, 1998, Boston police Officer Joseph Horton drove his cruiser onto the Carter School parking lot, a site of car break-ins in the past. A sole motor vehicle sat in the lot, backed in next to a dumpster. Pulling in front of the car, the officer noticed two men seated inside. Yuri Rushin, the defendant, was in the passenger seat, \u201cdrinking out of a Budweiser can.\u201d Stepping from his cruiser, Horton saw Rushin lean \u201cforward as if he was putting something on the floor.\u201d Concerned for his safety, Horton called for back-up. After other officers arrived, the defendant was arrested for \u201cdrinking an alcoholic beverage in a motor vehicle,\u201d in violation of a city ordinance. During a subsequent search incident to arrest, a loaded Clock nine millimeter handgun was found partially underneath the seat Rushin had occupied. On the seat was a knife. After receiving Miranda warnings, Rushin admitted the gun was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the defendant, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 36 (1985), asserted that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to introduce a certified copy of the city ordinance was fatal to its case in that the Commonwealth had failed to demonstrate a legal basis justifying the arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>The motion to suppress. </em>Here, the officer testified that he witnessed the defendant drinking from a Budweiser can while sitting in a car, which was a violation of a city ordinance. Having, he believed, a right of arrest,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he exercised it. That the gun was discovered pursuant to that arrest may be justified as a search incident thereto. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>402 Mass. 156, 159 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Sufficient evidence of the basis for the defendant\u2019s arrest, in the form of the officer\u2019s recitation of the ordinance, existed before the court to justify the officer\u2019s actions. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>was entitled to attack that testimony, and it was permissible for either party to enter in evidence a copy of the ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That no one did, however, is not fatal to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The court was not required to view a copy of the ordinance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, supra, </em>does not counsel otherwise. In that case, a police officer testified that he saw the defendant \u201cstanding about twelve to eighteen inches from an uncurtained window of a basement apartment and that the defendant was peering into the window. His belt was unbuckled, his trousers were unbuttoned and unzipped. He wore no underwear, and his hands were in front of his groin area. . . . The judge concluded that, when [the officer] saw the defendant \u2018peering into the window of a house in the early morning hours with his pants open and in disarray,\u2019 he had probable cause to arrest him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, supra </em>at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Perretti was arrested for \u201cpeeping-and-spying\u201d and possession of marijuana. Unlike the case at bar, it appears that there was no evidence whatsoever, either in oral or documentary form, before that court that \u201cpeeping-and-spying\u201d was a violation of a city ordinance. Apparently neither the officer testified to it, nor did the Commonwealth offer the ordinance in evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In these circumstances, the court in <em>Perretti </em>concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>probable cause to arrest could not be based on the ordinance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 40. The defect in <em>Perretti, </em>therefore, was that the content of the ordinance was not introduced in any form. Here, conversely, there was evidence before the court concerning the content of the ordinance in question in the form of the officer's testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contrary to the defendant\u2019s implicit claims, <em>Perretti </em>says nothing about the specific form of evidence required to establish the content of an ordinance in these circumstances. Sufficient evidence existed here to justify the arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\">fin dictum, <em>Perretti </em>counsels that \u201c[t]he defendant is correct in asserting that the ordinance was not put in evidence and must, therefore, be disregarded.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, supra </em>at 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 59, authorizes an arrest for a violation of an ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">An example of the efficacy of such an undertaking would entail an officer testifying that he had effectuated an arrest due solely to an ordinance violation and the defendant introducing evidence that no such ordinance existed or that the actions of the defendant were not within the scope of the ordinance. In such an instance, probable cause to arrest would be lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u201c[C]ourts, unless municipal courts, do not take judicial notice of municipal ordinances and by-laws.\u201d <em>Mahar </em>v. <em>Steuer, </em>170 Mass. 454, 456 (1898). As the Boston Municipal Court is just that, <em>Maher </em>theoretically applies, which could resolve the matter. However, there is no record indication that the motion judge took judicial notice of the ordinance. Moreover, given some uncertainty on the issue, see <em>Fournier </em>v. <em>Central Taxi Cab, Inc., </em>331 Mass. 248, 249 (1954) (\u201c[njeither a trial judge [of the Municipal Court of the Charlestown District] nor this court can consider such alleged ordinances unless they are put in evidence\u201d), we do not decide the case on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">A review of the <em>Perretti </em>briefs reveals that the defense brief did not even mention \u201cordinance.\u201d Rather, it argued that the observations of the police did not amount to probable cause to arrest the defendant for the commission of a crime. The Commonwealth, possibly recognizing the validity of the defendant\u2019s argument, asserted, seemingly for the first time, that \u201cpeeping- and-spying\u201d was a violation of a city ordinance. The defendant successfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>moved to strike a copy of the ordinance, which the Commonwealth included in an addendum to its brief. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perretti, supra </em>at 38 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b544-17\">It should be noted that as justification for its dictum, see note 1, <em>supra, Perretti </em>cited two civil cases \u2014 <em>Gaunt </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Methuen, </em>327 Mass. 380, 381 (1951), and <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, 7 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 591, 597-598 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 18 (1980) \u2014 which hold that a court cannot take judicial notice of an ordinance and that, as such, the ordinance needs to be put in evidence. We note that the evidentiary rules of civil trials are different from those applicable to criminal motions to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b544-18\">The Commonwealth asserts that even disregarding the ordinance, the officer had a reasonable basis to conduct a threshold inquiry. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 763 (1981). The specific and articulable facts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974), justifying the inquiry, included a high crime area, late at night, in an area where no other cars were present, with the defendant drinking an alcoholic beverage and suspiciously leaning down (to where the gun was eventually found). Given our holding, we need not address the sufficiency of this evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b544-19\">The defendant\u2019s second argument, that an unobjected-to jury instruction on constructive possession was faulty, also fails. Even if error, which we do not decide, there was not a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice given evidence that the officer saw the defendant lean down to where the gun was located, coupled with the defendant\u2019s admission of its ownership.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
