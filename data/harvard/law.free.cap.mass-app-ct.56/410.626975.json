L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, requires a Juvenile Court judge to make written subsidiary findings when deciding whether an individual who commits an offense prior to his seventeenth birthday but is not apprehended until after his eighteenth birthday may be prosecuted as an adult. The question arises in the following context.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\"><em>Background. </em>On the afternoon of January 16, 1990, Lawrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Searcy was shot to death in front of a dry cleaning business in the Roxbury area of Boston. An eyewitness, Lillian Belcher, saw the gunman shoot Searcy once in the back and then stand over Searcy\u2019s prone body and pump seven or eight more bullets into Searcy as he lay on the ground. In 1999, Belcher identified Jamal Davis, then twenty-five years old, as the shooter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 12, 1999, the Roxbury Juvenile Court issued a delinquency complaint charging Davis with Searcy\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, a Juvenile Court judge conducted a hearing to determine whether Davis should be prosecuted as an adult or discharged. The Commonwealth and the defendant each presented witnesses and had the opportunity to be heard upon whether (1) there was probable cause to believe that Davis had committed Searcy\u2019s murder; and (2) in the exercise of her discretion, the judge could conclude that, consistent with the protection of the public, Davis should be discharged, or whether the interests of the public required that Davis be prosecuted as an adult.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The Commonwealth contended that Belcher\u2019s testimony established probable cause to believe that Davis had murdered Searcy and that, given the barbarous nature of the crime, it was inconceivable that prosecution of the perpetrator was not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>interests of the public.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>The Commonwealth\u2019s presentation focused upon \u201cthe interests of the public\u201d and rested solely upon the facts and circumstances of the crime. The Commonwealth presented no evidence bearing specifically upon the correlative question of whether Davis\u2019s discharge was \u201cconsistent with the protection of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">For his part, Davis maintained that (1) the Commonwealth had failed to establish probable cause because it was predicated upon a suspect identification by Belcher, whose credibility was questionable,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (2) the weakness of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, together with the slipshod nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation, the staleness of the case, and the loss of potentially exculpatory evidence, put the defendant in an untenable position that made further prosecution not \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d Like the Commonwealth, Davis presented no evidence bearing upon whether his discharge was \u201cconsistent with the protection of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge stated, \u201cI find that there is probable cause and that the interest of justice [sic] would be served by having this case sent to the adult court.\u201d The judge made no written subsidiary findings to support her decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">After a grand jury indicted the defendant for murder in the first degree, the Juvenile Court dismissed the delinquency complaint. In Superior Court, Davis moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting both that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 162-163 (1982), and that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction because the Juvenile Court judge had failed to make statutorily required written findings. As relevant to this action, the focus in Superior Court was upon whether the version of G. L. c. 119, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u00a7 72A, in effect at the time of Searcy\u2019s murder or a 1996 amendment governed the defendant\u2019s case, and whether applying the latter version would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Superior Court judge decided that the earlier version of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, not the amended version, governed Davis\u2019s case and required written findings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He remanded to the Juvenile Court \u201cfor the required written findings.\u201d See <em>A Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), </em>380 Mass. 552, 562 n.13 (1980) (\u201cWhether or not technically a \u2018remand,\u2019 the order was in essence a request for further enlightenment to enable the judge to rule justly on the . . . motion\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 251, 259 (1983) (Superior Court is to \u201crequest the Juvenile Court to revise its findings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">When written findings did not materialize from the Juvenile Court judge, the defendant renewed his motion to dismiss in Superior Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A second Superior Court judge then reported this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cWhether, in the circumstances of this case, the indictment charging Jamal Davis with murder must be dismissed where the Juvenile Court has failed to make written findings, in compliance with G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, to support its determination that (1) probable cause existed to believe that Jamal Davis committed the offense charged of murder, and (2) that the interests of the public require that Jamal Davis be tried for this crime rather than released.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">We answer the reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d Where written subsidiary findings are not required by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>where as here, the record supports the Juvenile Court judge\u2019s determination of probable cause and her exercise of discretion to authorize prosecution of the defendant as an adult, dismissal of the indictment is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The reported question rests upon the premise that compliance with G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, requires written findings. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In the context of transfer of a juvenile for treatment as an adult under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Supreme Judicial Court has observed that written findings are a statutory, not a constitutional requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>362 Mass. 357, 369 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>365 Mass. 301, 306-307 (1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1111 (1975). Similarly, written findings are not a constitutional requirement for prosecution under \u00a7 72A of an individual who commits a crime as a juvenile but is not apprehended until an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Nor are written findings a statutory prerequisite to a \u00a7 72A transfer. Unlike \u00a7 61, which, when it was in effect, contained an explicit requirement of written subsidiary findings, \u00a7 72A makes no mention of written findings. The defendant posits such a requirement as implicit in \u00a7 72A\u2019s provision that the transfer determination \u201cshall be heard and determined in accordance with sections fifty-three to sixty-three, inclusive.\u201d Consequently, he contends, the \u00a7 72A determination must mirror the \u00a7 61 requirement of written findings to support a transfer decision. Plausible as the defendant\u2019s argument appears at first blush, the contention is .flawed both in law and in logic. We do not write upon a blank slate. The defendant\u2019s central contention, that \u00a7 72A incorporates all of the requirements for transfer contained in \u00a7 61, was considered and rejected in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. 854, 858-860 (1990), which, as here, involved a defendant\u2019s prosecution as an adult for a crime committed as a juvenile several years earlier. There, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cSince the Legislature provided specific standards for transfer in \u00a7 72A . . . these specific standards preempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the \u00a7 61 standards in this case. In other words, the specific provisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, relative to transfer are applicable to a \u00a7 72A transfer hearing and the standards set forth in \u00a7 61, despite the general incorporation of \u00a7\u00a7 53-63 are not controlling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 858-859.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Although \u00a7 61 is no longer operative, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>examination of its underlying considerations illuminates the fundamental differences between the respective transfer decisions under that statute and \u00a7 72A. A \u00a7 61 transfer considered whether an individual who was within the age for prosecution as a juvenile should be subject to adult prosecution and possible adult penalties. Section 61 reflected a legislative determination that such a weighty decision should hinge on two ultimate findings: (1) that the child presented a significant danger to the public; and (2) that the child was not amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile system. Those findings were to be proved by clear and convincing evidence grounded in specific evidentiary factors, such as the seriousness of the alleged offense; the juvenile\u2019s family, school and social history, including his court and juvenile delinquency record; adequate protection of the public; the nature of past treatment efforts; and the likelihood of rehabilitation. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">A \u00a7 72A transfer presents an important, but altogether different inquiry: whether an individual who is alleged to have committed a crime while a juvenile, but who has \u201caged out\u201d of the Juvenile Court\u2019s jurisdiction before being apprehended, will be subject to <em>any </em>prosecution <em>at all. </em>In the context of \u00a7 72A, the Legislature has determined that such a decision should depend upon the judge\u2019s discretionary assessment of two cognate considerations, the \u201cprotection of the public\u201d and \u201cthe interests of the public,\u201d without the need for proof by clear and convincing evidence and without specific evidentiary considerations to guide the ultimate decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 257 (defendant\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation, second component in \u00a7 61A transfer, is not relevant to \u00a7 72A determination). Thus, we conclude that unlike a \u00a7 61 transfer, a \u00a7 72A transfer requires neither clear and convincing evidence nor written subsidiary findings, but only record sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>port that there is probable cause and that the Juvenile Court judge has exercised and not abused her discretion in concluding either that discharge is consistent with protection of the public or that the interests of the public require adult prosecution rather than discharge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. at 858 (\u201cWith regard to transfer ... \u00a7 72A specifically provides a different standard from that which is applicable in the ordinary juvenile case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Here, the Juvenile Court judge did what was minimally required by \u00a7 72A. She conducted a hearing at which both sides had the opportunity to present evidence addressing probable cause and whether Davis\u2019s discharge was consistent with protection of the public or whether the interests of the public required adult prosecution rather than discharge. Notwithstanding the absence of written subsidiary findings, the record supports the conclusion that, based upon Belcher\u2019s eyewitness identification of Davis as the shooter, there is probable cause to believe that Davis murdered Searcy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>413 Mass. 148, 151 (1992) (minimum quantum of evidence for probable cause is whether Commonwealth has presented sufficient evidence to send case to jury if proceeding were trial). Although the Juvenile Court judge did not make specific reference to the heinous nature of Searcy\u2019s murder, nor recite the details of the killing in her order, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. at 859-860, nevertheless we are satisfied she considered and properly exercised her discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>390 Mass. 833, 838 (1984) (finding is clearly evident from record); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 547 (1981) (absent explicit findings, we analyze record to see if findings implicit in judge\u2019s ruling are supported).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The defendant adduced no evidence bearing upon whether his discharge was consistent with the protection of the public, but argued only more generally that the interests of justice would not be served by adult prosecution. The Commonwealth\u2019s only evidence bearing upon protection of the public arose indirectly from its trying to establish the contrary: that the nature of the crime and the \u201cbarbarous\u201d manner in which Davis murdered Searcy demonstrated that the interests of the public required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>adult prosecution. The thrust of the Commonwealth\u2019s case was that if prosecution of Davis for Searcy\u2019s cold blooded execution was not in the interests of the public and consistent with protection of the public, it would be difficult to imagine what is. Put differently, discharge of an accused murderer without public trial would be inconsistent with the protection of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">We are satisfied that the absence of any evidence that Davis\u2019s discharge would be consistent with the protection of the public, the manner of Searcy\u2019s murder, and the self-evident nature of the proposition that it is in the interests of the public to prosecute an accused murderer, all informed the exercise of the Juvenile Court judge\u2019s discretion and the conclusion that adult prosecution was warranted. \u201cThe judge had a sufficient basis to conclude that the interests of the public required transfer. The defendant received the benefit of the judge\u2019s discretion on this issue, and the judge did not abuse that discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bousquet, </em>407 Mass. at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">While \u00a7 72A does not require written subsidiary findings, we observe that malting such findings, however brief, is a prudent and desirable practice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 137 (2001). Written findings not only manifest that the judge properly exercised discretion by making explicit the reasons that lie inchoate in the record, but also inspire public confidence in the decision and its underpinnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We answer the reported question in the negative and remand to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Davis was bom in May, 1973, making him less than seventeen years old at the time of Searcy\u2019s murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\">See G.
