Bradley was assigned light duty as an office clerk and received workers\u2019 compensation payments for partial incapacity under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, from the employer\u2019s self-insurer, Commonwealth Energy Systems (insurer). From March 31 through September 23, 1996, there was a lockout of union employees, including Bradley, a longtime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>union member.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Bradley began receiving unemployment compensation, the insurer, pursuant to the offset provision in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B(2), applicable to workers receiving both partial disability benefits and unemployment compensation, discontinued its payments of disability benefits to him for the duration of the lockout.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">An administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) issued a decision allowing Bradley\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation during the lockout period. Following af-firmance of that decision by a majority of the DIA reviewing board,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the insurer appealed to a single justice of this court, who reported the matter to a full panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The insurer argues it was error for the board to award Bradley disability benefits during the lockout because his loss of earnings was caused by the lockout and was not the result of his work-related injury. It also claims that the award was based on the judge\u2019s erroneous determination of the amount of Bradley\u2019s earning capacity during the lockout.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\"><em>The lockout. </em>The insurer\u2019s assertion that Bradley should not have received disability benefits during the lockout ignores an employee\u2019s right to compensation for a loss of earning capacity as a result of an industrial injury even though economic conditions may affect the availability of work. <em>Pierce\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 649, 656 (1950) (\u201cif the actual wages received after the injury have been diminished by reason of economic conditions, the extent that they have been so lessened is to be disregarded in determining [the employee\u2019s] ability to earn subsequent to the accident\u201d). As stated by a leading commentator, \u201c[w]here the employee is claiming [workers\u2019] compensation for total or partial incapacity after a period during which he was gainfully employed, it is immaterial whether the employee lost his job because of a layoff, strike, voluntary resignation, or business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>recession. Whatever the reason for his predicament, he is entitled to compensation if he is totally or partially incapacitated from earning his former wage, by reason of the effects of his industrial injury.\u201d Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 325, at 385 (2d ed. 1981). Such a focus on compensation for injury-related loss of earning capacity is evident in older decisions such as <em>Septimo\u2019s </em>Case, 219 Mass. 430 (1914); <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489 (1922); and <em>Percival\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 50 (1929), in which employees returned to work after a compensable injury and thereafter lost their jobs due to economic conditions and which may be read as supporting the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits during layoffs. The board in its decision correctly treated the lockout in this case as analogous to a layoff. It stated: \u201cAs with a lockout, the termination of employment in a layoff is involuntary on the part of the employee and for reasons unrelated to his medical condition.\u201d It is consistent with the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statute that the employee\u2019s work-related incapacity be recognized regardless of the current status or availability of the job at which he suffered his injury, particularly where the work is unavailable due to circumstances beyond the control of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><em>The amount of benefits. </em>Because Bradley also received unemployment benefits during the lockout,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we consider the application of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which provides for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>coordination of the two systems of benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Partial disability benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 63, are based on a percentage of the \u201cdifference between [the employee\u2019s] average weekly wage before the injury and the weekly wage [the employee] is capable of earning after the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The applicable postinjury wage capacity is designated as the \u201cgreatest\u201d of the amounts computed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the first four subsections of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35D.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Cassola\u2019s Case, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 904, 905 &amp; n.l (2002). Because Bradley\u2019s actual earnings were terminated by the lockout and he was not capable of performing the job he held at the time of his injury,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 35D(1) and 35D(2) are not applicable. The parties\u2019 dispute centers on the applicability of \u00a7\u00a7 35D(3) and 35D(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The board agreed with the administrative judge\u2019s determination of the partial disability benefits due Bradley based on the judge\u2019s construction of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35D. Treating the lockout as a refusal to provide employment, the judge determined that Bradley\u2019s light-duty job was, in the meaning of \u00a7 35D(3) (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>not \u201cavailable\u201d to him<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and correctly concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>that the provisions of \u00a7 35D(3) could not be applied, leaving \u00a7 35D(4) as the controlling provision. In construing \u00a7 35D(4), the judge determined that Bradley had been assigned a position based on labor contract provisions, which resulted in his being paid wages that \u201cdid not reflect the true market value of the work he was performing.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">After his injury, Bradley had been \u201cmedically retrogressed\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to an office position titled \u201ccustomer service clerk-special.\u201d The duties of that position involved clerical work, including filing and handling telephone calls. The judge concluded that while this light-duty work was physically suitable for Bradley, his earnings of more than $23 per hour were based on his anomalous status under the employer\u2019s labor contract which resulted in his \u201ccontinuing] to receive high wages even though he no longer was doing work that in itself merited a high wage level.\u201d Essentially the judge rejected the use of Bradley\u2019s actual earnings immediately before the lockout because they had been \u201cartificially inflated.\u201d It is recognized that postinjury earnings may be an unreliable basis for determining earning capacity. See <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. at 492 (\u201cabnormal conditions produced ... by the great war .... enabled the employee to avoid an impairment of earning capacity which otherwise the physical injury would inevitably have caused\u201d). See also 4 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 81.01[4] (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The judge noted that clerks with length of service equivalent to that of Bradley were paid $15.63 per hour. He also found that Bradley had no training in the use of computers, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>use one in his light-duty job, and had no typing, shorthand, or special office skills.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, in accordance with \u00a7 35D(4), he determined the weekly wage \u201cthat the employee is capable of earning\u201d and, based on his assessment of Bradley\u2019s training, work experience, capabilities, pain, and physical limitations, see <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1988), assigned Bradley an earning capacity of $240 per week. Accordingly, the judge ordered payment of partial disability benefits of $407.48 per week,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and also ordered that the insurer may take credit for unemployment benefits pursuant to the offset provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judge\u2019s calculation of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits due Bradley properly was based on the effects of Bradley\u2019s physical injury on his earning capacity and, contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to the insurer\u2019s assertion, not on a calculation of earnings lost as the result of the lockout. We conclude that the board did not err in deciding that the administrative judge had properly applied the relevant statutory provisions, and that the board\u2019s decision is \u201cfactually warranted . . . disclosing reasoned decision making within the particular requirements governing a workers\u2019 compensation dispute.\u201d <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u201cLockout\u201d is defined as: \u201cAn employer\u2019s withholding of work and closing of a business because of a labor dispute.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 951 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">This case has been reported at 13 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 142 (1999). One member of the board dissented. The dissenting opinion takes the view that Bradley suffered an economic loss that was caused by the lockout, was unrelated to his injury, and was compensable only through unemployment benefits. The employer argues a similar view in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In pertinent part, G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(b)(4), as appearing in St. 1993, c. 88, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201can employee shall not be denied [unemployment] benefits as the result of an employer\u2019s lockout. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\">As relevant in the present case, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B, inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 47A, provides: \u201c(2) Any employee claiming or receiving benefits under section thirty-five who may be entitled to unemployment compensation benefits shall upon written request from the insurer apply for such benefits. Failure to do so within sixty days after written request shall constitute grounds for suspension of benefits under said section thirty-five. Any unemployment compensation benefits received shall be credited against partial disability benefits payable for the same time period, or, if for a period of time for which partial disability benefits have already been paid, shall be credited against any future partial disability benefits which are or may become payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">As implicitly recognized by this offset provision, in the case of partial disability, there is no inconsistency in an employee being eligible to receive both workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment benefits. Any theoretical inequity</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>in Bradley\u2019s being less burdened by the lockout than his fellow locked-out employees is a matter best left to the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">A leading national commentator states: \u201cTheoretically, the line between the two [systems] is plain: worker\u2019s compensation applies to wage loss attributable to physical disability, not to economic conditions: unemployment compensation applies to wage loss caused by economic conditions, not by physical disability .... At first glance the two [systems] may appear mutually exclusive; but the inconsistency disappears when the special meaning of disability in worker\u2019s compensation is remembered, involving ... the possibility of some physical capacity for work which is thwarted by the inability to get a job for physical reasons.\u201d 4 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 84.05 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In Massachusetts, after the enactment of the employment security act in 1935 (G. L. c. 151A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 479, \u00a7 5), employees were limited by that act and its 1941 successor (St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1) in obtaining unemployment compensation for the same time interval as that in which they received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The 1935 act contained an exception for compensation based on partial disability, and the 1941 act contained an exception for benefits for injuries specified under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, but not otherwise for benefits for partial disability. See the discussion in <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>Case, 325 Mass. 649, 654-655 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act of 1985, St. 1985, c. 572, directly provides for the coordination of benefits under the two systems through G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B, inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 47A. The 1985 act also amended G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 <em>25(d), </em>to allow payment of unemployment benefits where partial workers\u2019 compensation benefits are being paid. See St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 6A. See also Locke, Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act \u00a7 8.13 (Koziol Supp. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Prior to his injury, Bradley had been paid an average weekly wage of $1,469. In his light-duty assignment he earned $930-$ 1,100 per week and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits averaging $252.08 per week, representing a statutory percentage of the actual net loss of his prior earnings. When the employer locked out union employees, Bradley\u2019s pay was terminated. He applied for, and received, $347 per week in unemployment compensation. When the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B, were applied, the latter amount fully offset his disability benefits of $252.08. Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>8(2)(k), </em>as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 23, workers\u2019 compensation disability payments may be \u201csuspended or reduced\u201d in accordance with the offset provisions of \u00a7 36B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Section 35D, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 65, provides in relevant part: \u201cFor purposes of sections thirty-four, thirty-four A and thirty-five, the weekly wage the employee is capable of earning, if any, after the injury, shall be the greatest of the following: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201c(1) The actual earnings of the employee during each week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201c(2) The earnings that the employee is capable of earning in the job the employee held at the time of injury, provided, however, that such job has been made available to the employee and he is capable of performing it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\u201c(3) The earnings the employee is capable of earning in a particular suitable job; provided, however, that such job has been made available to the employee and he is capable of performing it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">\u201c(4) The earnings that the employee is capable of earning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">\u201c(5) . . . For purposes of this chapter, a suitable job or employment shall be any job that the employee is physically and mentally capable of performing, including light work, considering the nature and severity of the employee\u2019s injury, so long as such job bears a reasonable relationship to the employee\u2019s work experience, education, or training, either before or after the employee\u2019s injury. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">It is not disputed that at the times in issue Bradley was not capable of performing the job he held at the time of his injury. The administrative judge specifically concluded that Bradley could not have performed any other job than the light-duty work he had been doing before the lockout.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\">The judge interpreted the language of \u00a7 35D(3), \u201csuch job has been made available,\u201d not as making that section applicable simply on the basis that the light-duty job had been available at some time in the past. He read the language rather as meaning that if the job was not available during the time period at issue, the section did not apply. That reading appears to be correct, given the language that follows, in the present tense, \u201cand he is capable of performing it.\u201d We agree with and give deference to the board\u2019s reasoning that such an interpretation is harmonious with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(2)(d)(ii), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 23, which provides that payment of benefits shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>not be discontinued or modified except where a \u201csuitable job is open and has been made available, and remains open to the employee . . . .\u201d Contrary to the insurer\u2019s assertion that these two sections contain different language which should be given different meanings, the result reached by the judge and the board is consistent with the statutory interpretation principles expressed in <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 423 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">There is no merit in the employer\u2019s assertion, relying on an aspect of the process for determination of wage rates for public works contracts, see <em>Construction Indus. of Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>406 Mass. 162, 172 (1989), that the wages paid Bradley under the labor agreement were the proper basis for determining market wages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The record does not provide a definition for this term. It appears to be used in the employer\u2019s labor agreement to signify the situation here \u2014 that is, placement in light-duty work after an employee is injured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The board also stated that the wages were \u201cin the nature of a gratuity,\u201d although they were based on contractual provisions. Our record does not contain any of the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. We note that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10C(l)(a) and (e), inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 29, provide that benefits supplemental to those in \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, 35, and 36, and the creation of light-duty or modified jobs may be included in the scope of collective bargaining agreements. In this decision it is not necessary to determine the precise basis for the wages paid Bradley because whether they can be characterized as actual earnings for light-duty work or as a \u201cgratuity,\u201d compare <em>Bradley\u2019s Case, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 654-656 (1999), his light-duty job was no longer available during the lockout. Not presented in this case is any issue of whether or how Bradley\u2019s disability benefits are to be recalculated upon his return to work after the lockout.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 63, partial incapacity benefits shall be a \u201cweekly compensation equal to sixty percent of the difference between [the employee\u2019s] average weekly wage before the injury and the weekly wage [the employee] is capable of earning after the injury, but not more than seventy-five percent of what such employee would receive if he or she were eligible for total incapacity benefits under section thirty-four.\u201d In this case, the computation, sixty percent of ($1469-$240), yields $737.40, a result that exceeds the amount allowable under \u00a7 34. That amount, known as the State average weekly wage, promulgated annually by the division of employment and training, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(9), and G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 29, and applicable to the date of Bradley\u2019s injury in 1993, is $543.30 (see DIA unnumbered form \u201cMaximum Compensation Rate \u2014 State Average Weekly Wage (SAWW),\u201d Locke, Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act, App. J at 874-875 [Koziol Supp. 2000]). The judge\u2019s award, therefore, could not exceed seventy-five percent of that amount, or $407.48. Application of the credit for unemployment benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36B(2) \u2014 $347 \u25a0\u2014 reduces the employer\u2019s payment of partial disability benefits to $60.48 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In light of our decision, we reject the employer\u2019s request that we reverse the board\u2019s denial of its claim for costs pursuant to G.
