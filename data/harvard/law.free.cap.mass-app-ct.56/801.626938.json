L. c. 138, \u00a7 18B, to export and sell alcoholic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>beverages to licensees in the Commonwealth. The commission\u2019s order followed its determination that, in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25A, Miller had discriminated in the price of alcoholic beverages it sold to Massachusetts wholesalers, and, in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 2, had sold alcoholic beverages to a Massachusetts merchant lacking the necessary license under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18, to buy them.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The facts of record pertinent to each determined statutory violation are few and undisputed. Miller, a Wisconsin corporation with a beer brewery in North Carolina, holds a certificate of compliance issued by the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, Miller is authorized to export or sell alcoholic beverages to those in Massachusetts duly licensed by the commission to import or buy them. Those in Massachusetts holding a wholesalers\u2019 and importers\u2019 license under \u00a7 18<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may purchase alcoholic beverages from holders of certificates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>compliance under \u00a7 18B (\u00a7 18B certificate holders) such as Miller, while those in Massachusetts holding retailers\u2019 licenses, such as a ship chandler\u2019s license under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 13,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">During November, 1996, Miller sold comparable alcoholic beverages to six Massachusetts wholesalers duly licensed under \u00a7 18. All six received credit terms from Miller; five were provided credit terms of net eleven days (i.e., eleven days within which to pay Miller in full) while one was provided net thirty days. The six wholesalers are not in competition with each other insofar as each distributes Miller products in an exclusive distribution territory in Massachusetts granted it by Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">On five separate occasions from August, 1995, through April, 1997, Miller sold alcoholic beverages to Klausen-Getsby Company, a ship chandler licensed under \u00a7 13 and located in Boston, pursuant to a written contract. Under the terms of that contract, alcoholic beverages sold by Miller to this ship chandler were shipped free on board (F.O.B.) from Miller\u2019s North Carolina brewery, where title passed to the ship chandler. The ship chandler transported the product into Massachusetts \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>delivery to ships sailing from the port(s) of Boston, Massachusetts.\u201d The invoices for these transactions show cash on delivery net terms of payment effected by electronic funds transfers and \u201csold to\u201d and \u201cship to\u201d addresses of the ship chandler at its Boston location. The contract provided, inter alla, that all such sales \u201cshall be for export, used at ships stores or for resale aboard ships after departure from the United States,\u201d and that the ship chandler \u201crepresents and warrants that it will not sell any such beer ... for resale within the United States or Canada.\u201d The ship chandler did not hold a license under \u00a7 18, and was apparently later held accountable by the commission for the aforesaid proscribed purchases it made directly from Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In view of the foregoing, the commission determined that Miller\u2019s extension of different credit terms to Massachusetts wholesalers licensed under \u00a7 18 constituted price discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that Miller\u2019s sales to the Boston ship chandler were in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> insofar as not in compliance with Miller\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 18B. Miller protests that \u00a7 25A does not prohibit \u00a7 18B certificate holders such as itself from extending disparate credit terms to wholesalers licensed under \u00a7 18. As to its sales to the ship chandler, Miller maintains that the statutory scheme set forth in c. 138 has no application to a sale, consummated out-of-State, of alcoholic beverages that are to be sold for consumption, not in Massachusetts, but aboard ships at sea. Even if the statute does apply to such sales, Miller contends, it has no obligation under \u00a7 18B to assure that the ship chandler had all necessary licenses to buy Miller\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>We review the commission\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), to determine whether, as Miller claims, it was based on errors or law, and whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the agency\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Seagram Distillers Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988). While in our review we give due deference to the agency\u2019s expertise, technical competence, specialized knowledge, and discretionary authority in administering the statute, see <em>ibid.', Van Munching Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 309-310 (1996), the ultimate responsibility for interpreting the applicable statutory language nonetheless remains with the courts. <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>371 Mass. 584, 588-589 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>Section 25A: price discrimination. </em>Miller claims that offering disparate credit terms to its wholesalers does not violate \u00a7 25A because such conduct does not constitute price discrimination. This is so, Miller contends, because \u00a7 25A does not mention credit terms; its plain language prohibits only discrimination in price and in discounts, and neither \u201cprice\u201d nor \u201cdiscount\u201d encompasses the concept of credit terms. That the Legislature did not intend \u00a7 25A to include a prohibition against offering disparate credit terms, it argues, is only underscored by G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25, the one section in c. 138 to deal with extensions of credit. Section 25<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> expressly exempts \u00a7 18B certificate holders such as Miller from the limitations it places on credit terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>The commission maintains that the terms of credit that are extended to a buyer can reasonably be viewed as a component of the amount paid by the buyer and received by the seller. While acknowledging that no Massachusetts appellate decision is controlling on this point, it suggests both that the definition of price in <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>371 Mass. at 591 (\u201cthe actual amount paid to the supplier for goods furnished to the buyer\u201d), does not preclude this view and that decisions construing Federal antitrust statutes may be instructive in this regard. We agree both that <em>M.H. Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., supra, </em>is not dispositive and that \u201c[i]t is virtually self-evident that extending interest-free credit for a period of time is equivalent to giving a discount equal to the value of the use of the purchase price for that period of time. Thus, credit terms must be characterized as an inseparable part of the price.\u201d <em>Catalano, Inc. </em>v. <em>Target Sales, Inc., </em>446 U.S. 643, 648 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">That credit terms may reasonably be viewed as a component of price is not, however, the end of the matter. Questions remain, first, as to whether the act of offering disparate credit terms, without more (i.e., irrespective of the magnitude or nature of such differences, the business factors considered in offering the terms, whether the same standards of credit worthiness were extended to all applicants, whether the applicants were in competition with each other, and whether there was impact upon competition), may itself constitute discrimination under \u00a7 25A; and, second, as to whether the Legislature intended \u00a7 25 to be the exclusive means of regulating extensions of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">As to the former, we appreciate that the six wholesalers were not competitors, at least vis-a-vis Miller products, and that the record is silent as to Miller\u2019s reasons for offering disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>credit terms, what factors it considered, and what if any financial impact the different credit terms extended may have had. While such matters are of undoubted import in determining whether price discrimination in violation of Federal antitrust laws has occurred, see, e.g., <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Sun Oil Co., </em>515 F.2d 221, 224 (10th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 829 (1976); <em>Thomas J. Kline, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lorillard, Inc., </em>878 F.2d 791, 795-796 (4th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1073 (1990); <em>Carlo C. Gelardi Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller Brewing Co., </em>502 F. Supp. 637, 646-648 (D.N.J. 1980); <em>Whirlpool Corp. </em>v. <em>U.M.C.O. Intl. Corp., </em>748 F. Supp. 1557, 1566 (S.D. Fla. 1990), we are not persuaded of their significance when determining whether price discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25A, has occurred. When enacting \u00a7 25A in 1946, the Legislature made plain its purpose in the emergency preamble to the legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">\u201cWhereas, the practice of manufacturers and wholesalers in granting discounts, rebates, allowances, free goods and other inducements to favored licensees contributes to a disorderly distribution of alcoholic beverages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">\u201cWhereas, the deferred operation of this act would delay the proper regulation thereunder of the alcoholic beverage industry and be contrary to the interests of temperance, therefore this act is hereby declared to be an emergency law necessary for the immediate preservation of the public convenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">St. 1946, c. 304. From its inception, then, \u00a7 25A has been firmly tethered to the goal of protecting the public through the strict regulation of the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages; it was not enacted as an antitrust measure. Given the articulated purpose of eliminating differential treatment of \u201cfavored licensees,\u201d \u00a7 25A can reasonably be construed as prohibiting even seemingly minor discrepancies in prices offered by suppliers licensed under \u00a7 18B to their wholesalers. The different credit terms offered by Miller to one of its six Massachusetts wholesalers fall within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">The remaining concern is whether the Legislature intended \u00a7 25 to be the exclusive means for regulating credit terms, such that, if so, credit terms must not be read into the term \u201cprice\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 25A.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>To be sure, \u00a7 25 regulates the activities of licensees with respect to credit terms and expressly exempts \u00a7 18B certificate holders from its purview. So, for example, a wholesaler-licensee under \u00a7 18, while not required to extend credit to any retailer licensed under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, may extend credit if it wishes to do so, but only in the ordinary course of business and for no more than sixty days. It is by no means clear to us, however, that a wholesaler thus constrained by \u00a7 25 is nonetheless free to offer different credit terms to different retailers \u2014 e.g., sixty days for some, forty-five days for others, ten for yet others, etc. \u2014 without running afoul of \u00a7 25A. Otherwise put, we are not persuaded that \u00a7 25 and \u00a7 25A are mutually exclusive, that \u00a7 18B certificate holders such as Miller are, by virtue of their exemption from the strictures placed on credit terms by \u00a7 25, thereby also exempt from the prohibition on price discrimination set forth in \u00a7 25A, or that \u00a7 18B certificate holders are permitted to discriminate in the otherwise unrestricted credit terms they may offer to those to whom they are permitted to sell alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In view of the foregoing, we discern no basis for disturbing the commission\u2019s determination that Miller violated \u00a7 25A by offering one of its six wholesalers better credit terms than it did the other five.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><em>Sections 2 and 18B: sale to an unlicensed entity. </em>Miller contends that its sales to the Boston ship chandler are not within the scope of G. L. c. 138 because all such sales were consummated outside of Massachusetts and because the alcoholic beverages sold to the ship chandler were not to be consumed in Massachusetts. In Miller\u2019s view, the product was, in effect, just passing through Massachusetts on its way out to sea. To the extent that c. 138 is seen as applicable, however, Miller argues that it may not be held responsible in any event for the ship chandler\u2019s failure to procure the necessary licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Miller\u2019s contentions are best scrutinized after recourse to certain fundamentals about how the market for alcoholic beverages in Massachusetts is regulated. The \u201c[rjegulation of the liquor industry in Massachusetts is comprehensive and pervasive.\u2019\u2019 <em>Cellarmaster Wines of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27 (1989). \u201cMas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>sachusetts law requires that alcohol products sold in this State by manufacturers or suppliers be sold initially to licensed Massachusetts wholesalers. Those wholesalers in turn sell to retailers who sell to consumers. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 15, 18, 18B, 19.\u201d <em>Heublein, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capital Distrib. Co., </em>434 Mass. 698, 699 (2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">\u201cConsumers may purchase alcoholic beverages to be drunk off the premises only from duly licensed retailers. [G. L.] c. 138, \u00a7 15 (1991). Package stores so licensed under the statute may, in turn, purchase alcoholic beverages for resale from only those wholesalers who are duly licensed pursuant to [sjection 18 of the same chapter. . . . Moreover, wholesalers licensed under [s]ection 18 may sell alcoholic beverages only to licensed retailers, and may purchase such beverages only from manufacturers who are licensed under the statute or who are holders of a [certificate of [c]ompliance issued by the Alcoholic Beverage[s] Control Commission. . . . This certificate allows out-of-[S]tote licensees to export alcoholic beverages to Massachusetts and sell such beverages to duly licensed wholesalers. [G. L.] c. 138, \u00a7 18B (1991). Under this tight regulatory scheme, consumers cannot purchase alcoholic beverages directly from wholesalers or manufacturers and, in turn, wholesalers and manufacturers cannot sell alcoholic beverages directly to consumers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-8\"><em>Wine &amp; Spirits Wholesalers of Massachusetts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Net Contents, Inc., </em>10 F. Supp. 2d 84, 85 (D. Mass. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Pursuant to this multi-tiered \u201ctight regulatory scheme,\u201d the beer manufacturer Miller is an out-of-State licensee who may export and sell its product only to duly licensed Massachusetts wholesalers. It may not sell directly to Massachusetts retailers or consumers. The ship chandler, while eligible to hold a \u00a7 18 wholesalers\u2019 and importers\u2019 license, did not procure such a license and was licensed only as a retailer under \u00a7 13. The ship chandler, in other words, was not permitted by its limited license to buy directly from Miller, and Miller was not permitted by its \u00a7 18B certificate to sell directly to that ship chandler. Miller\u2019s contention that the subject sales somehow fall outside the purview of this comprehensive statutory framework <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>because, on the one hand, the sales were consummated out-of-State and, on the other, the product sold was intended for ultimate resale and consumption outside of Massachusetts aboard ships at sea, lands well wide of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The ship chandler is a retail merchant located and doing business in Boston; it is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth, including laws as to the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages. The ship chandler sells its wares squarely within the Commonwealth insofar as it sells to those operating their vessels out of Massachusetts ports; to the extent that those wares are alcoholic beverages, the ship chandler may purchase and sell only as its license permits. That the product so purchased within Massachusetts may then be resold and consumed aboard those vessels at sea is immaterial to the matter before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In like manner, we think nothing turns on the fact that Miller\u2019s sales to the ship chandler were F.O.B. the North Carolina brewery, where title is said to have passed to the ship chandler. We see nothing of consequence in such a business arrangement, providing as it does for formal transfer of goods outside the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Were it otherwise, the mere employment of logistics such as this \u2014 as easily employed in sales to wholesalers licensed under \u00a7 18 and retailers licensed under \u00a7 15 as to ship chandlers licensed under \u00a7 13 \u2014 would enable out-of-State \u00a7 18B certificate holders to sell alcoholic beverages to Massachusetts merchants free of Massachusetts regulation. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>would introduce a Trojan horse into the statutory scheme. We reject this, mindful that the statute has among its purposes \u201censuring] the necessary control of traffic in alcoholic beverages for the preservation of the public peace and order.\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Finally, Miller argues that even if the statutory scheme is applicable, as we hold it is, Miller ought not be penalized for the ship chandler\u2019s failure to procure a proper license under \u00a7 18. Unlike <em>BAA Massachusetts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 844-845 (2000), upon which Miller relies, where a \u00a7 18B certificate holder was held not to be liable for failing to determine whether its hired carrier held a permit under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 22, because nothing in \u00a7 18B established such a duty, this case involves a situation as to which \u00a7 18B does impose a duty upon the certificate holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Section 18B provides that a certificate holder may sell or export alcoholic beverages only to licensees. Otherwise put, it may not sell to whomever it pleases and, accordingly, may not turn a blind eye to the matter but must instead ascertain that it is selling to duly licensed purchasers. The statutes and regulations governing ship chandlers are plain and readily available to those doing business with such merchants. Under the familiar multi-tiered regulatory framework, Miller was undoubtedly on notice that it could not make sales directly to Massachusetts retailers and that only a ship chandler licensed under \u00a7 18 could purchase directly from Miller. In the circumstances, we discern no error in the commission\u2019s determination that \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 18B prohibit Miller\u2019s sales to one who fails to hold the necessary license to purchase from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Section 18B provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">\u201cThe commission shall issue a certificate of compliance to a licensee having a place of business located, and a license granted, outside the commonwealth and whose license authorizes the exportation or sale of alcoholic beverages to licensees in this commonwealth; provided, that such certificate shall be issued upon the condition that the holder shall furnish from time to time as the commission may require, but in no event more often than once each month, information concerning all shipments or sales of alcoholic beverages made by him to licensees in this commonwealth, and that he comply with the provisions of this chapter and any rules or regulations made under authority contained therein which pertain to a licensee of the same class, type or character, doing business in this commonwealth under a license issued by the commission.

The Attorney General concluded that the non-Massachusetts recipient did not require a license under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18. Opinion of the Attorney General, Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 42-44 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Notably, \u00a7 18 contemplates that licensees under that section will \u201cimport\u201d from \u00a7 18B certificate holders, whose licensed premises are by definition located in other States. It is implicit in the concept of importation that the transfer of goods to the Massachusetts importer-wholesaler may occur outside of Massachusetts for transport to and sale within the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
