He filed a charge with the Labor Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Commission (commission) contending that the BWSC\u2019s actions were taken in retaliation for his involvement in protected activity, in violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(1), (2) and (3). The commission investigated, issued a complaint of prohibited practice, and referred the matter to a hearing officer. After a five-day hearing, the hearing officer issued recommended findings of fact that were favorable to Fowler; however, even though the commission largely adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings, it ultimately determined that Fowler had failed to prove an essential element of his case: that BWSC senior staff knew that Fowler was engaged in union activity. The commission therefore dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Fowler appeals from the commission\u2019s decision, contending that the commission misapplied the law by requiring him to prove employer knowledge by \u201cdirect evidence\u201d and by failing to consider circumstantial proof on this issue, including evidence that the BWSC\u2019s asserted reasons for its adverse actions were a pretext. He also argues that the hearing officer\u2019s recommended findings of fact included a finding of employer knowledge and that the commission failed to explain its rejection of that finding as required by the State administrative procedure act. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8). We agree that the commission\u2019s decision was based on an erroneous view of the law and remand the case for consideration under the proper legal framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Although appellate review of the commission\u2019s findings is limited to an examination of the record to ascertain if the findings are supported by substantial evidence, we review the legal standards employed by the commission for error of law without deference to its decision. See, e.g., <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fedn. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>410 Mass. 890, 892 (1991); <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 327, 328-329 (1996). We begin by reiterating the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination based on protected activities before addressing the specific issues presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In a protected activities case, the charging party must produce evidence to support the conclusion that (1) the employee engaged in concerted activity as defined by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 2; (2) the employer knew of this activity; (3) the employer took adverse action against the employee; and (4) the adverse action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>motivated by the employer\u2019s desire to penalize or discourage the protected activity. <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., supra </em>at 329 &amp; n.5. In this case, it was not disputed that Fowler\u2019s union organizing activities, which began in January, 1996, constituted protected concerted activity; nor was it disputed that thereafter the BWSC took adverse action against Fowler by demoting him from deputy superintendent of sewer operations to safety manager in July, 1996, and terminating his employment in October, 1996. The only issues in contention were employer knowledge and motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">With respect to employer knowledge, Fowler took the position that his organizing activities were conducted publicly and must have been known to the BWSC\u2019s executive director, Vincent Mannering, if not from Mannering\u2019s own observations or his discussions with other members of the senior staff,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then through information received from Mannering\u2019s longtime personal friend, Joseph Crossen. Crossen was a BWSC safety engineer who, in mid-1996, became a deputy superintendent of water and sewer with direct oversight over Fowler after his demotion to safety manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As elaborated in the margin, the commission made findings to the effect that Crossen served as a conduit of information to Mannering,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Crossen and others close to Mannering, such as chief of staff Jay Porter, knew that union activities were afoot,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Crossen closely supervised Fowler,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Fowler\u2019s union activities were open and well-known in the workplace.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commission also concluded, as had the hearing officer, that Mannering and Crossen were not credible when they denied knowing of Fowler\u2019s role in the campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Nevertheless, the commission declined to infer that Manner-ing and Crossen knew of Fowler\u2019s union organizing, observing that there was no direct evidence that Crossen knew of Fowler\u2019s involvement in the organizing drive, and that no inference of employer knowledge could arise merely from disbelief of Man-nering\u2019s and Crossen\u2019s testimony. The commission explained that \u201c[i]f Crossen\u2019s knowledge of Fowler\u2019s activity was proven by direct evidence, we could infer that he shared his knowledge of Fowler\u2019s role in the organizing drive by the fact that he told Porter that the employees were organizing a union.\u201d However, absent such direct evidence, the commission assumed that it could not infer that Crossen possessed knowledge of Fowler\u2019s role. This assumption led the commission to conclude that it would be \u201cmere suspicion or speculation\u201d to find employer knowledge on the record before it. It therefore dismissed the complaint on that basis, without considering the remaining element of Fowler\u2019s prima facie case \u2014 employer motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Fowler does not disagree that, without more, disbelief of Mannering and Crossen did not establish the opposite of their testimony. See, e.g., <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 38 &amp; n.4 (1997); <em>Hopping </em>v. <em>Whirlaway, Inc., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 126 (1994); <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 224 (1992). His quarrel is with the commission\u2019s assumption that he needed to introduce direct evidence that Crossen knew of his union activity as a legal predicate to a finding of employer knowledge. We agree with Fowler that the commission was mistaken on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\">In cases arising under G. L. c. 150E, we may look for guidance, as did the commission, to Federal decisions applying the parallel provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq. (1994). See <em>Service Employees Intl. Union, Local 509 </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>431 Mass. 710, 713-714 (2000); <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 402, 405 (1984). Cases decided under the NLRA establish, as a general principle, that employer knowledge of employee union activities may be found from circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable inference of knowledge may be drawn. See, e.g., <em>FPC Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB., </em>64 F.3d 935, 943 (4th Cir. 1995); <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>316 N.L.R.B. 1248, 1253 (1995), enforced, 97 F.3d 1448 (4th Cir. 1996); <em>Regional Home Care, Inc., </em>329 N.L.R.B. 85, 85-86 (1999). An inference of knowledge may be \u201cbased on such circumstantial evidence as the timing of the alleged discriminatory actions; the [employer\u2019s] general knowledge of its employees\u2019 union activities; the [employer\u2019s] animus against the Union; and the pretextual reasons given for the adverse personnel actions.\u201d <em>Regional Home Care, Inc., supra </em>at 85-86. Each case is fact specific. Thus, for example, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has inferred that an employer knew of a discharged employee\u2019s union activities from a totality of circumstances that included evidence of the employer\u2019s general knowledge of union organizing and the employee\u2019s overt participation in union- activities. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., supra </em>at 1253.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Notwithstanding this authority, the commission declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>infer employer knowledge in reliance upon <em>The American League, </em>189 N.L.R.B. 541 (1971) \u2014 a case that the commission understood as requiring direct proof to establish an informant\u2019s knowledge that the complaining employee had engaged in union activity. <em>The American League </em>case arose from the termination, toward the end of the 1968 baseball season, of two American League umpires who were attempting to organize their cohorts to join an association previously established by National League umpires. Before their termination, the fired umpires had discussed this idea with other American League umpires and had met with a lawyer and with the National League association. Although these discussions were not entirely clandestine, the two organizers had attempted to keep knowledge of their efforts from League officials, and there was no evidence that any of those contacted had told management that organizing activity was taking place, much less that the fired umpires were behind it. Indeed, none of the numerous American League umpires who appeared as witnesses in the case testified that they had mentioned the organizing activities to League officials. On these facts, the hearing officer and the NLRB declined to infer employer knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Viewed in its factual context, <em>The American League </em>at most illustrates that employer knowledge need not be inferred when there is no direct evidence that anyone has reported union activity to the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 549. However, it does not stand for the extended proposition that direct proof must always be introduced to establish an informant\u2019s knowledge that the complaining employee was engaged in union activity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In the case at hand, the facts as found by the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>were considerably stronger on the issue of employer knowledge than the facts in <em>The American League. </em>The commission adopted the hearing officer\u2019s finding, based on Crossen\u2019s own testimony, that Crossen received union organizing information in June, 1996, and immediately shared it with Porter, who, in turn, relayed it to Mannering. Thus, there was direct proof that management had been told by an informant that employees were engaging in union activity. As to whether Crossen knew of Fowler\u2019s involvement with the organizing campaign and shared that information with senior staff, direct evidence was not required, and the commission was free to draw that inference from other findings, adopted from those of the hearing officer, establishing Crossen\u2019s close supervision of Fowler, Fowler\u2019s openness in conducting the organizing drive, and Crossen\u2019s role as a conduit of information to Porter and Mannering. Drawing an inference from these facts would rest upon affirmative evidence and would not be predicated solely on disbelief of Mannering and Crossen. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Joseph Antell, Inc., </em>358 F.2d 880, 883 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The commission also was entitled to consider whether the reasons advanced by the BWSC for demoting and terminating Fowler were a pretext<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, if so, to take that into account as an additional factor in deciding whether to infer employer knowledge. Although, by itself, \u201cthe unconvincing character of the employer\u2019s professed reasons for acting against an employee [does not] supply the otherwise missing proof of knowledge,\u201d <em>Tomateck, Inc., </em>333 N.L.R.B. No. 156, slip op. at 76-77 (May 8, 2001), it is well-established that pretext may be considered as part of the totality of circumstances from which employer knowledge may be inferred. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Joseph Antell, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>supra </em>at 883; <em>Montgomery Ward, supra </em>at 1253; <em>Regional Home Care, Inc., supra </em>at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In view of our decision, we need not dwell on Fowler\u2019s claim that the commission ran afoul of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), by failing to give an adequate explanation for rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s statement that \u201cCrossen knew of Fowler\u2019s involvement\u201d with the union. See <em>Vinal </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 92 (1982); <em>Noone </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 764 &amp; n.13 (1993). Although the statement was made in passing, we agree with Fowler that this was an implicit, if not explicit, finding that went beyond simply discrediting Mannering and Crossen, and that the commission rejected the finding. Nevertheless, we detect no c. 30A violation, because the commission adequately explained itself by opining that, on its view of the law, the evidence supporting such a finding was insufficient. The problem was not that the commission failed to give an explanation; it was that the explanation was based on an incorrect view of the law. On remand, it will be open to the commission to reassess its rejection of the hearing officer\u2019s finding in light of the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The commission\u2019s decision is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">There was direct evidence, and the commission found, that Fowler\u2019s role in the organizing campaign came to the attention of BWSC general counsel Henry Luthin; but because there was no proof (and no finding by the hearing officer) that Luthin met with Mannering between the time that Luthin obtained this information and the time that Fowler was terminated, the commission declined to infer employer knowledge from this evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Mannering had asked his friend Crossen to relay his observations about the operations department so that Mannering would not be relying upon \u201csanitized information.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Crossen was among those who were sent a letter from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 25 (teamsters), in June, 1996, soliciting their involvement in the union. He immediately shared the letter with Porter, who relayed it to Mannering. Others close to senior staff, including Mannering\u2019s own administrative assistant, also received this letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Fowler reported directly to Crossen. Crossen kept close track of Fowler\u2019s performance and regularly met with Fowler to go over his work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Between January and April, 1996, Fowler and the other principal organizer in the campaign, Deacon Perrotta, met with numerous mid-level managers to inform them of the organizing drive and ascertain their level of interest in becoming unionized. In April or May, 1996, when the teamsters indicated an interest in representing the potential bargaining unit, Fowler and Perrotta began campaigning specifically for the teamsters by first meeting with managers individually and later by holding small group meetings. Fowler met with over fifty managers individually and had fifteen to twenty small group meetings. These overtures took place on BWSC property, including the building where Mannering had his office. Fowler and Perrotta also held a large meeting at the South Bay Hotel in Boston, which was attended by seventeen managers and six or seven teamsters officials. At that meeting, Fowler sat in the front of the room and fielded questions from the managers and the teamsters officials. Later, Fowler and Perrotta distributed union authorization cards to employees at work. They also compiled the list used by the teamsters to send a letter and authorization cards to sixty-seven managers in the potential bargaining unit, including Crossen and Mannering\u2019s administrative assistants, although Fowler\u2019s name did not appear in this correspondence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">An inference of employer knowledge may also be drawn pursuant to the so-called \u201csmall plant doctrine,\u201d where the size of the plant, as well as other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>considerations, make it likely that the employer observed the employee\u2019s union activity. See <em>United L-N </em>Glass, 297 N.L.R.B. 329 (1989). Here, the commission determined that the facts did not support the application of the small plant doctrine. As Fowler does not challenge that determination on appeal, we do not consider whether it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The same is true of <em>Synergy Gas Corp., </em>290 N.L.R.B. 1098, 1101 (1988), also relied upon by the commission. In that case, the discharged employee claimed that employer knowledge could be inferred because two members of management had sons who worked with the employee, and the sons may have reported his activities to their parents. The claim was rejected because there was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to establish the likelihood that either of the sons would have made such a communication. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>employee\u2019s union activities were not \u201cintensive\u201d and were not likely to have been observed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The BWSC claimed that Fowler was demoted and discharged because of over-all poor performance and his responsibility for the failure of a pumping station during a severe rainstorm in September, 1996. However, the commission found that Fowler received positive evaluations for many years up until he began his union activities; that Fowler was not given any negative performance evaluations, warnings or other counseling about alleged deficiencies in his performance in 1996; and that the BWSC did not consider Fowler responsible for the pumping station mishap.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
