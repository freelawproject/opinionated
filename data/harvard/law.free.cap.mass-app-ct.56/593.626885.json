The circumstances were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">For the first quarter of 1989, the taxpayer filed a timely return reporting a total payroll tax owed for the period (including a prior quarter adjustment) of $9,525.17, previous payments of $450.51, and a balance due of $9,074.66. This was not paid with the return; and if normal procedures had been followed, the Department of Revenue in due course \u2014 usually one or two months \u2014 would have sent the taxpayer a notice of assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>for the unpaid balance, together with interest computed to a new due date and a penalty for the delinquency. The return was lost, however, and nothing more happened until, almost six years later, in early 1995, the department sent a notice advising the taxpayer that according to departmental records the taxpayer had failed to file a return for the period. In response, the taxpayer produced a date-stamped copy of its 1989 first quarter return. On July 11, 1995, the department issued its long-delayed notice of assessment, totaling $24,117.04, a sum that included $10,505.00 in interest and $4,537.34 in penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The taxpayer then sought to correct its return for the period, claiming it had mistakenly shown on the return $3,669.54 that belonged to another payroll period. The commissioner accepted the contention, abated $3,669.54 of the tax reported as due, and issued a new notice of assessment recalculating interest and penalties based on the reduced delinquency of $5,405.12. Further discussion led the commissioner a year later (on November 6, 1996) to abate the assessed penalties in full. The taxpayer then filed an application for abatement of the assessed interest, which had now mounted to $8,115.12, on the ground that the delay in payment was as much the department\u2019s fault as the taxpayer\u2019s; but the application was denied, the department taking the position that G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 32, required daily computation of interest on taxes not paid when due and that the commissioner lacked discretion to abate interest unless the underlying tax were abated. The board in effect agreed with this position when it allowed the department\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal; and such authority as we have found seems to agree with the general principle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., </em>414 Mass. 489, 494-495 (1993) (\u201cA taxpayer is entitled to an abatement . . . only if \u2018the tax is excessive in amount or illegal.\u2019 G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37 [1990 ed.]. . . . Equitable considerations, not prescribed by statute, are not major players in tax matters\u201d); <em>Tambrands, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 522, 525 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Of greater concern is the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the department\u2019s right to collect the unpaid tax liability had terminated under the statute of limitations because the statutory time for collection, six years, had passed prior to the time when the department sent its notice of assessment on July 11, 1995. The statute of limitations in question is G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 65, which, as amended by St. 1986, c. 488, \u00a7 53, provides that \u201c[t]axes shall be collected within six years after the assessment of the tax, or prior to the expiration of any period of collection agreed upon in writing by the commissioner and the taxpayer before the expiration of such six-year period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Absent evidence of an agreement within the relevant period, the focus of the statute is on the time of the \u201cassessment of the tax.\u201d The taxpayer, relying on G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argues that the tax was assessed for purposes of \u00a7 65 when it filed its return; the department, relying on its regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argues that the date of the assessment was neither the date of filing the return (April 30, 1989) nor the date it issued the first notice of assessment (July 11, 1995), but rather a date appearing as an entry in the department\u2019s internal records assigning March 22, 1995, as the date the commissioner made the verified determination of the amount the taxpayer owed for the first quarter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>1989.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The flaw in the taxpayer\u2019s argument, according to the department, is a failure to recognize the distinction between the \u201cassessment,\u201d as used in \u00a7 65, and the \u201cdeemed assessment\u201d referred to in \u00a7 26(a); the limitations period of \u00a7 65 begins to run, according to the department, not when a return is filed, but only when the commissioner has verified the return and entered a determination of the tax in the departmental records. The department cites <em>Heritage Bank for Sav. </em>v. Doran, 399 Mass. 855, 860 (1987), but that decision does not support the department\u2019s argument. The <em>Heritage Bank </em>decision concerned the date of assessment, not against the property of the corporate taxpayer, which would normally sign the tax return (and hence be \u201cself-assessed\u201d under \u00a7 26[a]), but against the property of certain corporate officers whose liability to pay the taxes the corporation should have paid arose under G. L. c. 62B, \u00a7 5, and G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 31 A. Under the latter section, the decision held, the corporate officers were deemed \u201cassessed\u201d (and hence <em>their </em>property was made subject to a lien)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the thirtieth day following notification from the commissioner to the officers that his assessment against the corporation remained unpaid and that he intended to seek payment from them personally. <em>Heritage Bank for Sav. </em>v. <em>Doran, supra </em>at 861. Nor does our decision in <em>Tambrands, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., supra, </em>support the department\u2019s position. The <em>Tambrands </em>decision did not concern the assessment date for the amount shown as due on the taxpayer\u2019s timely-filed return \u2014 that amount was paid with the return \u2014 but rather the assessment date for the <em>additional </em>amount found by the commissioner to be due when he audited the return. Thus, the cases the department cites do not support its contention that the amount shown as due upon the return is not assessed on filing. Moreover, the department suggests no alternative reading for the words \u201cdeemed assessed\u201d in \u00a7 26(a). We see no reason not to take \u00a7 26(a) at its word.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The relevance of the \u201cdeemed assessment\u201d (i.e., the self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>assessment arising from the filing of a tax return) is reinforced by comparing \u00a7 65 (six-year limit for collection) with \u00a7 50(a) (six-year lien for unpaid taxes). The lien on the taxpayer\u2019s property, according to \u00a7 50(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cshall arise at the time the assessment is made or <em>deemed to be made </em>and shall continue until the liability for the amount assessed or <em>deemed to be assessed </em>is satisfied. Said lien shall in any event terminate not later than six years from the date it was created.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 50(a), inserted by St. 1976, c. 415, \u00a7 22 (emphasis supplied). The tax shown as due on a tax return is, under \u00a7 26(a), \u201cdeemed to be assessed\u201d at the time the return is filed. The lien on the taxpayer\u2019s property for taxes not paid with the return arises under \u00a7 50(a) at the same time and expires six years from that time. The lien is the commissioner\u2019s vehicle for collection, and it would make little sense to rule that the six-year period the commissioner is given by \u00a7 65 to collect the tax (\u201cshall be collected within six years after the assessment of the tax\u201d) refers to some different six-year period. Sections 50(a) and 65 are meant to be read together.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The filing of the taxpayer\u2019s return on April 30, 1989, showing $9,074.66 ($9,525.17 less $450.51 paid) as the tax due thus began the running of the six-year limitations period for collection of that amount. All that occurred within that period was the department\u2019s March 22, 1995, entry of that amount in its record of assessments, together with interest and penalties computed to that time. To rule that the entry by the department began the statute of limitations running afresh would in effect vitiate the limitations statute. It follows that, on July 11, 1995, when the commissioner sent the notice of assessment to the taxpayer, the tax was uncollectible.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The department argues, however, that even if the taxpayer should succeed in showing that collection was time-barred, it is not entitled to the requested abatement. The department points to the fact that the taxpayer, while contesting its obligation to pay accrued interest on the underlying tax, agreed voluntarily to pay the tax itself and did so by two payments on June 24 and August 19, 1997. The voluntary payment, argues the department, under established statute of limitations principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>constituted an acknowledgment of the debt that had the automatic legal effect of waiving the protection of the statute, with the result that the entire debt, including the accrued interest, became again collectible. The department cites <em>Wenz </em>v. <em>Wenz, </em>222 Mass. 314, 321-322 (1916), and <em>Our Lady of the Sea Corp. </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 484, 490-492 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The rule of acknowledgment by partial payment, however, does not operate quite so flatfootedly. In the decisions relied on by the department, the partial payments of the debtors acknowledged in effect that the entire debt was presently due and owed. Here, in contrast, the taxpayer paid the tax in recognition of a moral obligation, whether enforceable or not, but consistently denied any obligation to pay the interest. The rule in such cases is that stated in the early leading case of <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>2 Pick. 368, 374, 377 (1824): \u201cthat the case is to be taken out of the statute, if the defendant has within six years made an unqualified acknowledgment of an existing debt. . . , [but that] acknowledgment must go to the fact, that the debt is still due [emphasis omitted].\u201d Such is the case where \u201cthe original cause of action is acknowledged, but qualified in such manner, as that it is doing great violence to the language to construe it into an acknowledgment of existing indebtment, or into a promise to pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375-376. To the same effect, see <em>Gillingham </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>178 Mass. 417, 421 (1901); Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 9.6, 9.8 (rev. ed. 1996). The taxpayer\u2019s agreement to pay (and payment of) the underlying tax, at the same time denying any present legal obligation to pay either it or the interest, did not constitute a waiver of the statute\u2019s protection with respect to the interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows that the interest portion of the debt remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>subject to the statute\u2019s bar to collection, and that the taxpayer was entitled to the abatement it sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-5\">As to the department\u2019s unwavering position on this point, see <em>Blue Jay Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>16 Mass.
