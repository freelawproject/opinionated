On December 4, an accidental fire destroyed the structure as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>existed on that date. The day after the fire, Lodge sent Assurance a reporting form stating that construction at the site had begun in November. Assurance took the position that construction began in October, when the foundation was poured, and denied Lodge\u2019s claim. Lodge then brought an action for breach of contract and violations of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D. On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge concluded that cement was a \u201cbuilding material\u201d and ordered entry of judgment in Assurance\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">1. <em>The controversy. </em>Lodge is a construction company that builds about fifty single-family houses a year. Its president, Andrew Lane, had been in the home construction business since 1958. Over the years, Lane had constructed or supervised the construction of some 13,000 houses. Since 1967 or 1968, he had purchased builder\u2019s risk insurance for his construction projects through one insurance agency. That agency periodically reviewed the cost of the policies for Lodge and, from time to time, recommended that he change insurers in order to obtain the best coverage at the lowest cost. It was upon the advice of the agency that Lodge, in early 1994, obtained a builder\u2019s risk policy from Assurance. This new policy took effect on March 2, 1994, and insured each of Lodge\u2019s structures under construction up to $1,000,000 against damage or fire loss. The provisions of the policy here controlling, sections E.4(a) &amp; (b), provide in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">\u201ca. By the last day of each month you will report to us the total estimated completed value of all buildings in your inventory during the previous month. Inventory includes buildings you started as well as previously reported buildings. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cThe starting date for the purpose of this report is the date when you first put the <em>building materials </em>on the construction site (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cb. If, at the time of a <em>loss </em>you have not reported a build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ing as required in this provision, we do not cover that building for that <em>loss\u201d </em>(emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">As can be seen from the terms of the policy, Lodge was required to report by the last day of each month the total estimated completed value of all structures started during the previous month. This reporting method gave Lodge a grace period during which it could add a new construction site and receive retroactive coverage so long as Lodge reported the site by the end of the <em>next </em>calendar month after the starting date of construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As provided by the policy, the \u201cstarting date\u201d turns upon the date when \u201cbuilding materials\u201d were first put upon the site. The policy, however, does not define the term \u201cbuilding materials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It is Lodge\u2019s position that as used in section E.4(a), the term \u201cbuilding materials\u201d is ambiguous and can reasonably be construed to mean lumber and other flammable components used to construct a building above the level of the lowest basement floor. The question before us is whether, as matter of law and as Assurance argues, the policy is unambiguous and enforceable in accordance with its terms, see <em>Seaco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bar-bosa, </em>435 Mass. 772, 779 (2002), and cases therein cited, or whether Lodge was entitled to summary judgment because, as explained in <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 281 (1997), quoting from <em>Trustees of Tufts Univ. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>415 Mass. 844, 849 (1993), \u201c[wjhere . . . there is more than one rational interpretation of policy language, \u2018the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 462, 466 (1995); <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">2. <em>The resolution. </em>In construing the terms of a policy, we consider the common and technical understanding of the words as well as the conduct of the parties in light of all the circumstances. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 (1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIf there is no ambiguity, we \u2018construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. at 381, quoting from <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We look first to the common understanding of the term \u201cbuilding materials.\u201d As defined in Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1392 (1993), the word \u201cmaterial,\u201d when used as a noun, means \u201cthe basic matter (as metal, wood, plastic, fiber) from which the whole or the greater part of something physical (as a machine, tool, <em>building, </em>fabric) is made\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>Wellesley </em>v. <em>Brossi, </em>340 Mass. 456, 457 (1960) (sand, rock, cement blocks, brick, and wood or \u201cother building materials\u201d); <em>DiMaggio </em>v. <em>Mystic Bldg. Wrecking Co., </em>340 Mass. 686, 689 (1960) (heavy lumber). Cf. <em>Mutual Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>173 S.W.2d 494, 497-498 (Tex. App. 1943) (hand-tools not within statutory comprehension of term \u201cbuilding materials\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Lodge does not argue that the term \u201cbuilding materials,\u201d standing alone, is <em>limited </em>to wooden framing materials.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor does it make any real argument that the term in question becomes ambiguous when read in the context of the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. at 466-467 (\u201cwords, which are clear by themselves, may become ambiguous when read in the context of an insurance policy\u201d). Instead, it argues that the circumstances of the execution of the insurance policy demonstrate the ambiguity. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 comment b (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"av9-dedup-0\">There are two circumstances which Lodge argues we must consider. First, there is Assurance\u2019s brochure in which it is expressly noted and emphasized that <em>\u201c[o]nce material which will be part of the completed structure is delivered to the construction site (including foundation), it is considered a start.\u201d </em>Lodge cites the brochure as proof of Assurance\u2019s recognition that the term \u201cbuilding materials,\u201d as used in the policy itself, reasonably could be construed to mean wooden framing materi-ais only.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, there is an affidavit from Lodge\u2019s insurance adjuster in which he states that insurance programs provided under other builder\u2019s risks policies allowed policyholders to report building starts no later than the date that construction began above the level of the lowest basement floor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>nothing in these circumstances which show that the term \u201cbuilding materials\u201d is susceptible of more than one meaning and is, therefore, ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Even assuming that Lodge did not receive the brochure prior to the date of the policy (see note 8, <em>supra), </em>the brochure does no more than recite, rather than contradict or expand upon, the common understanding of the words \u201cbuilding materials.\u201d The brochure, at most, supports Lodge\u2019s disagreement with Assurance\u2019s interpretation of the policy. \u201c[A]n ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other.\u201d <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. at 466, and cases therein cited. See note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Further, Lodge\u2019s claim of ambiguity in the terms of the policy gains no support from the insurance adjuster\u2019s affidavit, in which he recites the trade meaning of the term \u201cbuilding materials.\u201d See <em>Somerset Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 422, 427-428 (1995), repeating the rule of contract interpretation that express terms have preference over custom and usage. We also note the undisputed facts that, over the years and upon the advice of its insurance agent, Lodge purchased insurance on the basis of cost. See <em>Save-Mor Supermkts., Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 226 (1971), holding that it is fair to assume that a lesser cost of insurance means lesser coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>It follows from what we have said that we agree with the Superior Court judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the policy clearly provided that the term \u201cbuilding materials\u201d included cement and that, consequently, Lodge\u2019s reporting form was overdue, and that Lodge\u2019s failure to make a timely report resulted in the loss of coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-14\">Guilder\u2019s risk insurance typically indemnifies builders or contractors against the loss of, or damage to, a building under construction. See 1 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 1:53, at 1-77 (3d ed. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\">More specifically, the judge concluded: \u201cConstrued in its plain and ordinary sense, the term \u2018building materials\u2019 is unambiguous; it means material that becomes part of a building. Cement is such a material.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Lodge\u2019s monthly premium was based upon a percentage of the completed construction in relation to the value of the building upon its completion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201c(1) Words and other conduct are interpreted in the light of all the circumstances, and if the principal purpose of the parties is ascertainable it is given great weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201c(2) A writing is interpreted as a whole, and all writings that are part of the same transaction are interpreted together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201c(3) Unless a different intention is manifested,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">\u201c(a) where language has a generally prevailing meaning, it is interpreted in accordance with that meaning;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">\u201c(b) technical terms and words of art are given their technical meaning when used in a transaction within their technical field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u201c(4) Where an agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is given great weight in the interpretation of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u201c(5) Wherever reasonable, the manifestations of intention of the parties to a promise or agreement are interpreted as consistent with each other and with any relevant course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 (1981).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Indeed, both Lodge\u2019s president and controller acknowledged in their depositions that cement is a building material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Ahq2\">Lodge\u2019s simple assertion that the Superior Court judge erred in \u201coverlook[ing] the fundamental rule that words that are clear and unambiguous, by themselves, may be ambiguous when read in the context of the entire insuranee contract\u201d does not rise to the level of appellate argument within the comprehension of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"ahh-dedup-0\">The comment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArU\">\u201cThe meaning of words and other symbols commonly depends on their context; the meaning of other conduct is even more dependent on the circumstances. In interpreting the words and conduct of the parties to a contract, a court seeks to put itself in the position they occupied at the time the contract was made. Wien the parties have adopted a writing as a final expression of their agreement, interpretation is directed to the meaning of that writing in the light of the circumstances. See [Restatement (Second) of Contracts] \u00a7\u00a7 209, 212. The circumstances for this purpose include the entire situation, as it appeared to the parties, and in appropriate cases may include facts known to one party of which the other had reason to know.
