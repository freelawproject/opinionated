The father claims that the parents were denied due process by the trial judge\u2019s order excluding them from the courtroom during their daughters\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mother claims that the parents were denied due process by the court\u2019s failure to hold a so-called seventy-two hour hearing, as directed by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, within the statutorily prescribed time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both parents challenge the findings of fact entered by the trial judge and complain that the department furnished inadequate services in support of reunification before recommending the termination of their parental rights. We affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\"><em>Background. </em>The trial judge entered detailed findings of fact in 215 separately enumerated paragraphs, which we summarize to provide background for the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Roni was born in Taiwan on March 20, 1985. When Roni was between fifteen and seventeen months old, the mother (who was pregnant with Gail at the time) moved to the United States, leaving Roni in the care of the father\u2019s parents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gail was bom in the United States on November 14, 1986, and was sent back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>to live with Roni and the father\u2019s parents. The parents returned to Taiwan in 1989, where they rejoined their daughters. The family remained in Taiwan until 1992, when they moved to California. The family moved to Massachusetts in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The sisters suffered physical and emotional abuse by their parents. Among other incidents, the mother grabbed Roni\u2019s hair, struck her with bamboo shoots, a heavy cardboard tube, and a plastic baseball bat, hit her in the face, and regularly forced her to \u201csquat\u201d (with knees bent and arms in the air) for hours at a time as a form of discipline. The mother called Roni a \u201cpig,\u201d told her she was invisible, and would speak to Roni only through Gail. The mother also abused Gail, though not as severely. While the mother was home, she would not permit the sisters to speak to one another, and would punish them (by requiring them to \u201csquat\u201d) if they did. The father abused the children less frequently, because he was not home as often; he nonetheless found opportunities to beat the children with a wooden rod and a plastic bat, and he was aware of the mother\u2019s abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In October of 1997, the department received a report of abuse following an incident in which the mother struck Roni out of dissatisfaction with the manner in which Roni carried out instructions to deliver bags of apples to various neighbors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A social worker interviewed the sisters and the parents in the home, but the sisters denied abuse. After the social worker left the home, the father threw his food at Roni and told her that he could hit her as much as he wanted to; the mother forced Roni to \u201csquat\u201d and then pushed her out the door of the house. Roni ran from the house to a police station. A few days later, the department removed Roni from the custody of her parents and, subsequently, removed Gail from her parents and added her to the care and protection petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Both sisters were emotionally fragile when first placed in their present foster home, but have since flourished. The parents responded negligibly to the department\u2019s efforts to provide services to the family, and the department eventually shifted its goal for the children from reunification to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\"><em>Exclusion of parents from the courtroom. </em>At the commence<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ment of trial, the judge addressed the children\u2019s motion (which the parents vigorously opposed) to testify out of the presence of their parents. The judge ruled that the children should testify in open court, but ordered the parents and the court-appointed interpreter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to remain out of the courtroom during the children\u2019s testimony. The parents\u2019 counsel was allowed to remain in the courtroom during the children\u2019s testimony and to cross-examine the children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The father contends that this arrangement violated his due process rights \u201ceffectively to rebut adverse allegations concerning child-rearing capabilities.\u201d <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 710 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In <em>Adoption of Don, </em>435 Mass. 158, 167-169 (2001), the Supreme Judicial Court held that the constitutional right of confrontation under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution does not apply to proceedings for the termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the same time, among other factors, the court specifically noted that due process was satisfied in that case \u201cbecause the parents had the opportunity, through counsel, to cross-examine the child witnesses vigorously, in addition to presenting witnesses and other evidence on their own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Similarly, we declined prior to <em>Adoption of Don </em>to disturb orders allowing a child\u2019s testimony to be given in camera, outside the presence of both the parents and their counsel, where there was evidence that testifying in the presence of the parents would cause trauma to the child. See <em>Adoption of Arthur, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 914, 915 (1993); <em>Adoption of Tina, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 734 (1998). An order allowing a child to testify outside the presence of her parents to avoid trauma should ordinarily be supported by an explicit finding to that effect. See <em>ibid. </em>Here, there is a threshold difficulty in our evaluation of the judge\u2019s order in that the judge made no findings to support it and offered little explanation of any kind, saying only that \u201cwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>have made a minimal accommodation in view of the fact that this is a very serious proceeding with serious consequences, and I believe it\u2019s within the Court\u2019s discretion to structure it in this fashion. . . . [Rani is] fourteen and one-half years old [and Gail] . . . just turned thirteen, and the age of the girls factors into the Court\u2019s decision as to why they\u2019ll be testifying in the courtroom, not within the chambers.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compounding matters is the fact that the judge appears to have conducted the bulk of her discussion of the motion with counsel in an untranscribed lobby conference. Despite the absence of an explicit finding of trauma in the present case, however, we believe it implicit in the judge\u2019s order that, based on the opinions of the children\u2019s respective therapists (on which the children\u2019s motion relied to support their request), she determined that it would be traumatic to the children if their parents were present in the courtroom during their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The father observes that the parents in the present case were excluded entirely from the courtroom, while the parents in <em>Adoption of Don, supra, </em>were allowed to remain in the courtroom and were merely prevented from sitting in a face-to-face confrontation with the children. By their exclusion from the courtroom, the father argues, the parents were unable to observe the children\u2019s demeanor and, accordingly, were unable to discern when the children\u2019s demeanor revealed their testimony to be lacking in credibility; that inability, in turn, prevented the parents from assisting their counsel in identifying areas to probe on cross-examination. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>417 Mass. 498, 503 (1994).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">However, the prejudice the father claims is largely illusory. The children\u2019s testimony regarding the parentally inflicted abuse necessarily implicated the parents\u2019 acts and, accordingly, ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>dressed topics and incidents within the parents\u2019 direct knowledge; the parents did not need to observe the children\u2019s facial .expressions in order to advise their counsel that an alleged incident of abuse did not occur. The specific instances of alleged abuse to which the children testified had appeared previously in the reports of the court investigator and the children\u2019s therapists, providing the parents with ample opportunity prior to trial (in addition to their opportunity during trial to consult with their counsel immediately following the children\u2019s testimony, see note 7 supra) to advise their counsel of any incidents they claimed did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Though <em>Adoption of Don </em>confirmed that there is no art. 12 right of confrontation in child custody cases, it noted \u201cthe natural right that parents have to the custody of their, children, a right that is fundamental and constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168. Given the important interests at stake in child custody cases, and the need to preserve public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the proceedings, we observe that the judge\u2019s handling of the children\u2019s motion left much to be desired. It would be far preferable for any order limiting parties\u2019 access to, or participation in, any portion of the proceedings to be narrowly tailored to the particular protection required in the circumstances, explained by the judge and supported by explicit findings. Every effort should be made to safeguard the children\u2019s well-being, but with the least intrusion on the parents\u2019 opportunities for full participation practicable in the circumstances, and only where absolutely necessary should parents be excluded entirely from the courtroom.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nonetheless, absent a showing of prejudice in the present case, and in light of the therapists\u2019 beliefs that testifying in the presence of their parents would be traumatic to the children, we conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in excluding the parents from the courtroom during the children\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>Delay in holding the seventy-two hour hearing. </em>There is little to the mother\u2019s argument that the parents were denied due process rights by the delay in conducting the seventy-two hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>hearing within the time prescribed by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. To begin with, the mother overstates her complaint that, following removal of the children on October 31, 1997, the seventy-two hour hearing did not \u201cconclude\u201d until February 9, 1998. In fact, the hearing commenced on November 3, 1997 (at which the parties agreed to waive the seventy-two hour requirement because of the need to arrange for a Mandarin interpreter, see note 6 <em>supra). </em>Testimony commenced one week later, on November 10, 1997. While the hearing then continued over a number of nonconsecutive days, eventually reaching conclusion on February 9, there is no indication in the record that the parents challenged the schedule established for continuing the hearing, or that they sought relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. In any event, by virtue of the final determination of parental unfitness following a full trial, the question is largely moot. See <em>Care and Protection of Robert, </em>408 Mass. 52, 68 n.8 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The parents devote significant portions of their argument to an assault on the children\u2019s credibility and on a number of the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact in reliance thereon. It is probably sufficient to observe in response that our role on review of a trial judge\u2019s findings is extremely limited; we do not \u201cassess the evidence de nova, but rather . . . determine whether the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and whether they proved parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 802 (1993). Our posture toward the trial judge\u2019s findings and rulings in child custody cases is one of \u201csubstantial deference.\u201d <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 225 (1998). The trial judge ruled explicitly that she found the children\u2019s testimony \u201cextremely credible\u201d and concluded that the incidents of abuse they recounted warranted termination of parental rights. Our review of the record does not suggest that the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Those findings, in turn, amply support the decision to terminate parental rights. See <em>Adoption of Don, supra </em>at 167. Moreover, even if we were to accept the parents\u2019 claims that the children fabricated or exaggerated certain of the alleged incidents of abuse, we note that the parents do not challenge, and even concede, that some incidents occurred substantially as found by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Failure to provide services. </em>Both parents claim that the department failed to provide adequate service in support of the goal of reunification, as directed by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1. See <em>Care and Protection of Elaine, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 273-274 (2002). Specifically, the parents contend that, following removal of the children from their custody, the department provided them inadequate opportunities for visitation and that, as a result, the children became enamored of their new foster home. However, the limited visitation was indicated by the children\u2019s therapists, who cited apprehension on the children\u2019s part toward visitation. Moreover, during the second of the two visits that did occur, the father became angry and began to yell at Gail because she refused to sit next to him; both parents then abruptly left the department\u2019s offices. Review of the record reveals that the parents failed to attend scheduled meetings with the department and exhibited a general lack of cooperation with the department.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the trial judge concluded, while there was likely more the department could have done, what the parents cite as a lack of service on the part of the department principally illustrated the parents\u2019 refusal to accept responsibility for the condition of their family or to acknowledge the severity of their abusive behavior.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-11\">The mother adopts the father\u2019s argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-12\">We decline to consider the mother\u2019s additional claim that the single justice of this court erred in refusing the parents\u2019 joint motion for additional time to supplement the record with the transcript of a portion of the trial missing from the assembled record or, alternatively, to vacate the assembly of the record. Neither parent filed an appeal from the order of the single justice, as required by Appeals Court Rule 2:02 (1975), thereby failing a necessary predicate for review. In any event, we detect no abuse of discretion in the order of the single justice (who previously had allowed several motions to enlarge the appellants\u2019 time to supplement the record).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-13\">The father did not reside with Roni or his parents during this period.

See <em>Adoption of Don, supra </em>at 169, and cases cited.

We agree with the trial judge, whose findings show thoughtful consideration of that claim, and who observed that there was no evidence that the nature and scope of the abuse inflicted on the children was common or considered appropriate in Taiwan, and that the only evidence was to the contrary. The parents\u2019 insistence that they are victims of cultural bias, and that their daughters have fabricated allegations of abuse in order to pursue a more affluent lifestyle than the parents can provide, instead stands as further evidence of their unwillingness to acknowledge the severity of the abuse they inflicted on their daughters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
