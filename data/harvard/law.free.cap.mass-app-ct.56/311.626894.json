L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32B, and did so within 1,000 feet of a school, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. In this appeal, the juvenile claims that the evidence was insufficient to show a controlled substance was involved and that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The evidence at trial, viewed in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), is as follows. In the evening of March 8, 2000, the juvenile, a student at a private alternative school in East Bridgewater, telephoned Susan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> another student. The juvenile told Susan that she was going to bring Klonopin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pills into school and distribute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">On the following day, the juvenile\u2019s mother, who had a prescription for \u201c[pjink\u201d Klonopin pills, noticed that seventeen pills were missing. At school that same day, the juvenile showed Susan a pill bottle. Susan saw pills inside but could not describe them further. Later that day, the juvenile gave Michael, another student, some pills from a bottle. He described them as round, \u201cpinkish orange,\u201d with the letter \u201cK\u201d \u201cpunched out.\u201d Michael put about fifteen of them in his pocket and consumed a \u201ccouple\u201d of them around lunchtime. Michael also told Susan that he received pills from the juvenile. The juvenile showed John, another student, a \u201cregular prescription bottle\u201d in class, and pointed to Michael as one who had received the pills. She told Mark, another student, that she and Michael were going to get in trouble (\u201cbopped\u201d); she showed Mark a prescription bottle with no label, saying she had \u201c[a lot of] pills,\u201d and put it back in her pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The assistant program director of the school was called to Michael\u2019s classroom early that afternoon and observed that Michael appeared to be \u201cunder the influence.\u201d After confronting Michael about his behavior, the assistant director called local paramedics, having decided that Michael should be sent to a hospital in Brockton for screening. Before the paramedics arrived, the assistant director talked to Michael about his condi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tian and also talked to four other students, one of whom gave him an unmarked prescription container. This student sat directly to the juvenile\u2019s right in the classroom. The assistant director described the contents of the container as \u201cpinkish brownish pills with a hollowed out \u2018K\u2019 in the middle.\u201d The assistant director sent the container and the pills with the paramedics to be delivered to hospital personnel. A physician testified that he was familiar with the drug Klonopin and that Klonopin pills are \u201cusually identifie[d]\u201d by a \u201cK\u201d marked on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>Sufficiency of the proof of a controlled substance. </em>The juvenile understandably does not argue that there was insufficient evidence of distribution. She claims only that there was insufficient proof that Klonopin was distributed and that her motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed. No certificate of analysis was introduced pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 13. A police officer, in the course of his investigation, sought the pills which had been sent to the Brockton hospital with Michael, and determined that the container and the pills were destroyed at the hospital and never tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A certificate of analysis is not a prerequisite to proving that the pills are a controlled substance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>399 Mass. 465, 467 (1987) (\u201cProof that a substance is a particular drug need not be made by chemical analysis and may be made by circumstantial evidence\u201d). To determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of distribution beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201cthe [juvenile\u2019s] intent to distribute a controlled substance \u2018is a matter of fact, which may not be susceptible of proof by direct evidence. In that event resort must be had... by inference from all the facts and circumstances developed at the trial.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>356 Mass. 574, 578-579 (1970), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holiday, </em>349 Mass. 126, 128 (1965).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 648 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The jury reasonably could have inferred that the distributed substance was Klonopin from the juvenile\u2019s statements to Susan the evening before the incident that she would be bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Klonopin pills into school and distributing them to others,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that they were in her home by prescription, a fact confirmed by the juvenile\u2019s mother, who testified that she had discovered seventeen pills missing that day. The juvenile\u2019s display of pills and a prescription bottle to Susan and other students the next day also supports the conclusion that the juvenile carried out her stated intention. Moreover, the color of the pills Michael received from the juvenile was generally consistent with the pink color described by her mother. The appearance of the letter \u201cK\u201d on those pills, viewed in the light of the physician\u2019s testimony that Klonopin pills usually are identified by that letter, further supports the conclusion that the juvenile distributed Klonopin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Viewed cumulatively, this evidence provides an ample evidentiary basis from which a rational jury could find the essential elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. at 648. The juvenile\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty properly was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>Alleged prosecutorial error.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The juvenile\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of witnesses is without merit. In her closing argument the prosecutor used rhetorical terms such as \u201cI suggest\u201d or \u201cI would suggest\u201d when urging the jury to evaluate the demeanor and the testimony of the witnesses in determining their credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>401 Mass. 318, 329 (1987). There was no statement of personal belief by the prosecutor. The prosecutor properly could respond to defense counsel\u2019s argument suggesting the jury could infer that Michael sought the help of his friends to \u201cpoint the finger\u201d at the juvenile, knowing that he was \u201cin trouble\u201d for ingesting the pills, and had to \u201ccome up with some story as to how he got those pills.\u201d In responding, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether the answers of each student \u201cseemed frank\u201d and \u201cforthcoming\u201d and whether \u201cthey were trying to hide anything,\u201d in evaluating their credibility and motive to testify. She argued that the jury should consider that Michael appeared to want drugs, and she asked the jury to consider the testimony that the students had been friendly with the juvenile. She suggested that their demeanor and testimony would indicate they had not conspired with Michael in making up a \u201cstory\u201d to blame the juvenile. These responses were proper. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 712-714 (1993). The argument was factually based and properly suggested that the jury consider the demeanor of witnesses in assessing their testimony. No improper rhetorical questions were posed. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Achorn, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 250 (1988). We discern no support for the juvenile\u2019s claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the prosecutor referred to facts not in evidence or significantly misstated the physician\u2019s testimony or improperly characterized the students\u2019 testimony. Because there also was no request for a curative instruction, we conclude the judge was not required to go beyond the instructions he gave concerning comments of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Even if some of the questions that the prosecutor asked the jurors to address, or her concluding statement that a \u201cfair and just verdict is a verdict of guilty,\u201d might be construed as being improper, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 475 (2000), we conclude, in the absence of an identifiable objection,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">We use pseudonyms for all of the juveniles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">A physician testified that Klonopin is a trade name for the drug Clonazepam. General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 31, lists Clonazepam as a Class C(a)(3) controlled substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We need not address the juvenile\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in her reply brief, that these statements should not have been admitted for their probative effect because they did not constitute an admission of guilt. In any event, this argument is without merit. \u201cAny extrajudicial statement by a party may be admitted in evidence against that party by an opponent, and will not be excluded on the ground that it constitutes hearsay.\u201d Liacos, Brodin &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.8.1, at 496 (7th ed. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We also do not consider any issue of the voluntariness of these statements. The issue was not raised below nor argued to us. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>426 Mass. 76, 82-83 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">To the extent that there were any differences in testimony regarding the color or marking of Klonopin pills, those differences would only affect the weight of the evidence and constituted an issue to be resolved by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In concluding the evidence was sufficient to show the juvenile distributed Klonopin,. we do not rely on lay testimony such as that permitted by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawson, 399 </em>Mass. at 467 (\u201cThe great weight of authority in this country permits, for example, an experienced user of a controlled substance to testify that a substance that he saw and used was a particular drug\u201d). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cantres, </em>405 Mass. 238, 246-247 (1989), the Supreme Judicial Court stated that \u201c[i]t is enough that the witness have familiarity based on prior use or sale\u201d and that \u201c \u2018[(Identification based on past use coupled with present observation of the substance at hand will suffice to establish the illicit nature of a suspected substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrell, 737 </em>F.2d 971, 978-979 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1164 (1985), and 470 U.S. 1027 (1985). While there was testimony in this case tending to show some knowledge of the use of Klonopin, as when Michael described feeling \u201chigh,\u201d or acknowledged that he had \u201coverdosed\u201d on the pills; or when Susan stated that she \u201cknew how people act when they take Klonopin when it\u2019s not theirs\u201d; or when the assistant director described Michael as seeming to be \u201cunder the influence,\u201d these unspecific and conclu-</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>spry remarks do not demonstrate such familiarity or experience as alone would sufficiently identify Klonopin to support a conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">As a separate issue, the juvenile first complains that the prosecutor improperly elicited testimony from Michael that he was aware that he could be charged for taking the pills, and then asked him, \u201c[Y]et, you showed up to testify today?\u201d This question, not objected to, occurred on redirect examination, following questions raised in cross-examination as to whether Michael was testifying pursuant to any promises made by the prosecution and whether he understood that he could be charged with possession. There was no error. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 96 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">At a bench conference following the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing, defense counsel made a statement marked \u201cinaudible\u201d in the transcript. The judge responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything remotely touching prosecutorial misconduct was made during the course of the argument in this case.\u201d Another \u201cinaudible\u201d statement of counsel followed, and the bench discussion turned to several requested instructions, none of which touched upon the prosecutor\u2019s argument. The juvenile has not identified anything material to her appeal in the inaudible portions, nor has she taken any steps under the applicable sections of Mass.R.A.P. 8(b)(3), as amended, 388 Mass. 1106 (1983), \u201cto ensure that the record is adequate for appellate review.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woody, </em>429 Mass. 95, 99 (1999). Accordingly, we review the claims of error under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard.
