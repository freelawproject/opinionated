We recite the relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">a. <em>the Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>Mark Sbalbi (Sbalbi) was acquainted with the defendant. He often rode dirt bikes with the defendant\u2019s teenage son, Gary, Jr. (Gary).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the afternoon of July 6, 1995, Gary went to Sbalbi\u2019s house to retrieve a helmet that he had left there earlier. Because Sbalbi and his wife had guests at that time, he told Gary that someone else had borrowed the helmet and summarily dismissed him. Angered by Sbalbi\u2019s attitude, Gary told Sbalbi that he wanted the return of his helmet and stomped off. Shortly after leaving the Sbalbi residence, Gary met Sbalbi\u2019s eleven year old son, Mark, in a nearby parking lot. Gary took Mark\u2019s bicycle and told him that he would get it back when Gary\u2019s helmet was returned. Upset, Mark returned home on Gary\u2019s bicycle and told his father what had happened. Sbalbi became furious and drove through his neighborhood looking for Gary. Sbalbi found him, his girlfriend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>and his friend, Danny Sepulveda, at a nearby gas station. Warning Gary to stay away from his children, he grabbed Mark\u2019s bicycle, put it in the trunk of his car, and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">After returning home, Sbalbi had an apparent change of heart. At about 9:00 p.m., he put Gary\u2019s bicycle in his car and drove to Sepulveda\u2019s house to drop it off for Gary. When he arrived, he saw Gary, his girlfriend, and Sepulveda standing outside. Gary was talking on a cordless phone. Sbalbi, who knew that the defendant kept a number of guns at his house, called out to Gary: \u201cAre you calling your father? Is he going to bring his guns over?\u201d Gary nodded affirmatively, and Sbalbi drove back to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Arriving home, Sbalbi sat on the front steps to his house, less than twenty feet from the street. His wife and four children were inside. Within minutes, the defendant, driving a Ford Bronco truck, pulled up to the house and asked Sbalbi where Gary was. Sbalbi said that Gary was at Sepulveda\u2019s house, and the defendant drove away. Sbalbi watched the defendant drive to the end of the street, turn around, and drive back toward Sbalbi\u2019s house. As he left his front stoop and began to walk toward the back of his house, Sbalbi saw the defendant drive alongside his house. It was about 9:35 p.m. The street lights and at least one neighbor\u2019s lamp post were lit. Sbalbi looked right into the defendant\u2019s face. He also saw the defendant\u2019s extended arm and a flash of light while hearing the ringing sound of five or six shots. Sbalbi threw himself to the ground. Inside the house, his wife and children were screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">No one was hurt. There were plaster chips scattered all about the living room and bullet holes in the couch, wall, and ceiling. Sbalbi\u2019s wife immediately called the police. Their investigation revealed six nine millimeter bullet holes. One of those bullet holes was in a couch, just inches away from where the Sbalbis\u2019 baby had been sleeping. The police also recovered four spent nine millimeter shell casings and an ammunition clip for a nine millimeter, semiautomatic weapon in the street outside the Sbalbi house.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Sbalbi told the police about his brief conversation with the defendant outside his home and the subsequent shooting. He described the vehicle from which the shots were fired, identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the defendant as the shooter, and gave the defendant\u2019s address. The police immediately went to the defendant\u2019s home. At their request, the defendant removed a key from a pocket in his trousers. Using that key, the police unlocked a metal gun cabinet that they found in a bedroom closet. Among the numerous firearms found inside the cabinet was a nine millimeter handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Within an hour after the shooting, the police brought Sbalbi to the defendant\u2019s home. While seated in a police cruiser, Sbalbi positively identified the defendant as the man had who shot at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">b. <em>the defendant\u2019s case. </em>While conceding that the gun found in his cabinet was the gun used in the shooting, the defendant sought to establish that Gary had fired the shots at Sbalbi and into his house. Gary testified as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">After trying to retrieve his helmet from Sbalbi, Gary saw Mark, \u201ctraded\u201d bikes with him, and then met up with his girlfriend and Sepulveda. They rode their bicycles to a local gas station where they were confronted by an angry Sbalbi. According to Gary, Sbalbi hit him in the face twice, took Mark\u2019s bicycle, and left the area. Gary, his girlfriend, and Sepulveda returned to Sepulveda\u2019s house at about 9:10 p.m. Sepulveda was riding his bicycle while Gary and his girlfriend both rode on another bike belonging to Gary.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Upon arriving at Sepulveda\u2019s house, Gary remained outside and used a cordless telephone to call the defendant and ask him to drive him and his girlfriend home. He explained to his father that he did not have a bicycle and that his girlfriend had to get home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While Gary was speaking with the defendant, Sbalbi drove up, and returned his bicycle to him. At some point thereafter, the defendant appeared and drove Gary and his girlfriend back to the Gaudette house. Gary\u2019s girlfriend then borrowed his bicycle so that she could get home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Gary related that as his father dressed for work, he (Gary) took the keys to his father\u2019s truck and gun cabinet. He testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that he removed a nine millimeter gun from the cabinet, climbed into the defendant\u2019s truck, drove to the Sbalbis\u2019 house, fired the shots in issue, drove home, parked the defendant\u2019s truck, and returned the gun to its cabinet. According to Gary, all this was done without his parents\u2019 knowledge. Although it was undisputed that Gary did not have a driver\u2019s license, he insisted that he knew how to drive both the defendant\u2019s Dodge Ram Charger truck and his mother\u2019s Ford Bronco. He claimed that when he was \u201clittle,\u201d his brother would let him drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">2. <em>The arguments. </em>Against the backdrop of the recited evidence, we take up the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">a. <em>admissibility of prior consistent statements. </em>Because he was moving to Florida and would be unavailable to testify at trial, the parties agreed to videotape their examination of Danny Sepulveda. In response to questions put by defense counsel, Sepulveda revealed that shortly after the shooting in issue, he received a telephone call from Gary, asking that he go and retrieve a gun clip that he had dropped in the area of Mark Sbalbi\u2019s house.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">When defense counsel offered Gary\u2019s conversation with Sepulveda in evidence, the judge sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection and explained the bases of her ruling. She reasoned that because Gary was no more than a witness in the proceedings, his statements to Sepulveda could not be deemed admissions of a party opponent. Nor could the statements be treated as declarations against penal interest: Gary was available to testify. Moreover, Gary\u2019s state of mind at the time he made the statements was irrelevant. Although not argued by defense counsel at trial, the judge also determined that the statements were not admissible as prior consistent statements. This conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>sion was based upon her finding that Gary\u2019s testimony had not been impeached by an allegation of \u201crecent contrivance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant argues that the judge erred in ruling that Gary\u2019s conversation with Sepulveda was not admissible under the \u201cprior consistent statements\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay and in rejecting the claim that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to convince her otherwise.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">For purposes of decision, we assume without deciding that the Commonwealth\u2019s examination of Gary created an insinuation that he was prevaricating. Upon the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge concluded that even had the defendant\u2019s trial attorney argued that Gary\u2019s statements to Sepulveda were admissible on the grounds that they were prior consistent statements, she would have sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection on the basis that Gary made the statements at a time when he had a motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">As stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 99-100 (1999), the necessary evidentiary foundation for the admissibility of prior consistent statements is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cAs a general matter, a witness\u2019s prior statement that is consistent with his testimony at trial is inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>425 Mass. 382, 396-397 (1997). However, if the witness\u2019s trial testimony is impeached by a claim of recent contrivance or inducement, a prior statement made before the witness had an incentive to fabricate testimony may be admitted. Even then, \u2018these statements are admissible only to rebut the claim of recent fabrication, not to prove the truth of the matter.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>and cases cited .... Trial judges are granted \u2018wide discretion in deciding whether the circumstances warrant the admission of a witness\u2019s prior consistent statements when he has been <em>or will be </em>impeached with an inconsistent statement\u2019 (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saarela, </em>376 Mass. 720, 723 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zukoski, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>370 Mass. 23, 27, (1976) (trial judge has \u2018range of discretion in determining whether a suggestion of recent contrivance exists in the circumstances\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We see no abuse of discretion or other error of law in the judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It is the defendant\u2019s argument that any motive Gary might have had to lie could not have arisen until after the defendant was arrested. The evidence, the defendant claims, shows that Gary made his statements to Sepulveda shortly after the shooting which, according to Sbalbi, occurred about 9:35 p.m., whereas the defendant\u2019s arrest took place much later. This argument completely fails to take into account both the evidence of Gary\u2019s knowledge of the events of the day, and his relationship to the defendant. We think that when this evidence is put into the balance, a judge reasonably could conclude, as matter of discretion, that the defense had failed to show that the statements in question were made \u201cbefore the witness had a motive to fabricate.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">b. <em>the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>Although the defendant did not object to all the remarks made by the prosecutor in his closing argument about which the defendant now complains, the judge considered each of them in ruling upon the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We, therefore, consider all his claims as if they had been preserved properly for appellate review, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hallet, </em>427 Mass. 552, 554, 558 (1998), and examine them in light of the evidence and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 679 &amp; n.5 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">We have recited the strong evidence against the defendant, that is, Sbalbi\u2019s identification of him and the basis for the reliability of that identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagano, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 63 (1999) (identification testimony on similar circumstances \u201cmade a potent case for conviction\u201d). Although the judge did not refer specifically to any particular statement made by the prosecutor in his closing argument, she twice informed the jurors that closing arguments were not evidence. She also instructed the jurors that, in their deliberations, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>were not to be swayed by sympathy, emotion, or concern about the effect or consequences of their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It is on this basis that we turn to the defendant\u2019s complaints about six statements made by the prosecutor in his closing argument. The defendant\u2019s arguments can be summarized as complaints that the prosecutor improperly and prejudicially sought to inflame the jury by unfairly attacking the character and demeanor of the defendant and his son; attempting to lure the jurors beyond a calm consideration of the evidence; insinuating that because the police had no doubt about the identity of Sbalbi\u2019s shooter, neither should they; misstating the evidence; and vouching for Sbalbi\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Of the six statements in issue, there are only two that merit some comment, albeit slight. The first of the two claims concerns the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the defendant should be ashamed for sitting by while his young son lied and sought to shoulder the blame for the crimes under consideration. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Even if this comment improperly impugned the defendant\u2019s character, we conclude that on the basis of the evidence, particularly Sbalbi\u2019s identification of the defendant, and the jury instructions, reversal of his convictions is not warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>689, 696-697 (1994). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 574-575 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 258. 264-265 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">As for the second claim, concerning the bullet holes in the doll, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>we accept the defendant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s statement and display of the doll were dramatic. However, that is not to say that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was unduly prejudicial or otherwise improper. The doll had been admitted in evidence, and there was no dispute that the shots fired at Sbalbi and into his house had come from the defendant\u2019s gun. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 31-32 (1982). The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were an appropriate response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument in which he challenged the probative value of the doll and argued that although the doll \u201cmay appear flamboyant and eye-catching and appealing, [it] has nothing to do with the case at hand.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>407 Mass. 927, 939 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As for the remaining complaints about the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we need say no more than that the disputed remarks can be characterized as \u201centhusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 629 (1993), rather than as unfair and improper argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 782, 786 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">c. <em>the motion for new trial. </em>Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant claims error in the judge\u2019s denials of his motion for a new trial and his request for an evidentiary hearing on that motion. In his motion for new trial, the defendant claims that defense counsel was ineffective on two bases: (1) he failed to call a witness favorable to the defense; and (2) a conflict of interest so hampered him that he failed to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant and his wife never told the police that Gary was the culprit because they knew that he was lying.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">We examine the judge\u2019s rulings to determine whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>made a significant error of law or otherwise abused her broad range of discretion. Because the motion judge was also the trial judge, her rulings are \u201cafforded special deference,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hung Tan Vo, </em>427 Mass. 464, 467 (1998), that is to say, her ruling will not be set aside \u201cunless it is manifestly unjust.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To determine whether the judge erroneously denied the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, we must ascertain, within the restrictions of the scope of our review, whether the defendant demonstrated both that his trial attorney\u2019s performance fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), and that his performance \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">We need say little about any failure of defense counsel to call a witness who would have testified that Sbalbi appeared to be intoxicated at the time of his confrontation with Gary at the gas station. Because both Sbalbi and his wife testified that he had been drinking that day, the testimony of the witness in issue would have been cumulative at best. The circumstances of this case do not provide us with any basis for a departure from the general rule that a failure to present cumulative testimony does not give rise to a claim of incompetency of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, 20 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 258, 261 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Of all the contentions on appeal, the only one with potential merit concerns the defendant\u2019s allegation that defense counsel\u2019s effectiveness was compromised by a conflict of interest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986) (conflict exists where \u201cindependent professional judgment\u201d is impaired by personal interests or those of another client). He argues that defense counsel should have withdrawn from the case so that he could testify to the fact that the defendant and his wife did not tell the police about Gary\u2019s admission of guilt because defense counsel advised them against such action, all as set out in the affidavits of the defendant and his wife.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claims that defense counsel\u2019s testimony was necessary to rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant and his wife refrained from telling the police about Gary\u2019s admission of guilt because they knew that Gary was lying.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Upon scrutiny, his argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge found that although Gary had proclaimed his guilt to defense counsel within six days after the shooting, defense counsel did not seek leave to withdraw from the case until the morning of the commencement of the retrial. His request was based upon his representation that the defendant wanted to call him to testify as a \u201ccorroborating witness\u201d to Gary\u2019s early admission of guilt. Concluding that any such testimony would be inadmissible, she denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Relying upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408 (1979), the defendant claims that the need for defense counsel\u2019s testimony to the effect that he had told the defendant, his wife, and Gary to remain silent about Gary\u2019s admission of guilt created a genuine conflict of interest. However, <em>Rondeau </em>is distinguishable. There defense counsel\u2019s testimony was not precluded by the rules of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 415 (\u201cno rule of evidence would have prevented [the attorney] from testifying\u201d). Moreover, the attorney was the only witness without a criminal history who could testify to the defendant\u2019s alibi. <em>Id. </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In the present case, the judge found and concluded at trial, and on the motion for new trial, that any hearsay testimony concerning Gary\u2019s admission of guilt was inadmissible for those reasons discussed in part 2(a) of this opinion, <em>supra. </em>Further, and notwithstanding strong evidence to the contrary, Gary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>insisted at trial that he was the guilty party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He also stated, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, that defense counsel never advised against or otherwise precluded him from telling the police about his role in the crimes comprehended by the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the judge\u2019s findings and rulings on the motion for new trial, and the record before us, we conclude that any doubt concerning defense counsel\u2019s obedience to his ethical obligations (see SJ.C. Rule l:7[b] and comment [4], 426 Mass. 1330-1332 [1998]) is insufficient to entitle the defendant to a new trial. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rondeau, 378 Mass. at 416-417.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Because we find no error in the judge\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s motion failed to present any substantial issue requiring an evidentiary hearing, we conclude that it was well within the broad range of her discretion to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial without first conducting an evidentiary hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Birks, </em>435 Mass. 782, 792 (2002), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The defendant\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial.

It is well established that, based on the grounds set out in the motion and the evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>trials, she was free to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>290 Mass. 406, 410 (1935); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 663 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The defendant does not argue that the prosecutor, before asking any witness about his or her failure to relate Gary\u2019s admission of guilt, did not comply with the requirements set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 296-297 (1981). In any event, the prosecutor established that both Gary and his mother knew that the defendant had been arrested as well as where the police station was located, and that the defendant had not asked either of them to refrain from speaking with the police. See <em>ibid-, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>386 Mass. 54, 58 n.4 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>433 Mass. 45, 48-51 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>435 Mass. 509, 522-525 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\">As noted in her memorandum of decision, the judge was aware of the fact that Gary had been sequestered from the courtroom throughout the trial but that members of his family continually left the courtroom after any witness gave testimony concerning him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
