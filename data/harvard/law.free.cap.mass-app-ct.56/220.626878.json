L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[tij), which had an altered serial number (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 11C), and illegal possession of ammunition (G. L. c. 269, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u00a7 10[/i]). His sole argument is that the motion judge erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress the handgun and ammunition which, he claims, were obtained as the result of an investigatory stop not based on reasonable suspicion, in violation of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The motion judge found that the officers had lawfully stopped the defendant upon reasonable suspicion. That finding was based upon the defendant\u2019s efforts to evade the officers\u2019 attempt to question him about a recent crime and their suspicion that he was carrying a firearm inside his pants. A loaded gun fell out of the defendant\u2019s pants as the officers attempted to question him after catching up with him. The defendant maintains that his illegal seizure occurred at the moment the police ordered him to stop rather than the moment identified by the judge. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We summarize the findings of the motion judge supplemented by uncontroverted evidence based on the testimony of Officer Leonardo Hernandez of the Boston police department, the arresting officer \u2014 testimony which the judge expressly found credible and relied upon for her ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>415 Mass. 814, 816-817 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 726 n.5 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On November 14, 1998, Detective Jay Greene of the Boston police department went to Boston Medical Center to question the defendant, who had been stabbed earlier that day on Bowdoin Street in the Dorchester section of Boston. The defendant stated that he had been attacked and stabbed in the back by \u201cfour guys\u201d but denied knowing who they were, a denial not believed by the detective. Detective Greene later filed a report of his interview with the defendant, which reflected the detective\u2019s suspicion that the stabbing related to the many altercations and violent outbreaks between feuding \u201cHamilton Street\u201d and \u201cHolmes[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Avenue\u201d factions within the young, male Cape Verdean population in the Bowdoin Street area.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>On November 16, 1998, Officer Hernandez and other members of the Boston police department who patrolled the Bowdoin Street area received a roll call briefing concerning the stabbing. The briefing mentioned police suspicion that it was another incident of violence between the feuding Cape Verdean youth factions. Officer Hernandez had been patrolling the area for several years and testified to the high rate of violence in the Cape Verdean community.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">At about 3:20 p.m., Officer Hernandez was standing beside his marked cruiser on Bowdoin Street with Officer Berlino Felix when he noticed the defendant, who was known to him. The defendant was riding a bicycle with his left hand while his right hand was placed inside the middle of his pants. Officer Hernandez mentioned to Officer Felix that the defendant was the person recently stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The two police officers, in separate cruisers, followed the defendant. They observed that he continuously kept his right hand in the middle of his pants as he rode. Officer Hernandez pulled abreast of the defendant and said that he would like to talk to him. The defendant slowed down as if to stop but, as Officer Hernandez stepped out of his cruiser, the defendant sped off on his bicycle. At the moment Officer Hernandez pulled abreast of the defendant, he developed a suspicion that the defendant was carrying a firearm. That suspicion was based upon the defendant\u2019s recent stabbing, the reported police suspicion that the stabbing had been yet another violent incident between the two Cape Verdean factions, the frequency of retaliations among young Cape Verdean males, and the defendant\u2019s act of continuously, holding his right hand within his pants. These factors, the judge concluded, justified the two officers\u2019 pursuit of the defendant in their cruisers upon his taking off on his bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Shortly after the pursuit began, the defendant fell off his bicycle, face-first onto the ground. The officers stopped, approached him, and performed an initial pat-down as he lay on the ground, his right hand still inside his pants. They then stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>him up, whereupon the firearm fell through one leg of his baggy pants onto the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">These findings, on the basis of which the judge denied the motion to suppress, did not comport with the unchallenged testimony of Officer Hernandez, the sole testifying witness to the circumstances of the challenged seizure. The findings failed to mention Officer Hernandez\u2019s testimony that he expressly ordered the defendant to \u201cstop\u201d three separate times before the pursuit: first, as he pulled his cruiser alongside the defendant to have him stop and talk; second, as the defendant appeared to ignore him and continued pedalling; and finally, after the defendant slowed down, appeared to stop, but then got back on his bicycle and sped off as Officer Hernandez stepped out of his cruiser. The officer also testified that his concern that the defendant might possess a weapon first arose only after the defendant fled at a high rate of speed following his false stop while keeping his right hand inside his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We do not disturb subsidiary findings of a judge on a motion to suppress, provided they are \u201cwarranted by the evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>430 Mass. 545, 546 (2000), and are not infected by \u201cclear error,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 97 (1997), while we review de nova ultimate findings and conclusions of law, particularly those of constitutional dimension. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 682 n.2 (1977). Applying those standards to the instant record, we discern clear error in the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings and legal error in her ultimate findings, with respect to both the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s seizure and whether reasonable suspicion existed to effect it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 659, 664 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201c[D]eteraiining the precise moment of seizure [is] critical to resolution of the issue of suppression.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bar-ros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 173 (2001). The judge\u2019s finding that the defendant was not seized for constitutional purposes until the police began pursuing him following his false stop and subsequent flight is contradicted by Officer Hernandez\u2019s testimony. The officer stated that he called for the defendant to \u201cstop\u201d twice before the defendant slowed down and then again as the defendant sped away after apparently feigning a stop. By overlooking these commands that the defendant stop, the judge committed a factual and a legal error regarding the crucial issue of fixing the moment of the defendant\u2019s seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">A person is constitutionally seized by a law enforcement officer \u201cif, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave\u201d without submitting to police questioning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. 782, 786 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 791 (1985). Although a police officer does not violate art. 14 by merely approaching an individual in the street or other public place and requesting him to answer questions, a seizure may be found \u201cwhere the police have engaged in some \u2018show of authority\u2019 which could be expected to command compliance, beyond simply identifying themselves as police.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>403 Mass. 640, 644 (1988), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>West, </em>651 F.2d 71, 73 (1st Cir. 1981), vacated on other grounds, 463 U.S. 1201 (1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1188 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. at 172, 174, 176 (after the defendant had ignored police officer\u2019s earlier request \u2014 \u201cHey you ... I want to speak with you\u201d \u2014 officer exited vehicle, approached defendant, pointed to him and said, \u201cHey you. I wanna talk to you. Come here\u201d; second request had a \u201ccompulsory dimension to it\u201d that \u201ccommunicat[ed] what a reasonable person would understand as a command that would be enforced by the police power\u201d and constituted a seizure).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Closely and conspicuously following a lone bicyclist in two marked police cruisers, twice ordering him to \u201cstop\u201d with the unmistakable intent of requiring him to submit to police inquir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>les, and emerging from a police vehicle in uniform to confront him after he had apparently stopped in response to the repeated orders, constituted police conduct of such an assertive and intimidating nature as to amount to a seizure requiring reasonable suspicion under art. 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 763-764 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. at 174-176; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 494 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mock, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 276, 278-279 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 569, 571-573 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The judge again erred factually and legally in resolving the second question in the required analysis under art. 14: at the moment the defendant was stopped in the constitutional sense, i.e., when he was seized, did the police have reasonable suspicion to believe that he had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime, based upon specific and articulable facts and reasonable inferences flowing therefrom, in light of the officers\u2019 experience and the entirety of the circumstances? See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405-406 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We see no objective basis in the evidence for reasonable suspicion at the time the defendant was seized as described above, or even at the subsequent moment when the judge determined he had been seized (i.e., when the police pursued him after he sped off on his bicycle following his false stop).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">From the moment of the officers\u2019 first observation of the defendant until he slowed down and virtually halted pursuant to Officer Hernandez\u2019s second order to stop, the record shows (and the officer candidly admitted) that the police had no evidence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>information \u2014 much less specific and articulable facts \u2014 creating the slightest suspicion that the defendant had committed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was in the course of committing, or was about to engage in any criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The record contains no evidence that the police knew of any actual or alleged violent behavior on the defendant\u2019s part, including possession or use of firearms or other weapons (see note 6, <em>supra). </em>Officer Hernandez conceded that nothing about the defendant\u2019s conduct as he bicycled away from the pursuing police, including his keeping his right hand inside his pants as he rode, was perceived by the police as threatening their or the public\u2019s safety until he fled after Officer Hernandez got out of his cruiser to question him. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 43-44 (2002) (as defendant attempted to evade police observation in a high crime area where firearms offenses were common, he made a quick movement that police perceived as the imminent use of a concealed weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Even at that point, the factors recounted by Officer Hernandez as creating his suspicion that the defendant might have a weapon did not provide adequate bases for any reasonable suspicion that the defendant was previously, then, or would soon be engaged in criminal activity. Taken together, those factors \u2014 the defendant\u2019s recent stabbing, police perception of a high rate of violence in the local Cape Verdean community, police \u201csuspicion\u201d that Cape Verdean youths from Homes Avenue were the defendant\u2019s assaulters, police concern about recent feuding and vengeful violence between those youths and rivals from Hamilton Street, the fact that the defendant was from the Hamilton Street area, and the persistent position of his right hand in his pants \u2014 amounted to no more than a hunch that because the defendant had been the victim of a stabbing, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>might be inclined to be carrying a weapon and seeking revenge against his assailants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Neither the defendant\u2019s presence in a \u201chigh crime area\u201d nor his efforts to avoid interaction with the police provided the officers with reason to stop him in the absence of any known criminal conduct attributable to him, or of any illegal or suspicious actions on his part observed by them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 763-764; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>413 Mass. 492, 496 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Moreover, nothing in the record demonstrated any connection between the defendant\u2019s stabbing and the problems in the Cape Verdean community. No evidence indicated any involvement by the defendant in the retaliatory violence among feuding Cape Verdean youth factions. There was no evidence that the defendant was himself of Cape Verdean descent. The police suspicion that the defendant might have been on his way to exact vengeance for his stabbing was also belied by the observable facts; when he was sighted (as well as while he was being followed), the defendant was riding in a direction away from Homes Avenue, the \u201cturf\u201d of his supposed assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The judge\u2019s reliance on police concern about the defendant\u2019s involvement in retaliatory Cape Verdean violence involving the defendant was, consequently, unfounded on the evidence presented. Nor was her ruling shored by her finding that police pursuit was justified by their suspicion that the defendant was carrying a firearm. Reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop cannot be founded on police belief (whatever its source) that a person is carrying a concealed firearm in the absence \u2014 as was the ca.se here \u2014 of any evidence of suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>cions conduct by that person indicative of criminal activity<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or of an imminent threat to police or public safety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>407 Mass. 178, 183, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. 266, 268-271, 274 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. at 176-178. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 671, 673-677 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Because the evidence did not provide the police with objectively reasonable suspicion to justify the pursuit and seizure of the defendant, his motion should have been allowed, and the handgun and ammunition discovered as the direct fruits of the police stop, suppressed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>343 Mass. 703, 705-708 (1962). See also <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 478, 486-488 (1963).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Had the motion to suppress been allowed, there would have been no evidence to support the defendant\u2019s convictions. His trial motions for a required finding of not guilty should, therefore, have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">\n<em>Findings set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Judgments for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">One other police officer, Detective Jay Greene, who was not involved in the defendant\u2019s seizure, testified at the hearing, but only as to the background facts surrounding the incident, summarized in the paragraph immediately following.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The transcript so spells this street name. There is no \u201cHolmes Avenue\u201d in Dorchester, but there is a \u201cHomes Avenue,\u201d which intersects with Bowdoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Street and is presumably the street referred to. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grin-kley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 69 n.9 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Although the clear error standard is a very limited form of review in cases where the motion judge\u2019s findings rest on determinations of credibility and resolution of conflicting testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), this case does not implicate that confining principle. It does not involve any conflicting testimony, but rather a single police witness\u2019s uncontradicted testimony that the motion judge explicitly found to be credible, contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 492 (2001), with no intimation that the judge did not credit that testimony in its entirety. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>423 Mass. 266, 268 n.2 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redd, </em>50 Mass App. Ct. 904, 904 n.3 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chongarlides, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 366, 372 n.8 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The final command to the defendant to stop, as he rode away after slowing down as if to stop, merely reiterated the already manifested police intention not to allow the defendant to leave the area without first acquiescing to their demand that he stop and respond to their questions \u2014 the functional equivalent of a seizure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stoute, </em>422 Mass. at 789.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The defendant\u2019s eventual refusal to submit to the police show of authority by engaging in flight and evasion did not change the character of the encounter for art. 14 purposes. Events subsequent to police pursuit or seizure, including efforts to elude or flee from the police, cannot be used to supply the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify the prior police action. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. at 763-764; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 708 n.2 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Officer Hernandez\u2019s testimony was that he recognized the defendant from having \u201cr[u]n into him on different [prior] occasions.\u201d It was devoid of specifics about those occasions and provided no basis for a finding that the defendant had ever been involved in, or even suspected of, committing any crime or using or carrying a firearm or weapon of any sort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. at 406.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. at 177-178. Nothing in the evidence indicates that the appearance of the twenty year old defendant at the time of the incident provided a rational basis for the police to suspect that he was under the age at which he could be lawfully issued a license to carry firearms. Compare the concurring opinions, <em>id. </em>at 179 &amp; n.l, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 620-621 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was also directed to statements he had made after being arrested following his seizure and search. Although one of the arresting officers testified at trial to statements the defendant made after he was booked and given Miranda warnings (\u201c[T]hey stabbed me. I was trying to protect myself\u201d), nothing was said about his statements at the hearing on the motion, and neither brief contains reasoned arguments about them. To the extent the Commonwealth relied at trial on such statements by the defendant, they, too, should have been suppressed and were also improperly admitted (over the defendant\u2019s objection) under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine reflected in the cited authorities, because of the direct causal link between the illegal stop, the defendant\u2019s arrest, and his making the statements.
