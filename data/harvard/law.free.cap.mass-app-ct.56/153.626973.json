As Burns obtained a club, the defendant fled out the room\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>window. Burns then called the police, who, accompanied by Burns and his daughter, searched the defendant\u2019s bedroom without a warrant and seized, among other incriminatory evidence, items that the victim told them were used in the attack on her. The defendant never returned to the house, and was apprehended seven weeks later in Florida. He was indicted on multiple counts of aggravated rape, rape, indecent assault and battery on a child over fourteen, threatening to commit murder, and possession of cocaine and marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His motion to suppress the items taken from his bedroom by the police on the day of the incident was allowed, and the Commonwealth has appealed. We conclude that at the time of the search the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy and had abandoned the property in the room. We therefore reverse the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><em>The motion to suppress. </em>The judge found the following facts in his ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which we supplement with uncontroverted facts adduced at the hearing on the motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 726 n.5 (2000). The victim\u2019s father, Robert Burns, rented a single-family, four-bedroom home at 67 Lawler Street in Holyoke, which he occupied along with his twenty year old son and his seventeen year old daughter, the victim. In November, 1999, the defendant arranged to live with the family and share their food expenses, though he did not pay rent. Beginning at that time, and continuing until February 16, 2000, the defendant had a bedroom in the house where he slept and stored his clothes and personal belongings. The room was furnished by Bums. The defendant\u2019s room was not kept locked, and the children and their father had access to the room, although Bums acknowledged that he would knock on the door before entering when the defendant was in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">On the afternoon of February 16, 2000, Bums returned to the house from work, and noticed his daughter\u2019s car parked in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>front. Aware that she was supposed to be at work, he began to search the house for her. Loud music was coming from the bedroom occupied by the defendant. Bums asked him through the closed door whether he had seen his daughter. The defendant said that he had not. As Bums continued to search, his daughter emerged from the defendant\u2019s bedroom, naked and crying. She appeared to have been beaten. Mr. Bums went to another part of the house to secure a club to confront the defendant. Meanwhile, the defendant fled the house through an open window in his bedroom, and drove away in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Burns called the police, who entered the house and spoke with Bums and his daughter. She told them she had been raped in the defendant\u2019s bedroom, and stated that the defendant had given her cocaine and marijuana and forced her to drink Gold-schlager, an alcoholic beverage. Burns accompanied a police detective into the defendant\u2019s bedroom<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where the detective seized a pair of underpants, a bag containing white powder, part of a marijuana cigarette, a bottle of Goldschlager and a cloth with white powder on it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Later in the evening, after the detective had been informed that, in exchange for his room at the house, the defendant would sometimes help Bums out by buying groceries, the detective returned to the house. The victim pointed out additional items in the defendant\u2019s bedroom that were involved in the attack on her. These items were also seized.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Still later, while reviewing the victim\u2019s written statement, the detective became aware that a can of shortening and a cucumber that another officer had observed under the defendant\u2019s bed had also been used in the attack on the victim. The detective sent two officers to the house; these items also were retrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The motion judge, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Midi, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 593 (1999), found that the defendant had a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>able expectation of privacy in the area searched because it was \u201chis personal room in the premises.\u201d The fact that Bums and his son and daughter entered the room freely in the defendant\u2019s absence did not diminish the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy there, he found. The motion judge went on to reject each of the theories advanced by the Commonwealth to justify the warrantless police entry into the room and seizure of the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">First, he noted that the seizure was not valid under the plain view doctrine, which, although authorizing police officers\u2019 right to make an observation of items in plain view, does not give rise to a right to enter an area and seize the items without some independent right of access to the area. See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 137 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>412 Mass. 745, 750-751 n.9 (1992). Second, the judge mled that the officers\u2019 entry was not validated by any consent given by Bums or the victim to search the defendant\u2019s room. To be effective, he reasoned, such consent would have required that they shared the defendant\u2019s bedroom or exercised equal control over his possessions and his use of the room. The judge distinguished cases in which consent of a third party was held valid to justify a war-rantless search, noting that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 832 (1995), the defendant had no room of his own, and that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ploude, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 141 (1998), the landlord had to walk through the defendant\u2019s leased space to get to his office. Third, the judge rejected the argument that the defendant had abandoned his possessions, finding that his sudden exit from the premises \u201cto avoid being apprehended for the crime he [was] alleged to have committed\u201d was, by itself, an insufficient basis on which to infer his intent never to return to the premises. He also found there was no time for the police to decide the defendant was not coming back.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In its appeal, the Commonwealth attacks each of the judge\u2019s conclusions on the motion to suppress as erroneous, arguing that the items properly were seized and should not have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Although we show substantial deference to the judge\u2019s legal conclusions drawn from his findings, we indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>dently review the application of constitutional principles to the facts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 671-672 (2001). We conclude that at the time of the search, the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bedroom, and had in any event abandoned the premises when the search occurred. The judge\u2019s allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion was, therefore, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">a. <em>The defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. </em>\u201cIn connection with a suppression motion, a defendant has the burden of establishing that the government has intruded on his or her reasonable expectation of privacy, thus establishing that a search has taken place. Then, but only then, the government has the burden to show that its search was reasonable and therefore lawful.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. 540, 544, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 832 (1990) (citations omitted). \u201c[Sjociety would accept that a room in a residence is a place where an <em>occupant </em>of that room would have an expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Midi, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 593 (emphasis added). See also <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 96-97, 99 (1990) (defendant\u2019s \u201cstatus as an overnight guest is alone enough to show that he had an expectation of privacy in the home that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable\u201d; status as overnight guest \u201cprovides him with privacy, a place where he and his possessions will not be disturbed by anyone but his host and those his host allows inside\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">A reasonable expectation of privacy does not arise solely by virtue of a defendant\u2019s occupation of a bedroom, however. Instead, we examine the nature of the occupancy and the circumstances attending it. \u201cIn evaluating the reasonableness of an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy, we look to a number of factors, including the character of the location involved. Thus, we consider whether the defendant owned the place involved; whether the defendant controlled access to the area; and whether the area was freely accessible to others. We have stated that \u2018an individual can have only a very limited expectation of privacy with respect to an area used routinely by others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 301-302 (1991), quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Hampshire, </em>384 Mass. 736, 742 (1981) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The defendant here did not own or rent his room in the house. He was a guest who provided some food money. Burns was free to end his hospitality anytime he wanted. See generally <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. at 99. The defendant also did not control access to the room. Burns could enter the room whenever he wanted to, even when the defendant was present, though in that case Bums would knock on the door to the room first, out of \u201ccourtesy.\u201d The defendant\u2019s room in the house was routinely entered by Burns. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. at 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The \u201cvery limited expectation of privacy\u201d the defendant had in the room prior to Febmary 16, which was dependent upon the relationship between the defendant and his host, disintegrated that afternoon. <em>Id. </em>at 302, quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Hampshire, supra. </em>Bums, who had allowed the defendant to live in his home as a friend, saw his daughter leaving the defendant\u2019s room naked, crying, and apparently beaten up. His daughter informed him that the defendant had raped her after providing her with drugs and forcing her to drink alcohol; the remains of the drags and alcohol were spread about the room in plain view, along with the daughter\u2019s clothing. The relationship between the defendant and his host was thereby destroyed. Recognizing his unwelcome status in the home after these events, the defendant fled through the window and drove off in his car, escaping from Burns who had gone to get a club to confront him. At this point, the defendant was no longer an occupant of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In sum, when the searches occurred, if he had any remaining subjective expectation of privacy regarding his room, the defendant certainly had no expectation of privacy that society objectively would recognize as reasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>406 Mass. at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">b. <em>Abandonment. </em>We further conclude that when the search occurred, the defendant had abandoned the premises. A defendant enjoys no right of privacy in property he has abandoned. <em>Abel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 241 (1960). \u201cAbandonment is primarily a question of intent, and intent may be inferred from words spoken, acts done, and other objective facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paszko, </em>391 Mass. 164, 184 (1984), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>474 F.2d 174, 176 (5th Cir. 1973). The essence of abandonment has been described as \u201cthe act of leaving coupled with the intention of not returning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 914 (1981). Here, as the defendant escaped through the bedroom window, the victim was reporting to her father what had taken place in the room. The record does not reveal that the defendant, a guest in the house, voiced any intentions as he fled. Nevertheless, the suddenness of his exit, and the fact that he fled through a window, along with his awareness that Burns, his host, had been searching for the victim and would find her in a distraught state leaving the defendant\u2019s room, dispel any question about his intent. He was on the run, with no intention of returning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Taken together, the facts are more than sufficient to establish that the defendant abandoned the premises. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The judge appeared to doubt whether abandonment could be found when the police conducted the search without knowing whether the defendant had abandoned the premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Feguer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>302 F.2d 214, 250 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 872 (1962), Judge, and later Justice, Blackmun, writing for the Eighth Circuit panel, disposed of the question as follows: \u201cThe defense\u2019s suggestion that the search . . . was unreasonable because the abandonment of the room by the defendant was not then known to the . . . police is somewhat intriguing but is, we feel, without substance. Abandonment in fact had been effected before the search. It was purposeful and voluntary and the room\u2019s search could not possibly have violated any constitutional right of the defendant.\u201d Citing <em>Feguer, </em>this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>observed, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 914, that \u201c[a] relinquishment of rights by abandonment does not depend on knowledge by the police that the abandonment has occurred.\u201d The nature of the defendant\u2019s leaving, which demonstrated his intentions, satisfies us that he had abandoned the premises, thereby giving up all right to privacy within them, when the search took place.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>Order allowing defendant\u2019s motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Additional indictments alleged assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and assault and battery.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 914 (in determining abandonment, court referenced defendant\u2019s flight to Arizona after discovering padlock on his door); <em>Parman </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 399 F.2d 559, 564 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 858 (1968) (Judge, later Justice, Burger upheld a finding of abandonment \u201cpremised on the fact that Appellant fled Washington almost immediately after the crime was committed and was in Ohio, registered under an assumed name at a tourist home, when the search occurred\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In his ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge wrote, \u201cHere, the police entered the room and seized all the items at issue in this motion on the same day that the crime was committed. There was no time for them to have decided that the defendant was not coming back.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Given our conclusion that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy after the incident and prior to the search and that he had abandoned the premises, Bums also certainly had the right to consent to the search of the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
