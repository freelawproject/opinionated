App. Ct. 453, 457 (1984), is this dispute over whether Joseph Frazier ever acquired title to 1586 Main Street, Concord (property) by adverse possession. The question comes before us in the form of a claim by Albert J. Lawrence, Frazier\u2019s devisee, for damages under G. L. c. 79, \u00a7 14, following an eminent domain taking by the town of Concord that attempted to quiet title to the property. Lawrence appeals from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Superior Court judge\u2019s determination, on cross motions for summary judgment, that title was in the town through a specific devise rather than in Lawrence via adverse possession obtained by Joseph Frazier.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We conclude that Frazier did not attain the requisite \u201copen and notorious\u201d possession to acquire title by adverse possession. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the town and the denial of Lawrence\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>For present purposes, the history of the property begins in 1941 with Mary J. Burke, the record owner. On August 27, 1941, Burke executed a holographic will leaving the property to her daughter, Helen Burke Boyer, for fife, \u201cnever to be sold.\u201d The will directed that when Helen died, the property should go to Burke\u2019s adopted daughter (and Helen\u2019s sister) Harriet Burke Frazier, and that if Harriet died with no surviving children, then the property should go to the town \u201cto be used as they see fit and proceeds from same to be used for better education of some deserving children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">After Mary Burke\u2019s death in 1942, her will was probated in Middlesex County. The probate petition was filed by Helen, the nominated executrix and an heir at law, and was assented to by Harriet, the decedent\u2019s only other heir at law and next of kin. The petition, which was approved without publication, did not indicate, nor was it required to, that the town had any interest in the property. Nothing in the probate record evidences any notice to the town as a contingent beneficiary. Lawrence does not contend that notice was sent, and the town asserts that it received no notice. Such a notice requirement was not enacted until 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In November, 1964, Helen conveyed her life estate in the property to her sister, Harriet. On May 18, 1965, Harriet died childless, survived only by her husband, Joseph Frazier, with whom she resided. Harriet\u2019s death certificate listed the property as her permanent residence. Upon Harriet\u2019s dying childless, the property passed to the town under the will of Mary Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In an inheritance tax filing prepared for the Commonwealth, Frazier correctly omitted the property and reported that the only real estate of which Harriet had died seized was a parcel on Lexington Road, Concord, held with him as tenants by the entirety. Because Harriet\u2019s interest in the property ended when she died childless, upon her death she had no interest in the property, which passed to the town not through her estate, but through that of Mary Burke.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">With the town unaware that the contingent devise from Mary Burke had ripened into ownership, Frazier continued what, to the town and all the world, appeared to be the same use of the property as when Harriet was alive: he treated the property as his own. From 1968 to 1973 Frazier rented the property to at least two different tenants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From January 1, 1974, until his death on December 24, 1996, Frazier resided at the property, treating it as his primary residence. Frazier gardened and sat out on the porch. His neighbors, many of whom were close friends, believed he owned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">From 1965 until 1972, Frazier paid the property taxes, which were assessed in the name of \u201cHarriet Burke Frazier.\u201d Similarly, from 1972 until 1979, he paid the taxes assessed to \u201cThe Estate of Harriet Burke Frazier.\u201d In 1980, for reasons not evident from the record, the property came to be assessed in the name of \u201cJoseph G. Frazier.\u201d Frazier paid these tax bills as well. In 1993, during a meeting to discuss his estate, Frazier declined to have a title search run on the property, stating that it would \u201copen a can of worms.\u201d By his will, which was allowed by the Middlesex Probate Court on February 24, 1997, Frazier devised \u201call [his] right, title and interest\u201d in the property to Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">On April 28, 1997, the town first learned of its interest in the property when counsel for Frazier\u2019s estate wrote to the town\u2019s legal counsel, advising of the town\u2019s potential interest and of Frazier\u2019s adverse possession claim. On June 22, 1998, in order to quiet the title, the town seized the property by eminent domain for \u201cmunicipal purposes, including the future sale thereof.\u201d As the owner, the town did not pay itself damages and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>did not compensate Lawrence for the taking. This action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">2. <em>Adverse possession. </em>The elements of adverse possession are well known and oft-recited. A claimant must prove nonpermissive use that is actual, continuous, open, notorious, exclusive, and adverse for twenty years. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. 251, 262 (1964). <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 621-622 (1992). <em>Totman </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>431 Mass. 143, 145 (2000). <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>McGillvary, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 902, 903 (1993). The burden of proof rests on the claimant and \u201cextends to all of the necessary elements of such possession.\u201d <em>Mendonca </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Oil Co. of Pa., </em>354 Mass. 323, 326 (1968), quoting from <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>324 Mass. 450, 453 (1949). Further, \u201c[t]he acts of the wrongdoer are to be construed strictly and \u2018the true owner is not to be barred of his right except upon clear proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Bessel, </em>213 Mass. 74, 76 (1912), quoting from <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>11 Cush. 206, 210 (1853).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We need not dwell upon whether Frazier\u2019s possession was exclusive, continuous, and adverse to the town\u2019s ownership for a period of at least twenty years. The evidence was ample, and essentially uncontradicted, that, from 1965 until Frazier\u2019s death in 1996, it was each of these things. By all appearances, Frazier used the property as any owner would.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Whether Frazier\u2019s use was \u201copen\u201d presents a more metaphysical inquiry, but one of no legal consequence because, however analyzed, his use was not open and notorious. To create a prescriptive right, the claimant\u2019s use must be both open and notorious. See <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 218 (1955). \u201cTo be open the use must be made without attempted concealment. To be notorious it must be known to some who might reasonably be expected to communicate their knowledge to the owner if he maintained a reasonable degree of supervision over his premises.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from 2 American Law of Property \u00a7 8.56 (Casner ed. 1952). Both requirements serve the same essential purpose: to secure to the property owner a fair chance of protecting himself. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe guiding principle behind the elements of adverse possession is ... to provide notice to the true owner, allowing for the legal vindication of property rights.\u201d <em>Totman </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>431 Mass. at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Whether analyzed under the rubric of \u201copen\u201d or \u201cnotorious,\u201d Frazier\u2019s use fails the fundamental test of adverse possession. Here, the town neither knew, nor reasonably could have known, of its interest in the property. Moreover, Frazier concealed that of which only he, and no one else with an interest in the property, was aware: that upon Harriet Frazier\u2019s dying childless, the property passed to the town under Mary Burke\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Frazier\u2019s use was not open so as to put the town on notice that its property rights were at risk. Although Frazier did not attempt to conceal that he was using the property, his use was not open because the true owner, the town, neither knew nor reasonably should have known of its ownership or that the nature of Frazier\u2019s use changed when Harriet died, becoming adverse to the town\u2019s ownership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Neither was Frazier\u2019s use notorious. Nothing in Frazier\u2019s conduct or use should have alerted the town, or anyone else, to the town\u2019s interest. See <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. at 218. Other than Frazier himself, there was no one with actual or constructive knowledge that Harriet\u2019s interest in the property ended when she died childless. Similarly, other than Frazier, whose interest was contrary, there was no one either with knowledge that Mary Burke\u2019s specific devise to the town was being thwarted or with an interest in ascertaining that her devise be honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">There is a critical difference between knowing whether one has been dispossessed of land and knowing whether one has any interest in the land. \u201cFrom the standpoint of the true owner, the purpose of the various requirements of adverse possession \u2014 that the nonpermissive use by another be actual, open, notorious, exclusive and adverse \u25a0\u2014 is to put him on notice of the hostile activity of the possession so that he, the owner, may have an opportunity to take steps to vindicate his rights by legal action.\u201d <em>Ottavia </em>v. <em>Savarese, </em>338 Mass. 330, 333 (1959). If, as here, the true owner does not know, and could not reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>have known, that there were property rights to protect, then the purpose is rendered irrelevant. The effect is especially pernicious where, as here, Frazier\u2019s possession began permissively under a testamentary devise to his late wife and where the town acquired title pursuant to a testamentary contingent remainder of which it had no notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">To underscore the importance of notice in adverse possession cases that begin with a tenant\u2019s permissive use, we have h\u00e9ld that \u201cthere is and should be a heavy burden on the lessee or licensee to show by clear evidence that the use has shifted at some point from permissive to adverse, so as to put the owner on clear notice that he should take steps to protect his rights.\u201d <em>Begg </em>v. <em>Ganson, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 221 (1993). Because Frazier\u2019s possession began under his late wife\u2019s life tenancy and continued, at least until 1980, in his deceased wife\u2019s name or that of her estate, his claim may rightly be compared to that of an adverse possessor whose tenancy began as a permissive use. A tenant in such a position cannot pretend for twenty years that his use was permissive and then claim title to the land. Neither should Frazier, who cloaked the adverse nature of his own possession under his wife\u2019s once legitimate property interests and worked to perpetuate the town\u2019s ignorance of its interest, gain title via adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Lawrence reads <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 456-457, too broadly in support of the proposition that an owner need not have knowledge that he is dispossessed. (\u201cRequiring actual knowledge of disseisin \u2018would deprive the principle of prescription of much of its value in quieting controversy and giving sanction to long continued usages.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. at 217-218.) There, because of exclusive possession and use by a cotenant for a period exceeding ninety years, the court deemed an absent cotenant to have slept on his rights for so long a period as to support a determination of knowledge and of ouster sufficient to be nonpermissive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Allen </em>is entirely consistent with the requirement that, while an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>owner need not <em>actually </em>know of the adverse possessor\u2019s presence and actions on his property, the adverse possessor\u2019s actions must be such that the owner, if he were reasonably vigilant, should know of the adverse possessor\u2019s use of his property. \u201cThe underlying inquiry, however, has always been what knowledge the absent party \u2018must be deemed to have had.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Batchelder, supra </em>at 457, quoting from <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>139 Mass. 268, 274 (1885). A court will infer knowledge, whether it be knowledge of seisin, or dispossession, or of another element of adverse possession, when the facts warrant such an inference. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the town did not know and could not reasonably have known of its ownership.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No inference of knowledge would be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Similarly unpersuasive is Lawrence\u2019s argument, grounded in a line of tax taking cases, that the town should have known of its contingent remainder interest in Mary Burke\u2019s will. See <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Jaeckle, </em>371 Mass. 573, 579-580 (1976); <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 592, 594 (1984) (\u201cthe board of assessors is charged not only with constructive knowledge of the contents of the records in the county\u2019s registry of deeds, but may also be charged with knowledge of the contents of records in the county\u2019s registry of probate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We refuse to extend a principle which protects a party\u2019s rights in tax takings to Frazier\u2019s claim of adverse possession. A municipality can hardly be expected to read every will probated in every county in Massachusetts, or, if the landowner is a nonresident, in the country at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Finally, we view the precision of the inheritance tax filing, signed by Frazier, as suggestive of Frazier\u2019s awareness, as Harriet\u2019s surviving spouse, that he no longer had an interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>property and that, upon Harriet\u2019s death, the property had passed to the town.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarly, we view Frazier\u2019s tax payments to the town when the property was assessed in the name of his late wife, and then her estate, as an attempt to further the belief of the town and others that the property was his late wife\u2019s and had passed through her estate. By continuing to treat the property after Harriet\u2019s death as he had during Harriet\u2019s life tenancy, Frazier concealed from the town the true nature of his possession and the town\u2019s ownership. In a sense, Frazier perpetuated his concealment in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Lawrence concedes that the statute of limitations for recovery of land may not run when there is evidence of fraud on the part of the adverse possessor. <em>Sunter </em>v. <em>Sunter, </em>190 Mass. 449, 455-456 (1906). See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>172 Mass. 395 (1899) (noting no evidence of fraud on adverse possessor\u2019s part). Although Frazier\u2019s actions do not quite amount to fraud, they suggest concealment and a willingness to perpetuate the town\u2019s ignorance of its interest in the property under circumstances where Frazier was in a unique position to know of that interest and the town was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In sum, upon the peculiar facts of this case, where the town neither knew, nor reasonably could have known that it acquired an ownership interest in the property when Harriet Frazier died childless, and where Frazier himself undoubtedly knew of and concealed that interest, Frazier\u2019s possession was not open and notorious. It would be a perversion of adverse possession and of the testamentary wishes of Mary Burke if by his conduct Frazier could circumvent the specific devise of Mary Burke\u2019s will and make himself the residuary devisee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">See G. L. c. 192, \u00a7 12, enacted in 1954, providing for notice to beneficiaries by the executor within three months of allowance of the will. When Mary Burke\u2019s will was probated, the executrix and the heirs at law were the only persons interested and entitled to notice.'</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">During this period Frazier lived at the Lexington Road property, from which he operated a convenience store.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Although the facts establish that Frazier attempted to conceal, or, more benignly, neglected to disclose to the town its ownership interest, he did not conceal that he was using the property. On this view, his use was \u201copen,\u201d while concealment of the town\u2019s ownership interest was ongoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Lawrence also cites cases involving boundary disputes to support the contention that a true owner need not know his property rights are being infringed for an adverse possessor to gain title. See, e.g., <em>Boutin </em>v. <em>Perreault, </em>343 Mass. 329 (1961). However, knowledge of a boundary is different in kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>from knowledge of ownership. In boundary cases, many of which originated in an era of less precision than is now available with modern surveying and global positioning techniques, the focus is upon the owner\u2019s vigilance against a neighbor\u2019s conduct infringing upon the owner\u2019s known property, along imprecise boundary lines. In contrast, when an owner is ignorant entirely of the fact of ownership, the focus is different. Nothing about Frazier\u2019s use should have alerted the town that its property rights were threatened because the town was entirely, and understandably, unaware of such rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Additionally, in <em>Allen </em>there was no evidence that any member of the Allen family ever took steps to conceal from the Batchelders that they were once devised an interest in the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">We take note of the fact that Frazier was Harriet\u2019s spouse in 1942 at the time of the probating of Mary Burke\u2019s will and in 1964 upon the conveyance by Helen Burke Boyer to Harriet, and that as Harriet\u2019s spouse he would have an interest in any property which she owned and of which she died seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Because we conclude Frazier did not obtain title through adverse possession, we need not address the town\u2019s argument that the portion of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, which was enacted in 1987 and which prevents the statute of limitations for recovery of land from running when a town holds land for a public purpose, applies to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
