Having determined that this case implicates the principles expounded in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meier, ante </em>278 (2002), a case heard by the same panel of this court, we conclude that evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to communicate her threats to the victim was lacking. Consequently, we reverse and set aside the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\"><em>Facts. </em>Robin and Jeffrey Furst married in January, 1998, and separated in October of that same year. Through Jeffrey, Robin became acquainted with one George Carson, who lived with the couple for several months after they married. Jeffrey had known Carson since 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>After the couple separated, Robin had approximately thirty conversations with Carson during the spring and summer of 1999, in which she expressed anger at Jeffrey and stated that she wanted \u201csomething bad\u201d to happen to him. Carson testified that in one of the earliest conversations, Robin told him, \u201cI\u2019d like to see [Jeffrey] killed. I\u2019d like to see him disappear.\u201d Later, in June, 1999, Robin asked Carson to \u201c[t]ake care of [Jeffrey],\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you take care of him. I\u2019d like to have him disappear.\u201d In July, 1999, Robin and Carson met several times, and she repeated to Carson that she wanted Jeffrey \u201ctaken care of\u201d and for him to \u201cdisappear.\u201d In sum, Carson testified, \u201cshe wanted him dead.\u201d Although she did not suggest how this might be accomplished, on one occasion she offered Carson money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On another, she offered him sex if he were to kill Jeffrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In July, 1999, Carson informed Jeffrey about the substance of his conversations with Robin. Jeffrey testified that following these revelations, he was in a state of \u201cshock and fear\u201d and that he spoke with his attorney and a representative of the Boston police department. Robin never communicated her remarks directly to Jeffrey, nor did she tell Carson to relay them to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Menacing words alone, even those that express a threat to commit a crime, do not constitute an offense under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2. For a statutory violation to occur, such words must first be communicated in some manner to the defendant\u2019s intended victim, directly or through an intermediary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 520, 525-526 (2002). But it is not enough that threatening words reach their target. \u201cThe Commonwealth must [also] prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant intended that her threats be communicated to [the victim].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meier, supra </em>at 282. Thus, assuming that Robin\u2019s various statements to Carson that she wanted Jeffrey killed were \u201cthreats\u201d within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ing of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they are not punishable under that statute unless, among other things, Robin also intended that Carson communicate them to Jeffrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In cases where a defendant utters a threat directly to her proposed victim, the defendant\u2019s intent to communicate the threat is apparent. But in circumstances where a threat is relayed to its ultimate recipient by a third party, the Commonwealth must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant intended that the threat be communicated through the intermediary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meier, supra </em>at 282. In such cases, the defendant\u2019s intent need not be express and may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, when a defendant utters a threat to a third party who \u2018would likely communicate it to [the ultimate target],\u2019 ... the defendant\u2019s act constitutes evidence of her intent to communicate the threat to the intended victim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Troy T., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Even when considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence here does not support the conclusion that Robin intended Carson to relay her statements to Jeffrey. Where the defendant took Carson into her confidence and sought his help to kill her estranged husband, it cannot reasonably be inferred that she intended Carson to inform Jeffrey of her remarks. The defendant approached Carson as a potential partner in crime, and not as one who would likely communicate her statements to the intended victim. Because the Commonwealth failed to produce sufficient evidence to satisfy any rational trier of fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Carson\u2019s disclosures to Jeffrey were intended by the defendant, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>essential element of the crime charged, the defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADX\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AK0\">\n<em>Judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Apparently, Robin maintained that Jeffrey owed her $50,000, and told Carson that if he could get that back for her, she would give him a portion of the money. It is not clear from Carson\u2019s testimony that she intended the money to be payment for harming Jeffrey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Although the defendant was charged with threatening to commit a crime (the killing of her husband) in violation of G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, there is no indication in the record that she was charged with the more obvious offense, on these facts, of soliciting Carson to commit a crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barsell, </em>424 Mass. <em>737, </em>738 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>135 Mass. 545, 549 (1883) (\u201cThe solicitation of \u2018another to commit a felony or other aggravated offence\u2019 is an \u2018indictable offence at common law\u2019 in Massachusetts\u201d). Although we assume, for purposes of this opinion, that Robin\u2019s remarks to Carson were threats, we do not decide whether a solicitation to commit a crime per se constitutes a threat to commit the same offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
