We address the scope of Markel\u2019s obligation to defend an employee of the Society, Faith Willard, under a general liability policy containing an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>exclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs instituted this declaratory judgment action to recover a settlement amount paid by the Society that exceeded the limit of the Massachusetts commercial automobile policy provided by Arbella Mutual Insurance Company (Ar-bella), as well as to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred on behalf of Willard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge concluded that the severability of interests clause in the Markel policy entitled Willard \u201cto coverage on claims of negligent supervision and negligent failure to follow camp rules and policies.\u201d On appeal, Markel asserts that the judgment in favor of Willard was error because the policy clearly and unambiguously excludes coverage for claims for \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 . . . arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any . . . \u2018auto\u2019 . . . owned or operated by . . . any insured.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The Society is the named insured on the Markel commercial general liability policy, whereas Willard is an insured under the policy in her capacity as an employee of the camp; she is also an insured as executive officer and director of the corporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commercial general liability policy contains a severability of interests clause which states in pertinent part that \u201cthis insurance applies . . . [separately to each insured against whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>claim is made or \u2018suit\u2019 is brought.\u201d Willard, relying on <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240 (1986), argues that this clause provides coverage for the negligent supervision claims against her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In <em>Mamell, </em>the parents of Michael Mamell, who owned and insured his own automobile, were sued for negligent supervision of a party held in their home. Michael, who was emancipated<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but then under the legal age for drinking alcohol, left the party in his car while intoxicated and was involved in a fatal accident. A provision in the parents\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance policy excluded coverage for bodily injury arising out of the insured\u2019s ownership or use of a motor vehicle. The court concluded that the parents, who neither owned nor operated the motor vehicle, were \u201cnot preclude[d] . . . from obtaining coverage in connection with the . . . tort action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244-245.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Willard argues that because she did not own or operate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>automobile, the severability of interests clause in the Markel policy provides coverage for negligent supervision claims against her. Although we proceed on the assumption that the claims are against Willard in her capacity as an employee of the camp, we note that she is also an executive officer and a director of the Society.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The claims against Willard involve actions falling within the scope of Willard\u2019s employment for which the Society is vicariously hable. <em>Wang Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986). The Society purchased (from Arbella) a Massachusetts commercial automobile insurance policy that insured Willard for the alleged negligent acts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We think that when the real party in interest, here the Society (which, as we have noted, paid $135,000 toward the settlement that resolved the claims against it and Willard), seeks coverage or payment, directly or through what amounts to subrogation, under its general liability policy for the consequences of an injury caused by a motor vehicle it owns, the principles of <em>Marnell </em>are inapplicable and the vehicle owner \u201cis not entitled to be defended againstf, or reimbursed for payments made to resolve,] claims of negligent supervision ... or against analogous claims.\u201d <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 353, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>358 (1990). Accord <em>Ayer </em>v. <em>Imperial Cas. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>418 Mass. 71, 74 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The judgment is vacated and a new judgment is to enter declaring that Markel Insurance Company is not obligated to defend or indemnify Willard in connection with the underlying claims against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The Society has not appealed the entry of summary judgment declaring that, due to the motor vehicle exclusion, Markel had no duty to defend or indemnify the Society.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The underlying claims arose from a one-car roll-over accident in which a fifteen year old camper, Stephen Home, was seriously injured. The car, owned by the Society, was operated by a camp counsellor, Mark Inchley. The settlement required the release of all claims against the plaintiffs and paid $635,000 to the injured camper. Arbella paid its policy limits, $500,000, and the Society paid the remaining $135,000. Arbella is not a party to this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Because we agree with Markel that the policy excludes coverage for the underlying claims, we need not reach its other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The Markel policy states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">\u201cSECTION II - WHO IS AN INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae1\">\u201c1.

During settlement negotiations, the injured camper\u2019s counsel forwarded a copy of a proposed complaint to counsel for the camp. The proposed complaint was forwarded to Markel.

At the same time, the purpose of the severability clause is served because coverage [under the homeowners\u2019 policy] is extended to insureds who neither owned nor operated the motor vehicle involved in the accident.\u201d <em>Worcester Mut.
