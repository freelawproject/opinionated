Raymond C., Richard W., and Diane L. Bateman, abutters to the land,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. A judge of that court decided the board had acted within its authority. On appeal, the Batemans argue as follows: (1) Wylie\u2019s proposed use of the land overloads an easement which serves her property; (2) the judge\u2019s findings fail to support the grant of a variance from required frontage or the grant of a special permit to construct more than one building; and (3) Wylie requires a special permit because her proposed use does not fall within the agricultural use exemption to the zoning law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that there was no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Wylie wishes to construct a riding stable on a thirty-six acre site (locus) situated off Jewett Street and Hazen Court in Georgetown. The locus consists of four contiguous parcels: three lower lots and one larger upper lot. Wylie entered into a contract with the owner of the land, Arnold Belkin, to purchase the locus subject to the necessary approval.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Over the Batemans\u2019 property abutting the locus runs a forty-foot wide easement from Jewett Street, a public way, to the three lower parcels. The locus is oddly shaped, somewhat resembling a pork chop. The three lower parcels depend on the easement for access to a public way.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The shape of the combined properties and the three lower lots\u2019 absence of frontage resulted from a 1951 eminent domain taking by the Commonwealth for Interstate Route 95 (1-95). The Commonwealth took portions of the three lower lots that had direct frontage on Jewett Street. At the same time as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>taking, the Commonwealth took the forty-foot wide easement in the Batemans\u2019 property to enable the then owners of the three lower lots to access Jewett Street, thereby ameliorating damage to the parcels. Specifically, the easement was taken by the Department of Public works \u201cin behalf of owners of land whose rights of access [to Jewett Street] and egress therefrom would otherwise become inoperative due to the limited access provisions of said State highway layout, and consists] of the right to enter on said parcels of land at any time to construct, ... maintain and use, roadways ... as the various persons in whose behalf said easements are taken may require.\u201d The easement over the Bateman\u2019s land further stated that said parcel is \u201chereby taken in behalf of Philip Belkin, Arnold Belkin and Barnet Bamstein.\u201d Belkin later acquired full ownership of the three lower parcels and the fourth upper parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"A_r\">The fourth, upper parcel also depends on an easement for access to a public way. This parcel is benefited by a separate twenty-foot wide easement, also over the Batemans\u2019 land. That easement was created by an 1870 deed. As the Land Court judge found in related litigation in Belkin vs. Bateman, Land Court, Misc. Case No. 176674 (November 27, 1995),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the language of the 1870 deed of the right of way expressed a grant in general terms because it did not limit access to a particular use or scope. The Superior Court judge here found that the second easement mns adjacent to the forty-foot wide easement.</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">Wylie plans to construct an enclosed one-story riding arena, a one-story barn with a caretaker\u2019s apartment, and a one-story ranch style home on the three lower lots. The judge found that Wylie proposes to use the stable as a \u201cdressage facility, meaning that horses and riders will be trained in the dressage style which requires that horse and rider train to compete singly and not in groups or classes.\u201d There will also be fifteen parking spaces beside the barn. To exercise the horses, she plans to build seven fenced paddocks of various sizes and an outdoor sand riding rink. The upper eighteen-acre parcel will contain a portion of the sand riding rink and a portion of two riding paddocks. The remainder of the upper parcel is undeveloped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>and includes wetlands. Wylie\u2019s plans do not extend any road into the upper parcel. The gravel driveway she plans to build will be constructed over the forty-foot wide easement and will be twenty feet wide. It would lead into the lower three parcels of land where the buildings are situated. Wylie plans to light the driveway and plant shrubbery to minimize the effect of the light on the Batemans. The structures Wylie plans to build are situated from 700 to more than 1,000 feet away from structures on the Batemans\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">2. <em>Overloading of the easement. </em>The Batemans take issue with the Superior Court\u2019s finding that the forty-foot wide easement \u201ccan be used to access the entire locus,\u201d including the upper parcel. Relying on decisions in which appurtenant easements were negotiated by private parties without referencing after-acquired property, the Batemans argue that this case is governed by the principle that \u201cafter-acquired property . . . may not be added to the dominant estate without the express consent of the owner of the servient estate [and] absent such consent, the use of an easement to benefit property located beyond the dominant estate constitutes an overburdening of the easement.\u201d <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amherst, </em>422 Mass. 359, 364 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201cThe principles of interpretation designed to give effect to the express or implied intent of parties contracting for or acquiring an interest in land, however, are, in general, inapplicable to eminent domain proceedings.\u201d <em>Mugar </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 445 (1990). The Bate-mans never negotiated the original easement or staked out the extent of their rights; rather, the Commonwealth took the easement in the Batemans\u2019 land to remedy the elimination of access and egress caused by the 1-95 takings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u201cThe basic question where the interest was acquired by eminent domain is what interest the taking authority intended to acquire [and in our case, convey] as shown by the relevant documents.\u201d <em>Boorstein </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy., </em>370 Mass. 13, 17 n.6 (1976). The documents unequivocally provide an easement granting access and egress rights over the Bateman property to benefit the bottom three parcels. Less obvious is whether the easement is overloaded when the activities on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>dominant estate benefitting from the easement extend into after-acquired property not explicitly addressed in the easement. Given the special circumstances of this case, we conclude that there is no overloading of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Here, a second easement burdens the Bateman property providing access and egress for the upper parcel. As the Land Court judge found, \u201cPursuant to the express terms of the grant, the ser-vient estate is to contain a right of way that provides access to the dominant estate \u2018at all times without let or hindrance.\u2019 \u201d The language of the easement was found to express a grant \u201cin general terms because it does not limit access to a particular use or scope.\u201d Belkin vs. Bateman, <em>supra. </em>The second easement, therefore, authorizes access to the upper parcel through the Bate-man estate for the activities at issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, this easement runs adjacent to the forty-foot wide easement. Thus, as a practical matter, given the existence of the second unrestricted, adjacent easement, no new burden, not previously authorized, would be imposed on the Bateman estate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">It also does not make any sense to require the use of two separate adjacent easements to the same horse farm, with the easement to be used dependent upon whether a horse may be frolicking in a particular part of a paddock. We, therefore, agree that the forty-foot wide easement has not been overloaded; the trial judge correctly concluded that the easement may be used to benefit the entire locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">3. <em>Variance and special permit. </em>The Batemans further claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>that the Superior Court judge erred in upholding the board\u2019s grant of a variance from the by-law\u2019s frontage requirements and grant of a special permit to construct more than one building. The board found that Wylie had met the four requirements set out in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10, for a variance: (1) \u201cthat owing to circumstances relating to soil condition, shape, or topography of such land\u201d (2) \u201ca literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or the by-law would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner\u201d; (3) the \u201crelief may be granted without substantial harm to the public good\u201d; and (4) the relief may be granted \u201cwithout nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of such ordinance or bylaw.\u201d See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>383 Mass. 1, 9 (1981). The judge upheld the board\u2019s decision. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In upholding the grant of the variance, the judge found that the \u201cshape of the lot resulted wholly from the actions of the Commonwealth through its powers of eminent domain which deprived the locus of any frontage and was created by no fault of the current or previous owners.\u201d The judge further found that the unique shape of the lot was not characteristic of other lots in the area. She also found that, without a variance from the bylaw\u2019s frontage requirements, the entire substantial locus would be unbuildable. These findings are amply supported by the evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The legal conclusion the judge drew from her findings is equally supported by our case law, in which we have held that an oddly shaped lot with no frontage created a substantial hardship when the lack of frontage and shape resulted through no fault of the appellant. See <em>Paulding </em>v. <em>Bruins, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 711 (1984) (finding that pork chop-shaped lot was a factor contributing to uniqueness); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Brolly, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 4 (1998) (owner did not create his own hardship where taking precluded the consummation of land swap designed to secure necessary frontage; variance properly granted for \u201c \u2018pork chop\u2019 lot unlike any other in the neighborhood\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Similarly, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the variance will not harm the public good was well supported. The judge found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>any increase in traffic would be minimal. She emphasized the following: (1) Wylie proposes to use the stable as a dressage facility, which means that riders will typically come to the locus singularly or in small groups; (2) even for larger events, the number of cars traveling to the farm will remain small, as the parking lot accommodates only fifteen cars; and (3) the board restricted the horse farm\u2019s hours of operation, so traffic will be limited at night. The judge\u2019s conclusion that the grant would not \u201cnullify or substantially derogate the intent or purpose of the by-law\u201d also had adequate factual basis. The judge found that the locus exceeded the by-law requirements in every aspect except frontage and that the proposed use would maintain the locus\u2019s rural character.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">As for the special permit, the judge found that the thirty-six acre size of the locus greatly exceeded the 40,000 square feet necessary for the erection of a single house. This finding supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that Wylie satisfied her burden of showing that the board\u2019s decision allowing three buildings on the locus was not arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or based on legally untenable grounds. See <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Natick, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 1002, 1004 (1981) (burden of going forward with evidence rests on the party seeking to establish the validity of a variance or special permit); <em>ACW Realty Mgmt., Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westfield, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 242, 246 (1996) (if supported by facts found by the trial judge, the board\u2019s decision may be disturbed only if it is based on a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">4. <em>Agricultural use. </em>Finally, the Batemans argue that Wylie requires a special permit to use the locus as a public stable and riding academy. They argue that the board and the court erred in concluding that the proposed use was agricultural and thus exempt from the proscriptions of the town\u2019s zoning by-law. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 3, provides as follows: \u201c[N]or shall any [zoning] ordinance or by-law prohibit, unreasonably regulate or require a special permit for the use of land for the primary purpose of agriculture.\u201d Wylie\u2019s proposed use falls squarely within this exemption. See <em>Steege </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stow, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 970 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Wylie proposes to use the locus to raise, train, and board her own and others\u2019 horses. She also plans to coach riders, and to offer lessons and horses to people who do not own their own horses. The <em>Steege </em>decision concluded that a locus used \u201cfor raising, training, and boarding of horses; for giving riding lessons; and for the riding use of owners of the boarded horses\u201d fell under the agricultural use exemption. See <em>Steege </em>v. <em>Bd. of Appeals of Stow, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 970, 972. In that case, we noted that including such use in a definition of agriculture corresponded with \u201c[the word\u2019s] plain and ordinary meaning and its consistent and well-established . . . definition in other statutory contexts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 972. Cf. <em>Sturbridge </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 925-926 (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Wylie\u2019s use is agricultural; she therefore requires no special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The trial judge correctly concluded that the Batemans had standing to bring this appeal. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17; <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The Batemans\u2019 last argument, that the board\u2019s decision must be annulled because the board took additional evidence from Wylie after the close of the public hearing, is insufficiently developed to satisfy the requirements of Mass. R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), and is, accordingly, waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">During the course of the litigation Belkin died, and the land is currently owned by his estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"ARo\">We take judicial notice of this decision as requested by the Batemans. That decision was not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Although the specific issue of the use of the second easement for a riding academy and public stable was not before the Land Court in Belkin vs. Bate-man, <em>supra, </em>that decision, as explained above, demonstrates that the easement is unrestricted and would encompass such a use. See Part 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Wylie\u2019s proposed activities are also concentrated on the dominant Belkin estate with only a spillover onto the after-acquired upper parcel. All the buildings, parking areas, and roadway are to be located on the dominant estate. Contrast <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Mart Realty of Brockton, Inc., </em>348 Mass. 675, 679 (1965); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Amherst, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 168-169 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>422 Mass. 359 (1996). The activities proposed to be undertaken on the after-acquired property are relatively limited and are part and parcel of the activities centered on the dominant estate. Contrast <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>210 Mass. 302 (1911). To conclude that this spillover onto the upper parcel of portions of two of seven paddocks and a part of the sand rink overloads the forty-foot wide easement would elevate form over substance where the upper parcel also benefits from an unrestricted, adjacent easement over the Bateman estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Contrary to the Batemans\u2019 argument, we have not held that a farm must generate $500 in sales to qualify for the G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, exemption. In <em>Steege, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s ability to qualify for G. L. c. 61 A, \u00a7 3, tax status was one factor considered by the court in reaching its conclusion that the use was agricultural. See <em>Steege </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Stow, supra </em>at 971-972. A riding stable of the size and type proposed here would satisfy such a requirement without reference to the parcels\u2019 status under G. L. c. 61A, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
