L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 13C, and of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a knife), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. He appeals both convictions, asserting that (1) the debt the victim owed did not constitute a \u201cloan\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 13C, and the evidence was accordingly not sufficient to support the conviction; and (2) there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. Sometime in July, 1999, Kenneth Luciano agreed with one \u201cG\u201d or \u201cGC\u201d of New York that Luciano would sell drugs for \u201cG\u201d in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. \u201cG\u201d supplied Luciano with crack cocaine on the understanding that Luciano would sell the drugs and turn over to \u201cG\u201d certain sale proceeds. Luciano apparently did not do so, instead consuming the drugs with his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">On Labor Day, 1999, \u201cG,\u201d the defendant, and two others (a woman named Kelly McLennan and a man referred to as \u201cDan\u201d) drove to Great Barrington for the purpose of collecting the money and having the defendant \u201creplace\u201d Luciano as local drug distributor. After locating Luciano, the three men confronted him about the money he owed \u201cG.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the defendant struck Luciano on the head with a hard plastic toy, and Dan stabbed Luciano with a knife that \u201cG\u201d provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\"><em>Assault and battery for purposes of collecting a loan. </em>The defendant asserts that, while the transaction between \u201cG\u201d and Luciano resulted in a debt, it was not a loan, and, accordingly, the statute does not encompass the transaction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 13C, prohibits \u201cassault and battery upon another for the purpose of collecting a loan,\u201d but the statute does not itself define the word \u201cloan,\u201d and we are not aware of any appellate decision construing its meaning. \u201cUnless otherwise defined, it is usual to interpret the words [of a statute] as taking on their ordinary contemporary common meaning.\u201d 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:28, at 352 (6th ed. 2000). The defendant proposes in this regard a somewhat constrained definition of \u201cloan\u201d: the delivery of an item or money to another for temporary use. Under this definition, no loan occurred since the drugs furnished to Luciano <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>were not for his temporary use, later to be returned. On this view, Luciano may have incurred a debt, but there was no loan, \u201cloan\u201d being but a subset of \u201cdebt.\u201d Such a spare construction of the term \u201cloan,\u201d however, flies in the face of common sense and does not reflect its ordinary usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In essence, what happened here is that Luciano purchased the drugs on \u201ccredit\u201d: \u201cG\u201d gave Luciano drugs on the understanding that Luciano would pay him back with money. Perfectly legal transactions along the same lines, where goods are provided on the understanding that payment will later be made for them, are everyday occurrences. Such credit transactions, we think, fall squarely within the established meaning of \u201cloan.\u201d See <em>In re DePasquale, 225 </em>B.R. 830, 832 (Bankr. 1st Cir. 1998), quoting from <em>In re Johnson, </em>215 B.R. 750, 752 (Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1997), aff\u2019d, 218 B.R. 449 (Bankr. 8th Cir. 1998) (test for loan is \u201cwhether the creditor extended credit to the [djebtor . . . and whether the [djebtor promised to repay the amount of credit advanced\u201d). See also <em>Firstar Eagan Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Marquette Bank Minneapolis, N.A., </em>466 N.W.2d 8, 11 (Minn. Ct. App. 1991) (loan requires \u201can actual delivery of something to another and a promise of repayment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Finally, insofar as dictionaries reflect common usage and ordinary contemporary common meaning, we note that Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines loan as including \u201csomething lent for the borrower\u2019s temporary use on condition that it or its equivalent be returned.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1326 (1993). Further along these lines, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cloan\u201d to include \u201cthe creation of debt by a credit to an account with the lender upon which the debtor is entitled to draw immediately.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 936 (6th ed. 1990). Burton\u2019s Legal Thesaurus cites \u201cextension of credit\u201d as a synonym for \u201cloan.\u201d Burton, Burton\u2019s Legal Thesaurus 340 (3d ed. 1998). Providing another with drugs on the condition that payment for those drugs be made at a later date surely fits within these definitions. Accordingly, the statute encompasses the transaction shown by sufficient evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>have occurred and we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction of assault and battery for the purpose of collecting a loan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><em>Assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. </em>The defendant also contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon under a joint venture theory. He argues in this regard that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knew that \u201cG\u201d had a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">To be convicted as a joint venturer in a crime involving the coventurer\u2019s use of a weapon, it must be proven that the defendant knew at the time of the joint venture that the coven-turer had the weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>388 Mass. 536, 544 (1983). Here, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the defendant had planned with \u201cG\u201d and Dan to collect the money together from Luciano and that the defendant would thereafter replace Luciano as drug dealer for \u201cG.\u201d There was testimony that, when Luciano was confronted by the three men about the money owed to \u201cG,\u201d \u201ca knife [was] set down on the table.\u201d Indeed, the defendant struck the first blow before Dan stabbed Luciano with that knife. Such evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that the defendant knew of the knife, and that he shared the intent to participate in the victim\u2019s stabbing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 639, 643-644 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 488-489 (1977), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 985, 985-986 (1984), support his interpretation of the statute. If anything, <em>White </em>supports the Commonwealth\u2019s case, given our suggestion there that the defendant could have been indicted under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13C, for the use of violence in collecting a debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
