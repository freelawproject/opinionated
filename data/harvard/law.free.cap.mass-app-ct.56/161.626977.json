Schiappa, Jr., whose insurer, National Marine Underwriters, Inc. (National Marine), failed to pay a claim under a so-called \u201call risk\u201d contract of insurance. See <em>Standard Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 762, 763-768 (1973); <em>Mellon </em>v. <em>Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 933, 934-935 (1984). After a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, a District Court judge granted National Marine\u2019s motion, and judgment entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>in its favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A panel of the Appellate Division of the District Court subsequently affirmed. Schiappa now appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The material facts are not disputed. In 1989, Tiger Marine (Tiger) sold a Checkmate Convicor speedboat to Schiappa. He purchased the instant policy to cover the boat, and it was in effect in November, 1991. At that time, Schiappa contracted with Tiger to leave his boat at Tiger\u2019s boatyard for the installation of a new, more powerful engine and to find a buyer for the used one. Not much occurred during the winter months, but Schiappa did hear from Tiger that a buyer for his old engine had been found. In the summer of 1992, Schiappa discovered that his boat, still stored at Tiger\u2019s boatyard, had been \u201cstripped\u201d of most of its parts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Schiappa does not argue that Tiger converted the boat; rather, he argues that the theft of various parts by Tiger\u2019s employees or a third person or persons amounted to larceny and that coverage for theft is available under the policy. National Marine lays stress on an exclusion in Schiappa\u2019s policy that reads, in relevant part, \u201cThere is no coverage under any section of this policy if the unsecured yacht . . . [sustains damage d]ue to conversion, embezzlement, or secretion.\u201d In rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s theory and giving effect to the exclusionary language in the policy, the motion judge and the Appellate Division recognized the technical common-law distinctions between \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201cconversion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">That the parts may have been stolen would not defeat, but rather support recovery, as borne out by the detailed language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>of the policy that we have quoted. As we have noted, the policy has an exclusion for loss \u201cdue to conversion, embezzlement, or secretion,\u201d which is for the insurer to prove. <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Canadian Universal Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 375, 381 (1971). The exclusionary clause contemplates tortious abstraction of the boat proper, as where a bailee might secrete the entire boat, or embezzle or convert it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course, \u201cconversion\u201d is a loose term and in its broadest signification might extend even to physical damage to the boat, but such a reading of the term would also contradict the basic coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We view the case in simpler terms. The plain language of the policy and the reasonable expectations of the insured may be taken into account in construing the insurance contract. See <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers\u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 280-282 (1997). However, they are not decisive. See <em>Aguiar </em>v. <em>Generali Assicurazioni Ins. Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 687, 690-691 (1999); <em>County of Barnstable </em>v. <em>American Fin. Corp., </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 213, 215, 217-218 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In construing \u201call risk\u201d policies of insurance, \u201c[t]he \u2018risk\u2019 comprehended [in such policy] has been characterized as: \u2018a fortuitous event \u2014 a casualty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Standard Elec. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 764 (citation omitted). See <em>Bettigole </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 274 (1991). That type of protection extends to the kind of loss that is not usually covered under other insurance. See <em>H.R.G. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 374, 376 &amp; n.3 (1988). See Gor-man, All Risks of Loss v. All Loss: An Examination of Broad Form Insurance Coverages, 34 Notre Dame Law. 346, 353 (1959); Kelton &amp; Widiss, Insurance Law \u00a7 5.1(b)(1), at 462-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>463 (1988); Freedman, Richards on Insurance \u00a7 5:6, at 369-370 (6th ed. 1990); 1 Holmes, Appleman on Insurance 2d \u00a7 1.6, at 41-43 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In this case, not only is there no doubt that removal of parts of the boat is a \u201cfortuitous loss\u201d as that term has been defined, but it is also evident that other language contained in National Marine\u2019s policy extends coverage for the damage to Schiappa\u2019s boat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">\u201cWe may pay for loss in money or we may also repair or replace damaged or <em>missing parts </em>with parts of like kind or quality. If those parts are unavailable we will pay for the loss of those parts in money, at their current market value. Before we pay for or replace property stolen or <em>presumed stolen, </em>we may return it to you, with payment for any physical damage, less the applicable deductible .... If your insured yacht is stolen or <em>presumed stolen </em>and is not found, we will pay for the loss, less the applicable deductible, or at our option, replace the insured yacht with one of like kind and quality, less the applicable deductible. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">(Emphasis added.) This language, incident to the policy\u2019s \u201call risk\u201d statement of coverage, encompasses the situation here, and Schiappa carried his burden by showing that he discovered his boat \u201cstripped\u201d \u2014 that there were \u201cmissing parts\u201d that he \u201cpresumed [were] stolen\u201d while the boat was in Tiger\u2019s custody. See <em>Tumblin </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>344 Mass. 318, 320 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Our reading of the \u201cmissing parts\u201d clause, in conjunction with the \u201call risk\u201d statement of coverage, brings a measure of harmony to the policy as a whole. The wrongs to which the policy extends are those which cause damage to the boat, as well as theft of parts and the theft of the entire craft. Although the record below is less informative than one might wish, Schi-appa\u2019s summary judgment materials did provide an acceptable basis for us to conclude that significant parts of his boat were \u201cmissing.\u201d For its part, National Marine filed almost nothing to support its position, and the record contains no admissible evidence that would unsettle a conclusion in favor of coverage. Consequently, there were no genuine issues of material fact in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>To the extent that any ambiguity is created in the differing interpretation of the policy posed by the Appellate Division and National Marine, such that it would require proof of both \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201cconversion,\u201d we need not reach the question of whether the formal elements of a \u201ctheft\u201d were proven in this case. Compare <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co., </em>255 Mass. 528, 530 (1926); <em>Farnum </em>v. <em>Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co., </em>281 Mass. 364, 368 (1937); <em>Rich </em>v. <em>United Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>328 Mass. 133, 134 (1951); <em>Swift </em>v <em>American Univ. Ins. Co., </em>349 Mass. 637, 640-641 (1965). Instead, the \u201cmissing parts\u201d clause refers to coverage for \u201cmissing parts\u201d that are \u201cpresumed stolen,\u201d and Schiappa makes a similar point by noting that an analogous situation would occur if his boat had mysteriously disappeared. \u201cBecause recovery under an \u2018all-risks\u2019 policy generally requires only that the insured show that a fortuitous loss has occurred, in the case of a mysterious disappearance, a showing that loss has occurred is generally sufficient, although the insured may also be required to furnish a good faith explanation.\u201d 10 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 151:36 (3d ed. 1998). See <em>Atlantic Lines Ltd. </em>v. <em>American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>547 F.2d 11, 13 (2d Cir. 1976). There is no question that the removal of parts from Schiappa\u2019s boat constituted \u201cdamage\u201d under National Marine\u2019s policy. Indeed, if \u201call risk\u201d coverage were as narrow as asserted by National Marine, such a policy would have little utility. We venture, further, that the owner of a pleasure boat would be astonished and confounded to learn that \u201call risk\u201d insurance would not cover the situation where the craft was recovered in the disconsolate condition presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of Schiappa.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> After the District Court\u2019s ruling, Schiappa and National Marine stipulated to a dismissal without prejudice of Schiappa\u2019s ancillary claims under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\">In a separate action, Schiappa sued Tiger for the damage to his boat. A judgment entered for Schiappa in that suit, including a finding that the appraised value of his boat was $26,000. When combined with attorneys\u2019s fees assessed under G. L. c. 93 A, the damages amounted to almost $40,000. The judge in that case also found that Tiger\u2019s acts in failing to secure Schiappa\u2019s boat were knowing and wilful, thereby tripling the total judgment to over $100,000. Tiger has since undertaken a name change (to Tiger Electrical Services, Inc.) and apparently is bankrupt, and Schiappa has pursued this claim against National Marine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\">In affirming the judgment and rejecting Schiappa\u2019s arguments, the Appellate Division held that the \u201cconversion\u201d exclusion applied, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cThe difficulty with plaintiff\u2019s argument is that although all thefts encompass the elements of conversion all conversions do not encompass the elements of theft. . . . Therefor [sic], an insurance policy which provides coverage for theft of the plaintiff\u2019s boat while excluding coverage for conversion of the boat is not illusory, as although it allows an insurer to deny coverage for conversion of the vessel, it does not allow an insurer to deny coverage for theft of the vessel.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The insured himself could not recover if he was guilty of the abstraction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
