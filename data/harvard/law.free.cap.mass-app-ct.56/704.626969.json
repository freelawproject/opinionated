L. c. 41, \u00a7 100, and G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, is novel, the applicable principles of the law of arbitration are familiar. We decide that the provisions of \u00a7 100 do not preclude submission to arbitration of the question of entitlement to paid leave under \u00a7 11 IF, and that a motion by the city of Lawrence (city) to vacate an arbitration award that conferred paid leave was rightly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 100, as amended through St. 1970, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>c. 27, requires employers of police officers or fire fighters to indemnify them for medical expenses attendant on work-related injury, if the appointing authority determines that it \u201cis appropriate under all the circumstances.\u201d Chief among the relevant \u201ccircumstances\u201d is whether the medical expenses were, in fact, work related, i.e., causally related to something that happened to the officer or fire fighter on the job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 11 IF provides that a police officer or fire fighter who suffers an incapacitating injury on duty shall receive paid leave for the period of incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">1. <em>Background facts. </em>Robert Jackson, a patrolman on the Lawrence police force, suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) while on patrol duty on the morning of November 18, 1998. He applied promptly for paid leave on the ground that he had been injured on duty; i.e., he sought \u00a7 111F benefits. When Jackson returned to work in the spring of 1999, the city had not yet acted on his application for paid leave. It had received a letter dated May 21, 1999, from Timothy E. Guiney, M.D., one of several physicians who had treated Jackson, saying that the TLA was traceable to an embolus to the brain arising in the heart. That put in play G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94, the so-called \u201cHeart Law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The city sought an additional opinion from a medical claims administration service, Meditrol, Inc. An officer of Meditrol, whose training was in accounting, reviewed Jackson\u2019s medical records. His opinion was that the heart law presumption was not applicable and that Jackson\u2019s TIA was the product of a congenital, preexisting condition. Consequently, Meditrol advised, the city was not to reimburse Jackson\u2019s medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>expenses under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 100, or grant him paid leave under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">2. <em>The arbitration. </em>Lawrence Patrolmen\u2019s Association (union), as collective bargaining agent for the Lawrence patrolmen, entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the city on behalf of the patrolmen. Article XII of that agreement, devoted to the subjects of \u201cSick Leave, Injuries, Special Leave and Death Leave,\u201d provided in \u00a7 4 as to \u201cInjured Leave\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\u201cGeneral Laws [cjhapter 41, [sjection 111F shall be applied in cases of injury. Officers shall have twenty-four (24) hours to report injury in the line of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">After progressing through the requisite grievance stages, the union demanded arbitration on the question of paid leave for Jackson. A single arbitrator decided that the \u00a7 11 IF question was a proper subject of arbitration under the agreement, and he awarded Jackson incapacity leave pay from November 18, 1998, to the date Jackson resumed work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The city brought a complaint in Superior Court to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a)(3). A judge of the Superior Court concluded that the arbitrator had acted within his authority and denied the application to vacate the award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">3. <em>Arbitrability of dispute. </em>As previously noted, the subject of paid leave on account of injuries was part of the collective bargaining agreement and referred to the substantive rights conferred by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF. That statutory provision is among those enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), </em>as subordinate to the collective bargaining agreement in the event of conflict between the agreement and the statutory provision. Article XVI of the collective bargaining agreement, pertaining to \u201cGrievance Procedure,\u201d provides in \u00a7 1 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018grievance\u2019 shall be defined as any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">This is a so-called \u201cbroad\u201d arbitration clause that presumptively makes disputes under the agreement a subject of arbitration. <em>United Steelworkers of America </em>v. <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 576, 582-583 (1960). <em>Local No. 1710, Intl. Assn. of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. 417, 421-422 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Disputes under the agreement are to be arbitrated unless \u201cit may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 421.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Duxbury </em>v. <em>Duxbury Permanent Firefighters Assn., Local 2167, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 464-466 (2000). The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, compounded with the strong policy favoring arbitration when parties have agreed to it, <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. J. <em>Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990); <em>Danvers </em>v. <em>Wexler Constr. Co., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 160, 163 (1981), put solid ground under the conclusion of the arbitrator and the judge that the question of Patrolman Jackson\u2019s entitlement to injured leave pay under \u00a7 11 IF was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Even a broad clause, however, does not make arbitrable questions that a statute or agreement places beyond the authority of arbitrators. See <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>369 Mass. 683, 685 (1976); <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 338, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 127-128 (1992). See also the many authorities collected in <em>School Comm. of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 795 (1977), although in that case the court determined that there was not a statutory prohibition against the subject committed to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The city\u2019s argument for the proposition that G. L. c. 41, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u00a7 100, forbids submitting to arbitration questions arising under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, begins with the observation that \u00a7 100 is not among those statutes enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), </em>as subordinate to a collective bargaining agreement. Section 100 confers upon the appointing authorities of cities and towns discretion to determine whether an injury is work related and \u201cwhether indemnification is \u2018appropriate under all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Packish </em>v. <em>McMurtrie, </em>697 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1983). Without developing the thought by either authority or analysis, the city proceeds on the assumption that this function of appointing authorities is nondelegable and that entitlement to indemnification for medical expenses may not be submitted to arbitration. We think the question of the nondelegability of matters under \u00a7 100 is not free from doubt, but we need not decide it. For purposes of resolving the instant case, we are prepared to assume that a claim under \u00a7 100 is immune to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A major question in deciding claims under \u00a7 100 is whether the injury for which medical expenses are to be reimbursed was work related. The city contends its nonarbitrable decision that Jackson\u2019s medical expenses were not work related must, because there is overlapping subject matter, govern a decision whether he is entitled to paid leave under \u00a7 11 IF and, therefore, his \u00a7 11 IF claim is not arbitrable. In the absence of any language so suggesting in either \u00a7 100 or \u00a7 11 IF, we do not think that a decision maker under \u00a7 100 on medical reimbursement in connection with on-the-job <em>accidents </em>(see note 1, <em>supra), </em>binds, by some sort of administrative collateral estoppel, the decision maker under \u00a7 11 IF on paid leave for incapacity caused by injury on duty. As in the case of private agreements, we think that limitations on arbitration must be set forth with some clarity. See <em>Grobet File Co. of America </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 132, 135 (1988). The two sections of the statute are independent rather than interdependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">That \u00a7 11 IF issues may be the subject of a collective bargaining agreement is strongly suggested by the inclusion of \u00a7 11 IF among those provisions made subordinate by G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), </em>to a collective bargaining agreement in the event of conflict between the agreement and the statute. See particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Borghesi, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 661, 663-664 (1985), in which the court expressly ruled that a \u00a7 11 IF question was a proper subject of arbitration. Cf. <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Easton, 405 </em>Mass. 159, 164-165 (1989), in which the arbitrability of \u00a7 11 IF issues is implied. Other cases in which questions under \u00a7 11 IF were submitted to arbitration include <em>Duxbury </em>v. <em>Dux-bury Permanent Firefighters Assn., Local 2167, </em>supra; and <em>Reading </em>v. <em>Reading Patrolmen\u2019s Assn., Local 191, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 468 (2000). Cf. <em>Howcroft </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 581-582 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The question of Patrolman Jackson\u2019s paid leave claim under \u00a7 11 IF was properly submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator\u2019s findings, rulings, and award, in the absence of fraud (never here suggested) are binding. <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61-62 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1131 (2002). <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Hemisphere Hotel Mgmt., Inc., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 264 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">As the Superior Court judge correctly declined to vacate the arbitration award, we affirm the judge\u2019s order. Pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (if), the judge should have confirmed the award and entered judgment pursuant to it. See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 13. An order confirming the arbitration award and judgment pursuant thereto shall enter nunc pro tune as of September 8, 2000, the date of the Superior Court judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Paragraph 1 of \u00a7 100 provides that the employer shall determine whether the employee\u2019s medical expenses were \u201cincurred as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring or of undergoing a hazard peculiar to his employment, while acting in the performance and within the scope of his duty without fault of his own.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 94, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 610, provides that \u201cany condition of impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in total or partial disability or death to a uniformed member of a paid fire department or permanent member of a police department . . . shall, if he successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service ... be presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary be shown by competent evidence.\u201d Jackson\u2019s physical when he entered the force in 1975 did not turn up evidence of heart disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">That precise date is uncertain on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\">The parties put the case to the judge on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 756 (1974). In their presentation, however, the parties relied on materials outside the pleadings. The judge, therefore, converted the motions to ones for summary judgment. The docket reflects entry of an order allowing the union\u2019s motion. There is no docket entry of a final judgment but this does not deter review. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Neither party has furnished us with the entire collective bargaining agreement. Customarily, collective bargaining agreements provide that arbitration follows if a grievance is not resolved. See, e.g., <em>Local No. 1710, Intl. Assn. of Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. at 418-419. In their briefs the parties take for granted that arbitration is the last step in the grievance process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Illustrations of broad and narrow arbitration clauses and how their application plays out are discussed in the <em>Local 1710 </em>opinion, <em>supra </em>at 426-429.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
