The plaintiff paid part of the total premium in cash and financed the balance through a premium finance agreement (G. L. c. 255C, \u00a7 1, definition 4) with Main Street Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Agency, Inc. (Main), Empire\u2019s agent. The agreement, dated January 3,1974, included a promissory note signed by the plaintiff payable to Main in monthly installments; Main assigned the agreement to Colony Finance Corp. (Colony). In her complaint the plaintiff alleged that the premium finance agreement did not meet the disclosure requirements of G. L. c. 140C and G. L. c. 255C and sought to have the three defendants subjected to the penalty prescribed by G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(b). The plaintiff also claimed that a notice of cancellation of her policy sent by Colony to Empire was ineffective to permit Empire to cancel the policy and that she was therefore entitled to recover from the defendants her losses arising from an automobile accident in which she was involved on June 29, 1974, five days after the notice of cancellation purported to become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The judge filed findings of fact and an order for judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), and on the same day entered a judgment declaring that the cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s policy was void and that the policy was in full force and effect on the date of the accident. The judgment further provided that the plaintiff recover from the defendants jointly and severally her losses arising from the automobile accident. The judge\u2019s findings of fact were silent on the question whether the premium finance agreement met the disclosure requirements of G. L. c. 140C and G. L. c. 255C, and the judgment was likewise silent as to the penalty prescribed by G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(b). The plaintiff filed a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(b), 365 Mass. 817 (1974), that the judge find that the premium finance agreement did not meet the disclosure requirements of G. L. c. 255C and as a result also violated G. L. c. 140C and G. L. c. 93A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the judgment be amended accordingly so as to award the plaintiff the minimum $100 penalty (and attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>and costs) prescribed by G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(b), together with a trebling pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), of the damages already awarded the plaintiff for her losses in the accident. The motion also sought interest on all the damages. The motion was denied. Within the time provided by Mass.R.A.P. 4, 365 Mass. 846 (1974), for appeal from the judgment, all parties filed notices of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\n<em>The Defendants\u2019 Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">1. <em>The validity of the cancellation. </em>We summarize certain facts which are not in question. The premium for the 1974 motor vehicle liability insurance policy which the plaintiff purchased through Main was $294.80. On December 31, 1973, the plaintiff paid Main $50, and on January 3,1974, she paid Main an additional $58.80. On the latter date the plaintiff signed a note which provided that she pay Main $247.52. Although the plaintiff had paid Main a total of $108.80, the face of the note indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>that Main had received a cash down payment of $73.80 on the premium and that the $247.52 amount of the note represented a $221 unpaid balance on the premium, a $1 credit for life insurance, and a $25.52 finance charge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By the terms of the note the plaintiff was to pay the $247.52 in eight monthly payments of $30.94. The note contained a power of attorney allowing its holder to \"perform all acts necessary or appropriate to effect cancellation\u201d of the plaintiffs insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Main assigned the note to Colony, and Colony transmitted $294.80 to Main which then sent the $294.80 to Empire in payment of the premium. Main transmitted to Colony $73.80 of the $108.80 which the plaintiff had paid Main on December 3l and January 3, and applied the remaining $35 from the plaintiffs $108.80 payment to the purchase of an automobile club membership in the plaintiffs name.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The plaintiff mailed payments of $30 to Colony on February 28, March 21, and April 25. Colony received these payments on March 4, March 25, and April 29, respectively. By June 3 Colony had received no further payments from the plaintiff, and, the plaintiff being in arrears, Colony sent her, by registered mail, notice that it was cancelling her policy effective June 24, 1974, because of \"default of payment on premium finance contract.\u201d This notice was returned to Colony unopened, and the plaintiff claims never to have received it. On June 11 Colony received from the plaintiff a money order for $30 dated May 21. On the same day Colony sent the plaintiff a letter stating that it was in receipt of her payment and adding, \"However, in order to reinstate your insurance, which will be cancelled effective June 24, we must receive $42.86 which includes late charges and a $2.00 reinstatement fee, before June 20. No personal checks will be accepted.\u201d The plaintiff received this letter on June 13. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>As a result of a telephone conversation with an employee of Colony, the plaintiff, on June 23, sent Colony $30.94 which Colony received on June 28 and accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On June 29, while passing through Georgia on a trip to Alabama, the plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident. On July 1, the plaintiff sent Colony a further payment of $40; but this payment was not accepted. Empire, on June 25, received notification from Colony that the plaintiffs policy was to be cancelled effective June 24. Empire processed the cancellation in early July. It has since refused the plaintiffs claim under the policy for her loss in the accident on the ground that the policy had been cancelled when it happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The judge found that Main had improperly applied $35 of the $108.80 which the plaintiff had paid to Main on December 31,1973, and January 3,1974, to the purchase of an automobile club membership in the plaintiffs name. The judge found that the plaintiff had not agreed to purchase such a membership and \"was unaware of such motor club enrollment and thought that the $108.[80] she had paid Main Street Insurance Agency, Inc. was to be put toward her 1974 car insurance premium.\u201d He further found that if Main had done so instead of diverting $35 to a motor club membership, the plaintiffs premium payments, including those which Colony received on June 11 and 28, would have carried the policy into July. He concluded that Main \"is responsible for any loss incurred by the plaintiff and that Colony and Empire held out Main... as their agent to collect monies due and to apply them properly towards insurance coverage and to forward the premium payments to them, and that they are legally obligated for any losses incurred by the plaintiff which are covered risks under the policy issued by Empire.\u201d There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">There was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding (see Mass.RCiv.P. 52[a], 365 Mass. 816 [1974]) that Main had, without authority, diverted $35 of the $108.80, intended as premium, to the purchase of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>club membership in the plaintiffs name: \u2014 The plaintiff had, through Main, insured her automobile for the year 1973 with the Hanover Insurance Company; simultaneously she had purchased through Main membership in an automobile club for 1973. Late in 1973 Main sent the plaintiff a \"Final Notice Before Cancellation\u201d to complete and return to Main an enclosed application for the renewal of her motor vehicle insurance policy for the year 1974. The instructions for completing the renewal form stated, \"Unless otherwise requested, your insurance will be renewed on the same basis as in 1973.\u201d The plaintiff visited Main\u2019s office on December 31,1973, and January 3,1974, in order to arrange for insurance. She intended that the full $108.80 which she paid to Main on those dates be applied to the payment of her premium. No one at Main\u2019s office said anything to her concerning the purchase of an automobile club membership in her name and she made no application therefor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The defendants are not aided by the language quoted above in the instructions to the insurance renewal form, on which they rely. As the judge correctly pointed out, the language in the instructions refers only to the renewal of insurance, not to the renewal of an automobile club membership. And, in any event, the plaintiff apparently did not merely return the enclosed forms as contemplated by the instructions but personally went to Main\u2019s office, where she bought new insurance instead of renewing her insurance on the same basis as in 1974. As the judge points out, \"The plaintiffs insurance on her car changed substantially in 1974 from that of 1973 in that she was insured with a different insurance company and there was also a change in her deductible amount under Coverage C, Division 2, Damage to Insured Motor Vehicle.\u201d (It was reduced from $100 to $50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Since the diversion of the $35 payment by Main was unauthorized, Main\u2019s duty was to apply that sum to the premium. In view of the judge\u2019s uncontested finding that Main was Colony\u2019s agent (see <em>Bousquet </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 824, 825 [1978]), that duty is likewise imposed on Colony. See <em>New England Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>American Manufacturers Mut. Ins. Co., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 172, 180-181 (1976), <em>S.C. </em>373 Mass. 594 (1977). Colony, like Main and Empire, is implicated in the process of selling insurance to the public, see <em>New England Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>American Manufacturers Mut. Ins. Co., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 179-180; and while we have found no cases exactly like this one, Colony\u2019s duty seems to us to be commensurate with the duty generally of an insurance company to apply overpayments, which it or its agent holds, to avoid forfeiture of a policy. <em>American Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Yee Lim Shee, </em>104 F.2d 688 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 308 U.S. 592 (1939). <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Catholic Mut. Benefit Ass\u2019n., </em>208 Mich. 448, 450-451 (1919). <em>National Aid Life Assn. </em>v. <em>Partlow, </em>178 Okla. 156, 157-158 (1936). 15 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 8275 (1944). Cf. <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>118 Mass. 478, 481 (1875); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Cambridge Sav. Bank, </em>346 Mass. 327, 331-332 (1963); <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>352 Mass. 278, 280 (1967). See <em>Chickering </em>v. <em>Globe Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>116 Mass. 321 (1874). As these authorities teach us, had Main held the note and collected the payments, neither it nor Empire could have effectively cancelled the policy for nonpayment of premiums if the application of the $35 payment diverted from premium would have been sufficient to avoid default. Similarly, Colony, to whom the note was negotiated and who collected the payments, ought not to be able to exercise its power of attorney to cancel the policy if its agent (here Main), in arranging for the financing and collecting the down payment owed the insured an amount intended as payment of premium and sufficient to prevent default on the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and thus to preclude forfeiture of the policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In the present case the $35 diverted from the plaintiffs premium payment was sufficient to prevent default on the note. The defendants do not attack the trial judge\u2019s finding that after the plaintiff received Colony\u2019s June 11 letter, which stated that her policy would be cancelled unless she paid Colony $42.86 before June 20, the plaintiff telephoned Colony and received an extension of time within which to make the payment; nor do the defendants attack the judge\u2019s at least implicit finding that the plaintiff\u2019s June 28 payment of $30.94 was received before the expiration of that extension. The $35 unapplied premium payment was more than sufficient to cover the $11.92 by which the plaintiff\u2019s June 28 payment ($30.94) was short of the $42.86 which Colony\u2019s letter requested be paid.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the judge correctly ruled that the policy was improperly cancelled and was in full force and effect on the date of the plaintiff\u2019s accident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>2. <em>The liability for damages. </em>The contention of Main and Colony that they cannot be held liable if the plaintiff can recover from Empire on the policy \u2014 the only contention they make in this connection \u2014 is without merit. The claim against Main and Colony is for damages arising from their action in causing Empire wrongfully to repudiate its insurance contract with the plaintiff. See <em>Grammenos </em>v. <em>Zolotas, </em>356 Mass. 594, 597 (1970); <em>Pino </em>v. <em>Trans-Atlantic Marine, Inc., </em>358 Mass. 498, 504 (1970). For such interference the plaintiff has a tort claim against Main and Colony which she properly joined with her claim on the policy against Empire. Mass.R.Civ.P. 20(a), 365 Mass. 766 (1974). <em>M.F. Roach Co. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, </em>355 Mass. 731, 732-733 (1969). See <em>Gentile Bros. </em>v. <em>Rowena Homes, Inc., </em>352 Mass. 584, 585, 591-592 (1967). All three are wrongdoers \u2014 Empire because it repudiated its contract and Main and Colony because they induced the breach; they are all therefore liable for the benefits under the insurance policy of which they wrongfully deprived the plaintiff. <em>H.D. Watts Co. </em>v. <em>American Bond &amp; Mortgage Co., </em>260 Mass. 599, 613-614 (1927). <em>National Merchandising Corp. </em>v. <em>Leyden, </em>370 Mass. 425, 430-431 &amp; n.6 (1976). See <em>Gentile Bros. </em>v. <em>Rowena Homes, Inc., supra; M.F. Roach Co. </em>v. <em>Provincetown, supra. </em>It is no defense to the claim against Main and Colony that the plaintiff also has a claim against Empire. <em>Phillips &amp; Benjamin Co. </em>v. <em>Ratner, </em>206 F.2d 372, 376 (2d Cir. 1953). <em>Wilson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United Packinghouse, </em>181 F. Supp. 809, 819 (N.D. Iowa, 1960). <em>Louis Schlesinger Co. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>4 N.J. 169, 181 (1950). Prosser, Torts \u00a7 129, at 948 (4th ed. 1971). Annot., 26 A.L.R.2d 1227, 1257, \u00a7 19 (1952). There is nothing to the contrary in <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>302 Mass. 398, 404-405 (1939), and <em>Backman </em>v. <em>Guiliano, </em>331 Mass. 231, 232 (1954), cited by Main and Colony. In those cases the contract in question was never breached; here Empire has breached the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">3. <em>Amount of damages, </em>(a) The defendants\u2019 attack on the judge\u2019s award of $1,278.32 damage to her automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>overlooks the fact that the parties stipulated at the beginning of trial that this sum was the amount of damages to the automobile. That the stipulation was made with reference to an estimate of the cost of repairs which the plaintiff had received seems to us beside the point. We thus need not deal with the defendants\u2019 argument that the proper measure of the plaintiffs recovery is the diminution in market value. Further, the defendants\u2019 brief is silent on the question whether that is the measure of recovery under the policy (see St. 1974, c. 503, \u00a7 1, amending G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34 I [1], as in effect on the date of the accident) \u2014 whatever its other applications. And they overlook that the estimate of the cost of repairs is evidence on the issue of the diminution in market value. <em>Medford Housing Authy. </em>v. <em>Marinucci Bros., </em>354 Mass. 699, 703-704 (1968), citing <em>Childs </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>174 Mass. 111, 114-116 (1899), and <em>Colangeli </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co., </em>353 Mass. 527, 530 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">(b) We agree with the defendants that the award in the judgment of \u201d$1,000.00 for expenses incurred since the date of the accident\u201d cannot stand. The judge found that \"the plaintiffs car could not be driven and was towed by City Wide Wrecker Service to their place of business where it has been accruing storage fees at the daily rate of $2.50.\u201d However, it is undisputed that no evidence was introduced as to the storage fees or the towing charge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor can the plaintiff in this case rely on the proposition that the trial judge could, solely on the basis of his general knowledge and experience, make a finding as to what a reasonable daily charge for storage (in Atlanta, Georgia) of the plaintiffs car would be. Compare <em>Scullane </em>v. <em>Kellogg, </em>169 Mass. 544, 550 (1897), <em>McGarrahan </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R., </em>171 Mass. 211, 220 (1898), <em>Thibault </em>v. <em>DeVio, </em>318 Mass. 605, 606-607 (1945), and <em>Green </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>369 Mass. 47, 55 (1975), with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Bunar, </em>328 Mass. 398, 403 (1952), and <em>Hurwitz </em>v. <em>Parkway Country Club, Inc., </em>343 Mass. 661, 666 (1962). However that may be (and we do not decide the point) that is not what the trial judge purported to do; rather he found that the actual daily charge to the plaintiff for the storage of her car was $2.50 a day. There being no such evidence of the daily charge, this finding was clearly erroneous and could not be a basis for the ultimate finding of $1,000. Further, there is no indication of what portion of the $1,000 is attributable to the towing. Again, even assuming that the towing of a car is a service of such an ordinary nature that, with a sufficient description of the towing involved, a trial judge could, in the usual case, make a finding as to its value solely on the basis of his general knowledge and experience, we have nothing in the record appendix besides the bare fact that there was towing involved.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co., </em>317 Mass. 529, 533 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\n<em>The Plaintiffs Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">1. <em>General Laws, c. 140C and c. 255C. </em>The plaintiff argues that the trial judge erred when he failed to find the premium financing agreement to be in violation of the disclosure requirements of G. L. c. 140C and c. 255C and failed to subject all three defendants to the $100 minimum penalty therefor (together with costs and attorney\u2019s fees) provided by G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(b), as amended by St. 1972, c. 229, \u00a7 9.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>General Laws c. 255C, regulating insurance premium financing, was inserted by St. 1964, c. 727, \u00a7 1; five years later G. L. c. 140C, the Massachusetts Truth-in-Lending Act, was inserted by St. 1969, c. 517, \u00a7 1. Section 21 of St. 1969, c. 517, added to G. L. c. 255C a new \u00a7 23 which provides: \"A transaction, although subject to this chapter, shall also be subject to the provisions of... [G. L. c. 140C] and in the case of conflict between the provisions of this chapter [G. L. c. 255C] and that chapter, the provisions of that chapter shall control.\u201d We therefore base the following discussion primarily on the provisions of G. L. c. 140C.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">At the beginning of the trial the parties stipulated that when the plaintiff signed the premium financing agreement on January 3, 1974, certain information including the \"date [of] first payment,\u201d the \"deferred payment price,\u201d and the date on which the \"finance charge will begin to accrue\u201d had not been written in the spaces provided for that information on the form for the premium financing agreement. The failure to write in the date of the first payment constituted a violation of G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 <em>7(b)(3), </em>inserted by St. 1969, c. 517, \u00a7 1, requiring that \"due dates or periods of payments\u201d be disclosed. Compare item 3 of the third paragraph of G. L. c. 255C, \u00a7 13. The failure to write in the deferred payment price constituted a violation of G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 7(c)(8). <em>Walker </em>v. <em>College Toyota, Inc., </em>399 F. Supp. 778, 779-781 (W.D. Va. 1974), aff'd, 519 F.2d 447 (4th Cir. 1975). Compare item 10 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>second paragraph of G. L. c. 255C, \u00a7 13. Because the premium financing agreement was signed on January 3, 1974, and interest began to accrue on January 1, 1974, the failure to write in the date interest began to accrue constituted a violation of G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 7(b)(1), inserted by St. 1969, c. 517, \u00a7 1, requiring that the due date on which the finance charge begins to accrue be disclosed \"if different from the date of the transactions.\u201d <em>Ljepava </em>v. <em>M.L.S.C. Properties, Inc., </em>511 F.2d 935, 943 n.8 (9th Cir. 1975). Compare item 1 of the third paragraph of G. L. c. 255C, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">There is no merit in the defendants\u2019 contention that oral disclosure to the plaintiff by Main of the missing information (of which, the defendants argue, th\u00e9re was sufficient evidence) constituted compliance with G. L. c. 140C. That contention flies in the face of G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7\u00a7 5(a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 7(a), both inserted by St. 1969, c. 517 \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Kristiansen </em>v. <em>Mullins &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>59 F.R.D. 99, 110 (E.D.N.Y. 1973); <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Household Finance Corp. </em>(D.C. Iowa 1973), C.C.H. Consumer Credit Guide, par. 99007 (Transfer Binder 1973). The mere inspection of \u00a7\u00a7 <em>5(a) </em>and 7(a), as set out in note 12 and note 13, <em>supra, </em>demonstrates that the defendants\u2019 contention approaches the frivolous. Were we to decide that the oral disclosure of required information was sufficient to avoid liability under G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(6), it would emasculate the Act. Cf. <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Chemical Bank N. Y. Trust Co., </em>329 F. Supp. 270, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). The fact that at some point after January 3,1974, the missing information was written on the premium financing agreement is irrelevant, even assuming that the plaintiff was somehow informed of this fact. General Laws c. 140C, \u00a7 7 (with certain exceptions not relevant to the present case), clearly mandates that the disclosures required by that section \"be made before the transaction is consummated\u201d (see note 13, <em>supra) </em>in order that the consumer may have an opportunity to comparison shop for the best credit terms available. Here, the transaction was consummated on January 3, 1974, when the plaintiff signed the premium financing agreement. G.

Auto. Ins.

The plaintiff and the defendants have briefed the case as if both sides had appealed from the judgment and neither the plaintiff nor any of the defendants has attempted to show that the inaccuracy of the others\u2019 notices of appeal has in any way been misleading. See <em>Altvater </em>v. <em>Battocletti, </em>300 F.2d 156,158 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>Peabody Coal Co. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>484 F.2d 78, 81 (6th Cir. 1973). Our treatment of the plaintiffs appeal as being from the final judgment makes immaterial her motion for additional findings and to amend the judgment and her appeal from the denial of that motion. See 13 Eickhoff and Farrell, Cyclopedia of Federal Procedure \u00a7 57.61 (3d ed., rev. vol. 1977). Our cases of <em>Nantucket Land Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>5 Mass.

App. Ct. 893 (1977), are not to the contrary since no judgments were entered in those cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\"> These amounts were all entered on the note when the plaintiff signed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\"> Indeed, the record appendix contains a representation by the plaintiffs counsel that at that time the plaintiff was a member of \"Triple A.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\"> Our analysis makes immaterial and we do not decide the defendants\u2019 contentions with reference to the exact application of the diverted sum, which they argue could not be applied either to the down payment or the first installment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\"> Of this $11.92, $8.16 is accounted for by various charges Colony made to the plaintiff as a result of her lateness in making the proceeding four payments. As the plaintiff raises no question concerning these late charges, and as they have no effect upon our decision as to the correctness of the judge\u2019s ruling that the cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s policy was improper, we do not consider their validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\"> We do not consider the assertion in the brief filed by Colony and Main (Empire\u2019s brief makes no separate argument on this matter) that the plaintiff did not give proper written notice of the accident to Empire and that Empire is thereby excused from liability on the policy. This assertion does not rise to the level of argument- It merely cites a provision of the policy and makes a reference to a part of the transcript not included in the record appendix. The defendants furnish no analysis to this court which might be helpful in reaching a decision in this rather complex area.

The trial judge found that the plaintiff, on or shortly after June 13, 1974, \"called Colony and was assured by them that she could make her payment after June 24, which she did.\u201d In context, the finding implies that the plaintiff was given an assurance that her policy would not be cancelled on June 24, the stated effective date of the notice of cancellation previously mailed, and that she was to have a reasonable time thereafter to pay Colony the $42.86 then owing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This critical finding is nowhere challenged by Colony; its two briefs ignore the finding; and we are in no position to conclude that it was not supported by the evidence, much of which has not been reproduced in the appendix. It follows from that finding that Colony\u2019s cancellation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>policy under the power of attorney given the holder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the plaintiffs note by the terms thereof was wrongful, and on general principles Colony is liable for the damages flowing from that wrongful cancellation. As to the measure of those damages, we concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">There is nothing in the judge\u2019s findings, however, which indicates that either Empire or its agent, Main, is liable for damages resulting from cancellation of the policy. The theory upon which the majority holds Empire liable \u2014 namely, that it had no right to cancel the policy for \"non-payment of premiums\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when its agent Main held money owing to the plaintiff sufficient to bring the premium payments up to date \u2014 is inapplicable for at least two reasons: first, it was the insured (acting through her attorney, the holder of the note) and not Empire who cancelled the policy, the cancellation having been for the purposes of obtaining return of the unused portion of the premium;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, second, whatever preliminary discussions may have taken place, the plaintiff signed a note which plainly disclosed that only $73.80 of her down payment had been applied to the insurance premium and which obligated her to pay $30.94 on the first day of each month for eight consecutive months. On the facts found, that note was not the product of fraud or mutual mistake; and neither the fact that the plaintiff may not have read the note at the time she signed it <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Santoianni, </em>330 Mass. 187, 193 [1953]) nor the fact that Main may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>obligated to return to her the $35 which it, without authorization, applied to renewing her membership in the automobile club altered her obligation to make the monthly payments she promised to make by signing the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Main cannot be held liable on the theory, advanced by the majority, of tortious interference with contract, because Main had nothing whatever to do with effecting the cancellation of the policy.* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor can Main\u2019s liability be predicated on its having been Empire\u2019s agent; for even if we assume, contrary to the facts found by the judge, that it was Empire which cancelled the policy and that Empire thereby breached the insurance contract, Main would not be similarly liable. The agent of a disclosed principal is not ordinarily personally liable for his principal\u2019s breach of contract (see Restatement [Second] of Agency \u00a7 320 [1958]; 16 Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 8832 [1968] at 459-461; Keeton, Insurance Law [1971] at 51), unless the breach is the result of the agent\u2019s own fraud. The trial judge made no finding of fraud,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and fraud is not to be presumed. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Santoianni, supra </em>at 192. <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corp. &amp; Taxn., </em>336 Mass. 337, 341 (1957). <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>354 Mass. 247, 248 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>As to the defendants Main and Empire, we concur in those portions of the majority opinion dealing with the judge\u2019s refusal to award the plaintiff $100 damages and attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(6). The defendant Colony is not similarly liable. It is clear from the judge\u2019s findings and from the evidence and the terms of the note that Colony did not become the plaintiffs creditor until the note was assigned by Main to Colony, and that Colony was not a \"creditor\u201d at the time Main violated the disclosure requirements of G. L. c. 140C and G. L. c. 255C. The judge\u2019s finding or conclusion that Main was Colony\u2019s agent was plainly wrong. There was no evidence that Colony had given Main actual authority, express or implied, to enter into business transactions in Colony\u2019s behalf, and no ostensible or apparent authority could be found from the note which,' on its face, plainly indicated that Colony would become a party to the transaction only if and when Main should assign the note to it. The fact that Main regularly assigned such notes to Colony furnished no basis for a conclusion that Colony was Main\u2019s principal (see Anderson Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-302:14, at 827 [2d fed. 1971]); to the contrary, if such a relationship existed, Colony would be payee from the outset and assignment would be superfluous. Colony was a stranger to the transaction at the time the truth-in-lending violations occurred and thus is not liable to the plaintiff for the statutory penalty. Contrast G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(c). See now G. L. c. 140C, \u00a7 10(g), inserted by St. 1975, c. 592, \u00a7 11, effective September 6, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> Failure to comply with the requirement of G.
