The defendants are the corporate successors to the original lessee and a guarantor of the lease, respectively. There is no dispute as to any material fact, and a summary judgment was entered which awarded the plaintiffs the total of the amounts claimed by them for the years 1969 through 1973, with interest. The defendants have appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">There are three separately stated components of the annual rent reserved under the lease: (1) a \"Minimum Rent\u201d; (2) a \"Percentage Rent,\u201d based on seven percent of a portion of the lessee\u2019s \"Gross Receipts\u201d (as defined); and (3) \"payments made ... on account of real estate taxes in accordance with [\u00a7 3(d) ] hereof\u2019 (which we shall occasionally refer to as the \"payments on account of. real estate taxes\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6There is no dispute in any of the years still involved (see note 4, supra) as to the amount yielded by the calculations necessary to arrive to any single component, standing by itself; the dispute is as to the interrelationship between (2) and (3) in those years. The plaintiffs contend that (3) must be added to the sum of (1) and (2); the defendants agree to (1) but contend that (3) may be taken as a credit against (2). If the plaintiffs are correct, the undisputed facts are such that the judgment must stand; if the defendants are correct, the judgment must be modified so as to cover only the liability which the defendants have conceded with respect to the year 1969 (see note 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Section 3(a) of the lease establishes the \"Minimum Rent,\u201d which is not in dispute and which has been paid in all years. Section 3(b) commences, \"In addition to the Minimum Rent, Lessee agrees to pay to Lessors during the term of the lease percentage rent ('Percentage Rent\u2019) in an amount equal to seven (7 %) percent of the amount, if any, by which the Gross Receipts, as hereinafter defined, from the business conducted at the demised premises in each calender year exceeds ... $357,143.00 ... ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (We shall refer to this provision as the \"seven percent calculation.\u201d) Section 3(b) continues, \"Any payments made by Lessee on account of real estate taxes in accordance with [\u00a7 3(d)] hereof shall be credited and offset against any Percentage Rent due hereunder, <em>except that such payments on account of real estate taxes shall be added to the maximum Percentage Rent </em>of... $30,000 ... set forth below\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (We shall refer to the italicized words as the \"except\u201d clause.) The remaining portion of \u00a7 3(b) which is relevant for present purposes reads, \"Lessee shall in no event, except as to payments against real estate taxes as provided above, be required to pay Percentage Rent in an amount in excess of... $30,000 ... per year----\u201d The material portion of \u00a7 3(d) reads, \"In addition to the Minimum Rent, herein-above provided for, the Lessee shall pay as additional rent for each calendar year ... during the term of this lease <em>... a </em>sum equal to thirty-three (33%) percent[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>amount, if any, by which the ... real estate tax assessed upon the real property of which the demised premises form a part exceeds the amount of the base real estate tax[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] assessed upon such real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In 1969 the \"seven percent calculation\u201d resulted in an amount higher than $30,000; in the years 1970 through 1973 that calculation resulted in amounts higher than $37,000. The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments (apparently accepted by the judge) are (1) that since the \"seven percent calculation\u201d resulted in an amount higher than $30,000 in 1969 and in amounts higher than $37,000 in the years 1970 through 1973, the lessee was (using the words of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and their brief) in a \"maximum percentage rent situation\u201d in all years and (2) that by reason of the \"except\u201d clause the lessee was not entitled to offset its \"payments on account of real estate taxes\u201d against the relevant \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d due in any year.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Reading all of the quoted provisions of the lease together, as we must, we believe the plaintiffs and the judge have misconstrued both the \"except\u201d clause and the lease provisions as to \"maximum Percentage Rent.\u201d Section 6(b) (iii) of the lease (see note 7, supra) is explicit on the point that the \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d for 1970 and subsequent years is to be calculated by adding the \"payments against real estate taxes\u201d to the figure of $37,000. In each of those years that calculation resulted in a \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d greater than the \"Percentage Rent\u201d derived solely from the \"seven percent calculation.\u201d Thus the lessee was not, as the plaintiff contend, in a \"maximum percentage rent situation\u201d in those years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>We construe the \"except\u201d clause as requiring that in all years in which \"payments on account of real estate taxes\u201d are made pursuant to \u00a7 3(d) the \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d is to be increased by the amounts of those payments. It strikes us that the reason for expressing such a provision in the form of an exception to the credit and offset provision was that the purposes of the \"except\u201d clause were to provide for a partial cancellation of the credit for \"payments on account of real estate taxes\u201d once the result of the \"seven percent calculation\u201d should exceed $30,000 in 1969 or $37,000 in any subsequent year and io provide for a complete cancellation of the credit if the result of the \"seven percent calculation\u201d should exceed $30,000 in 1969 or $37,000 in any subsequent year by the amount of the \"payment on account of real estate taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">To illustrate this point let us look at the year 1970. In that year the \"payment on account of real estate taxes\u201d made by the lessee was $2,768.01. Under our interpretation the \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d increased from $37,000 to $39,768.01. Suppose that the result of the \"seven percent calculation\u201d had been $39,768.01. The percentage rent to be paid under \u00a7 3(b) before the credit would have been $39,768.01, the lessee would have been entitled to a credit of $2,768.01, and the percentage rent due after the credit would have been $37,000, with the result that the increase in the \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d and the credit would have cancelled each other. If the \"seven percent calculation\u201d had resulted in a figure between $37,000 and $39,768.01, the fact that the percentage rent due before the credit would have been more than $37,000 (but less than $2,768.01 more), would have resulted in a partial cancellation of the credit. Interpreting the \"except\u201d clause and the lease provisions concerning \"maximum Percentage Rent\u201d in this manner leads to a smooth and seemingly fair transition into the so-called \"maximum rent situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>By contrast, if we were to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation, there would have been no such transition. Let us look again at the year 1970. If the lessee\u2019s gross receipts in that year had been such that the \"seven percent calculation\u201d would have resulted in a figure of $36,999.99, the lessee would have been entitled to a credit of $2,768.01 against its percentage rent. But if the lessee\u2019s gross receipts had been only fourteen cents higher, the \"seven percent calculation\u201d would have resulted in a figure one cent higher, or $37,000, and the lessee would not have been entitled to a credit for any part of the $2,768.01 actually paid by it for taxes. In other words, an increase in gross receipts of only fourteen cents would have resulted in an increase of $2,768.01 in the total rent due for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\"So far as reasonably practicable [a contract] should be given a construction which will make it a rational business instrument and will effectuate what appears to have been the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Berkal </em>v. <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co., </em>327 Mass. 329, 333 (1951). Although the ques-tibn is not entirely free from doubt, we are of the opinion that the interpretation contended for by the defendants accomplishes those objectives and is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">It follows that the judgment is to be modified so as to provide that the plaintiffs are to recover the sum of $21.11,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> together with interest on that sum from the date it should have been paid under the provisions of \u00a7 3(d) of the lease.
