L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). His appeal under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28, brings us only \"matter[s] of law apparent upon the record.\u201d The \u201crecord\u201d as used in that statute does not include the \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts and Case\u201d filed after the defendant\u2019s conviction. \u201cThe word 'record\u2019... refers to something already existing when the appeal is taken.\u201d <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>316 Mass. 187, 191 (1944), cited in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berney, </em>353 Mass. 571, 572 (1968). Such an appeal does not bring up the evidence for review. <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>337 Mass. 264, 266 (1958). A summary of the evidence, though agreed to by the parties, stands no better; the proper vehicle for such a summary is a bill of exceptions. However, since the pertinent facts have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>stipulated and the stipulation has been approved by the judge, we deem it appropriate to discuss the substance of the defendant\u2019s appeal, as both parties have done. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berney, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The sole contention of the defendant, a Connecticut resident, is that his conviction must be reversed because he had a valid firearm identification card issued to him on or about October 18, 1971, pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B, by the police department of Malden, Massachusetts. The circumstances of its issuance do not appear, but the Commonwealth agrees that it was still in effect on July 29, 1976, the date of the offense charged. The defendant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The defendant concedes that he did not have a license to carry a firearm issued pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, or a temporary license issued to \"a non-resident,\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F. He therefore does not come within either of the exceptions provided in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a)(1) and (2). He argues, however, that his firearm identification card brings him within the exception provided in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) (3), as appearing in St. 1975, c. 113, \u00a7 2, since it puts him in \"compliance] with the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-nine C <em>and </em>one hundred and thirty-one G of chapter one hundred and forty\u201d (emphasis supplied). He concedes that he is not within the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131G, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 86, which allows a nonresident under certain conditions to \"carry a pistol or revolver in or through the commonwealth for the purpose of taking part in a pistol or revolver competition ... or for the purpose of hunting.\u201d But he argues that \"and\u201d in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) (3), should be read as \"or\u201d so that compliance with G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C or \u00a7 131G, is sufficient to permit him to carry a firearm. But a firearm identification card obtained in compliance with G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 892, \u00a7 3, authorizes the holder to \"own or possess\u201d a firearm (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>375 Mass. 201, 210 [1978]); it does not authorize him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\"carr[y] on his person or under his control in a vehicle, a \u00f1rearm.\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 129C (sixth par.), though perhaps somewhat inartistically drawn, indicates the same intent. It is only when compliance with the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, which \"bring into play ... 'exempted persons and users\u2019\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403, 406 [1977]), is qualified by the narrow scope and purposes of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F \u2014 of which the defendant cannot avail himself\u2014 that an exemption occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">On the defendant\u2019s argument a firearm identification card would, in all cases, be sufficient to permit a person to carry a handgun without obtaining a license under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, although it seems obvious that the Legislature intended to condition the carrying of a firearm on compliance with the licensing requirements which are more stringent than those of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B. Thus, \u00a7 129B (second par.) provides that persons meeting specified conditions can obtain a firearm identification card as a matter of right and the licensing authority \"shall within thirty days from the date of application either approve ... or deny the application ....\u201d However, the issuance of a license under the first paragraph of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 415, requires a finding that the applicant is a \"suitable person\u201d and that he has \"good reason to fear injury\u201d or has \"any other proper purpose.\u201d A more thorough investigation also seems to be contemplated (see second par.). Further, the legislative awareness of a clear distinction between a firearm identification card and a license is manifest from the provisions of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) (4), subparagraph (3), which exempts a person having a valid firearm identification card only from the prohibition against carrying \"a rifle or shotgun.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>375 Mass. 138, 139 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
