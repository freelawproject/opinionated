The plaintiffs, Alexis McLaughlin, her daughter Mary Ann McLaughlin, and her niece Jocelyn Wujcik Wolfe, were travelling in a Ford truck on which a camper was mounted. Also present in the vehicle were Margaret Wujcik, sister of Alexis McLaughlin, and Catherine McDonald.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While they were travelling at about forty-five miles per hour, there was a blowout in the left rear tire; the truck went out of control and rolled over, and the camper became completely detached from the body of the truck. Wolfe, who was riding in the camper at the time, was seriously injured; the other plaintiffs sustained lesser injuries. The defendants in the case are Ford Motor Company (Ford), manufacturer of the truck, and Harold R. Donahue (doing business as Donahue Mobile Homes), the dealer who assembled the truck and camper unit and sold it to James McLaughlin, the husband of Alexis McLaughlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The original declaration, filed April 3, 1972, alleged injuries \"by reason of the negligence of the defendant [Ford]... in the manufacture of said motor vehicle and/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>or the equipment and/or apparatus connected therewith ____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The declaration also alleged in separate counts a breach of warranty by Donahue.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On June 2,1975, at the beginning of the trial, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 1A [3], 365 Mass. 731 [1974]) to allege in the counts against Ford injuries \"by reason of the negligence of the defendant ... in the manufacture of said motor vehicle and/or the equipment and/or apparatus connected therewith <em>and/or in its instructions or in its failure to give instructions as to said vehicle related to gross vehicle weight and gross vehicle weight </em>requirements.\u201d (The amendment added the italicized portions.) The amendment was allowed over Ford\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The case was submitted to the jury with interrogatories (Mass. R.Civ.P. 49[b], 365 Mass. 813 [1974]); motions by the defendants for directed verdicts were denied. The jury found that (a) there was no defect in the left rear wheel, (b) the accident was caused by \"a combination of the overloading in excess of the gross vehicle weight and the underinflation of the left rear tire of the vehicle,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6(c) Ford had not taken reasonable measures to make known \"the risks and dangers with respect to what could occur as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>result of underinflation of tires or the imposition of weight in excess of the gross maximum weight of the vehicle,\u201d (d) this failure was the proximate cause of the accident, (e) the plaintiffs were not contributorily negligent, and (f) Donahue had breached his warranty in the sale of the truck and camper unit. Verdicts were returned for all the plaintiffs against both defendants, who appealed from the resulting judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Ford\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">It is now accepted by both Ford and the plaintiffs that the jury could have found, as they did, that the blowout was caused by a combination of overloading the vehicle and underinflation of the left rear tire. Rather, Ford disputes the jury\u2019s finding that it was negligent in failing to provide an adequate warning of the danger that might arise from these conditions. It argues that, as a matter of law, adequate warnings were provided by the operator\u2019s manual furnished with the vehicle and the \"rating plate\u201d affixed to the door of the vehicle which gave (as described in the manual) the \"recommended maximum gross vehicle weight rating.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The duty of the manufacturer to warn of the dangers in the use of his product is well established; it is applicable to hazards involved in the use of properly designed products by users to whom the danger would not be apparent. <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Edward E.

Further, the forcefulness of the warning must be commensurate with the danger involved. <em>Post </em>v. <em>American Cleaning Equip. Corp., </em>437 S.W.2d 516, 520-521 (Ky.

Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>370 Mass. at 75-76. The jury\u2019s finding that there was no adequate warning was well warranted. The recommended gross vehicle weight was opaque even as a direction with respect to the load which the truck could carry without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>overloading; nowhere was the weight of the vehicle given so that the user could subtract that figure from the maximum gross vehicle weight rating of seven thousand five hundred pounds (subtracting also in this case the weight of added optional equipment) to derive the weight which could safely be loaded on the truck. Moreover, there is an obvious likelihood of overloading a camper with equipment and passengers by users who have had little or no experience in handling trucks, and this may require a more pointed warning that might otherwise be necessary. Nor was overloading presented as a danger to the safety of the passengers in the manual or elsewhere. Similarly, the \"Recommended Inflation Pressures\u201d given in the manual were not presented as safety measures, the disregard of which, when coupled with overloading, could result in a serious accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Upon examination of the references in the manual to which Ford points, the jury could well have found that these references to the \"Recommended tire pressures\u201d and \"Tire Pressures\u201d \u2014 like, e.g., the accompanying references to \"Maintenance recommendations\u201d and \"Cooling Systems,\u201d respectively \u2014 were designed to give information as to the most efficient use rather than alert the user to potential hazards. We find unpersuasive the emphasis placed by Ford on the statement under the heading \"Tires and Tire Care\u201d: \"For reliable vehicle control always maintain the recommended difference between front and rear tires.\u201d The jury could well have found that this suggestion, if relevant at all, was too oblique a reference and that a more explicit warning was required.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Also, the jury might well have taken into consideration that this truck was built as a \"camper special\u201d (so designated in the manual) to be used by consumers having no experience with trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Ford\u2019s contention, phrased in terms of proximate cause, that the plaintiffs did not introduce any evidence that an adequate warning would have reached them, is unpersuasive. An adequate warning is by definition one that would in the ordinary course have come to the user\u2019s attention. The failure to give such a warning therefore permits the inference that it would have alerted the user to the danger and forestalled the accident. The jury were free to draw such an inference absent some negating evidence binding on the plaintiffs. The burden was on the defendants to come forward with evidence tending to rebut such an inference; the plaintiffs were not required to refute a hypothesis which was never raised. \"The very reason that the law imposes a duty to give notice in a particular case is the assumption that, because of the danger not commonly known to users, 'a warning is needed.\u2019. .. That the plaintiff fell outside the common class should be the defendant\u2019s burden, not the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Hubbard-Hall Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>340 F.2d 402, 406 (1st Cir. 1965) (Aldrich, C.J., concurring). <em>Technical Chem.

[the plaintiffs] would have read an adequate warning\u201d which \"may, however, be rebutted if the manufacturer comes forward with contrary evidence that the presumed fact did not exist.\u201d See <em>Reyes </em>v. <em>Wyeth Labs., </em>498 F.2d 1264, 1281-1282 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 419 U.S. 1096 (1974); <em>Nissen Trampoline Co. </em>v. <em>Terre Haute First Natl.

App. 803, 804-805 (1976).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We also reject Ford\u2019s attack on the action of the judge in permitting the complaint to be amended to include a claim of inadequate warning. Allowance of the amendment at the beginning of trial on June 2, 1975 (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 15[a], 365 Mass. 761 [1974]), was well within the judge\u2019s discretion and consistent with the requirement of rule 15(a) that leave to amend should be given freely. <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 289-290 (1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ford complains that the allowance of the amendment at the commencement of trial deprived it of sufficient time to prepare its defense to the new claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, there is nothing to indicate just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>what, if any, presentation was made to the trial judge indicating such prejudice to Ford or such other circumstances as would justify the denial of the motion; nor is there any indication that Ford asked for a continuance. See <em>United States for Use of Way Panama, S.A. </em>v. <em>Ulhorn Int\u2019l. </em>S.A., 238 F. Supp. 887, 891 (D.C. C.Z. 1965), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. <em>National Surety Corp. </em>v. <em>United States for Use of Way Panama, S.A., </em>378 F.2d 294 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1004 (1967). \"[A] motion to amend should be allowed unless some good reason appears for denying it.\u201d <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. at 289. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Hunt Oil Co., </em>398 F.2d 578, 581-582 (8th Cir. 1968). See generally 6 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1488 (1971) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Nor do we see any error in the allowance of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to conform the pleadings to the evidence (Mass.R.Civ.P. 15[b], 365 Mass. 761 [1974]), which made explicit that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim went to the failure adequately to warn of the dangers of both underinflation of tires and overloading. Ford argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 \"intention only became evident during the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-examination of the defense experts, when it was obviously too late for Ford to prepare its legal contentions, much less conduct the discovery necessary for an adequate defense.\u201d But even on that assumption Ford cannot prevail because it did not object to the cross-examination on this issue and the evidence which was elicited. \"Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [which is tracked by Mass.R.Civ.P. 15 (b)] provides that 'When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\u2019 Under this rule, there is implied consent to litigate an issue if there is no objection to the introduction of evidence on the unpleaded issue, as long as the non-objecting party was fairly appraised that the evidence went to the unpleaded issue.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Niedland </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 F.2d 254, 258 (3d Cir. 1964). <em>George Cohen Sons &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Koch, </em>376 F.2d 629, 632-633 (1st Cir. 1967). 6 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1493, at 462-465. In this posture of the case the trial judge was well justified in instructing the jury on this issue (cf. <em>Slavitt </em>v. <em>Kauhi, </em>384 F.2d 530, 534 [9th Cir. 1967]), and their verdict was, as we have seen, supported by the evidence. Consequently the motion to conform was a purely formal matter. \"[F]ailure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(b), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). See Reporters\u2019 Notes to rule 15(b), as appearing in Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure, at 287 (1974); 6 Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1493, at 460-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Donahue\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Donahue makes only two contentions which we need consider <em>(Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 13-14 [1958]): (1) that Wolfe is not within the class of persons (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-318, inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 l)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>recover for breach of the warranty of merchantability provided by G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (also inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1), and (2) that the warranty of merchantability has no application where the injury is caused by a failure to give an adequate warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">1. We hold that Wolfe, the buyer\u2019s niece, is a \"person who is in the family ... of his [Donahue\u2019s] buyer.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-318. The interpretation of \u00a7 2-318 in this respect has not come before the Supreme Judicial Court or this court. We are persuaded by the analysis in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Preitz, </em>422 Pa. 383 (1966), overruled on other grounds, <em>Kassab </em>v. <em>Soya, </em>432 Pa. 217, 226 (1968), in which a nephew of the buyer who, like Wolfe, was not a member of the buyer\u2019s household was held to be \"in the family\u201d of the buyer under the identical Pennsylvania version of \u00a7 2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code (Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 12A, \u00a7 2-318 [Purdon], as appearing in 1959 Pa. Laws c. 426, at 1066). The court held that \"considering the remedial nature of the provision and the natural connotations of the word, its meaning was not intended to be unduly restrictive .... This interpretation of the word 'family\u2019 is not too burdensome on the seller who makes the warranty because not only must the beneficiary be in the buyer\u2019s family but also it must be 'reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>422 Pa. at 390. The Pennsylvania court pointed out that the statute makes a distinction between \"person ... in the family\u201d and \"person... in the... household,\u201d indicating that the former phrase was intended to extend beyond the members of the household. 422 Pa. at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This construction is consistent with and finds support in <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence R.R., </em>154 Mass. 299, 301 (1891), in which the court held that \"[t]he word \u2018family\u2019 has several meanings. Its primary meaning is the collective body of persons who live in one house and under one head or management. Its secondary meaning is those who are of the same lineage, or descend from one common progenitor. Unless the context manifests a different intention, the word \u2018family\u2019 is usually construed in its primary sense.\u201d In this case the context does indicate otherwise; the statutory opposition of the terms \"family\u201d and \"household\u201d supports the broad construction of the term \"family\u201d to indicate those not ordinarily thought of as living in the buyer\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Further, the application of \u00a7 2-318 to such persons as Wolfe seems to us within the legislative intent to liberalize the \"technical rules as to \u2018privity\u2019 \u201d (Comment 2 to \u00a7 2-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as appearing in 1A U.L.A. [Master ed. 1976]) consistent with the \"remedial nature\u201d (422 Pa. at 390) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">2. In the hands of an ordinary user the truck and camper unit with nothing more than the inadequate warnings furnished by Ford created, as the jury found, the danger of a blowout when used \"for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (2) (c). Donahue\u2019s sale was thus in breach of the warranty of merchantability, for a product is \"unmerchantable if sold without a suitable warning.\u201d <em>Casagrande </em>v. <em>F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>340 Mass. 552, 555 (1960). The court said, in that case, \"A retailer\u2019s implied warranty of merchantability of goods not of his manufacture is that they are reasonably suitable for the ordinary uses for which goods of that description are sold when used in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>adequate warning and instructions.\u201d 340 Mass. at 555. Compare <em>Taylor </em>v. Jacobson, 336 Mass. 709, 716 (1958) (scope of retailer\u2019s implied warranty may be limited by \"reasonable, intelligible and adequate warnings and instructions\u201d supplied by a manufacturer).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Other courts have also held that inadequate warnings may be the basis for a claim of breach of implied warranty. In <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Q.H.S. Inc., </em>448 F.2d 238 (4th Cir. 1971), the court held that an inadequate warning to users that hair rollers could catch fire could be the basis of an action for negligent failure to warn and breach of warranty: \"while the separate theories of negligence and breach of warranty are not always coextensive, we think this same evidence [of inadequate warning] sufficient to constitute a jury issue as to whether the rollers were of merchantable quality.\u201d 448 F.2d at 243. Accord, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hittle Serv. Inc., </em>219 Kan. 627, 635, 640 (1976); <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>190 Cal. App. 2d 617, 623-624 (1961) (failure to warn of dangers involved in spraying of insecticides constituted actionable negligence and breach of warranty of fitness for a particular purpose); <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>258 N.W.2d 782, 789 (Minn. 1977) (concurring opinion). Compare <em>Barth </em>v. <em>B.F. Goodrich Tire Co., </em>265 Cal. App. 2d 228, 244-245 (1968), a case, similar to our case on its facts, in which the court upheld instructions that \"[i]f directions or warnings as to the use of a particular product are reasonably required in order to prevent the use of such product from becoming unreasonably dangerous, the failure to give such warnings or directions, if any, renders the product defective----\u201d 265 Cal. App. 2d at 244. In the <em>Barth </em>case the court held that where a station wagon was overloaded while in normal use, creating a risk of tire failure, and where no warning was given of this danger, the defendant could be held liable under the doctrine of strict liability (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 402A [1965]), since, without an adequate warning, the tire was defective. Compare also Prosser, Torts \u00a7 99, at 659 (4th ed. 1971). See 2 Frumer &amp; Friedman, Products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Liability, ch. 3, at 3-1 to 3-7 (1977), discussing strict liability in tort as a development from liability for breach of warranty. They make the point that the two bases for liability are identical apart from contract defenses of privity and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-13\"> We accept the assumption of the parties that the law of Massachusetts applies.

I intend also to rely on such evidence of negligence as shall appear in evidence during the course of trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> At the end of the trial the judge allowed, again over Ford\u2019s objection, a further motion to amend the complaint which struck the portion italicized above and substituted instead \"and/or in its failure to give adequately information to potential users of the vehicle and camper or to take reasonable measures to make known to such users the risks and dangers with respect to what could occur as a result of underinflation of tires or the imposition of weight in excess of the gross maximum weight of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> The jury found specially that the cause of the accident was not either overloading or underinflation separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> Ford\u2019s expert pointed out that the underinflation and overloading complemented each other to create a distortion in the tire (\"overdeflection\u201d) which resulted in the failure of the rim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> We also note that the suggestion, \"Before driving each day, glance at all your tires. If one looks softer than the others, have all pressures checked\u201d might well have been considered by the jury to be misleading in view of the testimony by Ford\u2019s expert that the substantial underinflation in this case would not have been detected except by an expert. Compare <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>372 Mass. at 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\"> We see nothing of any consequence in the isolated bit of testimony by Mrs. McLaughlin that whenever she went on a trip she had the camper checked at a garage. At most it admits of speculation that the serviceman was negligent, but that would not absolve the manufacturer. <em>H.P. Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>370 Mass. at 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> The restrictive effect of specifications furnished by the plaintiffs prior to the new rules does not abridge the judge\u2019s discretion under rule 15. See Transitional Rule 1A[2], 365 Mass. 731 (1974). In any event, even under the old rules there was discretion to permit an amendment of specifications. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Crompton &amp; Knowles Loom Works, </em>305 Mass. 327, 328 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> The injection of this claim appears to have been prompted by information furnished to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel by Ford shortly before trial, that its experts would testify that the rim of the wheel failed by reason of \"either an overload condition and/or underinflation condition with respect to the tires or a combination of both\u201d and by an examination of the operating manual also furnished to the plaintiffs by Ford shortly before trial. The summary of expert testimony was given to the plaintiffs on April 11, 1975, pursuant to an order of the court dated January 14, 1975, that it be furnished in thirty days. Thereupon on April 17,1975, the plaintiffs moved for the production <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of the operator\u2019s manual and other documents. The motion was allowed on May 1, 1975. According to the defendant\u2019s brief, the documents were given to the plaintiffs on May 7. The court further ordered, on April 11, 1975, production of additional documents and photographs supporting the opinion of one of Ford\u2019s experts; these were provided on May 15,1975. Contrast the evidence of delay by the moving party in <em>Castellucci, </em>372 Mass. at 292-293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> Ford does not claim that it thought that this cross-examination was directed to an issue already in the case. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-examination could have come as no surprise in view of the information Ford had furnished the plaintiffs and the complementary effect of overloading and underinflation to which Ford\u2019s experts testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> That statute read at all times material: \"A seller\u2019s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.\u201d The statute was amended by St. 1971, c. 670, \u00a7 1, to eliminate the requirement of privity as a defense \"if the plaintiff was a person whom the manufacturer, seller or supplier might reasonably have expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods.\u201d (See also St. 1973, c. 750, which amended this proviso by adding the word \"lessor\u201d after \"seller.\u201d) The requirement of foreseeability has thus been a part of the statute at all times; and Donahue makes no argument that Wolfe was not a foreseeable traveller in the McLaughlins\u2019 camper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> The court instructed the jury in accordance with this warranty rather than G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-315 (inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1) which Donahue cites in his brief. No objection was taken to the instruction, and we treat \u00a7 2-314 as the applicable section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
