L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, as appearing in St. 1976, c. 397, \u00a7 6, seeking, among other things, (a) to invalidate two votes of the defendant planning board (board) which purported to deny an endorsement of \"approval not required\u201d on two plans of land which the plaintiffs had submitted to the board under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 363, \u00a7 1, and (b) a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties relative to said plans. Judgment was entered, and the plaintiffs have appealed from part 2 thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 brief informs us that \"[t]he sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the ... judge erred in remanding the case to the ... board to allow a full consideration of the matter on its merits.\u201d We called for and have before us the original record and have limited our consideration to the stated issue and conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We summarize the facts found by the judge. On December 3,1976, the plaintiffs submitted a plan of land to the board for endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P (approval not required). Another plan was similarly submitted on December 9,1976. The plans were to be considered by the board at its December 13 meeting. By agreement the matter was continued to December 20. The attorneys for the parties met by chance on December 20 and agreed to \u201cpostpone action until sometime later in the week.\u201d The judge found that the plaintiffs expected by that agreement that the matter would be taken up at the regular meeting of the board on December 27. On the morning of the twenty-seventh the plaintiffs were advised that the matter would not be considered at that night\u2019s meeting.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, neither the plaintiffs nor their counsel attended. As its final act of the evening the board voted to deny the requested endorsements, an action which the judge found to be an effort to comply with the time limitation found in \u00a7 81P.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Earlier on the twenty-seventh, the board had posted a notice of a special meeting to be held at 3:30 p.m. on December 30. The December 30 meeting was held, and the board again voted to deny the plaintiffs\u2019 request. At a hearing before the judge the parties agreed that the action of the board on the twenty-seventh was invalid for want of the notice required by G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. The judge ruled that the actions taken at the meeting of the twenty-seventh, although timely under \u00a7 81P, were invalid because of the want of notice and further found and ruled that the board\u2019s action of the thirtieth was invalid, as the fourteen-day period specified in \u00a7 81P had expired. <em>Cas-sani </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Hull, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 456-457 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The court thereupon proceeded to fashion a remedy that on proper notice the board reconsider the plaintiffs\u2019 requests (presumably at a meeting to be held pursuant to such notice). The judgment entered disposed of all aspects of the case presented by the pleadings. The remedy included the exercise of the judge\u2019s discretionary power under \u00a7 23B to invalidate the vote of the twenty-seventh, as well as the discretion accorded him under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 3. That discretion was tempered by his ordering the return of the case to the board for reconsideration and by his reinstating the fourteen-day period in which the board should act. The plaintiffs would have us determine that as neither \u00a7 23B nor \u00a7 81P makes any provision for such an extension of the fourteen-day period, the judge lacked the authority to do so. They would have us strike part 2 of the judgment, leaving part 1 in place. Were we to do so, the plaintiffs would at once become entitled to the endorsement sought. This clearly was not the result the judge intended. We decline to interfere with the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion by taking that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We are not to be understood as approving as a general principle of law that a judge may extend the fourteen-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>period in which the board is required to act under \u00a7 81P. See <em>Cassani </em>v. <em>Planning Board of Hull, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 456-457; <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Plymouth, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 747 (1975). In this case the board did act within the fourteen-day period as extended by the agreement of the parties. Assuming, as have the parties, that the action was susceptible to attack by the plaintiffs under \u00a7 23B, it was nonetheless open to the judge in his discretion not to invalidate the board\u2019s action. In view of that, the plaintiffs can hardly be said to have reason to complain that instead of allowing the questioned action to stand, the judge invalidated it and, as a part of a single package, returned the matter to the board, where all concerned would be afforded the opportunity to begin anew on the application for the approval under \u00a7 81P. We recognize, and it appears that the judge did also, that the plaintiffs had no control over the board\u2019s actions as to compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 23B. It is apparent that the judge did not desire to penalize the applicants for a failure of the board beyond their control. Compare <em>Burwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Worcester, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 739, 745 (1974). On the other hand, on the basis of the plans submitted to the board the judge may have concluded that there was some merit in the board\u2019s refusal to endorse them as requested, although that point was not decided by the judge and has not been argued before us. Thus, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, the judge\u2019s solution appears to us to be consistent with the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">To avoid any question as to the running of the \"fourteen-day limit\u201d set out in the judgment, part 2 thereof is to be modified by striking therefrom the words \"entry of judgment in this case\u201d and by inserting in place thereof the words \"receipt by the clerk of courts of the rescript of the Appeals Court.\u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-13\"> \"It is Ordered and Adjudged: (1) that the decisions of the Dennis Planning Board of December 27,1976, and December 30,1976, relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ing to the Dennishore plans of Franklin Kelley et al are annulled and invalidated; (2) that the Dennis Planning Board shall upon proper notice reconsider the request of Franklin Kelley et al for 'Approval Not Required\u2019 endorsement, subject to the fourteen-day limit contained in G.L., Chapter 41, Section 81P, which shall run from the date of entry of judgment in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\"> The complaint alleges and the answer admits that the reason for the delay was that the town counsel was unable to attend the meeting ''due to personal reasons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> It does not appear that the parties had agreed to any extension of the fourteen-day period (within which, under \u00a7 81P, the board was required to act) beyond December 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
