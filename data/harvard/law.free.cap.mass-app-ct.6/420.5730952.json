Dougan and three are against Robert R. Linehan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b443-5\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad7U\">Both defendants challenge their convictions of kidnapping, armed robbery and rape, alleging certain errors of procedure and substance. The defendant Dou-gan also appeals from a conviction of committing an unnatural act. We are constrained in the circumstances of these cases to reverse all the convictions and remand the cases for a new trial in the Superior Court for reasons that will appear below.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">As a complete recitation of the rather bizarre and sordid facts would serve no useful purpose, we mention particular facts only where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">1. There was no showing that either defendant had ransacked the apartment of the male victim, who was the principal Commonwealth witness, or had attempted to run him off the road. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McWhinnie, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 877 (1977), and cases cited. Accordingly, it was error to admit evidence of those events (cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szemetum, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 653-654 [1975]), and the judge had no discretion in the premises. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1973); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cirillo, </em>468 F.2d 1233, 1240 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 989 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">2. In view of the fact that there was no evidence linking either of the defendants to any of the incidents referred to in part 1 above, the prosecutor\u2019s closing was an even more egregious error. There can be no justification for comment on matters not in evidence (e.g., \"They had hounded him from pillar to post\u201d). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fearns, </em>501 F.2d 486, 489 (7th Cir. 1974). Nor may a \u201cprosecutor assail the character of a defendant whose character has not been placed in issue at trial (e.g., \"you\u2019re not dealing with your average citizen when you\u2019re dealing with a motorcycle gang\u201d). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 575 (1977), and cases cited. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>permissible bounds of closing argument were thus exceeded, and the judge\u2019s perfunctory curative instructions (e.g., \"If anything is said which does not accord with your memory of the evidence, ... you are to disregard it\u201d) were inadequate in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 446, 470-472 (1978), and authorities cited. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, 514 </em>F.2d 334, 343 (9th Cir. 1975). Thus, in these circumstances the Commonwealth cannot be heard to justify its closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 204-206 &amp; n.1 (1977) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>370 Mass. 591, 594-597 (1976). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. at 574-577. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>364 Mass. 310, 315-316 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">3. It was error for the judge to refuse, to allow counsel on cross-examination to show the photograph of one Robert W. Hayes to the male victim in an effort to shake his in-court identification of Linehan as one of those who had participated in the offenses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>282 Mass. 593, 597-599 (1933). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 288-290 (1974). The Commonwealth\u2019s argument in support of the judge\u2019s action must fail because there is nothing in the record to indicate that Linehan\u2019s counsel intended to use the photograph for an improper purpose or in an improper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">4. As there was no constitutional attack on the identification of Linehan (see e.g., <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 301-302 [1967], and <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 382-386 [1968]), the constitutional arguments of both parties relative to the lack of a voir dire are beside the point. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 91-92 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783, 787-789 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, ante </em>230, 237 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">5. There is no doubt that the defendants in their efforts to show possible bias are entitled to inquire whether Lopes had been aware of the maximum penalty for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>firearms offense at the time he agreed to cooperate with the authorities in the instant case. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>367 Mass. 454, 459-460 (1975), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dominico, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 713-714 (1974), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">6. As the defendants\u2019 other assignments of error are directed to issues which are not likely to arise on a retrial, no discussion of any of them is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
