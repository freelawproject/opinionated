The party benefited were the insurers on hull against total loss. Whatever expenses wore incurred to save the vessel from a total loss, against which it was insured, is a charge upon the underwriters against total loss. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Warren Ins. Co., </em>14 Pet. 109; <em>Frichette </em>v. <em>State Ins. Co., </em>3 Bosw. 190; <em>White </em>v. <em>Republic Ins. Co., </em>57 Me. 91; <em>Leiber </em>v. <em>Liverpool Ins. Co., </em>6 Bush, 639.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-18\">Is there any exception against this payment, under the terms of the policy, free from general average under 50 per cent.? Under this clause the expenses are clearly covered by the words of the policy, as but for these expenses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>salvage alone might have amounted to a total loss or 50 per cent., independently of the particular average. All the authorities agree that salvage is a charge upon the insurer, as a loss under the policy. 2 Arn. Ins. 846; 1 Pars. Mar. Ins. 599; Renecke, Ins. 380; 2 Phil. Ins. 477. Salvage is not general average. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Warren Ins. Co., </em>3 Sum. 394, 400; 2 Arn. Ins. 844; Id. p. 876, \u00a7 323; Id. 878; 3 Kent, Comm. 232; Lown. Gen. Av. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-4\">It is against public policy to give an additional motive to masters to refuse the aid of salvors, or to endeavor, as in this case, to reduce exorbitant charges. Charges incurred to prevent a total loss are decided by Willes, J., in <em>Kidston </em>v. <em>Marine Ins. Co., </em>L. R. 1 C. P. 535, to be particular charges, for \u2022which the insurers against total loss are liable, although they do not amount to a total loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-5\">In America it is universally held that additional expenses, fairly incurred in endeavoring to reduce the loss for the benefit of the underwriters, may be recovered. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Van Horne, </em>1 Caines, 284; <em>Jumel </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>7 Johns. 412; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>Id. 59.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-6\"><em>Theodore M.

Are insurers liable for salvage paid under the circumstances stated in the libel? The question is one of much importance and considerable difficulty. In this country it is undecided. It was so in England until the recent case of <em>Aitchison </em>v. <em>Lohre, </em>4 App. Cas. 755, when it was determined in favor of the insurers. Without this authority I am not certain what eonclu- ' sion I would reach. A discussion of the question now would be but a waste of time. All that can be said on either side was said by the distinguished counsel who appeared in <em>Aitchison </em>v. Lohre, and the very eminent judges who there filed opinions. That case has settled the law for England; and the great importance of uniformity in the rules governing commerce, and all contracts respecting it, in that country and this, induces me to accept the conclusion there reached. As said in <em>Norrington </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>115 U. S. 188, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 12: \u201cA diversity in the law as administered on the two sides of the Atlantic, concerning the interpretation and effect of commercial contracts, is greatly to be deprecated.\u201d Of course, differences do exist which the courts cannot remove. This, however, is not a reason or justification for increasing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The expenses of the agent sent out to settle with the salvors, and procure a release of the vessel from their lien, falls within the same rule. The exceptions are therefore sustained, and a decree will be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
