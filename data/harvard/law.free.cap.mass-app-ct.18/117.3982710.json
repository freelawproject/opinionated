The plaintiffs also sought an order requiring \u201cthe defendants to proceed to arbitration under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 8, and G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2, for a resolution of their dispute relative to the termination of the employment of the plaintiff [Browne].\u201d In addition to contesting the merits, the defendants moved for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against Browne\u2019s pursuing his claim for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The defendants appeal from an ensuing order compelling arbitration and the denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction against Browne\u2019s pursuing his claim for arbitration. The appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">By identical provisions in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 16, and G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 18, the Legislature has enumerated various types of judgments, orders, and decrees involving arbitration from which an appeal may be taken. As we are of opinion that the Supreme Judicial Court has adopted the view that those enumerations are comprehensive, an appeal (at least as of right) from any type of order not so enumerated is precluded. See <em>School Comm. of Agawam </em>v. <em>Agawam Educ. Assn., </em>371 Mass. 845, 846 (1977), where the court dismissed an appeal from an order denying an application to stay an arbitration proceeding. See also <em>George A. Fuller Co. </em>v. <em>Nelson J. Sanford &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 802 (1977). Likewise, this court, relying on the <em>Agawam </em>decision and G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 18, has indicated that no appeal will lie from an order compelling arbitration. See <em>Greenleaf Engr. &amp; Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Teradyne, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 571, 573 (1983); <em>J &amp; G Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Bennett Co., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 629, 630 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On appeal, however, the defendants assert that <em>the Agawam </em>case was legislatively overruled by St. 1977, c. 405, which inserted a second paragraph inG. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, under which appeals may be taken as of right from orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions. The defendants correctly note that the <em>Agawam </em>case was decided before that amendment; the same is true of the <em>Fuller </em>case, <em>supra. </em>The defendants\u2019 argument also appears to suggest that appeals may now be taken not only from orders denying a stay of arbitration, but also from orders compelling the parties to proceed to arbitration, contrary to the suggestions in the <em>Greenleaf </em>and <em>J &amp; G </em>cases, neither of which is cited in the defendants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We are unable to discern any reason for treating in these circumstances a denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction any differently from a denial of a stay. To the contrary, sound practice requires similar judicial treatment, and if one is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>an appealable order, neither should be the other. No language within the second paragraph of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
