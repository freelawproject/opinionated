G. L. c. 65C, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. A probate judge ruled that they were not, and the Commissioner of Revenue has appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The answer to the question turns on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the particular property interests held by the decedent on the date of his death represented \u201creal and tangible personal property having an actual situs outside the Commonwealth,\u201d G. L. c. 65C, \u00a7 <em>1(f), </em>inserted by St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 74. Our research indicates that the application of the Massachusetts estate tax to this particular type of asset has not previously been dealt with in an appellate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">When the decedent died on January 13, 1980, a domiciliary of Massachusetts, he owned three separate interests in oil and gas \u201cleases.\u201d \u201cLease\u201d is a term used loosely in the oil and gas industry to designate a variety of relationships between investors and landowners. (1) He had a \u201croyalty interest\u201d in an oil and gas lease relating to land in New Mexico. Under the terms of this lease he was designated as one of two \u201clessors\u201d who were entitled to receive one-eighth of the oil produced or, at the lessee\u2019s option, one-eighth of the proceeds of the sale of the oil produced, and one-eighth of the proceeds of the sale of gas produced. (2) He had a \u201cworking interest\u201d in an oil and gas lease relating to land in Texas, which interest he obtained by assignment from the lessee. Under the terms of this lease, the lessee, in exchange for payment of rents and royalties to the lessor, was entitled to explore, develop, and operate the land for the purpose, essentially, of producing oil, gas, and other minerals. (3) And he had an \u201coverriding royalty interest\u201d in an oil and gas lease, also relating to land in Texas, which interest he obtained by assignment from an overriding royalty interest holder under the original oil and gas lease. The decedent\u2019s \u201cworking interest\u201d and \u201coverriding royalty interest\u201d are each set forth in a \u201cdivision order\u201d specifying the nature of the interest and the fractional share.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The three underlying leases are form documents, similar in content. They all \u201cgrant, lease and let exclusively,\u201d and the New Mexico lease also \u201cdemises,\u201d the land described for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>purpose of exploration and production of oil and gas. Each is for a five-year term and \u201cthereafter\u201d so long as minerals are produced. Royalties accrue to the lessor as a fractional share of production, the lessee having the option to purchase that share at market price. Lessors and lessees have full rights of assignment. A lessee may surrender or abandon the lease, whereupon the interest in all minerals reverts to the lessor. Except to the extent of the rights of a lessor to royalties, the lessee owns the minerals produced. The lessee has the right to make reasonable use of the surface to the extent necessary to obtain the oil and gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The difference between an \u201coverriding royalty interest\u201d and a \u201cworking interest\u201d is that payments to one holding an \u201coverriding royalty interest\u201d are determined without deducting production costs, whereas one who has a \u201cworking interest\u201d assumes an obligation to pay production costs. None of the parties makes an issue of the differences among the three types of ownership involved. Although the documentation in the record of the chain of title with regard to the decedent\u2019s overriding royalty interest is incomplete, there is no basis for speculation that successive assignments gave assignees something less than the original lessee\u2019s interest in the particular fractional share transferred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record to indicate that either of the States in which the minerals are located is seeking to impose an estate tax on these interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">For purposes of the Massachusetts estate tax (which replaced the inheritance tax for persons dying on or after January 1, 1976) \u201cgross estate\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cthe federal gross estate, whether or not a federal estate tax return is required to be filed, less the value of real and tangible personal property having an actual situs outside the Commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 65C, \u00a7 1 (/), inserted by St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 74.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>The Federal gross estate, in turn, is defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031(a) (1976) as the \u201cvalue ... of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated.\u201d Thus, real property or tangible personal property located outside of Massachusetts is excluded from a person\u2019s Massachusetts gross estate, whereas intangible personal property, regardless of its location, is included.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The property in question has, in varying degrees, aspects of personalty and realty as well as tangibility and intangibility. On the one hand, like securities, the interests entitle the owner to receive monetary payments. On the other hand, they clearly relate to physical substances in the ground which are tangible and usually regarded as parts of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The question to be determined is whether the Massachusetts Legislature intended to include within the categories of real property or tangible personal property any or all of the mineral interests owned by the decedent at the time of his death or whether, on the other hand, such interests were intended to be classified as intangible personal property. To make the determination called for, we must first look to Massachusetts opinions preceding the insertion of G. L. c. 65C because, presumably, the Legislature was aware of earlier appellate decisions when it made the distinctions in issue in this case. See <em>Page </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>389 Mass. 388, 392 (1983). Thus, it is of significance that Massachusetts has consistently recognized that mineral rights may be severed from the remainder of land by reservation or grant, leaving an estate in the minerals which is separate and distinct from the soil in which they lie. <em>See Adams </em>v. <em>Briggs Iron Co., </em>7 Cush. 361, 366, 367 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>(1851); <em>Chester Emery Co. </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>112 Mass. 424 (1873); <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>183 Mass. 303, 305 (1903). A right to take minerals from land \u2014 something less than a fee interest in the minerals \u2014 has generally been included within the category of profits \u00e1 prendre which are viewed as real estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Wheatland, </em>343 Mass. 650 (1962), holding that for purposes of the Massachusetts income tax then in effect<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> payments to an owner for out-of-State timber rights were derived from profits \u00e1 prendre, analogous to the right to receive rent payments, and not taxable because they represented interests in real estate. Accord <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>356 Mass. 51 (1969), dealing specifically with the right to receive royalties based on mineral deposits located in Minnesota. See also <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>349 Mass. 438 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Although not conclusive as to the intent of the Massachusetts Legislature, it is of some significance that the courts in Texas and New Mexico, where the minerals are located, as well as most courts elsewhere in the country and most commentators, would also classify the kind of mineral rights with which we are concerned as something other than intangible personal property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Classifying the decedent\u2019s royalty interest as an interest in real estate presents little difficulty. The royalty interest represents outright ownership of a fractional portion of the minerals in the ground. Although they also represent interests in the mineral deposits in the ground, the overriding royalty and working interests are different from the royalty interest in that they are carved out of the lessee\u2019s interest in the minerals. Notwithstanding the terminology used, the lessees\u2019 interests are indistinguishable from profits \u00e1 prendre and should be treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>as such. Under the Massachusetts appellate decisions prior to enactment of the Massachusetts estate tax, of which the Legislature was presumably aware (see <em>Page </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra), </em>profits \u00e1 prendre were regarded as realty. Even considering them as ordinary leaseholds, however, a lessee\u2019s interest would not have been classified as an intangible interest in personal property. See <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>243 Mass. 129 (1922), holding that for purposes of the Massachusetts income tax provisions then in effect, income from the sale of a lessee\u2019s interest in the leasehold was not income derived from an intangible interest in personal property. Moreover, in general, \u201ctax laws are to be strictly construed. The right to tax is not to be implied, but must be plainly conferred. Doubts are resolved in favor of the .taxpayer.\u201d <em>DeBlois </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporation &amp; Taxation, </em>276 Mass. 437, 438-439 (1931). <em>State Tax Commission </em>v. <em>Wheatland, supra </em>at 653. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, supra </em>at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In summary, based upon Massachusetts precedent, authority in other jurisdictions, and the principle of strict construction of statutes dealing with taxation, the conclusion is compelling that the Legislature intended to exclude from the definition of gross estate royalty interests, overriding royalty interests arid working interests in out-of-State mineral deposits. We need not decide whether a legislative change expanding the definition to include any such interests would be consistent with Federal due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-14\"> The executors filed a Massachusetts estate tax return listing the interests in question as non-Massachusetts property. After auditing the return, the Commissioner included the assets as part of the decedent\u2019s Massachusetts gross estate. The executors applied for an abatement of the tax, claiming that the Commissioner had erroneously included the interests as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Massachusetts gross estate. The Commissioner denied the application, whereupon this action was commenced in a Probate Court. The parties submitted a stipulation of facts. The judge ruled that each of the decedent\u2019s interests constituted realty with a situs outside of the Commonwealth, and, consequently, that they were not subject to the Massachusetts estate tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> We express no opinion as to whether a holder of an overriding royalty interest with no rights other than the right to receive proceeds from the minerals sold would be viewed as holding intangible personal property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\"> The terms used are not defined in the statute. General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, provides that, for purposes of statutory construction in general, the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201c \u2018land,\u2019 \u2018lands\u2019 and \u2018real estate\u2019 shall include lands, tenements and heredi-taments and all rights thereto and interests therein.\u201d General Laws c. 140C, \u00a7 l(w), as in effect prior to St. 1981, c. 733, \u00a7 1, defines \u201creal property\u201d for purposes of the Consumer Credit Cost Disclosure Act as \u201cproperty which is real property under the law of the State in which it is located.\u201d General Laws c. 64H, \u00a7 1(15), defines \u201ctangible personal property\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts sales tax as \u201cpersonal property of any nature consisting of any produce, goods, wares, merchandise and commodities whatsoever ... but shall not include rights and credits, insurance policies, bills of exchange, stocks and bonds and similar evidences of indebtedness or ownership.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\"> For a case on point decided after the adoption of the Massachusetts estate tax, see <em>Bates Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>380 Mass. 933 (1980), holding that the right to remove sand and gravel from land was a present interest in that land which fell squarely within the definition of a profit \u00e1 prendre and which was a compensable interest in the condemned real estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"> The Massachusetts income tax was first adopted in 1916 (St. 1916, c. 269), pursuant to art. 44 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth. As originally enacted and until the law was amended in 1971 (St. 1971, c. 555) to make the definition of taxable income conform more closely to the definition of \u201cfederal gross income\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a) (1970), the Massachusetts income tax was frequently held to be not a general income tax or an excise tax but a tax on the underlying property. See <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>356 Mass. 51, 54-55 (1969); <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>368 Mass. 242, 243-245 (1975). Prior to 1971, income derived from real property, whether located within or without Massachusetts, was not taxable. See <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Wheatland, </em>343 Mass. 650, 653 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\"> In Texas, the lease vests in the lessee a determinable fee in the oil and gas in place, <em>Waggoner\u2019s Estate </em>v. <em>Sigler, </em>118 Tex. 509 (1929), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>royalty interest is an interest in land because it represents a portion of the oil and gas which remains vested in the lessor. <em>Sheffield </em>v. <em>Hogg, </em>124 Tex. 290 (1934). As such, it is subject to tax as real property. <em>Id. </em>at 299. New Mexico also recognizes oil and gas leases and retained royalty interests as real property. <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Roller, </em>94 N.M. 234, 235 (1980), reaffirming <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>27 N.M. 564 (1922), and <em>Duvall </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>54 N.M. 27 (1949). In other jurisdictions which recognize the fee to the minerals in. place prior to possession as severable from the fee to the surface land, the retained royalty interest of the lessor and the various lessee interests are generally considered real property. <em>Arrington </em>v. <em>United Royalty Co., </em>188 Ark. 270 (1933). <em>Hagood </em>v. <em>Heckers, </em>182 Colo. 337, 347-348 (1973). <em>State ex rel.

However, because subsurface oil and gas are fugacious, many States regard the fee to be nonseverable and the interests in the minerals to be incorporeal hereditaments, profits \u00e1 prendre or chattels real but, nevertheless, personalty flowing from an interest in the land. <em>Meeker </em>v. <em>Ambassador Oil Co., </em>308 F.2d 875, 882 (10th Cir. 1982). <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>113 Ariz. 248 (1976). <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>3 Cal.2d 110 (1935). <em>People ex rel.
