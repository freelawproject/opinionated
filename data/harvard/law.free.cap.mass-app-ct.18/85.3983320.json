Discussions proceeded over the next few days between counsel and between experts retained by each party to value certain closely held entities and real estate. On May 25, 1982, counsel reported a settlement to the judge, and counsel for the husband asked that both counsel be allowed to participate in reading into the record \u201cthe bare bones\u201d of an agreement which \u201cwe would like to incorporate in a formal agreement at a later stage but, nevertheless, to read the basic understandings into the record.\u201d There followed a detailed recitation of the parties\u2019 agreement, made with the assistance of a draft, which dealt with the transfer and retention of all of the marital assets, alimony, child support (including costs of education through college), custody, visitation and miscellaneous matters. The parties were present when the agreement was read into the record, and thereafter the judge conducted the colloquy which is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The judge then heard evidence on the ground for divorce (irretrievable breakdown of the marriage under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB) and invited the parties to submit a formal agreement for incorporation in the judgments of divorce nisi. Within about a month the wife repudiated the oral settlement agreement and retained new counsel. On July 9, 1982, the judge denied the wife\u2019s motion to reopen the proceedings, the grounds of which will be discussed below, and granted the husband\u2019s motions for the entry of judgment. On July 12, 1982, judgments of divorce nisi were entered for each party, incorporating, as the agreement of the parties, precisely the terms of the oral agreement read into the record on May 25,1982. The wife\u2019s motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>for a new trial and for relief from the judgments (Mass.R.Dom. Rel.P. 59[a] &amp; 60[b] [1975]) were denied on August <em>9, </em>1982. The wife appeals from the denial of her motion to reopen the proceedings, the judgments, the denial of her postjudgment motions, and a judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">1. <em>The effect of the oral agreement. </em>The agreement of the parties was reached after lengthy and apparently intensive negotiations. Experts retained by each party conferred and arrived at valuations for the closely held entities and the real estate. Counsel for the husband prepared a draft of an agreement which was reviewed with counsel for the wife. After further negotiations, some changes were made in the draft. It was this amended draft which was used as the basis for the agreement which was read into the record by counsel. Despite the characterization of that agreement as the \u201cbare bones\u201d and the \u201cbasic understandings\u201d by counsel for the husband, it contained all of the essential elements, in unusual detail undoubtedly because counsel was using the draft, of a marital separation agreement appropriate to the circumstances of the parties. The parties heard the agreement read and, in response to the clear questions of the judge, indicated that they entered the agreement freely, that it was not the product of fraud, that each had full knowledge of the assets and liabilities of the other, that each had been advised by counsel as to the meaning of the \u201cindividual clauses\u201d and that each was satisfied with the agreement. When the wife indicated some hesitancy about possible omissions, the judge told her that \u201cthis is the moment of truth\u201d and that \u201ceverything has to come to an end at one time and before it comes to an end, we like to have all bases covered.\u201d The wife stated her understanding of that concept and pressed the point no further. In referring to the contemplated \u201cformal written agreement,\u201d the judge told the parties that it would include all that had been dictated into the record and \u201cstandard clauses which lawyers frequently refer to as boiler plate.\u201d The parties indicated their understanding of the term \u201cboiler plate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We conclude that, at this stage of the proceedings, in the particular circumstances presented, the agreement read into the record was binding on the parties.

On July 7, 1982, trial counsel for the wife was allowed to withdraw for the reason that the wife had repudiated the May 25, 1982, agreement. New counsel for the wife appeared on July 7, 1982, and on July 9, 1982, filed a motion to reopen the proceedings. The three motions were heard together on the latter date; the husband\u2019s motions were allowed, and the wife\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The question whether to allow the motion to reopen the proceedings was within the discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Palmieri, </em>325 Mass. 554, 557 (1950).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only argument that the wife advances on appeal (see Mass.R.A.P. 16[a] [4]), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 [1975]) is that the judge abused his discretion in not reopening the proceedings in the face of the wife\u2019s allegations that the experts consulted during the settlement negotiations had made a major error in the valuation of business entities owned by the parties. In support of the motion the wife\u2019s counsel made general representations to the judge that he would produce a new expert who would testify that the original experts had used an improper method of valuing these entities, with the result that they were undervalued by one million dollars. The judge denied the motion, noting that the wife did not allege \u201cfraud, misrepresentation or deceit\u201d in connection with the settlement agreement, that before accepting the agreement he had conducted a colloquy (see note 1, <em>supra) </em>in which the wife indicated her full understanding of the underlying facts and the essential elements of the agreement and that she entered into it without coercion, that she understood the finality of the agreement, and that expert opinions regarding the value of assets such as those in question often vary widely. The wife\u2019s counsel then made an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u201coffer of proof\u201d which included a written report of the wife\u2019s new expert which concluded that \u201c[u]nfortunately, our Courts reject a speculation on future economic conditions, in most cases,\u201d and recommended that the wife seek a division of the entities in question into a \u201ctenancy in common.\u201d There was nothing in the report to undermine the valuations established by the experts for both parties beyond the expression, acknowledged to be speculative, that future economic conditions would result in an increase in the value of the entities. There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion to reopen the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">3. <em>The judgments of divorce nisi. </em>We hold that in the circumstances it was error to enter the judgments of divorce nisi incorporating the oral agreement of the parties and directing that the agreement should survive the entry of the judgments, without first finding that the agreement was fair and reasonable. Separation agreements which fix the mutual financial and property rights and obligations of a husband and wife, including those relating to a division of marital assets, are valid and binding, and specifically enforceable \u201cabsent countervailing equities,\u201d when a judge determines, at the time of the entry of a judgment of divorce nisi or thereafter, that the agreement was free of fraud and coercion and fair and reasonable at the time of the entry of the judgment, and that the parties agreed on the finality of the agreement. See <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 436-437 (1976); <em>Stansel </em>v. <em>Stansel, </em>385 Mass. 510, 514-515 (1982); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>389 Mass. 21, 24 (1983). Cf. <em>Osborne v. Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 599 (1981). Here, with ample bases in the record, the judge found before the entry of the judgments that the agreement was free of fraud and coercion and that the parties had agreed on its finality. He made no finding as to the fairness and reasonableness of the agreement. (Indeed, at the time of the entry of the judgments, the record indicates that he may have had insufficient information to allow for consideration of all of the factors necessary to such a finding.) The judge enforced the agreement, by incorporating it in the judgments, against the wishes of the wife. We think that in these circumstances the judge was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to make an independent finding that the agreement was fair and reasonable before incorporating it in the judgments. The wife\u2019s repudiation of the agreement before the entry of judgments put the case in a posture equivalent to one in which a party to an agreement which survives a judgment of divorce nisi seeks specific performance so as to bar a complaint for modification of the judgment. See <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>supra; <em>Stansel </em>v. <em>Stansel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In making a determination of fairness and reasonableness in circumstances such as here presented, a judge should consider at least the following: (1) the nature and substance of the objecting party\u2019s complaint; (2) the financial and property division provisions of the agreement as a whole; (3) the context in which the negotiations took place; (4) the complexity of the issues involved; (5) the background and knowledge of the parties; (6) the experience and ability of counsel;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (7) the need for and availability of experts to assist the parties and counsel; and (8) the mandatory and, if the judge deems it appropriate, the discretionary factors set forth in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u00a7 34 factors are not in any sense determinative, however, since marital separation agreements, at least as they relate to a division of assets, are almost always the product of compromise. In passing on the agreement, the judge is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing, though he may do so in his discretion. Finally, the judge is not required to divine what judgment he would likely enter if the case were fully litigated, but only whether the agreement is fair and reasonable when considered in light of the factors enumerated above and any other relevant circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The wife argues on appeal that the oral agreement was unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1, because (1) it was made \u201cupon consideration of marriage\u201d and (2) it constituted a \u201ccontract for the sale of lands.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The wife also contends that the judge abused his discretion in ordering that the agreement survive the judgments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither issue was presented in the Probate Court. \u201cA[ ] [nonjurisdictional] issue cannot be raised for the first time before this court.\u201d <em>Trustees of Stigmatine Fathers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>369 Mass. 562, 565 (1976). See <em>Manes </em>v. <em>Manes, </em>370 Mass. 235, 238 (1976); <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86, 88 (1977).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">4. <em>The judgment of contempt. </em>No stay of any of the provisions of the judgments of divorce nisi pending appeal was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>by the Probate Court. Following the entry of the judgments, the wife was adjudged in contempt of court for having wilfully failed and refused to cooperate in placing for sale, in accordance with the agreement incorporated in the judgments, Florida real estate owned by the parties. The wife was sentenced to jail until she should purge herself of contempt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is unnecessary to consider the wife\u2019s appeal from the judgment of contempt, as the judgment must be vacated in view of our disposition of the appeals from the judgments of divorce nisi. We comment, however, on the rules and statutes governing automatic stays of the operation of judgments of divorce nisi pending appeal. Rule 62(d) of Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. (1975) provides that an appeal stays execution upon a judgment except as otherwise provided in the rules. It seems clear that the term \u201cexecution\u201d applies only to a judgment for the payment of money. See rule 69. See generally G. L. cc. 235 &amp; 236. Rule 62(g) provides that an appeal stays the running of the nisi period but not the operation of \u201cany other order or judgment of the court relative to custody, visitation, alimony, support or maintenance unless the court otherwise orders.\u201d The rules make no provision for the automatic stay pending appeal of the order in question in this case, related as it was to the division of marital assets, and not calling for the payment of money. Compare rule 62(a) (\u201cExcept [with respect to actions for injunction or receivership], no execution shall issue upon a judgment <em>nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement </em>until the time for appeal from the judgment has expired\u201d [emphasis supplied]). Under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 304, \u00a7 1, which makes applicable the provisions of \u00a7 23, an appeal, while staying the running of the nisi period, does not stay proceedings under orders or judgments in divorce (or separate support or child support, see G. L. c. 209, \u00a7\u00a7 32 &amp; 37) proceedings. Under \u00a7 24, therefore, the order in question would not be stayed and contempt proceedings would be procedurally proper. Cf. <em>Sloane </em>v. <em>Sloane, </em>349 Mass. 318 (1965); <em>Gilmore </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Gilmore, </em>369 Mass. 598, 600 (1976); <em>Scholz </em>v. <em>Scholz, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 859 (1974) (cases decided before the 1978 amendment to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 24, but which emphasize the applicability of \u00a7\u00a7 23 &amp; 24 to appeals in divorce proceedings). There is no conflict between the rules and statutes. <em>See Boston Seaman\u2019s Friend Soc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>379 Mass. 414, 416-417 (1980). However, we invite the attention of the Probate Court and the Legislature to what may have been an oversight in failing to make some provision for the automatic stay of orders such as here involved pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Those portions of the judgments of divorce nisi which incorporate the provisions of the oral agreement with respect to the financial rights and obligations of the parties, between themselves and as to the children, and the division of marital assets are vacated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In all other respects the judgments are affirmed. The judgment of contempt is vacated. The case is remanded to the Probate Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\"> The Court: \u201cDid each of you hear in full what [counsel] said?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Mrs. Dominick: \u201cYes, sir, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The Court: \u201cDid you, Mr. Dominick?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Mr. Dominick: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The Court: \u201cAnd did each of you fully understand what [counsel] dicT tated?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Mrs. Dominick: \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">The Court: \u201cMr. Dominick?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Mr. Dominick: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">The Court: \u201cAnd did your counsel individually explain to you during the course of negotiations what these individual clauses meant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">Mrs..

L. c. 209, \u00a7\u00a7 25 &amp; 26. On the record before us it is impossible to determine whether the agreement would require the wife to transfer any interest in real estate or simply her interest in entities which owned real estate. In any event, even if the agreement could be construed as constituting a \u201ccontract for the sale of lands\u201d and the husband\u2019s insistence on its enforcement as an \u201caction,\u201d see G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1 &amp; clause Third, we think the better view is that oral agreements such as here involved, when read into the record, are not subject to the Statute of Frauds. It seems clear that such an agreement when incorporated in the judgments is not subject to the Statute of Frauds. See, e.g., <em>Perley </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>89 N.H. 359, 360 (1938); <em>Deer </em>v. <em>Deer, </em>29 Wash.2d 202, 212-213 (1947); <em>In re Dolgin Eldert Corp., </em>31 N.Y.2d 1, 8 (1972); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>14 Md. App. 263, 270-271 (1972); <em>Wray v. Langston, </em>380 So.2d 1262, 1263 (Miss. 1980). See also <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Juhlin, </em>194 Or. 40, 44 (1952); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>5 Ohio App.3d 94, 99-100 (1982). Contra <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Idaho Dept. of Water Resources, </em>105 Idaho 98, 100-101 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\"> We comment, however, that this argument is frivolous. The survival provision was read into the record as part of the agreement; the wife indicated that she had heard and understood the agreement and that each provision had been explained to her by her counsel; and immediately thereafter, presumably in the presence of the parties, in response to the judge\u2019s specific inquiry counsel confirmed that the agreement was to survive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> In view of our disposition of the appeals from the judgments of divorce nisi it is unnecessary to consider the wife\u2019s appeals from the denial of her motions for a new trial and for relief from judgment (Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 59[a] &amp; 60[b] [1975]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b118-5\"> A single justice of this court stayed the sentence pending disposition of the appeals from the judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"> While the wife\u2019s only objection was to the method of valuation of particular assets, it necessarily had a broader reach since she claimed that a proper valuation would show that there had been a substantially disproportionate division of assets to her prejudice and contrary to the intention of the parties. We cannot determine to what extent, if any, the financial and property division provisions of the agreement were interdependent. Thus we do not think it appropriate to leave any of those provisions intact pending the ultimate determination of the fairness and reasonableness of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
