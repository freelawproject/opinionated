The planning board disapproved the subdivision plan, however, on the ground that the proposed 150-dwelling unit development exceeded the density requirement of a 1973 amendment to the zoning by-law (50,000 square feet per lot). Litigation followed, as a result of which a judge of the Superior Court ruled, in favor of the Chiras, that the applicable density requirement was that in effect before the 1973 amendment (25,000 square feet per lot) and, in favor of various abutters, that the zoning by-law prohibited multifamily structures. The grant of the special permit for cluster development was thus conditioned on a requirement that the dwelling units be detached but was otherwise upheld; and the planning board was ordered to reconsider the subdivision plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In October, 1975, the planning board approved the plan with a notation stating: \u201cAll building units will be detached as covenanted\u201d; and a covenant to that effect was executed by the Chiras and the board. With legal obstacles cleared, practical difficulties apparently ensued, and the present plaintiff, holder of a mortgage on the Chiras\u2019 tract, came into ownership of the property through foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"A68\">In September, 1980, the plaintiff filed with the board of appeals an application for a special permit to construct multi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>family dwelling structures<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on most of the land (approximately eighty acres) which had been the subject of the Chiras\u2019 proposed development. After hearing, the board of appeals voted to deny the permit for a variety of reasons having to do with the impact of the development, none of which needs to be recounted for purposes of the present appeals. In the spring of 1981, the plaintiff filed with the planning board a plan showing the proposed multi-family housing development and sought an endorsement that approval of the plan under the Subdivision Control Law was not required. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IP. The planning board rejected the plaintiff\u2019s contention, which was (and is) that it had a right to the endorsement because the road system was identical to that shown in the plan approved in 1975 and differed from the earlier plan only in the arrangement of lot lines. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 810.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Three actions ensued: first, an appeal under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, from the denial of the permit by the board of appeals; second, an appeal under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, from the planning board\u2019s refusal to give the approval-not-required endorsement; and, third, an action against the board of health for a declaration that a regulation of that board purporting to limit septic systems to two per lot, with a maximum of two dwelling units per septic system, is invalid and unconstitutional. The three municipal defendants moved for, and were granted, summary judgments , and the cases come before us on the plaintiff\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\n<em>The Planning Board Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The provision on which the plaintiff relies (relating to changes in the number, shape or size of lots on an approved plan), like the corresponding restriction applicable to planning board regulations (see \u00a7 81Q, eighth sentence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7), serves to confine the scope of planning boards\u2019 discretion to prevent their intruding into the sphere of zoning. The restrictions are not woodenly applied, however, to preclude a planning board from taking cognizance of a lot layout which directly impinges on matters lying within the proper sphere of planning board regulation, such as means of access for vehicles and utilities. See, e.g., <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>376 Mass. 801 (1978); <em>Hrenchuk </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Walpole, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 949 (1979). Compare <em>Gallitano </em>v. <em>Board of Survey &amp; Planning of Waltham, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 273-274 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The endorsements of a planning board (whether an approval of a plan under \u00a7 81U or a notation that approval is not required under \u00a7 8IP) are a prerequisite to recordability of the plan, \u00a7 8IX, and hence, as a practical matter, to marketability of the lots shown thereon. See <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 602-603 (1980); <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 808 (1981). The cases have supported the concept that, where a planning board knows its endorsement may tend to mislead buyers of lots shown on a plan, it is to exercise its powers in a way that protects persons who will rely on the endorsement. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 156 (1983). Thus, in <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, </em>346 Mass. 278, 283-284 (1963), it was held that a plan showing a division into two lots should have been treated as a subdivision if both lots had been proposed for building because one of the lots lacked the requisite frontage on a public way; but that the planning board had properly given its endorsement that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>proval was not required because the plan stated on its face that the deficient lot \u201c[did] not conform with the [z]oning [b]y-[l]aw\u201d (346 Mass. at 281). Compare <em>Smalley v. Planning Bd. of Harwich, supra </em>at 604-605. With <em>Smalley </em>contrast the <em>Bloom </em>case, <em>supra, </em>and <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>at 155-157.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Here, the 1973 plan was approved subject to a condition that all dwellings erected on the lots shown thereon be detached. The imposition of that condition was not appealed, and its propriety is not now before us. Compare <em>Campanelli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Ipswich, </em>358 Mass. 798 (1970); <em>Costanza &amp; Bertolino, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of North Reading, </em>360 Mass. 677, 681 (1971); <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Beverly, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 859 (1974). The 1981 plan showed the same roads but altered lot lines. The plan also showed that the lots are designed to serve multi-family dwellings. The plaintiff asked the planning board to disregard the proposed use, but this it could not demand as of right. <em>Loring Hills Developers Trust v. Planning Bd. of Salem, </em>374 Mass. 343, 351 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The application for the \u00a7 8IP endorsement was necessarily predicated on the approval of the 1973 plan, which remained contingent on acceptance of the condition. As the 1981 plan does not contemplate compliance with the condition, it is, in effect, a new plan, necessitating independent approval. <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Acushnet, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 218 (1980). Compare <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, </em>347 Mass. 320, 324-325 (1964). We need not consider whether the plaintiff might have been entitled to a \u00a7 8IP endorsement if each lot shown on the plan had been expressly made subject to the condition on the 1973 plan, in accordance with the holding in <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, supra. </em>The record in the case before us makes clear that the plaintiff did not seek such a qualified endorsement and affirmatively sought multi-family dwellings as \u201cthe only way the investors would be able to recover their money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>It follows that the judge did not err in ruling that the planning board was correct in refusing the \u00a7 8 IP endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>The Board of Appeals Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The judge did not deal with the several reasons given by the board of appeals for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for a special permit to construct multi-family housing. He appears instead to have ruled, in accordance with the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that the special permit was properly refused because of the detached-dwelling condition imposed on the 1973 plan approval. The board\u2019s contention was based on G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81Y, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7, which, in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cIn any . . . town in which the [Subdivision [Cjontrol [L]aw is in effect, the board or officer, if any, having the power and duty to issue permits for the erection of buildings shall not issue any permit for the erection of a building until first satisfied that the lot on which the building is to be erected is not within a subdivision, or that a way furnishing the access to such lot. . . is shown on a plan recorded or entitled to be recorded under [\u00a7 8IX], and that any condition endorsed thereon limiting the right to erect or maintain buildings on such lot have [sic] been satisfied, or waived by the planning board....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">If the plaintiff\u2019s application were for building permits, \u00a7 81Y would preclude favorable action by either the building inspector or the board. See <em>Ellen M. Gifford Sheltering Home Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wayland, </em>349 Mass. 292, 294-295 (1965); <em>Planning Bd. of Easton </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 1009 (1981). Here, the application is for a special permit, not a building permit: that is, it seeks a generalized approval for the construction of multi-family housing on the lots designated, which, if granted, must be followed by applications for the building permits for each approved building, showing detail sufficient to enable the building inspector to determine com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>pliance with applicable codes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before the building permit stage is reached, the plaintiff is in the position of needing approvals of two boards for its development: first, of the board of appeals, which has authority to issue special permits for multi-family dwellings; and, second, of the planning board, which has authority either to release the condition on the 1973 approved plan or to approve the 1981 plan. Compare <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 808. We are aware of no statutory requirement that the approval by one of those boards is a condition precedent to approval by the other. Contrast the relationship between the board of health and a planning board with respect to approval of a subdivision plan. <em>Loring Hills Developers Trust </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Salem, </em>374 Mass. at 348. <em>Fairbairn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Barnstable, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 173-174(1977). The necessity for favorable planning board action would not invalidate the grant of a special permit by the board of appeals, despite the fact that, without the favorable action, the special permit might prove unavailing. Hence the ground on which the judge summarily affirmed the decision of the board of appeals was erroneous. The board of appeals case must be remanded to the Superior Court for review under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, of the reasons for disapproval stated by the board. See <em>Vazza Props., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Woburn, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 312 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>The Board of Health Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Because the plan submitted to the planning board for the endorsement, approval not required, envisioned large lots with many four-family structures, the plaintiff anticipated a problem with the regulation promulgated by the board of health generally limiting to four the number of dwelling units that can be served by the two permitted septic systems on one lot.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus it initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>this action for declaratory relief to establish that the regulation was unconstitutional and invalid. Recognizing that declaratory relief is not afforded in the absence of an actual controversy, the plaintiff predicated the existence of such a controversy on two propositions: first that it was entitled as of right to the endorsement of the plan showing the lots and to the issuance of the special permits for multiple-family housing thereon; and, second, on an assertion that the regulation in issue left no discretion in the board of health to allow construction of septic systems to serve more than four dwellings on a lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We now know that the plaintiff is not entitled to endorsement of the plan establishing the lots; that its entitlement to the special permits denied by the board of appeals has yet to be litigated; and that the board of health asserts (at least in this litigation) that another of its regulations* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> gives it the discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>in appropriate cases to permit septic facilities serving more than four dwellings on a lot. The board of health has not yet been asked to review or act with respect to any aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s development plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In the circumstances the judge was correct in ruling that no actual controversy exists at this point between the plaintiff and the board of health. The plaintiff\u2019s present position with respect to septic systems is such that, if a court were to entertain its action, any owner of a large tract of land, foreseeing a possibility that a board might deny him a permit, could proceed directly to court to establish that a denial would be unconstitutional, without first seeking favorable action from the board. \u201c[Our courts have] long adhered to the principle that [they] should not resolve hypothetical issues.\u201d \u201cThis reluctance is heightened when the hypothetical question involves a constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>International Marathons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>392 Mass. 376, 379 &amp; n.7 (1984). The action was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In the planning board case, 82-1026, and the board of health case, 82-1020, the judgments are affirmed. In the board of appeals case, 82-1027, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> The judge\u2019s rulings were affirmed in <em>Chira </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Tisbury, </em>3 Mass.
