The Act also referred to subsequent employment opportunities for the faculty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of the College. The question before us is whether the Labor Relations Commission (Commission) was correct in interpreting c. 808 to allow bargaining over the continued employment of the College\u2019s faculty. The Commission held that such bargaining was mandatory and ordered the Regents to bargain with Massachusetts State College Association/MTA (Association), the employee organization representing the faculty and librarians<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at the College, \u201cover the methods and criteria for selecting which former Boston State College faculty/librarians and the number of such faculty to be employed at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Regents, the University,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the union representing the faculty at the University, Massachusetts Society of Professors/Faculty Staff Union/MTA/NEA (Union), have all appealed. We conclude that even if there was an obligation prior to the Act to bargain about the number of the College\u2019s faculty who were to be employed at the University and the criteria for their selection, that duty no longer existed after the passage of c. 808. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">There is no dispute as to the relevant facts, and the Commission disposed of the matter on affidavits and memoranda without hearing evidence. On July 14, 1981, the Regents voted to consolidate the College and the University and, as required by G. L. c. 15A, \u00a7 <em>5(b), </em>submitted a report to the Legislature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Shortly thereafter, the Association requested the Regents to bargain with it over the effects of consolidation. After rejecting a request of the Regents that there be coordinated bargaining with the faculty unions of other institutions, the Association bargained with the Regents from August 25, 1981, to November 23, 1981. Among the issues considered were the number of and the criteria under which the College\u2019s faculty members were to be employed at the University, as well as matters of tenure and seniority, the availability of employment at other State colleges, and which bargaining unit would represent the College\u2019s former employees. Prior to December 7, 1981, the date set for the next bargaining session, the parties agreed to suspend negotiations pending the outcome of a request by the Regents for a supplemental appropriation. The legislative response to that request was c. 808 of St. 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Since we think that the bills preceding c. 808 place the actions of the parties, as well as the Act, in context, we briefly review them here. The first appropriation bill discussing the discontinuance of the College was 1981 Senate Doc. No. 2398, reported out of committee on November 25, 1981. That bill, in addition to directing the Regents to provide an appropriate plan for students of the College, required them to implement a plan for \u201cthe provision of employment opportunities at public institutions of higher education\u201d for persons employed by the College; \u201cprovided, however, due consideration shall be given to the <em>integrity of academic and personnel policies and collective bargaining agreements at the employing institutions </em>. . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Tlie next legislative bill, 1981 House Doc. No. 7466, passed that chamber on December 18, 1981. It provided that employees of both the College and the University shall retain \u201call negotiated contract rights under their respective union contracts.\u201d The Regents were directed to initiate negotiations among the various institutions \u201cand the appropriate bargaining units thereof\u2019 in order to reconcile conflicting terms of existing contracts. If agreement should not be reached by a certain date, the Regents were to file recommendations for a legislative solution. The Regents were also directed to give \u201cdue regard to existing negotiated employee rights to include tenure, rank, seniority, and salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>On December 21, 1981, the Senate declined to concur in the House version and passed its own bill, 1981 Senate Doc. No. 2450. Instead of providing for bargaining by the Regents and the faculty unions, that bill contained a legislative resolution of the rights of the employees and their bargaining units. \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,\u201d professional employees of the College \u201cwho are subsequently employed at another public institution of higher education with the approval\u201d of the Regents shall be deemed to be members of the bargaining units, if any, of that other institution. The bill also gave the College\u2019s faculty certain seniority rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The House, in turn, declined to accept the Senate amendment, and the two versions went to conference on December 22, 1981. On January 5, 1982, the conference committee reported a bill (House Doc. No. 7479), which was passed by both chambers on that date.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> retained the provisions of the Senate bill as to bargaining units and as to seniority, but, in addition, gave the faculty of the College two significant benefits: (1) tenured faculty of the College were to be given tenured offers; and (2) those professional employees of the College who were not subsequently employed at another public institution of higher education were to continue \u201cto be deemed to be\u201d paid employees of the Regents until June 30, 1982 (later extended to August 31, 1982, by reason of St. 1982 c. 241, \u00a7 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The Act, as well as the two bills which were sent to conference on December 22, 1981, called for discontinuance of the College by January 24, 1982. Recognizing the time pressures for implementing the program formerly provided by the College, and aware that it would require additional faculty, the University, on December 24, 1981, invited the College\u2019s faculty to apply for positions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>On January 7, 1982, two days after the legislation was passed by both Houses, the Association demanded a resumption of negotiations. When that demand was declined, the Association filed charges with the Commission. On January 29, 1982, the Commission issued a complaint of prohibited practice alleging that the Regents had violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10(a)(5), by refusing to bargain with the Association and had violated \u00a7 10(a)(1) in offering employment to the employees individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The Commission\u2019s final decision upheld the charges. Ruling that the Regents were required to bargain with the Association, the Commission, citing \u00a7 1 of c. 150E, treated the Regents as the common employer of the faculties of both the College and the University. Relying on Federal cases in the private sector, see e.g., <em>Cooper Thermometer Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>376 F.2d 684, 688 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>Fraser &amp; Johnston Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>469 F.2d 1259, 1262-1263 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>National Car Rental Sys., Inc., </em>672 F.2d 1182, 1188 (3d Cir. 1982), the Commission viewed the discontinuance of the College as a move of one group of employees to another location of a single common employer. We think that analogy is not consonant with the express provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The first two sentences of \u00a7 14, see Appendix, refer to faculty of the College \u201cemployed at another public institution of higher education with the approval of the board of regents.\u201d The role of the Regents is clearly limited. The power to appoint is left to each institution of higher education, while the Regents are merely to approve such appointments.* **<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The vesting of approval but not appointment power in the Regents is consistent with a legislative sensitivity to the policy implications of imposing appointments on an institution of public higher education. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>As noted earlier, the first Senate bill, 1981 Senate Doc. No. 2398, showed an awareness of the problem and required that \u201cdue consideration ... be given to the integrity of academic and personnel policies ... at the employing institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The limitation of the Regents\u2019 authority is also consonant with a specific Regents\u2019 policy, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of according to each institution of public education independence as to faculty appointments. We have no reason to assume that the Legislature, to whom the Regents submitted reports, see G. L. c. 15A, \u00a7 <em>5(b), </em>intended to negate such an explicit policy. Indeed, the Regents (and the University) urge that the establishment of criteria for hiring and tenure of University faculty is at the core of educational policy in maintaining a system of \u201cpublic higher education of high quality.\u201d G. L. c. 15A, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1980, c. 329, \u00a7 112. For this reason, they urge, the number of College faculty to be hired by the University and the criteria for hiring are not mandatory subjects of bargaining. See, e.g., <em>Dennis-Yarmouth Regional Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Dennis Teachers Assn., </em>372 Mass. 116, 120 (1977); <em>School Comm. of West Bridgewater </em>v. <em>West Bridgewater Teachers\u2019 Assn., </em>372 Mass. 121, 122 (1977); <em>Berkshire Hills Regional Sch. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Berkshire Hills Educ. Assn., </em>375 Mass. 522, 526-527 (1978). In the view that we take of c. 808 we need not decide whether, in the absence of the Act, there would be a duty to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Also apparent in all the bills and in the Act is a legislative concern with the negotiated rights not only of the College faculty but also of the employees at the employing institutions. We note, in this connection, that the main contention of the Union (also joined in by the Regents and the University) is that the Commission\u2019s order impermissibly intrudes into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>collective bargaining relationship between the Union and the University. The Union claims, with some plausibility, that its agreement contains comprehensive detailed criteria for the hiring of faculty at the University and places primary responsibility in the University faculty for initiating and recommending names for appointment. The imposition of any additional criteria, it urges, would conflict with that agreement. Cf. <em>General Warehouse &amp; Helpers Local 767 </em>v. <em>Standard Brands, Inc., </em>579 F.2d 1282, 1293-1294 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. dismissed, 441 U.S. 957 (1979); <em>International Assn. of Machinists </em>v. <em>Howmet Corp., </em>466 F.2d 1249, 1254-1255 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Our reading of the statute does not require us to determine whether a duty to bargain about criteria would, of necessity, interfere with the Union\u2019s contract. Nevertheless, the serious possibility of conflict explicitly referred to in the legislation passed by the House (1981 House Doc. No. 7466), and the concern expressed in the Act, as well as in all the bills, for respecting the existing bargaining agreements at the institutions subsequently employing faculty members of the College, support our conclusion that c. 808 was intended as a legislative resolution of the rights of the College\u2019s faculty and a deliberate rejection of bargaining between the Association and the Regents.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Contrary to our reading, the Commission found the Act silent and concluded that it did not foreclose the Regents from bargaining with the Association over the number and criteria for selection of College faculty. Even were we to find the Act silent, as the Commission contends, the rejection by the Senate of the bargaining provisions of 1981 House Doc. No. 7466 and the ultimate passage of the conference committee bill which deleted those provisions provide a \u201ccogent basis for rejecting the view\u201d that the Legislature contemplated mandatory bargaining by the Regents and the Association. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>347 Mass. 1, 7 (1964). <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 575 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The decision of the Commission is reversed, and the complaint is to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF ST. 1981, C. 808</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201cSECTION 2. . . .
