The defendant claims that the trial judge\u2019s charge on assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon was so incorrect and misleading as to constitute reversible error. The defendant also claims that the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>exceeded the bounds of proper closing argument by appealing to the passions of the jury and referring to matters not in evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The defendant makes a broad and general claim that the trial judge gave incorrect jury instructions despite being made aware by defense counsel of the \u201ccorrect\u201d instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our analysis requires only that we examine the argument that the judge failed to instruct that a finding of \u201cdemonstrable physical injury\u201d is required for conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon based on wilful, wanton, and reckless conduct. We agree with the defendant that the instruction regarding injury was incorrect. For reasons that will appear, we reverse only two of the defendant\u2019s four convictions for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The relevant testimony may be summarized. About 11:40 a.m., on March 28, 1983, while driving a police cruiser on White Street in Springfield, Officers Brown and Minor saw a man and a woman \u201cstruggling\u201d beside a parked green Oldsmobile automobile. As the cruiser approached, the man (later identified as the defendant) threw the woman to the ground, \u201cjumped into the Oldsmobile and sped out of the parking lot going northbound on White Street.\u201d The officers, with overhead lights and siren on, pursued the defendant, who, weaving back and forth across the \u201csolid double lines,\u201d was \u201cpassing vehicles in front of him.\u201d The defendant, at times traveling between seventy to eighty miles per hour through a \u201cthickly settled area\u201d which contained a school zone in which the speed limit was posted at thirty miles per hour, did not slow down until he reached the intersection of Allen Street. The defendant also ran a red light. As the defendant\u2019s vehicle attempted to negotiate a left turn onto Allen Street it suddenly lurched to the right, colliding with a stationary unmarked police car occupied by Officers Pidgeon and Palmer. After the defendant hit the police car, he drove \u201cvery slowly\u201d along a chain link fence on the sidewalk of Allen Street. At this point, Officer Brown brought his cruiser parallel to the defendant\u2019s car. The defendant then \u201clooked over at [Officers Brown and Minor] and gunned the car, and came off the sidewalk into [their] cruiser.\u201d As the defendant pulled out into the street, his car scraped a lightpost and hit the cruiser again. The officers then pursued the defendant until his car struck a cement abutment and stalled. The officers removed the defendant, a small child and a nine-month old baby from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Massachusetts recognizes two theories of assault and battery, one of which requires \u201cthe intentional and unjustified use of force upon the person of another, however slight\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 [1931]), while the other requires a wilful, wanton, and reckless act which results in personal injury to another <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 274-276 [1983]). \u201cInjury\u201d as defined in <em>Welch </em>means more than \u201cunconsented touching, however slight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. What is required is \u201cactual physical injury\u201d or \u201cdemonstrable physical injury.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>It is against this background that the pertinent instruction must be examined. That instruction provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">\u201cTo prove a battery the Commonwealth must establish an unjustifiable and intentional use of force upon the person of another, however slight [,] or wanton or reckless, an act causing injury to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Though not as clear as it might have been, the judge\u2019s instruction can be interpreted as correctly stating both of the recognized theories of battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">On the evidence presented to the jury the convictions of the defendant for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon Officers Pidgeon and Palmer could only have been based on the \u201creckless conduct\u201d theory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is so because the evidence tends to establish that the defendant was traveling very fast on a wet road, and that while he was attempting to negotiate a left turn at the Allen Street intersection, which requires an automobile to bear to the right before making a left turn, he hit the parked automobile occupied by Officers Pidgeon and Palmer. We do not think that permissible inferences from this evidence were sufficient \u201cto bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity\u201d to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionally hit the automobile occupied by Pidgeon and Palmer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 168 (1980). On the other hand, the jury certainly could have found the defendant\u2019s conduct to have been reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Under the reckless conduct theory, however, the Commonwealth must show that the officers suffered \u201cdemonstrable physical injury\u201d in accordance with the holding of <em>Welch. </em>The question is whether using the term \u201cinjury\u201d as opposed to \u201cdemonstrable physical injury\u201d would make a difference to jurors in a case such as this. The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><em>Manning, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 430 (1978), provides some guidance. In that case an instruction that \u201cit was not necessary for [the jury] to find that the knife came into contact with the victim\u201d was held to be erroneous. In this case, Officer Palmer testified on direct examination that as a result of the collision he was shaken but not injured, and that Officer Pidgeon (who did not testify at the trial) told him that his wrist was sore and that Pidgeon held his wrist for a \u201cfew minutes\u201d before getting out of the automobile. It thus would appear that if the jury had been given a proper instruction on this point, they could have reached a different conclusion with respect to one of the officers, if not both.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the convictions for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon Officers Palmer and Pidgeon must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The other assignment of error relating to the judge\u2019s instruction focuses on the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">\u201cAn automobile in which a person is riding, as a matter of law, may be construed to be an extension of the person. In an unprivileged and intentional application of physical force, that automobile may be considered and may be construed as an assault and battery upon the person within. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">This instruction relates to the charges of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon Officers Brown and Minor, who were involved in the actual pursuit of the defendant. On those charges the Commonwealth proceeded on the theory of an intentional act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without the \u201cextension\u201d instruction, the Commonwealth could not have prevailed because the element of \u201cforce upon the person of another, however slight\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, 277 </em>Mass. 199, 203 [1931]), could not have been satisfied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim of error here is that the \u201cextension\u201d theory is not supported by case law and that \u201c[a] correct instruction would, at least, have included the requirement that a \u2018battery\u2019 of the car must result in a battery of the occupants of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 364 (1983), wherein the Supreme Judicial Court stated that it \u201c. . . need not. . . consider whether a criminal act against property may be the basis for a manslaughter conviction,\u201d the defendant asserts that the reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>50 N.Y.Sup.Ct. 356 (1888), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 430 (1978), controls the instant circumstances. From those two cases the defendant concludes that for a \u201cbattery\u201d of a car to offend against G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, there must be a battery (i.e., a resultant \u201cforce\u201d) upon its occupants. Upon analysis we do not so read those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In <em>Manning, </em>the defendant appealed from a conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon on the ground that the jury instructions were erroneous. The facts upon which the conviction was based were, in part, that the defendant \u201ctightened his arm around [the victim\u2019s] neck and touched [a] knife to her throat.\u201d 6 Mass. App. Ct. at 431. The court noted that, although there was testimony that the knife touched the victim, this testimony was weakened on cross-examination so that the jury could have disbelieved it. Consequently, an instruction that \u201cit was not necessary for them to find that the knife came into contact with the victim\u201d was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 436. In reversing the conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the court suggested that, at best, the defendant could have been convicted of a simple assault and battery which resulted when he touched the victim. This was so because the unprivileged touching that lies at the heart of the offense of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon must be <em>manifested through the weapon. </em>In contrast, there can be no question in this case that the touching, if any, was manifested through the dangerous weapon, that is, the defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>In <em>Moore, </em>the victim was driving a horse-drawn sleigh. The defendant intercepted the sleigh, grabbed the reins, and, over the driver\u2019s protests, caused it to be turned around and headed in the opposite direction. It is this series of events to which the court was referring when it stated that \u201c[t]he horses and sleigh were the instruments with which [the defendant] directed and augmented his personal and physical force against and upon the body of [the victim].\u201d 50 N.Y.Sup.Ct. at 358. If there was a battery on the occupant of the sleigh, it follows that there must have been a battery on the occupants of the automobile hit by the defendant in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Aside from the <em>Moore </em>case, this theory has support in two treatises. In both, the writers note that the \u201ctouching\u201d element of a battery does not require the actual touching of the victim. See LaFave &amp; Scott, Jr., Criminal Law \u00a7 81, at 604 (1972); Perkins, Criminal Law c. 2, \u00a7 2, at 108-109 (2d ed. 1969). Neither writer, however, cites much authority for that proposition. Indeed, aside from <em>\u2018\u2018\u2018'The Queen </em>v. <em>Day, </em>1 Cox C.C. 207 (1845),\u201d which is cited by Perkins, <em>Moore </em>is the only case cited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In view of the foregoing, we adopt the reasoning of <em>Moore, </em>and hold that the trial judge\u2019s instructions regarding \u201cextension\u201d were not erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon on Officers Brown and Minor based on the \u201cintentional\u201d act theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>As no independent argument has been made regarding the conviction of driving to endanger (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>we merely note that the conviction was not flawed. Accordingly, the judgments in Nos. JR-83-261A, JR-83-261C, and JR-83261D are affirmed. The judgments in Nos. JR-83-261B and JR-83-261E are reversed and the verdicts set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\"> With regard to that claim of error, although this court has indicated its strong distaste for improper argument by either the prosecution or the defense, and, when appropriate, has reversed convictions on that basis, we take this occasion to note that appellate counsel in general have tended to include improper argument as an almost obligatory ground of appeal. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, ante </em>556, 560-561 (1984). This case is an example. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were fair inferences from the evidence, as well as permissible in order to correct a blatantly erroneous impression created by defense counsel\u2019s argument. Although the prosecutor\u2019s comments here did not stray over proper bounds, for <em>all </em>counsel we express our concern once more: \u201cMembers of the bar, however, would be most ill-advised to consider that each departure from the norm which is not so grievous as to precipitate a reversal of a conviction sets a new and less elevated standard for lawyers\u2019 behavior.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>372 Mass. 185, 197-198 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 317 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1022, 1025 (1984) (Brown, J. concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> As separate claims, or as part of the general claim that the instructions were incorrect, the defendant asserts that the judge (1) inadequately defined the meaning of the offense and gave no attention to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 276 (1983), although that case had been explained in detail to the judge; (2) failed to instruct that a finding of negligence would result in verdicts of not guilty of wanton and reckless assault and battery; (3) failed to instruct that a finding of \u201cdemonstrable physical injury\u201d is required for conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon based on wilful, wanton, and reckless conduct; and (4) included an instruction that \u201can automobile in which a person is riding, as a matter of law, may be construed to be an extension of the person.\u201d The second above mentioned aspect, however, was not preserved for appeal, and the defendant does not argue the applicability of the \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-9\"> Even though the defendant did not move for required findings of not guilty, our analysis must proceed in this manner because, as will be seen, the instructions were deficient and we have no way of knowing on what theory of the evidence the jury based their verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\"> The judge, of course, was not required to charge in the exact words requested, or give an incorrect instruction. He merely \u201chas the duty to state the applicable law to the jury clearly and correctly.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcione, </em>364 Mass. 611, 618 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\"> The defendant does not argue otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b824-10\"> The Commonwealth could not have prevailed under the reckless conduct theory because neither Officer Brown nor Minor suffered an injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> The court in <em>Moore </em>stated that a person sustains \u201cbodily harm, in a legal sense, when another touches his person against his will with physical force intentionally hostile and aggressive, or <em>projects such force against his per</em>son\u201d (emphasis supplied). 50 N.Y.Sup.Ct. at 358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\"> <em>Moore </em>appears to be the leading case on indirect assault and battery. Accordingly, it has been cited with approval in various jurisdictions. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>3 Cal.2d 279 (1935); <em>People </em>v. <em>Britton, </em>6 Cal.2d 1 (1936); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dauzat, </em>392 So.2d 393 (La. 1980); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State, 52 </em>Md. App. 500 (1982). None of these cases, however, involves circumstances similar to those in <em>Moore </em>or in this case. In passing, it should be noted that, although the majority in <em>Bianco </em>declined to entertain the issue, the dissent not only entertained it, but expressed an opinion adverse to the defendant, citing <em>Moore </em>with approval. 388 Mass. at 373 (Liacos, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
