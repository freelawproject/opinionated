Lovell, Inc. (Lovell), appeals from judgments of the Superior Court enjoining Lovell from (a) garaging or maintaining eighteen-wheel vehicles or allowing such vehicles on its property and (b) using a garage for the storage of commercial vehicles and equipment. The appeals have been consolidated. The questions argued are whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction over the cases, and if so, whether it decided them correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">We state the facts pertaining to the jurisdictional issues. Lovell is in the business of installing and maintaining septic tanks and cesspools with its base of operations at 789 Mayflower Street in Duxbury. The property is located in a residential zone. Lovell conducted its business pursuant to a variance granted by the board of appeals of Duxbury (board) in 1965 which permitted it (1) to conduct, in \u201ca residential district,\u201d a \u201ccesspool business, both as to the maintenance of the same and the construction of new cesspools,\u201d and (2) to construct \u201ca garage to store [its] equipment under cover.\u201d In 1975, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>town adopted a new zoning by-law. By reason of art. 106 of the by-law, Lovell\u2019s operations became a nonconforming use. The plaintiffs live on Mayflower Street in the immediate vicinity of Lovell\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In early 1981, Lovell inquired of the board whether a special permit would be necessary under the by-law for the construction of a second garage on its Mayflower Street property. On May 15, 1981, the board issued a memorandum to the building inspector stating that a special permit was unnecessary. On June 22,1981, the plaintiffs, and other neighborhood residents, wrote to the building inspector complaining about the parking of large flatbed trucks and \u201cother long trailer trucks\u201d on Lovell\u2019s property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The building inspector did not reply to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On July 10, 1981, the building inspector issued a building permit granting Lovell permission to construct a fifty by fifty-five foot second building for the \u201cstorage of vehicles.\u201d The building inspector\u2019s decision to grant the permit was not appealed to the board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>On October 19,1981, after engaging a lawyer, the plaintiffs, in two letters, requested that the building inspector (1) issue a \u201cstop order\u201d prohibiting Lovell from operating and maintaining eighteen-wheel gravel trucks and flatbed trailers, and (2) issue a \u201cstop order\u201d on the building permit granted Lovell on July 10, 1981.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The building inspector did not respond to the letters within fourteen days. He did, however, reply in a letter dated November 18, 1981, in which he declined both requests for enforcement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>On November 19, 1981, the plaintiffs appealed from the building inspector\u2019s decision to the board. On January 14, 1982, the board held a hearing on the appeal and also heard Lovell\u2019s argument that the board lacked jurisdiction. On February 1, 1982, the board filed a written decision with the town clerk in which it stated that it had \u201cno jurisdiction to hear the issue of the building permit as the appeal appears to be untimely.\u201d While the board\u2019s decision is a bit unclear, it also appears that the board believed that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal pertaining to Lovell\u2019s use of eighteen-wheel vehicles. Nevertheless, the board agreed to decide the merits \u201cin order that the [t]own, the parties and the public may have the benefit of our opinion.\u201d The board upheld both decisions of the building inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">On February 17, 1982, the plaintiffs filed two complaints in the Superior Court alleging that they were aggrieved by the board\u2019s decision. The complaints sought (a) to enjoin Lovell from maintaining and using eighteen-wheel vehicles on its property and from using the second garage built pursuant to the permit in violation of the by-law; (b) orders directing the building inspector to compel removal of the garage and prohibiting Lovell\u2019s use of eighteen-wheel vehicles; and (c) a further order confining Lovell\u2019s operations to the level of nonconforming use permitted by the 1965 variance. Lovell filed motions to dismiss both actions on the ground that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction. A judge of the Superior Court denied Lovell\u2019s motions and considered the cases on their merits. He concluded that the board had erred and entered the judgments described earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">1. Resolution of the jurisdictional questions requires examination of the pertinent provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, and 15 of G. L. c. 40A.* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The building inspector in Duxbury is the officer charged with enforcement of the Duxbury zoning by-law. Section 7 of G. L. c. 40A provides that the building inspector \u201cshall notify, in writing, the party requesting . . . enforcement [of the zoning by-law] of any action or refusal to act, and the reasons therefor, within fourteen days of receipt of [a] request\u201d for enforcement. Under \u00a7 8 of G. L. c. 40A, a person aggrieved \u201cby reason of his inability to obtain . . . enforcement action\u201d has a right of appeal to the permit granting authority, here the board. Under \u00a7 15 of c. 40A, any such appeal must be taken \u201cwithin thirty days from the date of the order or decision which is being appealed.\u201d The language of the proviso in the second paragraph of \u00a7 7, however, establishes a six-year limitations period for actions seeking to remedy zoning violations arising out of alleged unlawful activities conducted pursuant to an \u201coriginal building permit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Lovell urges a strict construction of these statutes. As to the dispute over the eighteen-wheel vehicles, Lovell argues that the building inspector\u2019s failure to respond by July 6, 1981, the fourteenth day following the plaintiffs\u2019 June 22 letter, consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tuted a constructive denial of its request for enforcement and that the thirty-day appeal period specified in \u00a7 15 commenced running on that date and expired on August 5, 1981. As to the dispute over the building permit, Lovell measures the thirty-day appeal period from the date of the permit\u2019s issuance (July 10, 1981) making (according to its argument) an appeal from the permit\u2019s grant untimely if brought later than August 10, 1981. In Lovell\u2019s view, the requests for enforcement initiated by the letters of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on October 19, 1981 (followed by the building inspector\u2019s negative reply to those requests on November 18, 1981, and the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the board on November 19, 1981), were untimely in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The plaintiffs, on the other hand, look to the building inspector\u2019s written denial, on November 18, 1981, of both their requests for enforcement as the date which started the running of the thirty-day clock under \u00a7 15. In the plaintiffs\u2019 view, appeals filed with the board on November 19, 1981, and with the Superior Court on February 17, 1982 (the latter within twenty days of the filing of the board\u2019s decision with the town clerk, on February 1, 1982, see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17), were timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We think that the written decision required of a building inspector by \u00a7 7 should be deemed the operative event for purposes of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights of appeal. Section 7 is unambiguous in requiring a response \u201cin writing\u201d with \u201cthe reasons therefor\u201d when a building inspector \u201cdeclines to act\u201d on a request for enforcement. See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dalton, ante </em>191, 194-195 (1984) (where language of a statute is unambiguous, a court will construe it in accordance with its plain language). We also think that the language of \u00a7 8, which confers the right to appeal upon a \u201cperson aggrieved by reason of his inability to obtain . . . enforcement\u201d contemplates, as a precondition to the right of appeal, the written response declining enforcement described in \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In support of this interpretation, we consider significant the lack of any indication in either \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 that a building inspector\u2019s failure to respond within fourteen days to an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>forcement request is to be deemed a constructive denial of the request for purposes of setting in motion the thirty-day appeal period provided by \u00a7 15. The fact that the Legislature, in other provisions of the present Zoning Act, has made express provision for the effect of failures to act by local zoning authorities strongly suggests that the absence of any like provision in \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 is purposeful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Not only is an interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 15 which links the time for an appeal by an aggrieved party to the permit granting authority to the date of the building inspector\u2019s written decision under \u00a7 7 faithful to the reasonably plain wording of the statutes, but it also provides a means for the fair and practical administration of the provisions of c. 40A governing enforcement of a zoning by-law at the local stage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>We are not persuaded that a more restrictive construction is required by the designation in \u00a7 7 of a fourteen-day period for a response by the building inspector. This period is obviously designed to encourage promptness. In some cases, however, a building inspector may not be able to act on a request within fourteen days for legitimate reasons, such as (for example) the inspector\u2019s need to obtain further information from the complaining parties to clarify the nature of the complaint or his need to consult with other municipal boards or officers having an interest in the matter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In our view, the fourteen day requirement in \u00a7 7 \u201crelates only to the time of performance of a duty by a public officer and does not go to the essence of the thing to be done,\u201d <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>201 Mass. 204, 211 (1909); therefore it is directory and not mandatory. See <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of North Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 679-680 (1968), and cases cited. We conclude that the date on which a zoning enforcement officer responds in writing to a \u00a7 7 request for enforcement creates the appealable decision contemplated by \u00a7 8 and becomes the date for measuring the thirty-day appeal period set forth in \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is nothing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the contrary in either <em>Neuhaus </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 230 (1981), in the cases following that decision,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or in the Duxbury zoning by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Applying this reasoning, we conclude that jurisdictional requirements pertinent to the complaint concerning the eighteen-wheel vehicles were met. The failure of the building inspector to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 June 22, 1981, request was of no legal consequence. The plaintiffs\u2019 right of appeal to the board thus arose on November 18, 1981, when the inspector first complied with \u00a7 7 by his written response denying enforcement. Appeal to the board from the inspector\u2019s refusal of enforcement seasonably followed within thirty days of the inspector\u2019s denial (as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15), and the appeal to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision was within the twenty days required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The dispute concerning the building permit involves different considerations. Under \u00a7 13 of the prior c. 40A, a person aggrieved by a decision to issue a building permit could seek direct review of the decision. Until 1963,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> there was no statutory time limit for pursuing that right of review and the setting of a \u201creasonable time\u201d limit was left to local zoning by-laws. Failure to appeal within any time period set by the by-law foreclosed the right of direct review. See <em>Kolodny </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>346 Mass. 285 (1963).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>It was recognized, however, in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westport, </em>348 Mass. 515 (1965), that the right of direct review was not the exclusive remedy. The passage from <em>Brady </em>(at 519-520) set forth in the margin describes the shortcomings of the prior c. 40A in this area and the reasons necessitating an alternative remedy to correct violations of the zoning by-law made under color of a building permit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In essence, <em>Brady </em>con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>firmed the existence of the right well-established in Massachusetts jurisprudence, of aggrieved citizens, to obtain, by means of mandamus, strict enforcement of the zoning by-law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Sunderland </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of North Andover, </em>328 Mass. 638, 640 (1952), and cases cited; <em>Hallenborg </em>v. <em>Bil-lerica, </em>360 Mass. 513, 519-520 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The <em>Brady </em>right appears implicit in the addition to \u00a7 22 of the prior c. 40A (by means of St. 1970, c. 678, \u00a7 1) of a proviso establishing a six-year limitations period for actions seeking to remedy zoning violations occurring under an \u201coriginal building permit.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The six-year limitation period was inserted in the second paragraph of \u00a7 7 of G. L. c. 40A, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>to be read and applied in conjunction with the written response requirement of the first paragraph of \u00a7 7 and the rights conferred by \u00a7\u00a7 8, 15 and 17. Thus, with the enactment of the new Zoning Act, the <em>Brady </em>right to mandamus as a remedy for zoning violations committed under color of a building permit became a right to request the officer charged with enforcing local zoning to enforce the by-law under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7, and, if the requesting party is aggrieved by the inspector\u2019s decision, a right to seek administrative relief from the board under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 15, and, after exhausting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>administrative remedies, a right to obtain judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. <em>See Neuhaus v. Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 232-235.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Here the \u201coriginal building permit,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 7, was the permit authorizing Lovell to construct the second garage. See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. 205, 217-218 (1982). We view the plaintiffs\u2019 written request on October 19, 1981, for enforcement, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>as an effort to stop allegedly unlawful construction from going forward under color of that permit. The building inspector\u2019s written denial of their request made the plaintiffs, under \u00a7 8, \u201cperson[s] aggrieved by reason of [their] inability to obtain . . . enforcement action,\u201d and they thereafter complied, in a timely manner, with the jurisdictional steps required by c. 40A and the <em>Neuhaus </em>decision. We conclude that the Superior Court had jurisdiction of the appeal from the board\u2019s decision affirming the issuance of the building permit.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>Carstensen </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Cambridge, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 351-352 (1981) (applying this rule without discussing the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">2. We turn to a consideration of the merits. In addition to the facts previously recited in this opinion, the judge\u2019s memorandum contained the additional findings of fact set forth in the appendix to this opinion. Based on all the facts found, the judge ruled that the construction of the second garage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>beyond the scope of the 1965 variance and constituted an unlawful expansion of a nonconforming use in violation of the Duxbury zoning by-law. The judge further ruled that Lovell\u2019s use of eighteen-wheel vehicles violated each of the three considerations set forth in <em>Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Chuckran, </em>351 Mass. 20, 23 (1966), for determining the lawfulness of an expansion of a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s rulings on the matter of the second garage. The 1965 variance confined Lovell to using the property for its \u201ccesspool business, both as to the maintenance of the same and the construction of new cesspools,\u201d and allowed Lovell to \u201cconstruct and maintain a [single] six-stall garage on [the] land ... for the storage and maintenance of commercial vehicles and equipment.\u201d The variance sanctioned the first garage solely for the purpose of the storage and maintenance of vehicles used by Lovell in connection with the use permitted by the variance \u2014 the conduct of a cesspool business. The construction of the second garage violated the limits of the variance (and, as a result, in 1975, violated the permissible scope of the nonconforming use) that permitted construction of only one garage.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Compare <em>Selectmen of Stockbridge </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Monument Inn, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 957, 959 (1982) (enlargement of facilities in violation of special permit is an impermissible use of property).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">As to the eighteen-wheel vehicles, the judge\u2019s findings of fact (which are supported both by the testimony he found credible and the documentary and demonstrative evidence) make clear that by associating in 1979 with Francesco Excavation Corp., Lovell had established and conducted, side by side on the premises with its cesspool business, a trucking business in connection with work as a general contractor and excavator. These latter enterprises were not permitted by the 1965 variance<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (and thus were beyond the scope of the 1975 by-law protecting nonconforming uses) and constituted new, substantively different, uses from the authorized business. <em>See Building Inspector of Malden </em>v. <em>Werlin Realty Inc., </em>349 Mass. 623, 624-625 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Lovell argues that the eighteen-wheel vehicles are being used in connection with the lawful expansion of its cesspool business. On the facts found, the judge correctly concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>(in light of the rule that the party maintaining a nonconforming use has the burden of proving any expansion lawful, see <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. at 212) that Lovell had failed to demonstrate that the enlarged use satisfied the three considerations set forth in <em>Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Chuckran, </em>351 Mass. at 23.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> None of the other arguments made by Lovell persuades us that any different conclusion is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">3. The remaining questions concern the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">(a) The judge concluded that he could not ascertain, from the record, whether the second garage could be put to any lawful use or otherwise made to conform to the by-law. He, therefore, declined to order the garage removed pending an inquiry to determine whether relief could be obtained under the provisions of the by-law. Accordingly, part 1 of the judgments ordered only that Lovell be enjoined from using the second garage in connection with the use and maintenance of commercial vehicles and equipment. The decision to withhold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>an order for the removal of the second garage pending the possibility of further zoning proceedings was within the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of North Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 678-679 (1968); <em>Selectmen of Blackstone v. Tellestone, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 316 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">(b) Paragraph 2 of the judgment enjoined Lovell from \u201cgaraging or maintaining eighteen-wheel vehicles <em>or allowing the same on his property </em>[at] 789 Mayflower Street, Duxbury\u201d (emphasis supplied). The non-italicized language fashioned relief which was reasonably related to the grievance to be remedied. See <em>Billerica </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>320 Mass. 687, 690 (1947); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy., </em>379 Mass. 703, 730 (1980). The italicized language, however, is overbroad, since the facts found by the judge indicate that suppliers of Lovell\u2019s cesspool business had, from the inception of the business at the Mayflower Street site, made deliveries of materials, as necessary, to Lovell by means of eighteen-wheel vehicles. This aspect of the cases must be remanded for reconsideration of the scope of relief granted in light of the scope of the protected prior nonconforming use. The judge, if he deems it necessary or desirable, may hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The italicized language in paragraph 2 of the judgments (\u201cor allowing the same on his property\u201d) is vacated and that issue is remanded for the devising of new relief in accordance with this opinion. The balance of the judgments is affirmed. The plaintiffs are to have costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\u201cThe plaintiffs live in the immediate vicinity of the Lovell operation. Plaintiff Vokes resides at 761 Mayflower Street and plaintiff Boucher, at 748 Mayflower Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">\u201cBetween 1975 and 1979, the Lovell operation used and garaged commercial vehicles customarily used in a cesspool and septic tank maintenance and installation service on the Mayflower Street property. These included bulldozers, standard size pump trucks (i.e. not eighteen-wheelers), standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>size dump trucks, a \u2018loader, \u2019 and other vehicles of similar size and function. Vehicles were garaged in the six-stall garage which Lovell had built in accordance with the terms of the 1965 variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u201cDuring these years, supplier made infrequent but regular deliveries of materials used in Lovell\u2019s business (e.g., gravel) in eighteen-wheelers. Eighteen-wheel vehicles were never regularly garaged or maintained on the Mayflower Street property during these years.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cIn the latter portion of 1979, Lovell entered into a general partnership with Francesco Excavation Corp. (Francesco). Francesco is in the business of excavating and transporting excavated materials and other bulk materials. Francesco owns and maintains several eighteen-wheelers in connection with its business. The terms of the partnership are basically that Francesco may have full use of Lovell\u2019s Mayflower Street facilities for storage and maintenance of its vehicles and that Lovell may have use of Francesco\u2019s vehicles as Lovell may need them for deliveries and so forth in connection with its business. Francesco has listed 789 Mayflower Street, Duxbury, as its main address since the latter portion of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u201cDuring the early portion of 1981, Lovell, through Mr. A very Lovell, inquired of the [b]oard whether a special permit would be necessary for the construction of an additional garage on the Mayflower Street property. The [b]oard informed Mr. Lovell that a special permit would not be necessary and issued a memorandum to the building inspector to that effect. ... A building permit was issued to Lovell in July of 1981. Lovell constructed a second garage, comparable in size to the first garage, shortly thereafter. The second garage is used for maintenance work on Francesco\u2019s trucks and storage of trucks and equipment. Lovell did not have need for additional storage space for its own vehicles and equipment at the time the second garage was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\u201cIn the years following 1970, a number of residences were built in the immediate vicinity of the Lovell operation. Persons living in these residences registered no complaints regarding the Lovell operation with Lovell or town officials prior to the latter portion of 1979. Since that time, residents have been complaining. The residents report an increase in the level of noise emanating from the Lovell operation during the latter portion of 1979 described by one resident as \u2018phenomenal.\u2019 Noises heard are described as \u2018blasting\u2019 sounds, \u2018chains clanking,\u2019 horns blowing, and truck engines starting. Noise is heard at night, at 3 or 4 a.m., and on Sundays as well as during regular business hours.

[Here a footnote observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u2018On Mayflower Street, two cars are able to pass easily in the summer months but only with difficulty during the winter months when there is snow.\u2019] On one area road with a fairly sharp curve, residents have been run off the road by eighteen-wheelers travelling toward them.

These trucks have been parking for over a year, at Lovell\u2019s. Several of us have complained to [a local official] who said he talked to Mr. Lovell, and that Mr. Lovell denied that they were there. We have pictures to support our claim. These large trucks are a hazard to this residential area. They are much too long to negotiate the turn onto Lincoln St., and we have all seen several near accidents, because cars coming up Lincoln St., toward Mayflower, come around a curve and cannot see the trucks until they are halfway out-blocking the whole street. There have also been many close calls with children on bicycles, for the same reason. In addition, these trucks disturb the peace, by often leaving Lovell\u2019s as early as 4:30 A.M., and as late as 10:30 p.m. We request that this practice of parking these trucks, or any other large, noisy trucks, such as these, be discontinued immediately! This is a residential neighborhood, and they constitute a danger. We would like action on this matter before the trucks are responsible for some terrible accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\"> The record does not clearly indicate the dates when persons who might have been aggrieved by the building permit learned of its issuance.

The March 27 date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>which the permits issued was considered the crucial date for purposes of triggering the ten-day right of appeal specified by the Brookline zoning by-law as a \u201creasonable time\u201d for an appeal. Hence, the commissioner\u2019s decision not to revoke the permits made after the expiration of the ten-day period was not an appealable decision, that decision being viewed as \u201cno more than a reaffirmation of the [commissioner\u2019s] decision of March 27, 1962, to issue the permits\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288.

Decisions granting a permit may not, within the appeal period, come to the attention of persons who will be aggrieved by \u00e1 violation of the zoning law. . . . Construction under a permit may not be begun within the appeal period. The permit, or even construction under it, may not disclose the violation. . . . There is no requirement in the statute for notice to all persons possibly affected by an application for a permit. Aggrieved persons as to whom applicable provisions in respect of time of appeal are unreasonable may proceed by mandamus for enforcement of the law. . . . There is no provision in the statute requiring a written decision on requests for enforcement. If the decision not to comply with such a request is oral, no appeal lies. There is in such a case nothing except inaction to show what the decision is, and of course no date of decision from which to compute the time for an appeal. ... If, as here, the response is in writing, there is nevertheless no notice to other persons aggrieved and no basis for barring them from mandamus. There would be no occasion for notice to anyone else if the person requesting action did not appeal from the enforcing officer\u2019s not to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u201cFailure to take an appeal within the prescribed period from the granting or denial of a permit is a bar to a direct review of the action in respect of the permit [citing, among other cases, the two <em>Kolodny </em>decisions, see note 15 supra]. In a proceeding for enforcement of the zoning law, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>existence of a permit is inconsequential. . . . Hence, as this second of the <em>Kolodny </em>cases [346 Mass. 289] has established, the loss by an aggrieved citizen of the right of direct attack on a permit does not entail loss of the right of the same citizen to bring a mandamus petition for enforcement of the law and to stop violations in the construction going forward under the permit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> The problems arising out of an aggrieved party\u2019s being unaware of the issuance of a building permit still exist. The holder of a building permit has up to six months from the date of its issuance to commence work under the permit. See 780 Code of Mass. Regs. \u00a7 114.3 (1980). There is no public notice of the issuance of a building permit. A permit holder could keep the fact of the permit\u2019s issuance secret, refrain from beginning construction under the permit for the thirty-day period established by \u00a7 15, and thereby foreclose any further direct review of the legality of the permit\u2019s issuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. at 216-218.

The notice requirement appears to be in the nature of a lis pendens designed to give constructive notice to prospective purchasers and other interested parties that a question as to zoning exists with regard to the property. The failure to record notice would ordinarily require dismissal of the action subject to its being timely recommenced (if it can be), after the condition is satisfied, within the six-year limitations period. It appears here, however, that there are no other parties, beyond the parties to this action, whose rights are, or could be, adversely affected by the lack of notice. We conclude, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>without formulating a general, rule on the issue, that these appeals should be decided without regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to record the notice.

There is no mention in the variance of a general contracting business or of equipment used in general contracting work to be stored at the Mayflower Street premises. If Lovell found the variance to be ambiguous or incomplete, it had the right to seek clarification or to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">In 1975, only Lovell\u2019s cesspool operation became a legal nonconforming use under the Duxbury by-law. There is nothing to indicate that Lovell ever received permission (in the form of either a variance or special permit) to conduct a general contracting business (under the present Duxbury by-law a nonconforming use cannot be changed except to a conforming use or except to another nonconforming use if a special permit is granted). Thus, the fact that eighteen-wheel trucks may have been used in connection with an illegal general contracting business is not pertinent to an inquiry regarding whether the requisite similarity has been shown between the current use of those trucks and the lawful cesspool business. See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. at 214 (the increased use must be attributable to growth of the original nonconforming use in order to fall within the rule that an increase in volume of business does not constitute a change in use). See aslo <em>Kreger </em>v. <em>Public Bldgs.
