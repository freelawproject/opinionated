L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 65). We affirm the judgment because the board, on the evidence presented, was warranted in finding that the employee\u2019s obesity was not \u201ca known physical impairment which is due to any . . . disease or any congenital condition.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 855, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">We summarize the evidence before the board. At the time the employee was hired, he was \u201ca markedly obese individual weighing between 270 and 320 pounds.\u201d Although the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>had reservations whether the employee could move quickly enough to perform his duties, the employer was not concerned about the employee\u2019s hurting himself and viewed him as healthy. The employee did not list any medical condition on his application for employment. Four days after being hired, the employee was hit by a car and received worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The insurer sought reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund because medical reports indicated that the employee\u2019s disability was, in large part, caused by his obesity.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The purpose of the Second Injury Fund is \u2018\u201cto encourage the employment of persons [with known physical impairments \u201cdue to any previous accident, disease or any congenital condition\u201d] by relieving the employer or the insurer from the burden of paying the entire compensation for further disability of the employee due to the combined effect of his previous injury and one later received in the course of his employment. \u2019 \u201d <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 398, 402 (1979), quoting from <em>McLean\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 72, 74 (1950) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The insurer, in contending that the employee\u2019s extreme obesity is a congenital condition or a disease within the scope of \u00a7 37, relies on the testimony of an orthopedic surgeon who testified that the employee\u2019s obesity was a \u201cfamilial trait\u201d and a \u201cmetabolic condition.\u201d The Commonwealth, on the other hand, urges that the employee\u2019s varying weight* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indicates that the condition was not permanent, was a matter within the employee\u2019s control, and, for these reasons, was not the kind of disease or condition contemplated by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, See <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Triangle Maintenance Corp., </em>41 A.D.2d 800, 801 (N.Y. 1973) (evidence indicated claimant could lose weight).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Applying the appropriate standard of review, see <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 124, 125 (1968), we think the board was warranted in concluding that the insurer failed to show that the employee\u2019s condition was a \u201ccongenital condition\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or a disease. Compare <em>Durdaller </em>v. <em>Liberty Prods. Corp., </em>12 N.Y.2d 787, 788 (1962), where there was evidence that the \u2022employee\u2019s obesity was due to a permanent glandular condition. The same orthopedic surgeon whose testimony was relied upon by the insurer stated in one of his reports that it was his opinion that the problem was \u201centirely to do with diet.\u201d He testified that he had not conducted any medical tests to determine the cause of the employee\u2019s obesity, and in another of his reports noted that the employee had gained twenty pounds since the last examination \u201cso there can\u2019t be much of any effort given to reducing his weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As the insurer did not establish that the employee\u2019s obesity was \u201ca known physical impairment which is due to any previous accident, disease or any congenital condition,\u201d it was not entitled to reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> The bracketed material is from \u00a7 37, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 855, \u00a7 2.
