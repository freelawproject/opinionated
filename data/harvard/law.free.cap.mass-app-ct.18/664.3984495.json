Builders, Inc. (G.M.), against the town of Barnstable (town) seeking $75,000 in damages for the town\u2019s alleged failure to acquire a bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, as amended through St. 1978, c. 155, \u00a7 1, in connection with certain construction work at the Hyannis airport. G.M. claims that it was entitled to protection by such a bond. The action was heard by a Superior Court judge sitting without a jury. The judge entered a memorandum of decision which contained findings of fact and rulings of law. Pursuant to the memorandum, a final judgment entered in the town\u2019s favor. G.M. has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">The judge\u2019s findings of fact are fully supported by the evidence, see <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Mass. 671, 674 (1977), and may be summarized as follows. On October 17,1978, the town, through its airport commission, was informed that a corporation known as LaCipollina at the Airport, Inc. (LaCipollina), intended to assume management of the restaurant at the airport and that, in connection with the takeover, LaCipollina planned renovations of the restaurant premises and nearby areas. LaCipollina\u2019s architect prepared plans for the renovations, which were submitted for approval to the commission. In November, 1978, representatives of LaCipollina attended a meeting of the commission at which the plans and their cost were discussed. The commission approved the intended renovations as well as \u201cthe concept of [a] proposed lease\u201d between the town and LaCipollina. On November 27, 1978, the commission sent a \u201cletter of intent\u201d to LaCipollina which outlined the provisions of the proposed lease and included details for payment of the rent. The letter required that \u201c[e]vidence of bonding, disclaimers and hold harmless documents must be presented to the [c]ommission prior to the start of actual construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In meetings in December, 1978, and January, 1979, the commission again discussed the proposed lease with LaCipol-lina\u2019s representatives. These discussions included provisions for reimbursement of LaCipollina for the cost of its renovations. On February 8, 1979, the town through the commission, as lessor, and LaCipollina, as lessee, executed a lease for an initial term of ten years with an option to extend for an additional ten years. Among other provisions, the lease required LaCipollina to pay a fixed annual base rent to the town, together with a percentage of its gross receipts from the operation of the restaurant and cocktail lounge. Article Thirty of the lease recognized that LaCipollina contemplated making renovations to the building containing the demised premises, including additions which would expand the lobby and other nonrestaurant areas and improve the restaurant\u2019s premises and facilities. LaCipollina was given the right to recapture during the initial term of the lease, primarily by way of deductions from percentage rent, the entire cost of each such type of construction, according to specified detailed formulae. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>only reference to a bond appeared in Article Twenty-One of the lease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the lease were appended various papers collectively referred to as \u201ccontract documents\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">During the same period that LaCipollina was negotiating the terms of the lease with the commission, it was also negotiating with G.M. for the project\u2019s construction. On February 13, 1979, LaCipollina accepted a final proposal from G.M. setting atotal construction price of $265,000 forG.M.\u2019s work. G.M.\u2019s proposal stated that its \u201cfigure also includes a performance and payment bond as requested\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G.M. was aware of the provisions of the lease and also knew that there had been no public bidding for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">G.M. commenced its work under the contract with LaCipol-lina without determining that a bond had been provided for its protection. G.M. made no inquiry to ascertain whether LaCipollina had provided the bond specified in Article Twenty-One of the lease, see note 1, <em>supra. </em>G.M. also failed to consult an attorney to advise it concerning bonds or security. On March 1, 1979, it sent an invoice to LaCipollina \u201cfor work completed to date.\u201d Item no. 1 on that invoice requested payment of the premium fee for a bond procured by G.M. pursuant to its agreement with LaCipollina.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>LaCipollina encountered financial difficulties, eventually defaulted, and was adjudicated a bankrupt. Before that juncture, however, G.M. and LaCipollina, on May 22, 1979, entered into an additional agreement by which G.M. agreed to accept payment of the sums then owed it by LaCipollina over a three-year period, in equal monthly payments, on a direct reduction basis, and LaCipollina agreed to execute a promissory note therefor with interest. In this agreement, signed for G.M. by its president and treasurer, it was acknowledged that \u201cG.M. has acted as <em>general contractor </em>with respect to [the project] <em>on behalf of </em>[LaJCipollina\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The judge noted that G.M. sought recovery on a theory that the town had violated a duty, imposed on it by the lease and the contract documents, to obtain a bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, to pay G.M. for its work under the construction agreement. The judge viewed the case as requiring a \u201cclose analysis of the relationship of the various parties,\u201d concluding, on the facts found, that \u201cwhen it came to the work to be done on the [bjuilding, the [ojwner for purposes of the general contract was LaCipollina and not the [t]own,\u201d and that G.M. was LaCipollina\u2019s \u201cgeneral contractor.\u201d On the facts found, the judge ruled that the town had not made any contract which would oblige it to obtain a bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, and that G.M. had no rights under the bond which LaCipollina had agreed to furnish the town in accordance with Article Twenty-One of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The first paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[o]fficers or agents contracting in behalf of any . . . town ... for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition of public buildings . . . when the amount of the contract ... is more than two thousand dollars, shall obtain security by bond in an amount not less than one half of the total contract price, for payment by the contractor and subcontractor for labor performed or fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>nished and materials used.\u201d The statute \u201cafford[s] security to subcontractors and materialmen in public works because they do not have the benefit of a mechanic\u2019s or materialman\u2019s lien, as would be the case in private construction work.\u201d <em>Floors, Inc. </em>v. <em>B.G. Danis, Inc., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 356, 358 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 91 (1981). <em>See American Air Filter Co. </em>v. <em>Innamorati Bros., </em>358 Mass. 146, 150 (1970); <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>377 Mass. 863, 865, 866 (1979). As such, the statute does not afford protection to general contractors who deal directly with public officials. See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>204 Mass. 494 (1910); <em>Duteau </em>v. <em>Salvucci, </em>330 Mass. 531, 535 (1953). Nor, quite obviously, does the statute cover general contractors who deal with private entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">There is no dispute that the restaurant and adjacent areas at the airport are portions of public buildings owned by the town or that the project involved \u201creconstruction\u201d or \u201cremodeling\u201d of such buildings. G.M. has never questioned the validity of its agreement with LaCipollina and the latter\u2019s lease with the town, nor has G.M. contended that the over-all arrangement might violate the laws governing the public bidding of public works projects. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, as in effect prior to St. 1980, c. 579, \u00a7 55. The question before us is therefore a narrow one. We must decide whether (as G.M. contends) the lease between the town and LaCipollina obliged the town to obtain a bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29,forG.M.\u2019s benefit or whether (as the town contends) G.M. entered a contract solely with LaCipollina, a private corporation, making itself a general contractor which would not be protected by G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">We conclude that the latter was the case. The lease agreement between the town and LaCipollina was not a contract for construction or renovation of a public building within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. The lease between the town and LaCipollina acknowledged the latter\u2019s right to make certain renovations to premises within a public building but did not <em>require </em>that LaCipollina undertake or complete any renova<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The renovations remained, at all times, the sole responsibility of LaCipollina and not the responsibility of the town. LaCipollina thus became bound to the lease irrespective of its completion of the renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Nor did the town make any financial commitment to G.M. in any capacity. G.M. is not a party to the lease and is nowhere mentioned in its terms. The town\u2019s sole financial obligation inured to the benefit of LaCipollina and permitted LaCipollina to recapture the cost of any renovations completed by means of credits, taken over the base term of the lease, against the rent due the town. The requirement of a bond in Article Twenty-One of the lease was imposed on LaCipollina for the <em>town\u2019s </em>benefit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The town\u2019s general right, reserved in the lease, to approve plans and specifications would not create a duty to G.M. to see that a bond was obtained. This approval power simply gave the town, acting through its airport commission, the right to ensure that LaCipollina completed any renovations undertaken by it in a manner consistent with the public interest in the proper maintenance of the airport\u2019s facilities. Reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ment of the cost of renovations by way of rent deduction did, of course, give the town a financial interest in the project. This interest, however, is not sufficient in our view to alter the nature of the relationship between the parties or to make G.M. a subcontractor. We perceive no basis, in either the facts found by the judge or in the lease, to conclude that LaCipollina was the town\u2019s agent for any purpose which would impose on the town a duty to provide a bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, for G.M.\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We note further that G.M., at all material times, viewed itself as the general contractor for LaCipollina rather than for the town. G.M. agreed with LaCipollina to furnish all labor and materials necessary to complete the work and to procure a performance and payment bond, consistently billed LaCipol-lina as the owner as the contract progressed for work completed, and styled itself as the general contractor for the project in the May 22, 1979, agreement with LaCipollina for deferred payment of the balance owed on the contract. It is also significant that G.M. made provision for the subtrades on the project and billed LaCipollina for the work performed by the subcontractors. These facts undermine G.M.\u2019s argument that everything it did was part of one large subcontract made with LaCipollina, the latter acting as a general contractor on behalf of the town. That argument appears plainly to be an afterthought which occurred to G.M. when it became obvious that LaCipollina would not satisfy its obligations under the May 22, 1979, agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the town entered a lease with LaCipollina which authorized the latter\u2019s project but which left it to LaCipollina to pick its own contractor. LaCipollina in turn made its construction contract with G.M., independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>of any contractual commitment it had with the town. By the terms of the agreement between G.M. and LaCipollina, G.M. became the general contractor for LaCipollina\u2019s project.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the circumstances, the town was not required to see that a bond was posted under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, for G.M.\u2019s benefit,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and G.M. is referred to its remedies against LaCipollina, including the possibility of placing a lien on the latter\u2019s interest in the leasehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> That provision read in relevant part as follows: \u201cPrior to undertaking any construction hereunder, [LaCipollina] agrees to provide a Performance and Materials bond issued by a company authorized to issue bonds in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, running to the [commission] in an amount sufficient to cover the entire cost for construction . -. . determined by the Town of Barnstable Airport Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-8\"> These documents refer to the plans and specifications and included a copy of the \u201cAgreement between Owner and Contractor.\u201d This agreement was blank except for the handwritten insertion of the name of LaCipollina\u2019s architect as the project engineer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> The judge also found that representatives of the town had never had any \u201cdiscussion . . . which reasonably [could] have led G.M. to believe that any bond other than the one required in Article Twenty-One of the [l]ease would be forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\"> On each periodic invoice sent thereafter to LaCipollina, G.M. continued to bill for the bond. On its final invoice dated July 11, 1979, G.M. still listed the \u201c[b]ond\u201d under Item 1 as 100% complete, with $3,233 due to G.M. This bond, from what little appears about it in the record, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>intended to secure for G.M. coverages for worker\u2019s compensation and comprehensive general liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\"> G.M.\u2019s argument that Article Seven of the lease obliged LaCipollina to make the renovations is not persuasive. That article merely provides that LaCipollina needed the commission\u2019s approval for any renovations beyond those already approved. Article Thirty of the lease is the governing provision on the point, and that provision imposed no obligation on LaCipollina to make the renovations. Other provisions of the lease, particularly Article Two (\u201cTerm\u201d), Article Three (\u201cRent\u201d) and Article Five (\u201cNet Lease\u201d) confirm the interpretation of Article Thirty just stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> The judge ruled that the obligee of this bond was the town, which had required the bond to protect itself in the event that LaCipollina \u201cmight embark on extensive renovation and reconstruction of the premises, proceed to a stage where demolition, of substantial portions of the premises had been carried out, and then . . . default [leaving the town] unable to put the building back together in a good and workmanlike manner.\u201d We think the judge\u2019s analysis of the function of this bond is correct and that G.M. knew or should have known that this bond would not provide it with any security. We also agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that the \u201c[t]own\u2019s failure to require that LaCipollina furnish the . . . bond required by Article Twenty-One was not a legal cause of any loss or damage to G.M., which has no standing to urge a breach of that provision.\u201d See <em>John D. Ahern Co. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston University, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 50-51 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> G.M.\u2019s reliance on the \u201ccontract documents\u201d attached to the lease, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>to create a relationship within the purview of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, is misplaced. The documents do not identify any of the parties as the owner or as the general contractor. As noted, the so called \u201cAgreement1 between Owner and Contractor\u201d is blank except for the name of the project engineer, who was an employee of LaCipollina. We think these documents did not constitute an agreement which would refute the basic premise that G.M. was entering a contract with LaCipollina, not one with the town.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\"> The fact that G.M. was a general contractor renders the cases relied upon by G.M. inapposite since they all involve actions by subcontractors or materialmen to recover on a bond required of the general contractor under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. The case relied upon by G.M. at oral argument as the \u201cstrongest case\u201d for its position, <em>New England Concrete Pipe Corp. </em>v. <em>D.C. Systems Inc., </em>495 F. Supp. 1334 (D. Mass. 1980), vacated (on procedural grounds), 658 F.2d 869 (1st Cir. 1981), does not contain anything repugnant to the conclusions herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> We emphasize again, however, that we do not express an opinion whether a public entity can lawfully contract for a public work by means of lease or other agreements which have the effect of avoiding compliance with the public bidding laws, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44I. This case was tried in the Superior Court on the basis that the various agreements between the parties were valid. Our inquiry is strictly limited to a construction of the agreements which were in fact made by the parties and their legal ramifications under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
