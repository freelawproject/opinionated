L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E(\u00bf)(3), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 11. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictments, arguing that the 1982 amendments to this statute were unconstitutionally vague because the Legislature had failed to clarify unclear language in the penalty section of the statute as inserted by St. 1980, c. 436, \u00a7 4. The Supreme Judicial Court struck down similar provisions as impermissibly vague in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567 (1982), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326 (1983). The Superior Court judge reported two questions to this court. The reported questions are (1) whether the penalty provisions of the 1982 version<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of \u00a7 32E(6)(3) are unconstitutionally vague, or, (2) if not, whether they are ambiguous when read with G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, which sets forth general standards for indeterminate sentencing. We conclude that the statute is not vulnerable in either posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In relevant part, \u00a7 32E(&amp;)(3), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 650, \u00a7 11, reads: \u201c[Violators shall] be punished by a term of imprisonment in the state prison for not less than ten nor more than fifteen years .... [Fines may not be imposed] in lieu of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, as established herein.\u201d Section 32E(a)(l) reads in part: \u201c[Violators shall] be punished by a term of imprisonment in the state prison for not less than two and one-half nor more than fifteen years or by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not less than one nor more than two and one-half years. No sentence imposed under the provisions of this section shall be for less than a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201cA statute is plain and unambiguous if \u2018virtually anyone competent to understand it, and desiring fairly and impartially to ascertain its signification, would attribute to the expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>in its context a meaning such as the one we derive, rather than any other; and would consider any different meaning, by comparison, strained, or far-fetched, or unusual or unlikely. <em>New England Medical Center Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>381 Mass. 748, 750 (1980), quoting from <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>45 Del. 156, 160 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Section 32E is divided into three subsections. These subsections begin, respectively, with the phrases: \u201cAny person who trafficks in marihuana,\u201d \u201cAny person who trafficks in cocaine,\u201d and \u201cAny person who trafficks in heroin.\u201d Manifestly, each subsection applies exclusively to traffickers in the identified narcotic. Within each subsection the penalties for trafficking in large quantities are greater than the penalties for trafficking in small quantities. The mandatory minimum penalties for trafficking in heroin are on average greater than those for trafficking in cocaine. The mandatory minimum penalties for cocaine trafficking are on average greater than those for trafficking in marihuana. The logic of \u00a7 32E, considered in its entirety, is one of increasing penalties for increasing quantities of increasingly dangerous drugs. The defendants would have us check the ballooning of these penalties with a pointedly illogical reading of \u00a7 32E(a)(l). \u201cIt has been called a golden rule of statutory interpretation that unreasonableness of the result produced by one among alternative possible interpretations of a statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would produce a reasonable result.\u201d 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 45.12 (4th ed. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Viewing \u00a7 32E(\u00bf) (3) standing alone, we think it plain that the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment is \u201cnot less than ten\u201d years. However, the defendants argue that confusion arises when this subsection is read in conjunction with \u00a7 32E <em>(a) </em>(1). Section 32E(a) is introduced by the phrase \u201cAny person who trafficks in marihuana.\u201d This section does not apply to defendants, whose trafficking, if any, has been in cocaine. The defendants assert that the \u201csection\u201d to which \u00a7 32E(a)(l) refers could be all of \u00a7 32E. They argue, therefore, that it is unclear whether the one year term in \u00a7 32E(a) (1) applies only to \u00a7 32E(a)(l) or to all of \u00a7 32E. Further, they suggest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the word \u201cherein\u201d in \u00a7 32E(&amp;)(3) could refer to either \u00a7 32E <em>(b)(3) </em>alone or all of \u00a7 32E. Therefore, the defendants conclude, the statute is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The defendants\u2019 reading is contrived. \u201cIt is a fundamental tenet of due process that \u2018[n]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes,\u201d\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. at 569, quoting from <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). Due process does not require, however, that a Legislature enact laws immune to disingenuous constructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The Legislature plainly included an express reference to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year in \u00a7 32E(o)(l) because that subsection provides for sentences of different lengths either to the State prison or to a jail or house of correction. Articulation of the length of the mandatory minimum sentence is necessary in this subsection, but is unnecessary where only a State prison sentence is imposed, as in \u00a7 32E(\u00bf&gt;)(3) and the other subsections of \u00a7 32E as well. Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ca mandatory minimum\u201d in \u00a7 32E(o)(l) would serve no purpose if \u00a7 32E set forth only one mandatory minimum sentence, which would naturally be \u201cthe\u201d mandatory minimum sentence to which all the clauses make reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In \u00a7 32E(a)(l) \u201cherein\u201d must refer only to \u00a7 32E(a)(l); if it does not, the Legislature\u2019s distinction between \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d in the subsection would be pointless. The same is true of the word \u201csection.\u201d There is nothing in the canons of statutory construction or the common dictionary definition of \u201csection\u201d that requires us to give it an expansive meaning. A section is a \u201cdistinct part or portion of something written.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1061 (1983). The word section does not appear in more than one context in \u00a7 32E; its logical meaning in \u00a7 32E(a)(l) and the other subsections is narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The unconstitutional ambiguity in <em>Gagnon, Marrone, </em>and <em>Bongarzone, supra, </em>not only appeared <em>within </em>various clauses, but also created a situation in which no reasonable person could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>have chosen among several possible constructions of the penalty provisions. This is not the case here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">To both questions reported by the Superior Court our answer is no.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\"> Still another version of this statute has been adopted, St. 1983, c. 571, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"> The second question reported by the Superior Court, regarding a possible conflict between \u00a7 32E and G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, is easily resolved. Section 24 provides that no sentence to a State prison shall be for a minimum term of less than two and one-half years. The argument, which neither defendant raised, appears to be that if the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence were one year, then such a sentence could not be imposed under \u00a7 32E(\u00bf&gt;)(3), which specifies a penalty of incarceration in a State prison. Statutes that impose State prison terms of less than two and one-half years merely place violators on notice that their crimes are felonies. Judges are not thereby precluded from sentencing offenders to facilities other than State prisons. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 721-722 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>16 Mass.
