See <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 506-516 (1981); <em>Drysdale </em>v. <em>Spirito, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>689 F.2d 252, 253-255 (1st Cir. 1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Justice Stevens noted in <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>457 U.S. 569, 571 (1982), \u201cThe statutory provisions governing the Medicaid program are complex.\u201d The remark could be applied also to the relevant Federal and State regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Jane Morales (the mother) received AFDC benefits until May 9, 1982, when those benefits terminated, because the department determined that her monthly gross earnings of $793.06 by then \u201cexceeded the standard of assistance for . . . [her] family,\u201d consisting of herself and four children. See 42 C.F.R. 435, subparts E to I (1982). The mother\u2019s application to the department for continued Medicaid assistance was rejected on May 18, 1982, and by a corrected letter on June 9, 1982, she was notified that, \u201cif in the six month period beginning with the date of . . . [her] medical service . . . [she should] incur medical expenses of $416.18 . . . [she would] then be eligible to have medical bills which exceed this amount paid\u201d under the department\u2019s medical care plan. This determination meant that, before the mother would be eligible to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ceive Medicaid assistance, she would have to incur, or \u201cspend down,\u201d $416.18 from her own assets for medical bills.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The mother appealed and a hearing took place before an appeals referee of the department. See G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 16. The referee determined that the June 9 letter correctly stated the result provided for in the department\u2019s regulations. The mother sought judicial review of this ruling under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, asserting that the department had misapplied certain of its own regulations, some of which are set out in the appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The mother contends that, under the applicable regulations, she was entitled to medical assistance through August, 1982, a period during which, taking into account the $30 plus <em>Vi </em>disregard (see notes 3 and 4, <em>supra), </em>she would have no surplus income. The department, in effect, contends that its regulations, viewed as a whole, set out a reasonable and not unduly abrupt method of cutting down Medicaid assistance for persons who (e.g., by obtaining employment) have ceased to be eligible for AFDC. See the discussion in the <em>Drysdale </em>case, 689 F.2d at 255-256, of the EID (see note 3, <em>supra) </em>as an incentive to those receiving public assistance to earn income and thereby remove themselves from AFDC.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The department, as a matter of policy, could have recognized that the incentive to a person in the position of the mother to work to avoid being an AFDC recipient probably would be greater if its regulations should allow a former AFDC recipient to remain on Medicaid until she in fact (under the department\u2019s regulations) receives excess income (after taking into account for four months the $30 plus V\u00e1 disregard). See the final sentence quoted in the appendix from 106 Code Mass. Regs. (C.M.R.) \u00a7 506.120(A) (3) (1981). On that basis the mother would not have been subject to any \u201cspend down\u201d of her own funds for medical aid until after August, 1982. The termination of Medicaid on that basis might have turned out to be less burdensome. Instead (compare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602[a][8][A][iv] [Supp. V. 1981]), the department adopted regulations which it interprets as requiring an estimate of the mother\u2019s prospective earnings and work-related expenses (and any permissible $30 and <em>V3 </em>disregard) to be made for a future six-month period from the date of her first request for medical assistance after her AFDC has ceased. The mother\u2019s contention would have postponed any further computations until September, 1982. Then, of course (if the mother\u2019s income and circumstances remained unchanged) for the then succeeding six months she would be required by the regulations (as interpreted by the department) to expend for medical costs all or substantially all of her then current excess income before being eligible for Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The regulations could have been expressed much more clearly and in a manner more intelligible, not only to recipients of aid but even to social workers and judges trying to understand the Medicaid structure. The trial judge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> felt constrained, however, to accept in this review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>partment\u2019s interpretation (which he regarded as permissible) of its own regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We must consider whether the Massachusetts regulations are clear enough to permit that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We asked the parties to file further briefs (see note 1, supra), because we recognized that the department was confronted with the intricate problem of adjusting its procedures and regulations to a complex, frequently changed, Federal statutory and administrative structure for Medicaid and AFDC. <em>See Blum </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>457 U.S. 132, 141-142 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because of this Federal-State problem, we were reluctant to reject the department\u2019s somewhat obscure interpretation of its own regulations without being satisfied that a different interpretation would not complicate further an already difficult intergovernmental situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The new brief in behalf of the department essentially concedes that the mother\u2019s contentions as to the \u201ccorrect interpretation of [the department\u2019s] current regulations,\u201d if adopted by us, (1) \u201cprobably would not conflict with any [F]ederal statute or regulations,\u201d and (2) that Federal financial participation in Medicaid payments is available for payments made by a State pursuant to a court order. 42 C.F.R. 431.250(b) (2) and (d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>(1983). Deference is ordinarily afforded to a department\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 782 (1980). The regulations set out in the appendix, however, especially \u00a7\u00a7 505.300, 506.000, 506.510, 506.520, when read with \u00a7 506.120(A) (3), as the trial judge pointed out, do not clearly justify the department\u2019s interpretation. Instead, they indicate that an aid recipient, for four months after he or she has ceased to receive AFDC, remains eligible for the \u201c$30 and one-third \u2018disregard\u2019 \u201d and because of that disregard, such an aid recipient is likely to have no excess income for four months after receipt of the last AFDC payment. Section 506.510 (even when considered with the next to the last paragraph of G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10; see note 6, supra) does not seem to us to require (although it may permit) the use of a six-month prospective budget period, at least until the four-month period has expired. The department in 106 C.M.R. \u00a7 502.220 (1981) has recognized that determinations of eligibility may be made more frequently than at six-month intervals where the department knows of changes in an aid recipient\u2019s fiscal situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">If the department had made its regulations (and illustrations of their proposed application in particular circumstances) as informative as the provisions of Massachusetts Medical Assistance Procedures Handbook par. 6126(1982), see note 6, <em>supra, </em>it may be that its interpretation of its regulations would have been sustained as permissible. That handbook, however, has not been subjected to the statutory procedures for adopting regulations (see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 5-9), nor can we assume that the handbook is generally available to the public. We conclude, on this record, that the common-sense interpretation of the regulatory language is that for which the mother contends. The department\u2019s interpretation of its regulations seems inconsistent with their terms. See <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). See also <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 514-516. Compare <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 613, 616-617 (1980), where a departmental interpretation was ruled to be \u201cconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>[underlying] text\u2019s more obvious reading.\u201d We hold that the regulations permitted the mother to receive Medicaid until the expiration of four months from the last payment to her of AFDC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The judgment is reversed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court which is to reverse the decision of the department and to order the department to grant Medicaid benefits to the mother for the four months following the last May, 1982, AFDC payment to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">CERTAIN RELEVANT REGULATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">A.
