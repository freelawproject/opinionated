Martin against Farm and Home Savings and Loan Association, a private corporation, organized and chartered under the laws of Missouri, with a permit to do business in this State. By petition in the district court Martin sought to have declared paid a certain $3,000.00 non-negotiable note or contract executed by him and his wife to the Association. Also, Martin sought judgment removing the alleged cloud cast upon his title to certain real property by a certain deed of trust executed by himself and wife for the benefit of this Association. Trial in the district court resulted in a take nothing judgment in favor of the Association. On appeal by Martin to the Court of Civil Appeals at Fort Worth, that court reversed the judgment of the district court, and rendered judgment for Martin canceling the note and deed of trust, and removing the alleged cloud from his title. 81 S.

Materialman\u2019s lien note for $3,000.00, dated August 15, 1925, due on or before October 15, 1925, bearing ten per cent interest from maturity, payable to the order of WaplesPainter Company, and executed by Dan L.

This instrument was given to secure the above note, and it and the note were for labor and material to be furnished by Waples-Painter Company in building on the above-described lots. The improvements were to be erected for the purpose of enabling Martin and his wife to use such premises as a residence homestead, and they own no other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">3.

It is then contended by the Association that under the terms of such contract it is Martin\u2019s duty to continue to pay his monthly obligations until his stock is actually worth the amount of his $3,000.00 debt, or until he shall pay the difference between the amount of the debt and the actual value of his stock. In this connection, it is conclusively shown that the actual value of Martin\u2019s stock was $514.31 less than the $3,000.00 debt. It is also shown that this Association became insolvent in a building and loan sense prior to the time that Martin made his 97th monthly payment, to such an extent as to make Martin\u2019s stock worth $514.31 less than its par value. It is also shown that all stock, borrowing and nonborrowing, in this association is worth less than par. in the same proportion, and that such fact has been duly adjudicated in a class suit filed for that purpose in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In order to decide this case it is first necessary to determine what constitutes the contract between the parties. After a careful investigation of this record we are convinced that all instruments above enumerated constitute the contract, just as completely and just as effectively as if they were all comprised within the four corners of one instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">When the several instruments are read together as one contract, it fully appears by its various provisions that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>makes the laws of Missouri and the Association\u2019s articles of incorporation, by-laws, rules, and regulations, as they then existed or as they should be thereafter lawfully changed, varied, or amended, a part of the contract. It thus appears that in order to ascertain the full terms of the contract we must not only look to the terms and conditions directly set forth therein, but we must also look to the laws of Missouri and the by-laws, etc., of the Association. Wirtz v. Sovereign Camp W. O. W., 114 Texas, 471, 483, 268 S. W., 438, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Since the laws of Missouri and the by-laws of this Associaation, etc., are a part of this contract, Martin was and is charged with notice thereof, and must be held to be bound thereby, where such laws, by-laws, etc., \u201care not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States or the laws of the state, or the charter of the Association, or are not against public policy. Witz v. Soverign Camp W. O. W., supra. When we read this entire contract, considering the laws of Missouri and the by-laws of the Association as parts thereof, it becomes plainly evident that Martin simply became a borrowing member of this concern. No issue of fraud is involved, because Martin made his contract with full legal notice before him that the laws of Missouri and the by-laws of the Association were parts of his contract. In this connection, this record shows that Martin was an educated man, because it shows that he was Superintendent of the Schools of Bowie, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">When we come to examine the by-laws of this Association we find that they expressly provide that every shareholder of stipulated monthly payment installment stock shall pay to the Association _ monthly dues installments of 50c, 60c, 80c, and $1.30, respectively, on each $100.00 of stock, according to the class of stock carried by him. It is then shown that the stock is classified as H, F, D, and B, which are estimated to mature in 136, 120, 97, and 65 months, respectively. A reference to this contract shows that Martin subscribed to 30 shares of Class D stock. As shown by the by-laws, this stock required a monthly payment of 80c per share, and was merely estimated to mature in 97 months. But according to the by-laws this was a mere estimate, and not a guarantee. It is, therefore, evident that the provision for 97 monthly payments as set out in the note and deed of trust was, and is, merely an estimate. Martin had notice of this, because he was legally apprised of that fact by the by-laws of the Associaton. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>more, he was legally apprised of the fact that under the laws of Missouri and the by-laws of the Association, this Association could not guarantee the dividends on its stock. Also, he legally knew that he was becoming a member of an incorporated mutual association. Finally, we think under the laws of Texas this Association could not guarantee the maturity value of its stock, as we will later demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">We will not extend this opinion by attempting to discuss in detail all the provisions of this contract, including as parts thereof the laws of Missouri and the by-laws; but we think that when it is considered in its entirety it becomes plainly evident that Martin simply became a borrowing member of this Association, and that he entered into such relationship with full legal notice of the obligations he was assuming, as defined by the very instruments he signed, and the things they referred to and made parts thereof. Simply stated, by the terms of this contract Martin borrowed $3,000.00 from this Association, and agreed to pay as interest thereon the sum of $19.50 per month. At the same time he subscribed for $3,000.00 of the capital stock of this Association, represented by 30 shares. He agreed to pay monthly on this stock the sum of $24.00. It was understood by the contract, considered as a whole, that when the stock became of equal value to the $3,000.00 debt, the one would cancel the other, and the lien would be satisfied. It is true that the instrument termed the note states that Martin was to make 97 monthly payments of $43.50 each, being $24.00 on stock dues and $19.50 as monthly interest on the $3,000.00 borrowed. Also, it is true that the stock certificate states that 97 monthly payments shall be made thereon, and no further payments shall be required. At the same time, the by-laws of the association inform Martin that the statement that 97 payments only would be required was an estimate; and, further, the by-laws of the Association and the laws of Missouri informed Martin that the Association, a mutual concern, did not, and could not, bind itself to mature its stock prior to actual maturity thereof. In this connection, it is certainly evident that this debt has not been paid, unless it can be said that this stock should be valued at $3,000.00 under this contract. This not only cannot be said from the contract, but the opposite is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The Court of Civil Appeals holds that under Article 874, R. C. S., foreign building and loan associations doing business in this State are required to conduct their business in accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>anee with the laws of this .State governing domestic building and loan associations. The Court of Civil Appeals then holds that under the provisions of Article 857, R. C. S., this Association \u201chad a right to limit the number of payments the borrowing stockholder would be required to make to pay off his loan and secure a release of his encumbrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">A reading of Article 874, supra, shows that it provides, in substance, that foreign building and loan associations doing business in Texas shall conduct the same in accordance with our laws \u201cgoverning domestic building and loan associations, and shall comply with all requirements of said laws except as herein provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Article 857, supra, provides, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201c* * * Subject to the approval of the Commissioner, the number of payment (payments) of dues, interest and premium required from the borrowing stockholder to pay off his loan and secure a release of his incumbrance may be limited to such a definite number as the by-laws may provide. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Now, conceding that the provisions of Article 874 make the above-quoted portion of Article 857 applicable to foreign corporations doing business in Texas, still Article 857 can give no comfort to Martin under the facts contained in this record. In this regard it will be noted that Article 857 only authorizes building and loan associations to limit the number of payments of dues, interest, and premium required from borrowing stockholders when such limitation is authorized by its by-laws and approved by the commissioner. If either one of these requirements is lacking, the power does not exist. A reading of the by-laws of this Association will demonstrate that they not only do not provide for such a contract, but expressly prohibit it. Also, there is nothing in this record to show that the commissioner has ever approved, as to this Association, the authority provided for in the above-quoted portion of Article 857. Finally, as shown by the statute, the commissioner only has power to approve such contracts where the by-laws of the Association provide for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">As shown above, Article 857, supra, in effect authorizes building and loan associations to make contracts limiting the number of payments of dues, interest, and premiums required from borrowing stockholders, where such limitation is authorized by the by-laws of the Association and approved by the commissioner. We think this statute demonstrates a plain legislative intent to deny the right to make such contracts unless the statute is complied with. In other words, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>statute denies the right to make such contracts, unless they are authorized by the Association\u2019s by-laws and approved by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">Counsel for Martin contend that this contract is null and void because in contravention of Section 50 of Article XVI of our State Constitution. In this connection, it is contended that this contract attempts to create a lien on Martin\u2019s homestead to secure stock subscription, penalties, etc. The above constitutional provision makes null and void all attempted liens on the- homestead, except for purchase money therefor, and improvements made thereon. If this contract attempts to create a lien on Martin\u2019s homestead to secure his stock subscription, penalties, etc., it is, to that extent, null and void. Of course, a lien cannot be created on a homestead except for the purposes authorized by the Constitution. However, as we construe this contract, taken as a whole, it has the effect to extend and preserve a mechanic\u2019s lien on this property, Martin\u2019s homestead, to secure the $3,000.00 money borrowed, with interest. In this connection, Martin owed $3,000.00, bearing ten per cent, interest, secured by a valid and subsisting mechanic\u2019s lien on his homestead. This Association advanced the money to take up, pay off, and extend such indebtedness, and by the attending circumstances became subrogated to the original mechanic\u2019s lien to secure it for the money so advanced, with interest. This constituted Martin a borrower from the Association. At the same time, Martin assumed another relationship with the Association. He became a subscriber for 30 shares of Class D stock therein, for which he agreed to pay $24.00 per month. As a member of the Association, he agreed to pay certain other things. When the stock becomes of equal value to the debt, or when Martin pays the difference between the value of the stock and the debt, the one will cancel the other. The lien on the homestead is only for the money borrowed, with interest. It does not secure the stock subscription. The stock subscription, and money paid thereon, is in the nature of a separate savings account, by which a fund is created which will ultimately be applied to liquidate the debt in accordance with the details of the plan. Under the express words of the contract, the money paid on stock subscription is not as such a payment on the debt. In this connection, we take the liberty to requote the following provisions of the deed of trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">\u201cIt is also agreed that should default be made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>payment of any of the items mentioned in this conveyance, or in the obligations secured hereby on the day when the same are due and payable according to the terms thereof, and according to the By-Laws of said Association, its Rules and Regulations, and should such default continue, in whole or in part, and so remain unpaid for a period of Six Months from due dates, then the said Association, its successors and assigns shall have and is hereby given the option to, without notice declare mature, due and immediately payable the above described principal obligation, together with all arrearages, advances and penalties, although the period herein, and the ByLaws, Rules and regulation of said Association provided for payment of said obligation shall not have then expired; and in event of proceedings foreclosing this deed of trust, through legal proceedings or otherwise, the indebtedness hereby secured shall bear interest from date of default at the rate of 7.8 per cent per annum in lieu of further monthly installments, and the shares of stock above referred to shall be canceled and the surrender value thereof, as provided in the ByLaws of said Association, as of the date of the first default, shall be applied in reduction of the sums due on this Deed of Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">\u201cAnd it is further understood and declared to be the intent of the parties hereto that the grantors are bona fide stockholders in said Association, and have subscribed for said stock, and make payments thereon as an investment or method of saving, and in no sense or particular are the said stock payments to be considered as made on the loan or advances made by said Association, * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Counsel for Martin contend that Martin\u2019s contract with the Association is null and void because in contravention of Section 6 of Article XII of our State Constitution. That constitutional provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cSec. 6. No corporation shall issue stock or bonds except for money paid, labor done or property actually received, and all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">By this transaction Martin subscribed for 30 shares of Class D stock in this association, to be paid for in installments of $24.00 per month. The stock certificates never left the possession of the association, but was held by it as security therefor; and the stock could only be transferred on the books of the Association. We think this transaction, as applied to build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ing and loan associations, has been recognized as valid by this Court too long for its validity to be now open for review. Many millions of dollars of such contracts have been negotiated and are now in existence. Prudential Building &amp; Loan Assn. v. Shaw (Com. of Appls., opinion adopted), 119 Texas, 228, 26 S. W.
