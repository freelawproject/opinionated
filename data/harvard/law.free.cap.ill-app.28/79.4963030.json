But until the completion of the said union passenger depot, the said lessees shall severally have the use of convenient and suitable accommodations for their passenger trains to be furnished by the said first party, and they shall at all times have the use of sufficient, convenient and suitable standing room for their passenger, baggage and mail cars at said city of Peoria, while not in use, on tracks to be provided and set apart by said first party.</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\" pgmap=\"78\">\u201cSixth. \u2014 The said lessees shall severally have equal rights and accommodations in the use and enjoyment of all elevators, stock yards and other property and facilities at any time acquired or controlled by said party of the first part.

Stevess, Lee &amp; Morton, for appellant.</attorneys><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\" pgmap=\"81\">It is assumed by appellees that the appellant was a common carrier of the cars that were burned up at the sugar refinery, and that its. liability, as such, is determined by the case of P. &amp; P. U. Co. v. C., R. I. &amp; P. Co., 109 Ill. 135. It is further assumed that Reed had a right of action against it as a carrier, and that this right extended to the appellees as the owners of the cars. There are but few cases in any way analogous to this one. It is not determined by the case above cited, and upon which the appellees will attempt to fix the liability in this one. It will he seen in that case that no relation of lessor and lessee existed.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-8\" pgmap=\"81\">That case was one of first impression in our court. Since its decision the M. S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, Judge Treat presiding, has announced a contrary principle in a similar case. M. P. R. R. Co. v. C. &amp; A. R. R. Co., 23 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases, 718.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-9\" pgmap=\"81\">It is identical with the case of the P. &amp; P. U. Co. v. C., R. I. &amp; P. Co., and announces, as we believe, a correct.principle, although opposite to that of our Supreme Court; but inasmuch as the C., R. I. &amp; P. Co. had no interest whatever, as lessee or otherwise, in the tracks and property of tho P. &amp; P. U. Co., we do not think that the principle laid down by our court, if a correct one, is at all applicable to tho present case.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-10\" pgmap=\"81(95) 82(110)\">In St. P. &amp; S. C. R. R. Co. v. M. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co., 26 Minn. 243, there was an agreement between the plaintiff and defendant companies, between whose lines of road there was a rail connection at Merriam Junction, and the defendant received from plaintiff at the junction eight of its cars, loaded with wheat, for transportation and delivery to consignees at Minneapolis, a point on defendant\u2019s road. By the terms of said agreement the defendant was required to haul the cars over its road, having exclusive charge and control thereof, make delivery of the wheat, and return the cars? either loaded or empty, to the plaintiff, at the junction, in as good condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear by use excepted. Both parties were to share the profits of the transportation of the wheat and other freight so carried, and plaintiff was to receive from defendant, in addition to its shares of such profits, a stipulated compensation for the use of its cars, and while being so used by the defendant, the cars were wholly destroyed by fire at Minneapolis, without any fault or negligence on its part, amounting to more than ordinary wear and tear.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-5\" pgmap=\"82\">The court held that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff for such loss, either as a common carrier, bailee for hire or otherwise.</p><attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-6\" pgmap=\"82\">Mr. II. W. Wells, for appellees.</attorneys><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-7\" pgmap=\"82\">Our statute, act 1873, Starr &amp; C. Ill. Stat., p. 1961, was construed by the Supreme Court to recognize a railroad company a common carrier of railroad cars. P. &amp; P. U. Ry. Co. v. C., R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 109 Ill. 136.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-8\" pgmap=\"82\">We insist that the case now presented is in all its essential features like the case of P. &amp; P. U. v. C., R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 109 Ill. 135.</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-9\" pgmap=\"82\">It wras the same fire, October 27th, referred to in thaf case, that destroyed the cars sued for in this case. The only difference in facts being, that in that case the defendant was liable to return the empty cars to the plaintiff, and in this case it was bound to store them until called for.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-10\" pgmap=\"82\">The so-called lease was simply a contract by which defendant became a common carrier for the other parties to the lease, and undertook the carriage of all their cars, loaded or empty, upon a compensation mentioned, and to be ascertained under the contract.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-11\" pgmap=\"82\">There is no attempt to waive or evade liability as a common carrier anywhere in the contract. Bor is there any disguise of its position, as such carrier.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-12\" pgmap=\"82(21) 83(51)\">The defendant accepted these cars as a common carrier, and began to transport them, and we insist for appellees that such responsibility continued; that it was legally liable as a common carrier until the transportation was completed. Her can defendant excuse itself from the performance of its duty as carrier by producing this lease in evidence, to the receiver of a railroad which simply delivered these cars to defendant to be transported.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-5\" pgmap=\"83\">As was stated in the opinion, the case of the P. &amp; P. U. Ry. v. C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry., supra, was in that court a case of first impression. The principles governing the ease, however, were well established and have never been questioned. Mallory v. The Tioga R. R. Co., 39 Barb. 191; Hannibal R. R. Co. v. Swift, 12 Wall. 272; Spears v. L. S. &amp; M. S. R. R., 67 Barb. 518; N. J. R. R. Co. v. Pa. R. R. Co., 3 Dutch. 100; V. &amp; M. R. R. Co. v. Fitchburg R. R., 14 Allen, 462.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-7\" pgmap=\"83\">The liability of a common carrier continues from the time the carrier accepts the goods until the contract of transportation is completed and the goods delivered in a warehouse.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-8\" pgmap=\"83\">In this case the carrier was to deliver the cars on its track to the sugar refinery, there to be unloaded, then was to store them in its yards. The liability as carrier continued until the cars wore actually stored. Mohr v. C. &amp; N. W. R. R., 40 Iowa, 579; Leavenworth, etc., v. Morris, 16 Kan. 333; C. &amp; N. W. Ry. v. Bensley, 69 Ill. 630.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-10\" pgmap=\"83\">The stoppage of the cars to be unloaded was not a storage of the cars, but merely one of the stages of transportation.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-11\" pgmap=\"83\">It is one of the inflexible rules of law that a carrier can not become a warehouseman while the goods are in transit. McDonald v. Western R. R., 34 N. Y. 497; Oumut v. Henshaw, 35 Vt. 605.</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-12\" pgmap=\"83\">These cars wrere in defendant\u2019s custody while at the sugar-refinery, simply awaiting transportation. R. R. Co. v. Mfg. Co., 16 Wall. 318.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-13\" pgmap=\"83\">This action is brought in the name of the owner of the cars. That the owners were the proper parties has been held by our Supreme Court in Merchants Despatch v. Smith, 76 Ill. 542; G. W. R. R. v. McComas, 33 Ill. 185.</p><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-14\" pgmap=\"83(24) 84(43)\">The case of I. C. Ry. v. Schwartz, 13 Ill. App. 490, is a leading case upon this question, and while the question there turned upon the right of the consignee to sue under the contract, the reasoning of the court states the right in such cases as largely hinging upon ownership of the goods transported. See also Stone v. Wabash, etc., 9 Ill. App. 48.</p> <opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b84-5\" pgmap=\"84\">Per Curiam.</author> <p id=\"ATv\" pgmap=\"84\">We are of the opinion that the plea of the statute of limitations should prevail as to car Ho. 3043. It will be seen that each one of the cars mentioned in the above agreement was delivered to the appellant to be switched at different dates, hence the appellee, if it has a cause of action, would have a separate one for each car.</p> <p id=\"b84-6\" pgmap=\"84\">In the first declaration filed in October, 1884; the then plaintiffs declared for the loss of but three cars. All the cars were destroyed by fire September 27,1881. The amended declaration was filed in February, 1887, in which the charge for the loss of car Ho. 3043 -was first counted on as claimed.</p> <p id=\"b84-7\" pgmap=\"84\">This it will be seen was more than five years after the caluse of action accrued, and was barred by the statute of limitations. The fact that the declaration was afterward amended so as to make appellees parties plaintiff, could not have the effect to revive the claim as to such car already barred. To gain the claim for this car in the original declaration by way of amendment would be no different in point of law than to file a new count for it. It was entirely omitted from the declaration till after the bar had taken place. It can in no way be regarded as a recounting for the same cause of action. This point seems to be fully settled in I. C. R. R. Co. v. Cobb, Christy &amp; Co., 64 Ill. 128.</p> <p id=\"b84-8\" pgmap=\"84\">In that case a new count was filed declaring on a cause of action for loss of oats, not embraced in the original declaration and after the lapse of the statute, and it was held to be within the statute. The plea was good as against so much of the count as was barred, and the fact that it set up 'a bar to all would not interfere to make it bad as to the portion barred-</p> <p id=\"b84-9\" pgmap=\"84(49) 85(29)\">We are of the opinion that the appellee was a proper party to bring the suit. Merchants Despatch v. Smith, 76 Ill. 542; G. W. R. R. Co. v. McComas, 33 Ill. 185. That as to a shipper of cars over appellant\u2019s road we must hold it to stand' in the relation of a common carrier, as was fully decided in P. &amp; P. U. Ry. Co. v. C., R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 109 Ill. 136.</p> <p id=\"b85-5\" pgmap=\"85\">The appellee was the owner of the cars destroyed by fire, and was in no way bound by the contract between the railways, who were lessees of appellant, and the appellant, even if their contract relieved the appellant as to them, from the obligations of a common carrier, a point we do not now decide. The appellant was in the general business of switching cars for all railroads which would furnish it business. Whatever may have been decided in the United States District Court in Missouri, or in any other courts different, if different from the rule announced in the above cited cause reported in 109 Ill. 136 above, could have no binding effect in this court, as we are bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court of this State; so we will not stop to consider the cases cited by counsel for the appellant on that subject.</p> <p id=\"b85-6\" pgmap=\"85\">For the reason above given the judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b85-7\" pgmap=\"85\">Reversed, and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
