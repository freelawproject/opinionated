The bankruptcy court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>held the financing statement to be inadequate because it listed the debtor by the name in which it did business rather than its legal corporate name. The district court affirmed. Holding the debtor\u2019s name used in the financing statement was not seriously misleading, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">The facts are not disputed. Prior to its bankruptcy, the debtor engaged in the manufacture and sale of boats in Florida. Although its legal corporate name was \u201cGlas-eo, Inc.,\u201d the debtor operated its business solely under the name, \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Appellant, the Citizens Bank of Perry (\u201cthe bank\u201d), was \u201cfloor planning\u201d marine engines for the debtor. In 1977, in connection with this financing, the debtor executed promissory notes and a security agreement in the name of \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d The bank, to perfect its security interest in the marine engines, timely filed a standard form UCC-1 financing statement with the Florida Secretary of State, as required by Florida law. The bank listed the debtor on the form as \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d The form was signed at the bottom by an officer of the debtor, without any designation as to office, capacity or affiliation. A filing clerk in the Secretary of State\u2019s office indexed this financing statement under the name listed, but did not cross-index it under \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">Later in 1977, the debtor filed for bankruptcy. The trustee in bankruptcy, appel-lee here, inquired of the Secretary of State whether any financing statements had been filed under \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d Since the trustee did not request a search under \u201cElite Boats\u201d or \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d as well, the bank\u2019s financing statement was not disclosed. With permission of the bankruptcy court and without notice to the bank, the trustee then sold the marine engines. The bank commenced this action against the trustee for the sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">In granting the trustee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the bankruptcy court held the financing statement to be improper because it did not list the debtor by its legal name; \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d The court further held the Secretary of State had no duty to cross-index the financing statement under the debtor\u2019s legal name, and the trustee was not bound by its actual knowledge that the debtor did business as \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d The district court affirmed. On appeal, the bank contends that (1) listing the debtor as \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d was sufficient because it was not seriously misleading to future creditors; and (2) in any event, the Secretary of State should have cross-indexed under \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">To perfect a security interest in collateral, a creditor must file a financing statement which complies with the filing requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Florida. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 679.9-401 <em>et seq. </em>(1966). The purpose of the filing system is to give notice to creditors and other interested parties that a security interest exists in property of the debtor. <em>Owen v. McKesson &amp; Robbins Drug Co., </em>349 F.Supp. 1327, 1334 (N.D.Fla.1972). Perfect accuracy, however, is not required as long as the financing statement contains sufficient information to \u201cput any searcher on inquiry.\u201d <em>In re Excel Stores, Inc., </em>341 F.2d 961, 963 (2d Cir. 1965). <em>See also In re Fowler, </em>407 F.Supp. 799, 802 (W.D.Okla.1975). The emphasis of the Uniform Commercial Code is thus on commercial realities rather than on corporate technicalities. <em>Siljeg v. National Bank of Commerce, </em>509 F.2d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir. 1975). Section 9-402(5) reflects this emphasis by providing: \u201cA financing statement substantially complying with the requirements of this . section is effective even though it contains minor errors which are not seriously misleading.\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 679.9-402(5) (1966). <em>See generally In re Hammons, </em>614 F.2d 399, 405-06 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">The effect of errors in the listing of the debtor\u2019s name has been the subject of extensive litigation. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Sufficiency of Designation of Debtor or Secured Party in Security Agreement or Financing Statement Under UCC \u00a7 9-402, </em>99 A.L.R.3d 478-565 (1980). The decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>appear generally to turn on the particular factual circumstances involved. The case here, then, must be judged on its own facts, with the focus on whether potential creditors would have been misled as a result of the name the debtor was listed by in the bank\u2019s financing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">It is undisputed the debtor held itself out to the community and to creditors as \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d Its checks, stationery, and bank account all bore the latter name. Apparently the same name was used in its bills, contracts and telephone listing, because there is no indication in the record the debtor ever used the name of just \u201cGlaseo, Inc.,\u201d or any other name. Thus, listing the debtor by the sole name in which it did business was not misleading, because any reasonably prudent creditor would have requested the Secretary of State to search under \u201cElite Boats\u201d in addition to \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d Of course, the trustee in bankruptcy is considered to be in the position of a hypothetical but prudent creditor. <em>See, e. g., In re Federal\u2019s, Inc., </em>553 F.2d 509 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>In re Leichter, </em>471 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\"><em>Siljeg v. National Bank of Commerce, </em>509 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir. 1975), is analogous. <em>Sil-jeg </em>involved a security interest in property of a corporate debtor which later merged into another company. The parties disputed whether the \u201ctrue name\u201d of the debtor was the pre-merger or post-merger name, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the financing statement. In rejecting this focus of inquiry, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-6\">The issue to be determined is not the true name of the entity, but whether the filing was misleading. Filing under an assumed trade name is effective unless it is misleading .... It is likely that the ... corporation did business under only one name and it may well be that a filing under that name was not seriously misleading. 509 F.2d at 1012-13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">The court then remanded the case for consideration under this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">The trustee relies on several cases each involving an individual who is engaged in business under an assumed trade name. These cases generally hold that a financing statement listing only the trade name as the debtor will be insufficient to perfect a security interest effective against the individual. <em>See, e. g, In re Leichter, </em>471 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Citizens Bank v. Ansley, </em>467 F.Supp. 51 (M.D.Ga.1979), <em>affirmed without opinion, </em>604 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>But see In re Platt, </em>257 F.Supp. 478 (E.D.Pa.1966). There is a crucial distinction, however, between these cases and the case here. In the former, a single debtor is necessarily held out to the credit community under two names, that of the individual and of the business. The individual\u2019s credit for personal needs is unrelated to the business. A personal creditor would not necessarily be aware of the business or trade name, and thus may not discover security interests filed solely under the business name. In the present case, where the company does business only under one name, the opportunity for creditors to be misled is substantially reduced, even though that name is not the company\u2019s \u201ctrue name.\u201d <em>See Siljeg, supra, </em>509 F.2d at 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-10\">We hold the listing of the debtor as \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d rather than as \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d was not seriously misleading. The financing statement was therefore in substantial compliance with the filing requirements under Florida law and was sufficient to perfect the bank\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-11\">Because of our holding on the first issue presented by the bank, we need not decide whether the Secretary of State had a duty to cross-index the financing statement under \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d A creditor who has complied with the filing requirements does not bear the risk of improper indexing by the Secretary of State. Official Comment to Section 9-407, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 679.9-407 (1966). <em>See also In re Royal Electrotype Corp., </em>485 F.2d 394 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>In re Fowler, </em>407 F.Supp. 799 (W.D.Okla.1975). Thus, the bank would have a perfected security interest whether or not the Secretary of State had breached a duty to cross-index.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>TUTTLE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab9G\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">With deference, I dissent. The majority opinion treats this case as presenting a group of narrow issues arising under the filing provisions for perfection of security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 679.9-401 <em>et seq. </em>(1966). The majority eschews technicality to reach what might be considered to be a common sense solution in finding a perfected security interest despite an irregularity in the filing. Because this superficially appealing result contains the seeds for future mischief I cannot concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The filing system under the Code revolves around the concept of \u201cnotice filing,\u201d where a filing is to \u201c \u2018give the minimum information necessary to put any searcher on inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Excel Stores, </em>341 F.2d 961, 963 (2d Cir. 1965); <em>see </em>UCC 9-402, comment 2. To effectuate the Code's spirit of liberality and disdain for rigid technicality the drafters included the provision, now relied upon by the majority, that a financing statement is effective even if \u201cit contains minor errors which are not seriously misleading.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.9-4:02(5). This provision clearly was designed to accomplish substantial justice and \u201cto discourage the fanatical and impossibly refined reading of such statutory requirements in which courts have occasionally indulged themselves.\u201d UCC \u00a7 9-402, comment 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">This provision of liberality, however, was never intended to vitiate the beneficial effects of having a simple filing system for the benefit of both existing creditors and searchers of the files. In its decision which protects the rights of the bank-appellant, the majority has unfairly burdened the other persons who must rely upon the filing system. A variety of different types of errors may cause the name on the financing statement to be erroneous and result in an incorrect filing of the statement. In deciding whether an error is \u201cseriously misleading\u201d a court must apply an \u201cappropriate sensitivity to the relevant factors.\u201d J. White &amp; R. Summers, <em>Handbook of the Law Under the Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 23-16, 958 (2d ed.1980). In this regard the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that a subsequent creditor might never search the filings under the trade name of \u201cLandman Dry Cleaners\u201d where the debtor\u2019s name was \u201cLeichter.\u201d <em>In re Leichter, </em>471 F.2d 785, 787 (2d Cir. 1972). On the other hand, a filing under a trade name may be so similar to the debtor\u2019s real name that a searcher would be put on notice despite the technical error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-9\">The Referee found that a search of the public records under the name of Henry Platt would not have disclosed F.C.A.\u2019s interest. Platt Fur Co. was an unregistered fictitious name for the business of Henry Platt. He also used Kenwell Fur Novelty Co. as a fictitious name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-10\">The use of Kenwell as the debtor would clearly have left F.C.A. without a perfected security interest. However, the name Platt Fur Co. is sufficiently related to the name of the debtor, Henry Platt, to require those who search the records to make further investigation. Furthermore, the Referee found that the name was \u201cnot seriously misleading,\u201d the criterion for effectiveness under \u00a7 9-402(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1VH\"><em>In re Platt, 251 </em>F.Supp. 478, 482 (E.D.Pa.1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority distinguishes cases such as <em>Leichter </em>as cases where the credit records of an individual\u2019s business should be distinguished from the credit records of the individual. The majority reasons that: \u201cA personal creditor would not necessarily be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>aware of the business or trade name, and thus may not discover security interests filed solely under the business name. In the present case, where the company does business only under one name, the opportunity for creditors to be misled is substantially reduced, even though that name is not the company\u2019s \u2018true name.\u2019 \u201d At 796.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This distinction will not support the majority\u2019s result. The majority points to indications that the debtor always did business under the name \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d and concludes that therefore any potential creditor would know to check under that non-legal name. But we are reviewing a case that was disposed of on a motion for summary judgment. Given this state of the record there may have existed creditors who would have perceived the debtor as simply \u201cGlaseo, Inc.,\u201d the legally proper title which, of course, it was. Surely the trustee could be taken to stand in the shoes of such an ideal creditor who had no notice. And in searching for \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d one would not normally come across an item filed under the title of \u201cElite Boats.\u201d This is simply not a case where a searcher looking for the actual name would be put on notice by a filing under a similar trade name. A filing under the trade name in this case would not be filed near the actual name. Moreover, even if such creditors knew the trade name, they would still be justified to search only under the debtor\u2019s <em>legal </em>name. The terms of UCC \u00a7 9 \u2014 402 require no more.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Searching under a trade name would be completely unnecessary but for the majority\u2019s opinion. From now on in this Circuit, potential creditors must undertake to discover trade names and to conduct additional searches in order to avoid a judicial determination that they lacked diligence. And even if they follow such precautions they might yet overlook one trade name and face potentially expensive litigation over whether they should have known about that trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">Of course, the majority\u2019s conclusion may yet be saved if the Secretary of State wrongly failed to carry out a duty to cross index the financing statement. A creditor who complies with the filing requirements may not bear the risk of errors by the filing officer. <em>See </em>UCC \u00a7 9-407, comment 1. This rule holds true because under the Code \u201cPresentation for filing of a financing statement ... constitutes filing under this chapter.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 679.9 \u2014 403(1). <em>See In re Royal Electrotype Corp., </em>485 F.2d 394, 395-96 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>In re </em>Fowler, 407 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>F.Supp. 799 (W.D.Okla.1975). But those authorities do not aid the bank in the present case. The error lay in the bank\u2019s submission of the debtor\u2019s name as \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d The filing officer dutifully filed the statement under precisely this name. The bank may argue that the filing officers usually cross index under all names given. For example, a financing statement using a \u201cdoing business as\u201d listing of a debtor would be indexed under the legal name and the trade name. This argument by the bank differs from the position that the bank will not bear the risks of the filing officer\u2019s mistakes; rather this argument holds that the filing officer must correct the bank\u2019s errors. If the bank had clearly indicated two names separated by a notation such as \u201cd.b.a.\u201d, its position would be stronger. But the fact remains that the bank\u2019s submission could very easily be taken to be <em>one </em>name especially by a clerk untrained in legal subtleties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA secured party does not bear the risk of improper filing or indexing as <em>long as his conduct does not lead to the error on the part of the filing officer\u201d In re Fowler, </em>407 F.Supp. at 803 (emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">Courts may have the opportunity to view a situation with perfect hindsight which is unavailable to participants in daily activities. The bank had the opportunity to submit the correct name of the debtor and failed to do so. A searcher versed in the operation of the UCC would know that the filing should be under the debtor\u2019s legal name. He would have no reason to look under a trade name, even if he is aware of the trade name\u2019s existence, because he should be able to rely on the bank to submit the legal name and not a trade name. Future creditors must now anticipate mistakes by would-be secured creditors in order not to be ensnared in the hindsight of courts. The trustee should prevail against the bank which is responsible for any confusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">I would AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">. The Florida law, amended subsequent to the beginning of this case, provides that: \u201cA financing statement sufficiently shows the name of the debtor if it gives the individual partnership, or corporate names of the debtor, whether or not it adds other trade names or names of partners.\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 679.9-402(6) (West Supp.1980). Leading commentators have inferred that this provision would alter the result of <em>Platt: </em>\u201cWith this provision'on the books, the wise lawyer would advise Henry Platt and his creditors to use \u2018Henry Platt\u2019 as the name on the financing statement.\u201d White &amp; Summers, <em>supra, </em>at 958. Although not the law in any state, the official <em>comment </em>to the revision behind this new Florida provision provides some insight on this situation: \u201cTrade names are deemed to be too uncertain and likely not to be known to be the basis for a filing system.\u201d UCC \u00a7 9-402, comment 7,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">. The majority relies heavily on <em>Siljeg v. National Bank of Commerce, </em>509 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir. 1975), as a case where a filing under a name that is not the true name was potentially sufficient. That case, however, presented a closer question than the issue in this case. In <em>Siljeg, </em>the debtor had upon a merger taken the name of the firm with which it merged. Although the debtor wanted to take back its former name and the legally proper steps to change the name were not followed, the Secretary of State issued a certificate erroneously certifying that the former name survived the merger and the records of the Secretary of State were altered to reflect the former name as the legal name. Thus, it was possible that the debtor in <em>Siljeg always used as its corporate name </em>an ostensibly correct yet legally flawed name. In the present case, no one has ever contended that \u201cElite Boats, Division of Glaseo, Inc.\u201d was a legal name as opposed to a trade name. And in any event, <em>Siljeg </em>remanded for consideration of the fact question of whether this situation was \u201cseriously misleading,\u201d a procedure the present majority finds unnecessary in its reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">. This is particularly true with regards to the trustee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">In this regard, the trustee in bankruptcy must be deemed to stand in the shoes of the most favored creditor, not simply one who could\u2014 by virtue of his dealings with the debtor acting under his trade name \u2014 be held to a semblance of knowledge of the true facts; even such a creditor, knowing how UCC \u00a7 9-402 reads, might never search the filings under the trade name. That is to say, the trustee is more than a subsequent creditor seeking to build up his own equities at the expense of good faith creditors. Here the assignee of the filing creditor seeking to be secured over others, engaged in the financing business so that it should surely be familiar with the requirements of the Code, must be held to substantial compliance with the notice statute. Filing under the trade name only, we hold, was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\"><em>In re Leichter, </em>471 F.2d at 787-88 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1179-10\">. The bank\u2019s argument that the filing officer should have recognized that there were two names on the form actually cuts against the bank. If it is so easy to see that \u201cElite Boats\u201d is not a legal name then there is no reason or excuse for the bank\u2019s failure to submit the debtor\u2019s name as simply \u201cGlaseo, Inc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
