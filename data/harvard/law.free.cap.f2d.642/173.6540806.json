The Evanses contend that Adams promised to correct certain deficiencies in the property if they purchased it, that he failed to do so, and that, indeed, he never intended to do so. On the basis of these contentions, the Ev-anses filed suit against Adams in a Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>state court in July 1975, alleging breaches of contract and warranty, fraudulent misrepresentation, and violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The Evans-es requested a jury trial and sought both actual and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\">In September 1977, however, before the case was tried, Adams filed a bankruptcy petition and was duly declared bankrupt. The filing of the petition apparently stayed the state proceeding. The Evanses filed a proof of claim against Adams in the bankruptcy court for $41,000, the amount allegedly due them on their suit arising out of the duplex transaction, but they objected to the discharge of the claim. The court scheduled a hearing in January 1979 to determine whether the claim should be discharged, and counsel for both Adams and the Evanses presented themselves to argue the issues involved. The court, however, without reaching the merits of the Evanses\u2019 claim, decided that it was not allowable under section 57(d) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 93(d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for that reason was not dischargeable. The effect of that decision is that Adams remains liable for any judgment that may be rendered against him in the state court suit, the stay of which the bankruptcy court order dissolved, notwithstanding his declaration of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">The court initially found, and it is not disputed, that the claim at issue was \u201ccontingent or unliquidated,\u201d as not yet adjudicated by the state court. Under section 63(a) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a), at least most such claims may be \u201cproved,\u201d as is prerequisite for discharge. Under section 63(d), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(d), however, contingent or unliquidated claims that have been proved but have not been allowed under section 57(d) are deemed not proved and, indeed, not even provable. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-7\">That an unliquidated or contingent claim shall not be allowed unless liquidated or the amount thereof estimated in the manner and within the time directed by the court; and such claim shall not be allowed if the court shall determine that it is not capable of liquidation or of reasonable estimation or that such liquidation or estimation would unduly delay the administration of the estate or any proceeding under this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">In deciding not to allow the Evanses\u2019 claim, the bankruptcy court found both that the claim was \u201cnot capable of liquidation or of reasonable estimation\u201d and that \u201csuch liquidation or estimation would unduly delay the administration of the estate.\u201d The court did not elaborate further on the basis for its decision. Adams appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court, which affirmed the former; and Adams now appeals to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">Although this court has not heretofore had occasion to fashion a standard for reviewing bankruptcy court decisions on whether to allow claims under section 57(d), the prevailing rule appears to be that such decisions are reviewable only for abuse of discretion. <em>SEC v. An-Cor Oil Co., </em>604 F.2d 114, 121 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>In re Cartridge Television, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 1388 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>see In re William Rakestrow Co., </em>450 F.2d 6, 9 (9th Cir. 1971); 3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 502.03 (15th ed. 1980); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 57.15[4] (14th ed. 1977). While the latitude of the court\u2019s discretion to disallow claims is therefore broad, it is not unlimited. <em>See Schaefer v. Smith, </em>469 F.2d 1256 (10th Cir. 1972); <em>In re William Rakestrow Co., supra. </em>In the present case we conclude that the bounds of the court\u2019s discretion were transgressed. On the record before us, the court\u2019s decision that liquidation of the Evanses\u2019 claim would unduly delay the administration of the estate, and perforce its decision that the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>was not capable of liquidation, cannot stand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">First, the record reveals no reason why the court could not itself have liquidated the claim without precipitating \u201cundue delay.\u201d The legal issues involved, presented in a pretrial order, were all fairly routine. While it may have been true at the time that some of the law surrounding the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act was unsettled, the possible difficulty of legal issues to be decided does not, in and of itself, excuse a court from deciding them. The pretrial order also showed that only three witnesses were to be called, two of them parties. The Evanses conceded at oral argument before this court, moreover, that the case would require only a day or two to try. While it is possible that docket pressure would not have permitted the bankruptcy court to undertake a proceeding of even so short a duration while the parties were then before it, the record does not disclose why it could not have done so at a future date without \u201cunduly\u201d delaying the administration of the estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">Nor does the record disclose why, even if the court could not itself readily have liquidated the claim, the court could not simply have let the state court in which the Evans-es had brought their suit decide the case and so liquidate it. That suit has been pending in the state court well over three years when the bankruptcy court rendered its decision \u2014 and over two years when the bankruptcy petition was filed and the state proceedings thereby apparently stayed; thus, the suit may well have enjoyed sufficient precedence on the state court docket that it could have been adjudicated before Adams\u2019 third-party suit,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for which the estate was being held open, was resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">Nevertheless, we are aware that the bankruptcy court may have had valid reasons for deciding that liquidation of the claim would engender undue delay and therefore that the claim should not be allowed. The court, however, did not apprise us in its opinion of any such reasons. And since we can discern none from our independent review of the record, we must conclude that the court abused its discretion in disallowing the claim. Thus, the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, which also discloses no factual basis for that decision, is REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">. Since Adams\u2019 bankruptcy case commenced prior to October 1, 1979, the effective date of most of the provisions of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, all proceedings related to his case are, by the terms of the 1978 Code itself, governed by prior law. <em>See In re Schwab, </em>613 F.2d 1279, 1280-81 n.1 (5th Cir. 1980). All statutory references, therefore, are to the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 and its codification, both of which were repealed by the 1978 Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">. We do not reach the question whether the court abused its discretion in deciding that the claim was not capable of reasonable estimation and that such estimation would cause undue delay. We note, however, that the Evanses estimated the amount due them to be $41,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">. It appears, after the fact, that the estate is even now still open \u2014 two years after the court\u2019s decision to disallow the Evanses\u2019 claim \u2014 because Adams is a plaintiff in a suit against another party, the potential recovery from which will become part of the estate, and it strains credulity to suppose that the court could not in a two-year period have found time to adjudicate the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1160-13\"><em>.See </em>n.3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
