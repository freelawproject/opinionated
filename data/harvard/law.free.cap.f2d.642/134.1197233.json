See Fed.R.Civ.Pro. Rule 12(b)(6). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Wright, who is presently incarcerated in a New Mexico state prison, brings this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the defendant El Paso County Jail, El Paso County Sheriff (by title and a name) and \u201cother responsible parties\u201d alleging they: (1) negligently and deliberately failed to protect him from attacks by fellow inmates (Counts I and III), and (2) forced him to live under crowded and inhumane conditions (Count II), in violation of his constitutional rights. In establishing the factual bases for his claims, Wright, a black, alleges<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that, while detained at the El Paso County Jail: (1) in December, 1977, he was attacked by several Mexican-American inmates because he testified against another Mexican-American in a suit concerning a previous stabbing incident; (2) he notified county jail personnel that his life was in danger, but no precautions were taken; (3) in February, 1978, he was again attacked by Mexican-American inmates, again stemming from his earlier testimony, and was forced to undergo surgery as a result; and (4) the jail was infested with lice, rats, and roaches, and was so overcrowded that he had to sleep on the floor. Wright seeks <em>inter alia </em>$100,000 for actual damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">On motion of the defendant sheriff, the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.Pro. Rule 12(b)(6). The plaintiff appeals the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). A pro se prisoner complaint, such as this, is to be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Miller v. Stanmore, </em>636 F.2d 986, 992 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Taylor v. Gibson, </em>529 F.2d 709, 714 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">In light of this standard of review, we hold that the allegations of Wright\u2019s complaint that the defendants negligently <em>and deliberately </em>failed to protect him from attack by fellow inmates and forced him to live under crowded and inhumane conditions are sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 based on federal eighth amendment constitutional deprivations.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">A section 1983 plaintiff must prove both (1) deprivation of a federal constitutional or legal right, see <em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150, 90 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>1598, 1604, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) which (2) resulted from the sort of abuse of government power that is necessary to raise an ordinary tort by a government agent to the stature of a violation of the Constitution. <em>Suthoff v. Yazoo City Industrial Development Corporation, </em>637 F.2d 337, 340 (5th Cir. 1981), <em>rehearing denied, </em>642 F.2d 822 (5th Cir. 1981). Confinement under conditions in which the prisoner is constantly subjected to the threat of violence by fellow prisoners or must live in overcrowded and unhealthy quarters may constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>636 F.2d 1364, 1373-74 (5th Cir. 1981) (En Banc). In order to state a \u00a7 1983 cause of action against prison officials based on a constitutional deprivation resulting from cruel and unusual punishment, there must be at least some allegation of a conscious or callous indifference to a prisoner\u2019s rights, thus raising the tort to constitutional stature. See <em>Thomas v. Estelle, </em>603 F.2d 488, 490 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Fielder </em>v. <em>Bosshard, </em>590 F.2d 105, 109 (5th Cir. 1979). The prisoner plaintiff\u2019s pro se complaint sufficiently satisfies these threshold requirements such that it cannot be seen from the face of the complaint that he can prove no set of facts entitling him to relief under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We hold that the district court improperly dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and, therefore, REVERSE AND REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\">. In addition to his original complaint, Wright filed \u2014 in response to the defendant sheriffs motion for a more definite statement \u2014 a handwritten statement labeled a \u201cMotion in Support of 1983 42 U.S.C. Civil Complaint,\u201d further detailing the factual bases for his claims. Due to the liberal consideration accorded pro se pleadings, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), we consider this \u201cMotion\u201d an amendment to Wright\u2019s original complaint. <em>See McGruder v. Phelps, </em>608 F.2d 1023, 1025 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\">. Wright also requested the dismissal of all pending charges against him and \u201cimmunity from further subjection to the El Paso, County Jail.\u201d Whether the latter request should be liberally construed as a request for injunctive relief need not be decided since both it and the former request were rendered moot by Wright\u2019s conviction on the charges then pending and his incarceration at the New Mexico state prison. Nevertheless, Wright still has standing to seek damages arising out of the civil rights violations alleged to have occurred during his stay at the El Paso County Jail. <em>See Rhodes v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>477 F.2d 347, 348 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. The magistrate, in his report and recommendation, incorrectly suggests that the Sheriff of El Paso County is not subject to liability under \u00a7 1983. The sheriff is not immune from a \u00a7 1983 damages suit brought against him in his official capacity, since in essence the suit is against the governmental unit of which the officer is an agent, and the county itself is not immune from a damages suit. See <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, </em>619 F.2d 391, 403-404 (5th Cir. 1980). If sued in his individual capacity, otherwise, the sheriff may avoid \u00a7 1983 liability to the extent that he has available to him a qualified, good faith immunity. See <em>Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 98 S.Ct. 855 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">With regard to the other defendants, it may be appropriate on remand \u2014 especially considering the liberal treatment due pro se complaints, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 521, 92 S.Ct. 594, 596, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) \u2014 to allow the plaintiff to amend his complaint to change the defendant El Paso County Jail to El Paso County and to name the \u201cresponsible parties\u201d as their actual identities become available through discovery. See Fed.R.Civ.Proc. Rule 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
