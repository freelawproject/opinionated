See Miss.Code \u00a7 59-9-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-24\">Accepting the validity of the petitioner\u2019s assertion solely for the purpose of determining the jurisdictional issue presented on appeal, we conclude that the gravamen of our original holding need not be altered:</p>\n<p id=\"b928-25\">The allegations of the complaint \u2014 (a) that public and private persons conspired to misuse a municipality\u2019s expropriation powers, (b) through the municipality\u2019s institution of eminent domain proceedings with no intent to condemn, and (c) but solely in order to coerce the private landowners to sell their property at a price far below value to co-conspirator entities not a party to the condemnation proceedings \u2014 are sufficient to state a claim of \u00a7 1983 federal jurisdiction for deprivation under color of state law of individual federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-26\">The petitioners again urge the panel to follow the opinions of two other circuits, <em>Beistline v. City of San Diego, </em>256 F.2d 421 (9th Cir. 1958), <em>cert. denied </em>358 U.S. 865, 79 S.Ct. 96, 3 L.Ed.2d 98 (1958), and <em>Warring-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number><em>ton Sewer Company v. Tracey, </em>463 F.2d 771 (3d Cir. 1972). However, as we noted in the original panel opinion, both of those opinions are distinguishable from the situation presented on the instant appeal: in neither <em>Beistline </em>nor <em>Warrington </em>did the property owner allege that the defendant expropriating body <em>misused </em>its coercive powers by instituting condemnation proceedings in order to force the price down for the benefit of non-parties, without the condemnor having any intention actually to expropriate the land for public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
