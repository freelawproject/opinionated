The conspiracy resulted in the murder of the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-27\">It was charged that appellant paid the officers to move the prisoner into a cell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>where appellant\u2019s coconspirators could attack and kill him for appellant\u2019s personal reasons. The two correctional officers of the jail which appellant was alleged to have bribed were acquitted upon trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Appellant now appeals his sentence on the ground that the acquittal of the two jail employees removed state action from the case and therefore there could be no federal offense under \u00a7 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">This contention must fail. It is well established that the acquittal of coconspirators or coparticipants in a crime does not prove that the crime did not occur. <em>Rosecrans v. United States, </em>378 F.2d 561, 567 (5th Cir. 1967). Nor does it bar the United States government from charging that appellant conspired with the acquitted state employees. <em>Standefer v. United States, </em>447 U.S. 10, 100 S.Ct. 1999, 64 L.Ed.2d 689 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Appellant pleaded guilty after a thorough hearing and under a plea bargain agreement. The acquittal of the two jailers, therefore, does not control his admission of guilt of the offense of conspiring with the two correctional officers and others to bring about the harm to the murdered prisoner. As Judge Phillips said in <em>Rosecrans, supra, </em>\u201cThe subsequent acquittal of . . . codefendants does not constitute a refutation of Rosecrans\u2019 guilt, which he solemnly admitted by his plea of guilty. Such acquittal may have been the result of the failure of the United States to produce evidence at the trial satisfying the jury of codefendants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, or because of other reasons.\u201d 378 F.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
