Massey stricken off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-14\">Judgment was entered March 14, 1882, in favor of F. T. Clarke, assignee of Jerome Tan turn, against C. T. Massey and Mary H. Massey, for $512 73, upon a single bill, under seal, dated January 21, 1882, for $488 31, payable ninety days after December 13, 1881, with five per cent., attorney\u2019s collection fees, &amp;c., and containing a warrant of attorney to confess judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-15\">The Court below, after hearing depositions taken under this rule, May 31,1882, discharged the rule, and made the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-16\">\u201cThe lien of this judgment against Mary H.

Dig., 2115,) provides only for an <em>appeal </em>from a refusal to <em>open </em>a judgment. If this Court can take cognizance of an appeal to <em>strilce off &amp; </em>judgment, it must be brought up by <em>certiorari </em>and not by writ of error.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b398-9\">January 29, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AX-\">\u2014 Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"ADeG\">The main complaint is the refusal to strike off this judgment. If there be no error in this, there is none in refusing to set aside the <em>fi. fa., </em>nor in permitting the property named to be seized in execution. This is not an appeal from a refusal to open the judgment, but a writ of error for not granting the relief stated. The depositions taken are not legally before us, and cannot be considered. They are no part of the record to be reviewed on this writ. The record shows a judgment valid and regular on its face. The refusal to strike off was, therefore, clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
