K. Stewart &amp; Co. against Universal Insurance Company of Philadelphia, upon a policy of fire insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-13\">W. K. Stewart <em>&amp; </em>Co. were the occupiers of a certain building situate in Parnassus borough, Westmoreland county,,as \u201ca country store, sleeping-room, and dwelling-house.\u201d On October 13, 1877, the Universal Fire Insurance Company issued to them a policy of insurance upon the stock in said store for the sum of $1,000, for the term of one year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-14\">By the policy it was specified that \u201cno agent is empowered to waive any of the conditions of this policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>either before or after loss, without special authority in writing from the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">Certain provisions and conditions were attached to it, the eighth being as follows: \u201c It is hereby expressly provided and mutually agreed that no suit or action against this company for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery unless such suit or action shall be commenced within six months next after the loss shall occur, and should any suit or action be commenced after the expiration of the aforesaid six months, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed as conclusive evidence against the validity of such claim, any statute of limitation to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">On 30th March, 1878, a fire occurred by which the stock of goods insured was destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-8\">Suit was brought on the policy on 7th March, 1879. The defendant pleaded the general issue and specially the eighth section of the provisions of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-9\">Upon the trial in the Court below, before Blair, J., William K. Stewart, one of the plaintiffs, testified, under objection: \u201cAt one time, after the loss, Mr. Cross, the president of the company at that time, came to my house to see me. It was on the 14th of June, 1878, that he came to my place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-10\">When he came into the store \u2014 another store that I had set up after the fire \u2014 there were two or three persons in the store, two or three customers \u2014 he said he was Cross, and wanted to see me about our loss by the fire. He called me to the back part of the store ; he said he didn\u2019t want persons to hear our conversation, or something like that. We went back there and he told me he had just stopped off to see us about our loss by fire at Parnassus. He told me he had been up north collecting money, or trying to collect it, but had come very poor speed; and that he wanted to raise money to pay our loss. He said they were scarce of funds. That is about all he said then. He said he was around insuring, too; taking risks of insurance ; and asked me if I didn\u2019t want to insure again. I told him I believed I would. He said to give him a chance, that he would do as well as any other person. I told him if the company was responsible and in good standing I would just as leave let him take the risk a's any person else ; so he took it. Before he left he got out the risk, and told me if we wouldn\u2019t bring suit that we would get our money; he told me not to bring suit against the company and he said we would get our money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>He said they were short of funds. He said he was out up north collecting; up the valley I understood him; up north, is what he said. I took additional insurance at that time. I took $1,000 on the stock and store, and $2,000 on the dwelling. I have the policies in my pocket here. He took my note at that time. The premium came to $44. I said I did not feel like paying this, being as they owed me. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want any money.\u201d He said, \u201cWe will allow that to stand on your loss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">\u201cThere was also another provision in the contract of insurance which required that a suit must be instituted within six months after the time of the loss, otherwise there could be no recovery. That provision in the contract has not been complied with. It was competent for the parties to make a contract of this kind, if they saw fit; and if the plaintiff, without any sufficient excuse therefor, neglected to bring his suit within the time limited by his contract, he could not recover. The question then recurs, whether there is anything in the evidence in the cause that would relieve the plaintiff from these provisions in the contract and enable him to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">The provisions to which we have alluded are in favor of the company, and compliance with them might be waived or dispensed with by the company; or [the company might enter into a new contract or make a new promise by which it would be bound.] Here, you will observe, that a notice of loss and a proof of loss were sent within the time, but the proof of loss was deficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-8\">It is alleged by the plaintiff that the president of the company, some time in June, 1878, came to his place of residence, and, after first inquiring about the loss that had been suffered, stated to him that he wanted to pay it; that he was scarce of funds, and had been out on a collecting tour, but that the loss would be paid. He then asked him to insure again, which W. K. Stewart did, taking two policies, aggregating the sum of $3,000, for which he was to pay a premium of $44. And he says the president of the company agreed to charge him with that $44 on the amount due from the company for the loss that had been sustained. There is also a certain correspondence between the plaintiff and the company, which has been offered in evidence, and is part of the evidence in the cause. We have already said to you that it was competent for the defendant to dispense with compliance with these provisions in the contract, on the part of the plaintiff, or to make a new promise of payment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>which, in view of the obligations previously assumed, would be binding upon the company and would enable the plaintiff to recover. The credibility of the witness is for you. If you are satisfied from the evidence of Mr. Stewart and Mr. Sproul, and from the letters and correspondence that have been offered in evidence, that the company did dispense with compliance with these provisions of the contract, or [made a new promise, through its president, to pay the loss, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.] If you are not satisfied that there was such a promise or waiver of compliance by the company, then there can be no recovery in this cause. If you should find for the plaintiff, he would be entitled to recover the amount of the policy with interest from the time that it should have been paid. If we recollect the terms of the policy aright, the money was not to be paid until ninety days after the proof of the loss had been furnished, and in one of the letters sent by the president of the company to the plaintiff, he states that he has so many days yet in which to pay him. That is the time then from which the interest upon the sum would begin to run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the Court to charge the jury: That the conditions in this policy, that suit must be brought within six months from the date of loss, and that formal proofs of loss of a certain kind must be delivered to the company within a special time, &amp;c., are conditions solely for the benefit of the company, and any or all of such conditions may be waived by the company, and whether or not' such conditions were waived, is entirely a question of fact for the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">And the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the Court to charge :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\"><em>First. </em>That the plaintiff cannot recover under the evidence in this case, because the suit was brought more than six months after the loss by fire, contrary to the eighth section of the conditions of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\"><em>Second. </em>That even if the president of the defendant company did say as testified by W. K Stewart, it would not be any waiver by the company of the eighth provision of the conditions of the policy ; that the alleged conversation did not sufficiently show that there was any waiver of the eighth condition of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-10\"><em>Third. </em>That the plaintiffs under all the evidence are not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-11\">In answer to the above points, the Court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-12\">\u201cIn so far as these points are consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>instructions we have given in our general charge they are affirmed. In so iar as they are inconsistent with these instructions, they are refused or regarded as immaterial. (Counsel for defendant requests specific answers to the points submitted by him, to which the Court replied as follows:)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-4\">We would say that in this case there was no argument to the jury, and the Court was called upon, this Saturday evening, .to charge you immediately after the closing of the evidence in the case, and there was, therefore, not sufficient time or opportunity to draw up specific answers in writing to the several propositions submitted on the part of the plaintiff and the defendant; otherwise we would have been pleased to answer them in writing. This is the reason why we have given oral instructions in answer to these points instead of putting them in writing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the charge and the answers to the points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">February 18, 1882.
