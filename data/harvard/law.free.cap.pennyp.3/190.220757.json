J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-23\">On February 22, 1881, Mrs. Ellen O\u2019Hara went from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>her home, in Trunkeyville, to Oil City, on one of the defendant\u2019s passenger trains. Her husband, who was a trackman on a section of the road, had obtained for her \u25a0 an employ\u00e9\u2019s pass through the section foreman. The pass was in the following form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">\u201cPittsburgh, Titusville <em>&amp; </em>Buffalo Railway. Trip Pass.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">Pass Mrs. Hugh O\u2019Hara, on account of---, from Oil City to Trunkeyville, when countersigned by J. F.

On the afternoon of the same day, she took the regular passenger train.at Oil City to return to Trunkeyville. At President station, thirteen miles above Oil City, the regular train, on which Mrs. O\u2019Hara was riding, was run into by a special train, the engine of which plunged into the rear coach, where Mrs. O\u2019Hara was seated, and by the escaping steam and the shock of the concussion, she, among other passengers, was injured. The evidence showed that the special train had been chartered to take a funeral party from Oil City to Tionesta, and that it left Oil City after the express, or regular train, which was five minutes slow. A rule of the company provided that every following train should keep at least five minutes behind the time of the leading train. A passenger testified that at curves in the river he saw, a number of times, the express train ahead. An engineer of a standing train testified that he threw up his arms to warn the special train to go slow, and that his signal was disregarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-14\">The plaintiff presented the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-15\">1. \u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff, Mrs. O\u2019Hara, was injured while riding as a passenger on defendants\u2019 road, by reason of a collision caused by the negligence of the defendant company or its servants, she is entitled to recover damages sufficient to compensate her for the privation and inconvenience she has been subjected to, and for the pain and suffering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>bodily and mental, she has already experienced, and is likely yet to experience during the remainder of her life.\u201d Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">(First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">2. \u201cThe release of damages contained in the pass given in evidence will not relieve the defendant company from liability for damages occasioned by the negligence of the company or its agents.\u201d Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">(Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">The defendant presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the following points</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-10\">1. \u201cIt being the uncontroverted evidence that Mrs. O\u2019Hara was not an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, and that she was traveling upon defendant\u2019s railroad upon a free pass, for which she had given no consideration, such pass having been issued in violation of law, of which the said plaintiff was presumed to have notice, gave her no right to a. passage upon the train, and in the eye of the law she was a trespasser thereon, and no recovery can be had in this action.\u201d Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-11\">(Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-12\">4. \u201cThat if Mrs. O\u2019Hara accepted and rode upon a free pass of the description given to employ\u00e9s engaged on and about defendant\u2019s railway, and upon such pass was printed the condition that the person using the same assumed all risk of accident and damage to person or property, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-13\">(Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-14\">The Court charged, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows: \u2018 \u2018 The defendant claims that the plaintiff cannot maintain this suit because she was not an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, and was traveling on a free pass, issued in violation of law. ... We say to you that this is not a defense. Even if. we adopt the presumption that Mrs. O\u2019Hara was bound to know the law, she held a free pass signed by the superintendent of the road, countersigned by the foreman of the track section. The conductor of the train, whose peculiar duty is to determine the right of a passenger on his train, recognized her right to a seat under the pass, and having done so, it is not for the defendant to urge that the pass was issued in violation of law. Defendant also claims that as Mrs. O\u2019Hara accepted a pass of the kind given to employ\u00e9s, she occupied the position of an employ\u00e9 so far as the cause of action is concerned, and cannot recover for the injury occasioned by the fault of another employ\u00e9 of the road, in the absence of evidence showing the neglect of the superintending officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>or officers of the defendant. As to this, we say to you that Mrs. O\u2019Hara is not, so far as the evidence shows, in the position of an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, and her right to recover is not to be determined by the same rules as that of an employ\u00e9. W e think, and so instruct you, that Mrs. O\u2019Hara, for anything that appears in the evidence, is to be regarded as a passenger, with the right to recover damages for injuries occasioned by the neglect of the defendant, or its agents or employ\u00e9s, acting within the lines of their general employment, and that, whether the conductor of a special train was or was not managing his train in defiance of the rules of the road, the defendant is liable for the injury resulting from his negligence ; and we further say to you that the conditions on which the pass in this instance was given and accepted do not exempt the defendant from liability for injuries sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the neglect or carelessness of the conductor of the special train.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-6\">March 2, 1882. Verdict for plaintiff for $700, upon which judgment was afterward entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">The defendants thereupon took this writ, assigning for error the answers to the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s respective points and the portion of the charge quoted above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-8\"><em>T.

L., 1874, 25. Act of 1874, P. L., 289. Oreen\u2019s <em>Brices Ultra Vires, </em>362. Allegheny Valley railroad <em>v. </em>McLain, 10 Nor., 442. Huff <em>v. </em>Allegheny Valley railroad., <em>Ibid., </em>458.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-11\">The plaintiff traveling as and exercising and claiming the rights of an employ\u00e9 on the train is estopped from afterwards claiming that she was a regular passenger: Hannels <em>v. </em>Fitch, 8 Barr, 495.- French \u25a0\u00bb. Mehan, 6 Smith, 286. Pringle <em>v. </em>Pringle, 9 <em>Ibid., </em>281. Rankin <em>v. </em>Simpson, 19 Pa. St. 471. The pass and the conditions together amounted simply to permission on the part of agents without authority to ride on the cars at her own risk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-12\">The New York and New Jersey authorities go much further than we ask here. They decide broadly that a gratuitous passenger can limit his liability to any extent: Perkins <em>\u00b6. </em>New York Central R. R. Co., 24 N. Y., 196. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Wells <em>v. </em>New York Central R. R. Co., 24 <em>Ibid., </em>181. Kinney <em>v. </em>Central R. R. Co., 3 Yroom, (N. J.,) 407. Same <em>v. </em>same, <em>Ibid., </em>413.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">It is true that in Penn\u2019a R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Henderson, 51 Penn. St., 315, this Court seems to hold a contrary opinion, but it will be remembered that in the case last mentioned it was held that the plaintiff below was not a gratuitous passenger, but was compelled to go on the train to take care of his cattle, and paid his own fare as a drover in paying the freight charged for his cattle, and that the case finally turned upon this point, although the Court indicated an opinion that even in the case of a free passenger there could be no limit to the liability of a transportation company.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-7\"><em>B.

She bore the written permit of the highest executive officer of the road; and if the conductor, in obedience to the Constitution and statute, had chosen not to recognize it, he could not have ejected her from the train without demanding fare and giving her an opportunity to pay it: Duff <em>v. </em>Allegheny Yalley R. R. Co., 10 Nor. 461.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-9\">The, release of damages printed on the pass does not operate to exempt the plaintiff in error from liability. \u201cCommon carriers cannot so limit their liability by special notice as to relieve themselves from the consequences of their own or their servants\u2019 negligence.\u201d American Express Co. <em>v. </em>The Second National Bank of Titusville, 19 Smith, 395.

Against his extraordinary liability as a common carrier he may protect himself by such a contract, but not from his liability as a simple bailee. Such is the well-settled law of this Commonwealth. It may well be doubted whether the proviso in this pass, being against accidents, can be held applicable at all to cases where the injury has resulted from negligence. If the free pass in this case was unlawful, the conductor should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>have demanded the regular fare, and his not doing so did not make O\u2019Hara or his wife trespassers, or destroy their rights as passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Judgment affirmed in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
