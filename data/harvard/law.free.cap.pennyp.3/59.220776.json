On June 1, 1867, McCandless sold to C. H. Love <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>one hundred and fifty acres of land at Oakdale, Allegheny county, for $15,000, taking a purchase-money mortgage from Love for $10,000. Love laid the property out in lots, in the plan of which lots Nos. 19, 20, 21, and 22 are the property now in dispute. The mortgage not being paid, was foreclosed by McCandless, and the property sold at sheriff\u2019s sale in April, 1876. At this sale Love bought in the lots 19, 20, 21, and 22 in the name of James E. Eiken for $875, and not being able to pay the money, McCandless agreed to take them, and the sheriff\u2019s deed was made to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\">The plaintiff offered in evidence an agreement under seal, dated November 23, 1876, between McCandless and Love, in which the former agreed to sell, <em>inter </em>alia, the lots in dispute to the latter for the sum of $6,716, of which $2,000 was payable February 1, 1877, and the balance April 1, 1877. This agreement provided :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">\u201cAnd it is hereby expressly agreed and understood, that in case the said C. H. Love fails or neglects to pay the said sum of $2,000 on the 1st day of February, 1877, and the balance or remainder of the said purchase money of said lots or pieces of ground on or before the 1st day of April, 1877, then and in that case he, the said C.

Love, together with his wife, shall execute and deliver to the said James McCandless, his heirs, executors, and assigns, a quit claim and release, in due form of law, of all their right, title, interest, and claim of, in, and to the lots or pieces of ground herein mentioned and described.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ay8\">The plaintiff also offered in evidence the following assignment, under seal executed by McCandless, November 24, 1876 :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\"><em>\u201c </em>For value received, I hereby sell, assign, transfer, and set over to S.

The balance of $475 McMurray paid to him May 11, 1876. For these amounts Gill gave receipts as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">\u201cReceived of Mr. John McMurray the sum of four hundred dollars on account of the purchase money of four lots, Nos. 19, 20, 21, and 22, in C.

He put some weather-boarding on a small house on the premises, locked up the house with a pad-lock, repaired the floor, made rails on the property, and put up a fence. He also pried the house up and put posts under it. Gill disappeared September 17, 1877, without having made a deed to McMurray.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-13\">Defendants offered to prove that at the sheriff\u2019s sale on the Love mortgage, a notice was read and served upon the sheriff that the lots did not belong to Love, but were the property of McMurray. Upon objection, the Court rejected the offer, and defendants took an exception (sixth assignment of error).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-14\">Plaintiff offered to prove by C. H. Love, in rebuttal, that he was present at the sheriff\u2019s sale of this property in 1876; that the property was knocked down at his bid in the name of James E. Eiken; that he paid several hundred dollars on account of the bid to the sheriff; that subsequently he entered into an arrangement with James McCandless, the plaintiff in the writ, under which the property was sold, by which James McCandless was to take the sheriff\u2019s deed for this and other property sold at the said sale under the same mortgage, and an arrangement by which McCandless was to take the deed and was to re-convey the lots in controversy in this suit to him, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>to such persons as he might direct; that such agreement was subsequently put in writing, on the 23d of November, 1876, and on the 24th of November, 1876, McCandless conveyed the premises to S. B. W. Gill, with notice of this arrangement between himself and Mr. Love, and, at the same time, assigned the written agreement referred to, which is already in evidence, and that, in pursuance of that agreement, the property was conveyed by S. B. W. Gill to witness, C. H. Love, and a mortgage given for the purchase money by C. H. Love to S. B. W. Gill, and assigned to Thomas J. Kenney, the plaintiff in this suit; that when Gill purchased the property from McCandless in 1876, before the subsequent conveyance to Love, he, Gill, extended the time stipulated in said agreement for the payment of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-4\">The offer was admitted under exception. (Second and seventh assignments of error).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">Plaintiff then testified as to the facts stated in the offer. He said, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">\u201cI found it was going to take a little more time than I supposed.

They never asked any quit-claim deed or anything of the kind of either myself or my wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">The Court thereupon peremptorily instructed the jury to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, to which defendant took an exception.

H. Love, whose title the plaintiff below now owns, the several lots of ground, the right of possession to which forms the subject of the present contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">This agreement was, on th\u00e9 next day after its date, assigned by McCandless to S. B. W. Gill. On the same day of this assignment, McCandless executed to Gill a deed for this property in fee, and on the 12th of May, 1877, Gill conveyed to Love. This brief exhibits a good title in Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Against this, the defendant sets up the following receipts :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">\u201cReceived of John McMunuy the sum of four hundred dollars on account of the purchase money of four lots, Nos. 19, 20, 21, and 22, in C. H. Love\u2019s plan of the McCandless farm, in Oak Dale, Allegheny county, Pa., purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale by James E. Eiken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">\u201c <em>May Ifth, 1876. </em>S. B. W. Gill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201cKeceived, May 11th, 1876, of John McMurray, four hundred and seventy-five dollars in full, balance of the purchase money of the within-mentioned lots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">S. B. W. Gill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">It is contended that these constitute a sufficient agreement to convey under the statute of frauds. This may be admitted; but at that time Gill had no title, hence even his most formal conveyance could not have transferred to his vendee land that confessedly belonged to another person. But, it is urged, on the authority of Clark <em>v. </em>Martin, 13 Wr., 299, and similar cases, that Gill having afterward acquired title from McCandless, that title inured to the benefit of McMurray.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The principle thus stated is undoubtedly a correct one, but it cannot apply in this case, since the day before the deed was executed to Gill the equitable title vested in Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Thus, Gill never had anything but the legal title, and this he held as trustee for Love, the equitable vendee of McCandless. Of this legal title, McMurray, perhaps, might have compelled a conveyance, had he taken the proper steps for that purpose whilst it was still in Gill, but failing so to do, he now stands wholly without right of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">But it is said the agreement between McCandless and Love \"was forfeited in consequence of the non-payment of the purchase money at the time fixed by the terms thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">In order to understand this proposition properly, we transcribe that part of the contract bearing upon this particular point of the case. It is as follows : \u201cAnd it is hereby expressly agreed and understood, that in case said C. H. Love fails or neglects to pay said sum of $2,000 on the 1st day of February, 1877, and the balance or remainder of said purchase money of said lots or pieces of ground on or before the 1st day of April, 1877, then and in that case, he, the said C. H. Love, together writh his wife, shall execute and deliver to the said James McCandless, his heirs, executors, and assigns, a quit claim and release, in due form of law. of all their right, title, interest, and claim of, in, and to the lots or pieces of ground herein mentioned and described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Here we find Love agreeing that, if he did not meet his payments at the time fixed, he would reconvey to Mc-Candless, his heirs, or assigns. The neglect of payment was not, therefore, <em>per se </em>a forfeiture, and whether or not the quit claim or release should be insisted upon, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>pended altogether upon the will of McCandless or Gill, to whom he had assigned. But neither of these parties ever attempted to enforce this part of the contract, and all right and power to do so forever passed from Gill when he accepted Love's mortgage for the purchase money and executed to him the deed of May 12, 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Under the circumstances as above stated, McMurray\u2019s possession, whatever it may have been, amounted to nothing, for it was without right, and was not continued long enough to make title by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
