On October 3, 1881, the petition of Samuel White and Mrs. M. J. White was presented, setting forth, <em>inter alia, </em>a claim of title paramount to and distinct from that of the plaintiffs\u2019 , alleging that the petition for the <em>alias </em>writ was presented without their knowledge, and praying for a stay of said writ until next Argument Court, so that the petition might then be presented to the judge thereof for a rule to show cause why the writ should not be quashed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>or for such order \u201cas may be just and equitable.\u201d Whereupon, execution was stayed, as prayed for, until the next Argument Court, when, on consideration, October 25, 1881, the Court refused to further stay the writ. White and wife then superseded the writ by means of an appeal to and <em>certiorari </em>from the Supreme Court. At May term, 1882, an appeal of White and wife to the Supreme Court was quashed and the record returned. On May 29, 1882, a second <em>pluries </em>writ of <em>habere facias </em>was issued, served, and a levy was made on the personal property of White, and on June 5, 1882, the same was advertised for sale. On June 21, 1882, petition was again made for a stay and stay refused, whereupon White and his wife took this writ of error, assigning for error, <em>inter </em>alia, (1) the decree of August 20, 1881, awarding an <em>alias </em>writ of <em>hob. fac. poss.; </em>(2) the decree of October 25, 1881, refusing to stay the writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-4\"><em>T.

The Court had power to award the writ only \u201con cause shown.\u201d Act of February 1, 1834, Purd. Pig., 536. Not having notice of the decree awarding the <em>alias </em>writ until it was placed in the hands of the sheriff, the decree is absolutely void as to the plaintiffs in error, and restitution should be awarded them: Breading \u00ae.

On application by the plaintiffs in error, before it was executed, the Court inquired into the facts existing when it issued, and refused to stay the writ. This was substantially an order, <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, confirming the previous issuing of the writ. The evidence under which the Court acted is not before us. We will not presume it to have been insufficient to justify the conclusion at which the Court arrived. Care should be taken that no collusions be sanctioned whereby a third person shall obtain possession under the defendant after a judgment in ejectment and before writ of possession be fully executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
