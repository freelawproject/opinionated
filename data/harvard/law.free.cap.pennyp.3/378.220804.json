Plaintiff and defendants entered into a contract, under seal, by which plaintiff assigned to defendants his patent for an improvement in wardrobe bedsteads, and defendants were to manufacture and introduce said bedstead, to term them in their advertisements \u201c The Everitt Bedstead,\u201d to pay plaintiff a royalty of seven per cent, upon the wholesale price received by them, at the end of each mouth, \u201c upon all the said patented bedsteads made and sold by them; \u201d to keep full accounts, and if in default for sixty days, to re-assign the same; any improvements in said bedsteads to be held by the defendants, subject to the terms of the agreement. Defendants \"were in default for sixty days, broke their covenant to- account j ustly, advertised them as the \u201cChampion Folding Bed,\u201d and entered into a fraudulent conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of ail benefit of his own invention, and to appropriate it exclusively to themselves, by purchasing a prior patent, upon which the patent of plaintiff did not infringe, and having it re-issued so as to cover plaintiff\u2019s patent, and secretly assigned to themselves. <em>Held: </em>Affirming the decree of the Court below, that the evidences of fraud were so manifest as to fully justify a court of equity in making a decree for a compulsory assignment to the plaintiff of the original patent, with all the improvements made by the defendants, and also of the reissued patent under which the fraud was attempted to be perpetrated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b374-6\">2.

and the said party of the first part, for himself, his legal representatives and assigns, promises and agrees that at the request and expense of the said parties of the second part, or their assigns, he will obtain letters-patent of the United States for any such improvements made by him, and will execute and deliver proper assignments of the title to said letters-patent to said parties of the second part or their assigns.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\">The bill further averred that, on October 3, 1876, the Hale &amp; Kilburn Manufacturing Company succeeded Hale, Kilburn &amp; Company, and became assignees of the patent and contract; that defendants have made and patented improvements on the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and have made and sold bedsteads under the patent and its improvements, for which they have not accounted to the plaintiff \u2014 the defendants have refused to account or pay ; that they have refused plaintiff access to their books; that they are more than sixty days in default, and that, to defraud plaintiff, they have bought the patent of one Stark, and, as an excuse to hinder and defraud plaintiff, have caused a suit to be brought in the name of Stark to enjoin their use of plaintiff\u2019s patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">The bill prayed for an account, a re-assignment of said patent and improvements and rights thereunder, and for an injunction to restrain defendants from disposing of said patents and improvements, and from manufacturing and selling thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">The answer, which was filed November 22, 1878, and amended December 10, 1878, admitted the averments of the bill as to the plaintiff\u2019s patent; the contract with Hale, Kilburn &amp; Co. ; the succession of the Hale &amp; Kilburn Manufacturing Company ; submits whether their patents are for improvements to the plaintiff\u2019s patented process ; denies that plaintiff has been refused access to the books, or that defendants have failed to account, and annexes an account to the answer, showing a balance due to the plaintiff ; admits that the defendants are in default in payment to the plaintiff; offers to re-assign the patent; avers that they secured the control of the Stark and Maine patents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>in good faith and with the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, and charges that plaintiff\u2019s patent is void for want of novelty and utility. The answer then submits to a decree in favor of the plaintiff except under the s\u00e9cond prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">After a hearing on bill and answer, the Court, on December 9, 1878, appointed C. Stuart Patterson, examiner and master, and made an interlocutory decree directing, first, a reference to the master to take an account of all and every the bedsteads and furniture manufactured after April 16,1874; second, an injunction as prayed for ; third, a reference to the master \u201cto take testimony upon the matters contained in the second prayer of the bill,\u2019\u2019etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-7\">On May 5, 1879, an amendment to the bill was filed, which averred that there was such a relation between plaintiff and defendants that the latter could not, \u201c during the existence thereof, acquire title to said Stark\u2019s patent adversely\u201d to plaintiff, and prays that the defendants be decreed to assign to plaintiff Stark\u2019s patents and all rights thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-8\">The Master found, <em>inter </em>alia, the facts as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-9\">On November_19, 1873, the plaintiff filed in the Patent Office of the United States his petition for letters-patent for an improvement in wardrobe bedsteads. His application was rejected on November 22, 1873, again on December 3, 1873, and again on December 12, 1873, and as grounds of objection, the Patent Office Examiner referred to prior patents supposed to cover the same subject-matter, granted on August 22, 1865, to A. Stark ; on June 15, 1865, to S. 0. Maine; on September 6, 1870, to Davis &amp; Romminger, and on May 28, 1872, to H. Goodrich. The objections of the Examiner were, however, overcome by successive amendments to the specifications of claim, and on March 24, 1874, letters-patent were granted to the plaintiff, numbered 148,940.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-10\">On August 16, 1874, the plaintiff entered into a written contract with the defendants, Hale, Kilburn &amp; Co., as set forth in the bill. The contract was drawn by the solicitors of the defendants. There is nothing to show that plaintiff, as an inducement to the making of the contract, made any representation to the defendants in regard to the existence or nature of prior and subsisting patents for the same or a similar subject-matter. After a search had been made in the Patent Office, the contract was recorded. The defendants had taken the opinion of patent solicitors in Washington, and were advised that plaintiff\u2019s patent did not infringe upon the Maine patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-11\">Shortly after the execution of the agreement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>plaintiff, the defendants appear to have begun the manufacture of his beds, and their first sale was made in September, 1874. On October 3, 1876, the Hale <em>&amp; </em>Kilburn Manufacturing Company, also a defendant, was organized, and was thenceforth successor to and substituted for Hale, Kilburn &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\">\u25a0 The defendants appear to have made regular monthly payments on account of plaintiff\u2019s royalty until January, 1877, when they demanded and he refused to give receipts in full settlement to date ; and during some portion of the period before 1877, the plaintiff seems to have been in their debt, according to their statement of account. In July, 1877, defendants refused to pay royalties on certain styles of bedsteads, which they distinguished as Nos. 10 and 11, although the bedsteads so numbered were marked as being made under plaintiff\u2019s patent. Defendants afterwards withdrew their objections, and until April, 1878, the royalty seems to have been paid with regularity. Defendants kept a book for plaintiff\u2019s inspection, but did not permit him to have access to the books of original entry. From the account, as furnished by defendants, they omitted the springs, which are an essential part of the bedsteads, and the bedsteads furnished with ebony or mirrors they understated the prices, and made a uniform and unauthorized deduction by way of discount from the wholesale prices actually received by them. The account so stated was the basis of defendants\u2019 payment of royalty. The defendants persistently violated that part of the agreement which provided that the bedstead should be known as the \u201cEveritt Bedstead,\u201d announcing it in their advertisements as the \u201cChampion Folding Bed.\u201d As the sales of the bedstead increased, the defendants seemed to have formed the purpose of compelling his reduction and ultimate relinquishment of the royalty. In July, 1877, the defendant, C. Kilburn, asked the plaintiff to reduce his royalty from seven to three and one half per cent. ; and on his refusal, Mr. Kilburn threatened that the defendants would stop the manufacture, or make only enough to hold the bed and keep others from making it. In the summer of 1877, Mr. Kilburn told Asher B. Stevens, a mechanical inventor, that defendants were paying a heavy royalty, and directed him to get up a new bedstead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">Prior to December, 1876, the defendants had consulted and retained as counsel Mr. D. Rodney Mason, who testified that he had advised the defendants how they could manufacture the folding bed and avoid any pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>tense of infringing upon the plaintiff\u2019s patent. In the latter part of December, 1877, Mr. Stevens, having com-, pleted the model of his proposed bedstead, showed it, at . defendants\u2019 request, to Mr. Mason ; and on February 28, 1878, Mr. Mason wrote to defendants, advising them to discontinue the use of the Everitt patent, and expressing his approval of Stevens\u2019 invention, as avoiding any infringement upon Mr. Everitt. In the course of his examination of the subject of folding bedsteads, Mr. Stevens saw a drawing of the Stark bedstead, and showed the. drawing to defendants, who directed him to open communication with Mr. Stark, but, before he had accomplished that, Mr. Stark came to defendants\u2019 office, having seen their advertisement. Mr. Mason testified that the plaintiff\u2019s patent did not infringe upon the Stark patent, as it had been originally granted, but that the Stark patent was susceptible of being re-issued in such shape as would entirely cover the Everitt bedstead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-4\">On February 23, 1878, defendants bought his patent from Mr. Stark for $1,000, not for the purpose of protecting the Everitt patent against a possible infringement, but for the purpose of so using the Stark patent as to defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim for royalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">Mason then drew a petition for re-issue to the defendants of the Stark patent, and a formal assignment of the patent to the company defendant. On February 28,1878,. defendants wrote to Mr. Mason that \u201cMr. Stevens left for Washington last night, and took with him Stark\u2019s papers and check. You understand, we suppose, that if Stark\u2019s patent can be made to cover Everitt, we do not care to make any alterations in the bed, or adopt any of Mr. Stevens\u2019 plans. The bed is j ust splendid as it is, and we hope you can fix us all right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">On March 6, 1878, defendants, not having r\u00f3corded the former Stark papers, had Stark to sign a petition for a re-issue, in which the specifications were drawn so as to cover the Everitt patent. This application for a re-issue was granted April 9, 1878. The old assignment from Stark to defendants had been destroyed, and a new: assignment to defendants was drawn and executed by Stark, but was not recorded until December, 1878. On March 4, 1878, defendants wrote to Mr. Mason, suggest^ ing that he should notify them that they infringed on Stark\u2019s patent ;\u2022 and afterwards wrote several letters relating to the same subject. On April 10, 1878, Mason wrote to defendants, as attorney for Stark, charging them with infringing the Stark patent in manufacturing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201c Everitt bedstead.\u201d This letter was shown by defendants to plaintiff, and was used by them as a reason for \u25a0 refusing to pay the plaintiff his monthly installment of royalty then due. The plaintiff declined to recognize Stark\u2019s claim, and the defendants made him a small payment on account of his royalty. Other letters passed between defendants and Mr. Mason, which were not shown to plaintiff. On May 22, 1879, a meeting was held at the office of E. C. Mitchell, who had been retained as counsel for plaintiff. There were present: Messrs. Connolly and-Mitchell, as his counsel; the defendants, with Mr. Otterson, who was not aware of the relations between his clients and Stark and Mason, as their counsel; and Mr. Mason, really counsel for the defendants but professing to represent the adverse interest of Stark. At this meeting, Mr. Kilburn denied that defendants owned .the Stark patent, and Mr. Mason offered, on Stark\u2019s behalf, to grant a license under the Stark patent, in consideration of a five per cent, royalty, which would have to be deducted from plaintiff\u2019s seven per cent, royalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">On July 8, 1878, Mr. Mason, as counsel for Stark, filed in the Circuit Court of the United States a bill in equity, in which Stark was plaintiff, and the Hale and Kilburn Manufacturing Company was defendant, for an injunction restraining defendants from the further manufacture of bedsteads, for an account, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">The master further finds that defendants are in default, and have continued in default for more than sixty days before the bill was filed; that they have obtained and now hold patents for improvements in wardrobe bedsteads other than those above mentioned, and that the defendants\u2019 negotiations with Stark were concealed from the plaintiff ; that he was not offered an opportunity to participate in the purchase of the Stark patent, and that the defendants secretly purchased that patent in their own right for the purpose of using it as a means to compel the plaintiff either to abandon his patent, or to so modify his contract as to let them manufacture under his patent for a diminished royalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">The report concluded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-7\">\u201c The relation of confidence between the parties created by the contract for the manufacture and sale by the defendants, under the plaintiff\u2019s patent, the defendants\u2019 covenants to promote the sale and introduction of the bedsteads made under the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and to advertise the bedsteads under the plaintiff\u2019s name, and the defendants\u2019 fraud, beginning in their suppression of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s name in their advertisements, continuing in their false accounts, and fitly concluded by their secret purchase of a prior patent, their re-issue of that patent in such shape as to cover the plaintiff\u2019s patent, and their sham suit for infringement against themselves, all combine to make a case which merits the severest condemnation which a court of equity can impose. The master reports that the defendants be directed to assign to the plaintiff the Stark patent, and all their rights thereunder. The defendants cannot be permitted to deduct the one thousand dollars paid by them to Stark from the balance which is due by them to the plaintiff under the account. Having failed in their speculation in the purchase of the Stark patent at the plaintiff\u2019s expense, they must be content to bear the loss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-6\">The master recommended a decree that defendants pay to plaintiff the sum of $6,788 07, with interest from December 10, 1878 ; that defendants assign and deliver to plaintiff all the letters-patent for improvements in folding bedsteads, held by them, and also the re-issued patent granted to Andrew Stark, and that defendants pay the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">The defendants filed exceptions to the master\u2019s report, which the Court dismissed, Thayer, P. J., delivering the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">UA careful and thorough examination of the master\u2019s report and of the voluminous testimony taken in this case has convinced us of the correctness of the master\u2019s findings, and that the conclusions of law which he has reached are reasonable, just, and entirely in accordance with well-established principles of equity. No doubt whatever rests upon our minds of the bad faith of the defendants in their dealings with the plaintiff. It is proved by a mass of testimony and a concurrence of circumstances which establishes it beyond the possibility of a doubt. Their own uncontradicted acts, letters, and oral communications convict them of it so plainly that it is incapable of denial. An attentive perusal of the testimony leaves, it a self-evident fact which requires neither argument nor demonstration to establish it. They not only broke their express covenant to account justly with the plaintiff, and to pay him monthly his stipulated percentage of the sales, but the evidence shows that they entered into a fraudulent conspiracy, the successive steps in which brought them to the borders, if not actually within the lines of criminal responsibility. The object of this conspiracy was to deprive the plaintiff of all benefit of his own invention, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>to appropriate it exclusively to themselves. The means by which it was to be accomplished was the purchase of the Stark patent, which Mason, their own counsel, testified, was not infringed by the plaintiff\u2019s patent, the fraudulent re-issue of that patent, with such cunning devices, that it should be made \u201cto cover entirely the Everitt bedstead,\u201d and a secret assignment by Stark to themselves of that which they already owned ; to be followed by false and covinous notices to and sham suits against themselves, brought under their own instructions and by their owm counsel. All this was duly carried out, was duly discovered by the plaintiff, and is established in all its details in the evidence. The defendants now complain that the master has reported that they cannot be permitted in equity to avail themselves of this fraud, and to consummate it by being allowed to set up this fraudulent instrument as a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s demands. Nothing can be plainer than that upon the state of facts here exhibited the plaintiff is entitled, by some form of decree, to be protected against a deed obtained in the pursuit of this fraudulent and injurious purpose. Sometimes equity affords this protection by requiring the delivering up and cancellation of the fraudulent instrument; sometimes by a perpetual injunction against the use of it. What substantial difference does it make to the defendants whether the plaintiff is protected by such a decree, or by a decree requiring him to assign the re-issued patent to the plaintiff <em>% </em>The master has proceeded upon the well-established principle that one who has a common interest with and a confidential relation to another cannot avail himself of an outstanding or hostile title or incumbrance to the prejudice of his fellow. Much less can he create one himself. Where he has acted in good faith he will in equity be held to be a trustee of a title obtained for the common benefit, and will be entitled to be re-imbursed a proportionate part of the expense of acquiring it; but where he has obtained it for the purpose of defrauding his partner in the adventure he can neither claim any benefit from it himself, zzor demand indemnity for his outlay. In such cases the wrong-doer is held in equity to be a trustee, <em>ex </em>maleficio, for the interest intended to be defrauded, and equity will compel a conveyance to the <em>cestui que trust </em>without compensation. The maxim, that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong, prevails in equity evezi more strongly than at law, and with regard to actual fraud the principles of equity in their application to remedial justice are far more comprehensive. Equity will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>never permit a person to hold a benefit which he has derived from the perpetration of an actual fraud. ' Neither will it allow him compensation for it in any form whatever. In equity no man can set up his own iniquity as a defense any more than as a cause of action. Our reports are full of cases of constructive trusts arising <em>ex maleficio, \u25a0 </em>and it is well settled by many decisions that where an advantage has been gained by an actual fraud, the wrongdoer, who is converted into a trustee <em>ex maleficio, </em>is in no condition to demand indemnity for his outlay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-4\">These principles have often been applied in this State in various forms of procedure in equity and at law. Most frequently in actions of ejectment, as in Sharp <em>v. </em>Brady, 4 Casey, 433, and Seydlar <em>v. </em>Carson, 19 Smith, 81, and the numerous cases there cited by Judge Williams, in which a purchaser acquiring a title by fraud at a sheriff\u2019s sale has been held to be a trustee, <em>ex maleficio, </em>for the person wronged, who might recover against him without a return of the purchase money paid. It is often applied in bills <em>quia timet, </em>of which application O\u2019Neil <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 8 Wright, 18, is an illustration, where a fraudulent grantee was compelled to make a conveyance, although he had paid $1,000 for his title. Such a trust, <em>ex </em>maleficio, arises Avhenever a person holding fiduciary relations to another abuses the confidence reposed in him by taking and claiming for himself property which he ought to have applied to the protection of their common interest. The rule Avas clearly laid down by Sharswood, J., in Duff \u2022\u00bb. Wilson, 22 Smith, 442, and the other cases cited by the master in his report. It is more strongly applied in equity than at law, for the maxim there is, \u2018 \u2018 He who has done iniquity shall not have equity.\u201d It is apparent, therefore, that even if the construction upon which the defendants so strenuously insist should be put upon the fifth and seventh articles of the agreement, and it should be conceded that their covenants to assign, in case of failure to comply with their contract, extended only to improvements made by the parties, their case is no better, for they are still, by reason of the actual fraud practiced, within the operation of the equitable principle which makes them trustees, <em>ex </em>maleficio, without any title to compensation. But, in the present case, the defendants created themselves the very title which is alleged to be hostile to the plaintiff\u2019s rights, for without the re-issue of the Stkrk patent, which they obtained, the plaintiff would have been in no danger. The plaintiff is entitled, therefore, to relief and protection against the defendants\u2019 fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>re-issue of the Stark patent. He might have it by a perpetual injunction against the assignment or use of that patent, or he may have it upon the principles already adverted to, in the form of a decree for the compulsory assignment of it to the plaintiff. The form of the relief is not very material, for the result is the same in either case. The master has seen fit to recommend the latter alternative. In this, we think, he is fully sustained, both by reason and authority, and by the evidence in the cause, and we see no reason to dissent from his conclusions in that respect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">We are also of opinion that defendants have no just ground of complaint against the master for the manner in which he has settled and stated the account. The royalty was, by the terms of the agreement, chargeable on the price of the completed bedstead, as a whole, whether expensively or plainly finished, and including springs, ornaments, and all that constituted the complete bedstead when sold. It was not upon any bedstead of a particular pattern, but \u201cupon all the said patented bedsteads made and sold by them.\u201d We see no reason to doubt the correctness of the master\u2019s statement, that he has credited the defendants, in his supplemental report, with all the bedsteads shown not to have been delivered. It clearly appears also, upon a careful comparison of the duplicate charges contained in the defendants\u2019 printed statement of those charges, submitted to the Court, with the supplemental report submitted by the master (Exhibit C), that they have all been corrected in that report. A careful examination of the case, and of the forty-three exceptions filed by the defendants, has brought us to the conclusion that none of the exceptions are sustained. Let a decree, therefore, be drawn up for the plaintiff, in the form reported by the master on page 52 of this report, corrected as to the amount of the defendants\u2019 indebtedness according to the result reached by the master in his supplemental report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">Exceptions dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">The defendants appealed from the decree entered in accordance with the above opinion, and assigned as error the dismissal of the exceptions, the confirmation of the report, and the granting of the said decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-8\"><em>J. Edward Aeldey, George </em>Biddle, <em>James Otlerson, </em>and <em>George W. Biddle </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-9\">Many of the goods marked in the order-book as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>livered were afterwards returned, and should not have been taken into account. Royalties should not be allowed on bedsteads which were only marked in the order-book, as the use of the oider-book is not to make charges. It would not be evidence in an action for goods sold and delivered : Rhoads \u00bb. Gaul, 4 Rawle, 404.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">The agreement allows the royalty only upon all bedsteads sold. A subsequent exchange or return should avoid the royalty. The master has allowed royalties twice upon the same bedstead. He has included the charges for boxing, &amp;c., which are not subject to royalty. The master erred in adding thirty-three and one third per cent, to the returns from their agents, which it does not appear was collected, because the contract allows royalty only on wholesale prices, which means the sixty-six and two thirds per cent, actually received. The springs, the mirrors, and ebony strips were not parts of the bedstead upon which royalties should be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-7\">The complainant is not entitled to the Stark patent, because the agreement refers only to the Everitt patent, or improvements thereunder. An improvement has essential reference to a subject-matter to be improved: Page <em>v. </em>Ferry, 1 Fish Pat.

The master has made his calculations upon this basis. The royalty can only be rated by taking all the parts that go to make up the bedstead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-6\">The appellants are estopped from questioning the validity of the patent of the appellee: Hilliard on Contr., Vol. 2, p. 191; 5 E., 449 ; Beed <em>v. </em>Blandford, 2 Y. &amp; Jerv., 284 ; 284; Brinley <em>v. </em>Tibbets, 7 Greenl., 70; Kinsman <em>v. </em>Parkhurst, 18 How., 289 ; Crossley <em>v. </em>Dixon, 10 TI. of L.
