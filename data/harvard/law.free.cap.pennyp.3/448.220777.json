In executing the conveyance, the grantor signed his full and correct name \u201c Jonathan D. Weeber.\u201d The conveyancer then took an affidavit from the grantor that there was no other incumbrance than was on the searches. It subsequently appeared that a mortgage had been given by Jonathan D. Weeber, which the searches did not disclose, and the grantee was compelled to pay it to prevent the property from being sold by the sheriff. <em>Held, </em>in an action by the grantee against the administrator of the conveyancer, that the latter had not properly discharged the obligation he had. assumed and that his estate was 'liable for the amount of the mortgage.</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b444-11\">Before Mbrcur, C.

Weeber to the plaintiff, clear of incumbrances; that, when conveyed to plaintiff, the premises were subject to a certain mortgage debt given by said Weeber and the plaintiff was afterwards compelled to pay $1,109 17 to prevent them from being sold by the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">On the trial, before Biddle, J., the following facts appeared : Jonathan D. Weeber was the owner of certain real estate. In the deed conveying it to him, his name was written \u201cJonathan Weber.\u201d As Jonathan Weber, he was awarded a loan by The Harmony Building and Loan Association, to be secured by mortgage of said property. Gustavus Seidel, defendant\u2019s testator, who was the association\u2019s conveyancer, was engaged, in their behalf, in drawing the necessary papers, obtaining searches, &amp;c. He was visited by Weeber, -who brought with him John Bauer, the plaintiff. Bauer stated that he had agreed to purchase the property from Weeber and would assume the mortgage to the association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\"><em>Paul P. Zaiss, </em>one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, testified; \u201cMr. Bauer told Seidel to take out all new searches, and make a good deed.\u201d Seidel said, \u201cAll right, Bauer, I will attend to it.\u201d Mr. Bauer said, when he went in, \u201c to take out new searches.\u201d He told Seidel that he had bought a house from Mr. Weber, and to take out all new searches. Seidel' had a mortgage search ordered by Krumbhaar against Jonathan Weber December 15, 1874, brought down to January 4, 1875, in the same name. The deed was drawn from Jonathan Weber to John Bauer. When the deed was presented for execution, it was signed and acknowledged as \u201c Jonathan D. Weeber.\u201d The same witness whose testimony is quoted above testified that Bauer asked Seidel \u201cif he had taken out all new searches and if everything was all right.\u201d Seidel said: \u201cIt is everything right, and if it\u2019s not right, I\u2019m good for it.\u201d The notary who took Weeber\u2019s acknowledgment testified to having noticed the difference between the signature and the grantor\u2019s name, as written in the deed, and to referring the matter to Seidel. He continued : \u201cSeidel and Bauer had a talk in German \u2014 what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the conversation was, I don\u2019t know. After some time, Mr. Seidel ordered me to take Weber\u2019s affidavit, that there was no other incumbrance than was on the searches. Bauer was present. Weber took the affidavit. I don\u2019t know what became of it. I prepared it, and swore Weber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">When Weber signed his name, I advised taking out new searches against Jonathan D. Weeber, as the judgments or mortgages would not otherwise appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">There were no separate searches. There had been searches made against Jonathan Weber, and they were \u2018brought up.\u2019 Don\u2019t know who made them.

Mr. Weber said his right name was \u2018 Jonathan David Weeber,\u2019 but that in this country he never made use of it. ITe did all his business transactions in plain Jonathan Weber. Mr. Bauer asked what the expense for new searches would be, and was told eight or ten dollars \u2014 maybe more. So he considered awhile, and said, \u2018Never mind, I know Mr. Weber a good many years, and know his business very near as well as I do my own.\u2019 The settlement was then made. He also said, \u2018 I am satisfied that there is nothing against it. I have lived in the house a good many years.\u2019 He said he would take the property without any expense for new searches.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">The conveyancer\u2019s bill, amounting to $45, and including $7 50 for searches, was paid by Bauer and the deed delivered to him. It was afterwards discovered that, at the time of the conveyance to Bauer, the premises so conveyed were incumbered by a mortgage, executed some time before by \u201c Jonathan D. Weeber,\u201d and so indexed in the recorder\u2019s office. This mortgage did not appear upon the search taken out by Seidel against \u201cJonathan Weber.\u201d Proceedings were begun by the holder of the mortgage to compel its payment, and Bauer, in order to prevent the property being sold by the sheriff, was eventually forced to pay him $1,109 17, the sum to recover which this suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-12\">If the jury believe, from the evidence, that G-ustavus Seidel, defendant\u2019s testator, as a conveyancer, was employed by the plaintiff to ascertain the title of Jonathan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>D.

Weeber to the deed from him to the plaintiff, and that thereupon the defendant\u2019s testator gave to the plaintiff his opinion, honestly and in good faith, that the search was sufficient, and that the premises were free and clear of mortgage incumbrances, other than those mentioned in the search, defendant\u2019s testator is not liable, though mistaken, and your verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-12\">Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-13\">(Fifteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-14\">The Court charged the judge as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-15\">\u201c Whether the defendant should pay to the plaintiff the loss he sustained, depends mainly upon what occurred at the settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-16\">There were three witnesses, two for the plaintiff and one for the defendant: Zais, Norton, and Seidel.

Tail </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-11\">It was for the jury to say whether Mr. Seidel failed to use the proper means to discover the Price mortgage. It is an unheard-of practice that a conveyancer has acted in good faith by simply going to the grantor and getting him to make an affidavit that there are no incumbrances against the premises to be conveyed. In support of so novel a practice, why did not the defendant below call experts to show that this was a proper way for a conveyancer to act, and not complain of us because none were examined in support of our case <em>% </em>' It did not require evidence of conveyancers to show what was incumbent for Seidel to do. Hq recognizes that he was bound to take notice of the difference in the names, and acted, he says, upon it by getting the affidavit of Weeber. That would not be enough, because it did not protect us against the mortgage which a properly directed search would have revealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-12\">For another reason the specifications cannot be sustained. Bauer gave Seidel positive instructions to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>new searches taken out against Weeber. Seidel decided not to do this, but to rely upon his opinion that the old mortgage search was sufficient. He took the risk, and nothing can be plainer than if his neglect to obey the directions resulted in a loss, he is responsible: Gilbert <em>v. </em>Williams, 8 Mass., 51.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b449-4\">April 19, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A_L\">\u2014 Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AmN\">We discover no error in the admission or in the rejection of evidence. It was properly restricted to the transaction between the parties. The plaintiff\u2019s testator was bound to exercise reasonable care in the discharge of his professional duty. He was employed not only to prepare a proper deed of conveyance from Jonathan D. Weeber, of the premises in question, but also to procure the necessary searches whereby the deed would convey to the defendant in error a title clear of all incumbrances. Procuring a certificate of search of mortgage against Jonathan Weber only was not a due and proper discharge of the obligation which he assumed. The evidence that he did agree to perform the services stated, and failed to duly perform them, was most ample to submit to the jury, and justifies the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
