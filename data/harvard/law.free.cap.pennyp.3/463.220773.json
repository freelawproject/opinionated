Young, one of your orators, drawn to the order of said William Young, and indorsed by him to the said Brown, due February 3, 1883, and one of the notes of B. F. Young to the order of William Young, indorsed by and to the said Brown, due February 3,1883, and excepting that said James Koch received the promissory note of B. F.

The bill also averred that the defendants and each and all of them had, at the time of the negotiation and sale of the stock as aforesaid, knowledge of the statements and representations as aforesaid that were made to complainants, which induced the purchase thereof, and that the same were false, fraudulent, and untrue; that they knew each and all of them at the same time had knowledge that the said business of the said company was not in a prosperous condition ; that no dividends had been j&gt;aid for the said period of two years preceding said sale; that the property of said company did not contain deposits of sufficient quantity for a successful management of its business ; that the veins then upon the property contained ore of an inferior quality, which produced an inferior article of manufacture and utterly unmarketable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">It then prayed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">(1.) That the contract of sale be decreed null and void. (2.) That the defendants and each and every of them be decreed to return all moneys paid to them by the plaintiff as the purchase money of the stock with interest thereon. (3.) That the defendants and each of them be enjoined from using, indorsing, or disposing of the promissory notes given and indorsed by the plaintiffs or either of them as the purchase money of the stock. (4.) That the defendants and each of them be decreed to surrender, release, and deliver unto the plaintiffs the said promissory notes and each and every of them. (5.) That the defendants and each and every of them be decreed to pay unto the plaintiffs the sum of $8,000, paid and expended by them in the management of the business of the said company, or make restitution.; and (6.) General relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">The defendants demurred, specifying, <em>inter alia-.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\"><em>First. </em>The complainants have a full, adequate, and complete remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\"><em>Second. </em>The statement of the case in the bill does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>disclose any joint liability on the part of the defendants. The liability, if any, upon the facts stated in the bill, is several.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\"><em>Fourth. </em>The bill does not aver that the complainants jointly purchased the stock ; on the contrary, the facts as stated in paragraph VI of the bill show that it was an individual purchase by each of the complainants, and hence the complainants have no joint title to the relief prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\"><em>Eighth. </em>Because relief is prayed against all the defendants jointly in respect of promissory notes held by, and sums of money received by, them, or some of them, individually.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">After hearing on bill and demurrer, the Court entered a decree sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill without prejudice.

It avers that all of them had knowledge of the representations made ; that they were made by them and in their behalf; that they induced the purchase ; that they were false and untrue ; and that Beber, Berrett, Henninger, Koch, and Coblentz acted on behalf of all at the time of the representations and negotiations; and that Beber, Berrett, and Henninger, on behalf of all, visited the mines with plaintiffs, and made the representation of fraud as charged. All of the stock was sold under the same negotiations, and by the same representations, and the sale of it was concluded about the sam\u00e9 time. The stock was sold by each defendant under the contract, and they each assigned their respective shares to each of the plaintiffs in equal third parts. All were paid in the same manner, showing a common intent and joint action. Consequently, all parties are liable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>full extent of the fraud practiced which induced the purchase. They are responsible for the false representations made, even if they had no interest in the deception : Weed <em>v. </em>Case, <em>55 </em>Barb., 547, Note to Bispham\u2019s Equitv, page 207.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5\">As to the joinder of all the parties, they are all entitled to be joined, as the cause grew out of the same transaction, where both plaintiffs and defendants were interested in the same right, and the relief sought is of the same general nature. In this case there was no distinct, independent, and separate causes of complaint requiring diferent defenses and different decrees: Cumberland Valley Railroad Company\u2019s Appeal, 12 P. F. S., 218; Young <em>v. </em>Allegheny Oil Company, 10 Phil., 525 ; Calvin on Equity, page 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-6\">- The duty of restoring the stock and of surrendering the notes is therefore a joint one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-7\">As to the eighth cause of demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-8\">All the defendants having derived a benefit from the plaintiffs through the false representations inducing the purchase of the stock, and all knowing that such representations were false, and that the notes had, given, and indorsed, for part of the purchase money, all are entitled to be decreed to surrender the notes, and protect the plaintiffs from all injury by reason thereof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-9\">P. <em>F. Rothermel, Jr., George F. Baer, </em>and <em>George Tucker Bispham </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-10\">It is submitted that it is well settled in both England and in this country that such a bill as this will not lie for the reason that the plaintiff has a full and adequate remedy at law : Mackintosh <em>v. </em>Tracy, 4 Brewster, 59 ; Patterson \u00bb. Lane, 11 Casey, 275; Ambler <em>v. </em>Choteau, 1 Supreme Court Reporter, 556. The rule is the same in England: Newham <em>v. </em>May, 13 Price, 749, and has been recognized in this country: Russell <em>v. </em>Clark, 7 Crunch, 69 ; Hardwick <em>v. </em>Forbes, 1 Bibb., 212 ; Woodman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 25 Maine, 531.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-11\">Nor is it clear from the statement of complainants\u2019 case in the bill that there is any joint liability whatever. The facts show a several liability. The bill states that the stock was owned individually; that the negotiations, though begun by some on behalf of all, concluded with the owners as individuals ; that the terms of purchase with the various owners varied as to price; that the contracts were consummated at different dates ; and that when negotiable securities were given, they were given to the individual owners and not to the defendants jointly.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>April 9, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A6O\">\u2014 Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"A7fB\">We think the evidence fails to disclose any joint cause of action in the appellants. The cause of complaint is shown to be separate and distinct in each. It is not sufficient that each has sustained the same kind of injury. This does not authorize them to file a joint bill. The principal object of this bill is to recover damages for an alleged fraud\u2019 in making the contract. To recover these the appellants have a full, complete, and adequate remedy at law. The prayer for a rescission of the contract does not relieve the case from the fatal consequence of no joint cause of action in the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
