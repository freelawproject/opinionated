J., the following facts appeared: Sarah Jane Neal was born in East Franklin township, Armstrong county, September 6, 1847, on a farm on which her father, John Neal, had lived for many years. On April 10, 1854, John Neal bought a farm in Washington township, and shortly afterwards moved there, taking with him his daughter, Sarah Jane. In 1865, Sarah Jane became insane, and on September 7, 1870, an order of relief was granted to the overseers of Washington township on the oath of John Neal, and she was placed by them in the insane asylum at Dixmont. John Neal continued to reside in Washington township until November 5, 1880, when he bought a house and some ]and in East Franklin township, and lived there until his death, February 11, 1882. On December 17,1881, J. S. Smith and T. B. Faulk, two justices, granted an order directing the removal of Sarah Jane Neal from the charge of the overseers of Washington township to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the overseers of East Franklin township. From this order, the overseers of East Franklin township appealed. The appeal was argued April 26, 1882, the appellant submitting, <em>inter alia, </em>the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\">\u201cThat if an order of maintenance was issued September <em>7, </em>1870, charging the said Sarah J. Neal to the township of Washington as a pauper, and she was placed by the overseers of Washington township in an insane asylum, where she has remained ever since, her last legal settlement would be in the said township of Washington, and the order of removal would be without authority of law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\"><em>Answer. </em>Affirmed. (First assignment, of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">\u201c If Sarah Jane Neal was an actual pauper on the township of Washington on September 7,1870, she then being over twenty-one years of age, and removed by the overseers of said township to the insane asylum, where she has remained ever since, and has at no time since formed part of her father\u2019s family or household, but has continued a charge upon said township of Washington, her last place of legal settlement would be in said township of Washington, and her settlement would not follow her father to East Franklin township on his removal thereto in 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\"><em>Answer. </em>Affirmed. (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">The Court, in its opinion, said, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">\u201cIt seems scarcely possible for a pauper, while a pauper, to acquire a new settlement. This being the <em>status </em>of Sarah Jane Neal, a declared pauper upon the township of Washington at the time of her father\u2019s removal from that township, it does not reasonably follow that she, the child, neither an inmate of his family and not depending upon or receiving support from him, shall, by the mere act of the parent in removing and acquiring a new settlement, become <em>ipso facto </em>a charge upon the district of his last acquired settlement.\u201d (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\">Appeal sustained. The plaintiff thereupon took this writ, assigning; for error, <em>inter alia, </em>the affirmance of the appellant\u2019s points as above, and the portion of the opinion quoted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-11\"><em>W. D. Patton </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-12\">The only question at issue is whether the settlement of Sarah Jane Neal followed that of her father. The ordinary rule is \u201cthat when a father gains a second settlement after the birth of a child, that settlement is usually communicated to the child.\u201d 2 Lord Raymond, 1332. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>But it will be said that Sarah Jane Neal was emancipated. But how <em>% </em>She resided with her father until she was eighteen, and then became insane. She has never ceased to need the protection of her father, and has been incapable of securing a settlement for herself. Shippen <em>v. </em>Gaines, 5 Harris, 39. But it is said that because she was separated from her father after she became of age, by being sent to Dixmont, that she thereby became emancipated. Rex <em>v. </em>Much Cowarne, <em>2 </em>B. &amp; Adol, 861; Har. Dig., Vol. <em>2, </em>5269. \u201cAnidiot, though separated from her parents after the age of twenty-one, cannot be emancipated.\u201d And the fact that Sarah Jane Neal was not residing with her father at the time he moved into East Franklin township makes no difference, for many a person has been settled by derivative settlements in poor districts, upon the soil of which her feet had never trod. Rex <em>v. </em>Edgeworth, 3 T. R., 353 ; Str., 580; 2 Lord Raym., 1332; 3 Burn\u2019s Justice, 309; Rex <em>v. </em>Wilmington, 1 D. <em>&amp; </em>R., 140; Overseers of Washington <em>v. </em>Overseers of Beaver, 3 W. <em>&amp; </em>S., 548.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-4\"><em>E. S. Golden </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">It would be strange law that would override the order of maintenance in this case, and charge upon East Franklin township the responsibility of maintaining one whose maintenance had been charged upon Washington township after her majority, and at her father\u2019s instance, by the mere accident of her father\u2019s removal ten or twelve years after her separation from his family.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b105-6\">December 30, 1882.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AWo\">\u2014 Pee Ctteiam :</author>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">How it would have been had the change of residence of the father from Washington to Franklin been during the minority of his daughter, it is unnecessary to decide. Here that change took place after her arrival at full age. She could not be considered as a member of his family, and her father\u2019s act could not affect her <em>status </em>as a pauper.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
