J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">George Hoffner, in the year 1853, became the owner of about thirty-two acres of land in the southern part of the city of Philadelphia, including about twelve and three quarter acres within the boundaries of the Schuylkill Point Meadow Company. He became a member of the company and so remained, paying his assessments until his death in May, 1871. By his last will and testament he devised all of his real estate to his wife, Sarah A. Hoffner, forever, and appointed John A. Garrett his executor. At the time suit was brought the devisee still owned the land. No notice of the assessments had ever been given to her or to the executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">The Court charged the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">\u201cThe facts in this case are virtually admitted. The Schuylkill Point Meadow Bank Company was incorporated in the year 1761, and the 'object of the company was to raise a fund for the purpose of building a bank along the river Schuylkill in the southern part of this city, to keep the river from overflowing the meadows lying between the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers. This fund, according to the provisions of the act, was to be raised by the managers levying asssessments, from time to time, upon land lying within the limits of the company. These assessments were to be paid by the owners or possessors of said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\">\u201c It is undoubtedly true that this company have extraordinary powers under their charter, and as this case will eventually turn upon the law, I will reserve those questions for future consideration. I will say to you, gentlemen, that the counsel for defendants lay some stress upon the point that the plaintiff has failed to show that Mrs. Hoffner\u2019s land has been benefited by the work done by the company, for the reason, as is contended, that the footing ditch along Hollander\u2019s creek has not been kept open so as to drain her land. For the purposes of this case I charge you, that if there was a general benefit to the land-owners by the work done by the company, that seems to me to be sufficient under the law; and I do not think the company were bound to keep the footing ditch along Hollander\u2019s creek open for the purposes of drainage. Neither do I think the company were bound to give Mrs. Hoffner notice of the levying of assessments. Now, gentlemen, if you believe that the work was done by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>company, as the plaintiff alleges, and about which there is no serious dispute, and that said work was necessary, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff, subject, of course, to the points of law submitted by the counsel for defendants, and which points I reserve for the court in banc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-5\">The following points of law were reserved for the court in banc:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\"><em>First. </em>Whether the act of Assembly of September 26, 1761, and the supplement thereto, passed April 15, 1782, under which the plaintiff seeks to recover, are not in violation of the bill of rights and unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\"><em>Second. </em>Whether the said Garrett, executor, and said Sarah A. Hoffner, sole devisee, of George Hoffner, deceased, it having been shown that they were not members of said company, and have not assented to the laws or acts of said company, are bound by said acts of Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\"><em>Third. </em>Whether there can be a recovery against the defendants in this suit, under the following point, (3rd,) submitted by defendants, to wit: \u201c That it is not the true intendment of the said acts of Assembly that the managers may suffer the assessments to remain unpaid for an indefinite time, finally to be collected from a new tenant or an innocent purchaser ; that prompt collection of the assessments from the proper parties is enjoined by the spirit of the act, rather than a loose and unwarranted construction for the r enlargement of the powers of the managers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>Whether the said Sarah A. Hoffner, being the sole devisee of George Hoffner, deceased, is bound by covenants between him and said company, she not being a member of said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-10\">April 11, 1882. \u2014 yerdictfor plaintiff for $535 50, subject to points reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-11\">The, defendants moved for a-new trial and for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>upon the points reserved. The Court discharged the rule for a new trial, and refused to enter judgment for the defendants <em>non obstante veredicto. </em>By agreement of counsel the verdict was afterwards reduced, to $338, and judgment entered thereon. The defendants then took out a writ of error, assigning as error the charge of the Court and the refusal to enter j udgment for the defendants <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-12\"><em>Lewis Qassidy </em>and <em>Qhartes Davis </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-13\">The act of 1782, in not requiring notice to be given, does not repeal the notice required by the act of 1761.

Maynes, supra, an analogous act was held to be constitutional. The decision there was upon the point that the assessments could not be collected by distress from a tenant who went into possession after they were laid, or from any innocent purchaser. The assessments were made only for the years during which Mrs. HofEner was owner, and therefore Rutherford <em>v. </em>Maynes does not apply.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b373-9\">January 29, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AxkI\">\u2014 Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"AsY\">The defendant in error is a <em>quasi </em>corporation authorized by statute to levy the taxes in question. The charge is so far of a public character as to prevent the statute from infringing on the Constitution. The land is properly chargeable with the payment of these taxes. Mrs. HofEner is the widow of the former owner of the land and the sole'devisee thereof. The taxes .were duly and regularly laid since she acquired title to the land. She became personally liable for the taxes, and the fact that she has not paid them sooner constitutes no defense against their payment now.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Judgment was correctly entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
