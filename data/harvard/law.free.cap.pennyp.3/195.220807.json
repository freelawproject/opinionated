Clarkston, Rebecca J. Donalds, and Matilda Donalds from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of <em>Franklin </em>County, overruling the exceptions to the report of an auditor appointed to make distribution of the balance in the hands of Frederick Dice, executor of the estate of Anna Mary Ashway, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-14\">Mrs. Anna Mary Ashway died in Franklin county in January, 1879, leaving an estate valued at nearly $3,000. For the last ten years of her life she had made her home with her grand-son, Frederick Dice. During this time, she was a member of his family, assisting in such light household tasks as were possible at her age. She died in his house, and was buried therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-15\">On May 20, 1869, a month or two after Mrs. Ashway went to live with her grandson, she executed a will, in which, among other provisions, she bequeathed all the furniture then in her possession to her grand-son, Frederick Dice, and also made him sole executor thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>On December 8, 1880, he filed his account, in which he charged himself with $2,971 87, and claimed credit for $1,100 55. Among the credits claimed was the following: For boarding and support of decedent from January, 1873, to date of death, January, 1879, at $2 50 per week, $780.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">Exceptions were filed to the allowance of this credit by the appellants, and the account was referred to W. J. Zacharias, as auditor, before whom the testimony of two witnesses was offered in support of the allowance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\"><em>Mrs. Eliza Sellers </em>testified as follows : \u201cI had a conversation with my grandmother at my home about her (grandmother) living with Frederick Dice. I do not remember when exactly, but I think it was in the month of May, 1873. I do not remember of any one being present. She told me she liked it very much at Frederick\u2019s ; that she would stay there as long as she lived, if he would keep her that long. That was the year my mother lay sick at my house, and I wanted grandmother to stay at my house, but she would not stay. During this conversation in regard to her staying with me, she spoke of her home at Frederick\u2019s ; she said that she could not earn her boarding, and that Frederick was to be well paid for keeping her; she mentioned no amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\"><em>Mrs. Elimina Snyder </em>testified: \u201cI had a conversation with my grandmother in regard to her staying at Frederick Dice\u2019s. This conversation was in 1871 at my home ; she was there on a visit. She said she was not well, and wanted to go home to Frederick\u2019s ; that she was giving him one hundred dollars per year for keeping her, and she wanted to be there. She told me that several times during her stay, which was for a few days. She said if she got older he was to have more, as when she got older she would be more trouble.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">On cross-examination she said: &lt;\u00a3I think she said that he was to have $100 per year for keeping her. My grandmother always spoke in German. She sometimes said he was to have it, and sometimes said she would give him $100 per year ; but she never said she had given it to him. That is all she said on the subject.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\"><em>Q. </em>Did you not understand from the conversation which you had with your grandmother, and the words used by her, merely that she intended to pay Fred, and not that she had any bargain with him ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-11\"><em>A. </em>\u2018 \u2018 She said that he was to have it, and did not say that she had any bargain with him, or anything else. I don\u2019t know what she meant by \u2018he was to have it,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u25a0whether she meant that she intended to pay to him, or that she had a bargain with him to do it. She did not say that she had promised to pay Fred, bnt just said that was what she was to pay him. She sometimes said that was what she would pay, and sometimes said that he was to have it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">On July 26, 1881, the auditor filed his report sustaining the exceptions, disallowing the accountant the credit claimed for $780, and reporting a distribution accordingly. To this report exceptions were filed by the accountant, and sustained by the Court in the following opinion filed September 27, 1881, by Rowe, P. J. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">\u201cI think the auditor erred in not allowing the claim of Frederick Dice for support and maintenance of the decedent, and that the exceptions filed to his report must be sustained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">\u201c Frederick Dice was the grand-son of Anna Mary Ash-way, and the executor of her last will. In his account he claimed credit for $780 for boarding, etc., of decedent from January 1, 1873, to January 25, 1879, the date of her death, being $2 50 per week. The auditor disallowed the claim on the ground that, in the absence of an express contract, the boarding, etc., must be attributed to the family relationship.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-9\">\u201cBetween parent and child living in the same family, a claim such as this must be supported by evidence of an express contract. It is the same when one stands <em>in loco parentis. </em>In other cases, the ordinary rule prevails, unless and until it be shown that in fact the parties were not acting on the footing of a contract. This may be shown by the circumstances, and the nearer the relationship, the less expectation of payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-10\">\u201cIn the case in hand, the facts point clearly to a contract relation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-11\">\u201cIt seems that about April or May, 1869, Anna Mary Ashway went to live with her grandson, Frederick Dice. He had a family of his own. She bad children living in the county and with comfortable homes. She was then about eighty-tliree years of age, and could not earn her boarding any more, and had an estate which, at her death, amounted to $3,000.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-12\">\u201cAbout the time she went to Frederick\u2019s, namely, 20th May, 1869, she made a will, which was duly probated after her decease, wherein she gave her property to her children, except a portion of her furniture, which she gave to her said grandson, Frederick Dice. She lived in his family, and was provided for by him. and was well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>and kindly treated from the time she went there until she died. The services were worth $2 50 per week, making, for the six years immediately preceding her death, $780.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-4\">\u201cIn 1871, being on a visit to Elemina Snyder, a granddaughter, and a sister of Frederick Dice, she said she was not well and wanted to go home to Frederick\u2019s ; that she was giving him one hundred dollars per year for keeping her, and she wanted to be there. She said if she got older he was to have more, as she would become more troublesome. Again, in May, 1873, to Eliza Sellers, her granddaughter, she said she liked it very much at Frederick\u2019s ; that she would stay there as long as she lived, if he would keep her that long ; that she could not earn her boarding any more ; and that Frederick was to be well paid for keeping her, and, on this occasion, she declined to stay with Mrs. Snyder.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\">\u201c Now, in view of all this, it seems clear to me that the intention and understanding of the parties was that she was to pay for her living.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-6\">\u201cThe accountant is therefore to be allowed the credit he claimed for her support.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-7\">\u201cThe exceptions are sustained and the report recommitted to the auditor, that distribution may be made according to the principles of this opinion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-8\">The amended report, of the auditor, under the above opinion, was filed November 28, 1881, and exceptions were filed thereto. On December 20, 1881, the Court overruled the exceptions, and confirmed the amended report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-9\">From this decree, William M. Leidy <em>et </em>al., distributees under the will, appealed, assigning that the Court below erred in setting aside the original report of the auditor, disallowing the credit of $780, and in confirming the amended report as directed in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-10\"><em>John Q.
