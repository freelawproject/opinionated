Possession not being given up on that day, he commenced these proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-13\">The alderman\u2019s transcript set forth <em>inter alia </em>as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-14\">\u201cAnd now, April 17th, 3, p. M., after carefully considering the proofs and allegations, and finding the facts as set forth in the foregoing complaint, viz: \u2018 That the term of said demise is fully ended and expired,\u2019 are not proven, E find that said lease did not expire on March 31st, 1882, or thereabouts, because the defendant notified the plaintiff on November 29th, 1881, of his intention to continue the occupancy according to the provisions of the lease, and I find that under the terms of said lease, the defendant had a right to continue said lease from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>year to year for five successive years, at a rent to be fixed or mutually agreed upon by plaintiff and defendant through such appraiser as they might severally select. I further find, after hearing all witnesses on both sides on the question of forfeiture of lease for breach of covenants and conditions, that said lease has not been forfeited and such breaches have not been made or taken place. I hereby enter judgment publicly in favor of defendant and against plaintiff, and dismiss the complaint at the cost of plaintiff.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">On June 15, 1882, the Court reversed the judgment of the alderman, Stowe, J., delivering the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">\u2018 \u2018 When no evidence is given, nor facts from which the conclusion of the Justice is drawn, we cannot review his finding of facts on certiorari, and therefore we must take it, that under the evidence there was no forfeiture of the lease. But how is it with reference to the renewal of the lease ? It may very possibly be that the conduct of plaintiff would estop him from relying upon the provisions in the lease that \u2018lessee is to have the right, within five years, to continue from year to year at a rental to be fixed, viz : Lessee to appoint in writing to lessor, on or before December 1 prior to the end of such lease, a reputable freeholder as an appraiser, whereafter lessor, on the 3d of said December, shall appoint another, which two . . . shall fix the advance, if any, of the rent for the year from the 31 March following,\u2019 &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-8\">But if so, the Justice has not so found. He merely says he finds said lease did not expire on March 31, 1882, or thereabouts, because the defendant notified the plaintiff on the 29th of November, 1881, of his intention to continue the occupancy according to the provisions of the lease, \u2018 and I find that under the terms of the lease the defendant had a right to continue said lease from year to year for five successive years, at a rental to be fixed or mutually agreed upon by plaintiff and defendant, through such appraisers as they might severally select.\u2019 Now, the case shows its determination on 31st March, 1882, and without there was a renewal under the lease by a compliance with its provisions, that was the end of it, unless plaintiff, by his acts, had estopped himself from setting u p such a claim. Whether he did or not, does not appear. Certainly, the Justice does not so find in terms, nor does he find any fact which would have had that effect. What he does find is that \u2018 defendant notified the plaintiff on 29th of November, 1881, of his intention to continue the occupancy of the premises according to the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the lease.\u2019 This is entirely insufficient. What he was to do was \u00a3 by writing to lessor, to appoint a reputable freeholder as an appraiser to fix the rent,\u2019 &amp;c. This he did not do, and, therefore, the finding of the fact stated by the Justice does not sustain his conclusion as worked out by his judgment. It is stated by counsel in argument that the plaintiff would not give defendant a copy of the agreement upon application, made for that purpose, so that he might comply with it, nor inform him what it was necessary to do to continue the lease, and defendant was ignorant of the terms, and so notified plaintiff It may estop the plaintiff, but the fact is not found upon the record, and we cannot assume it to be true.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\">The lessee then took out a writ of error, assigning as errors that the Court had no jurisdiction, under the act by virtue of which these proceedings are instituted, over a <em>certiorari </em>issued at the instance of the landlord, or to set aside the judgment of the Justice under such procedure; that the Court erred in reversing the judgment, in inferring facts not found by the alderman on his record, and that the reversal was based on a presumption of things not proven.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-5\"><em>JosiaTi CoTien, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">By the terms of the act, a <em>certiorari </em>is only given to the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">Evidence was submitted and discussed outside of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">Bedford <em>v. </em>Kelly, 61 Penna. St., 491.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">The finding of the alderman that the lease had not expired presupposes that the terms of the lease, in reference to its renewal, were fully complied with, or were proven to have been performed by the tenant, or, if not performed, that proper evidence\u201d was abundantly submitted to the Justice, going to show that by the landlord\u2019s own evasions the tenant was prevented from performing the covenants incident to a renewal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-10\">The court is not to look beyond the transcript: Commissioners <em>v. </em>Fickinger, 1 P.
