In an action against a railroad company for injuries to a building by a flood, which injuries were alleged to have been caused by the failure of the defendant to keep its culvert in proper condition, there was evidence that two of the three barrels of the culvert were nearly closed up. The Court charged the jury that if the company constructed the culvert in a reasonably skillful manner, and in such a way as to vent the water in cases of ordinary freshets, and kept the same in proper repair, they liad done all that could be asked of them. Subject to this charge the Court affirmed plaintiff\u2019s point that if the jury believed from all the evidence in the case that the three barrels of the defendant\u2019s culvert, if open and free from obstructions, would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>been sufficient under the circumstances to have vented and discharged such a quantity of water as would have prevented the damage, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. Held, not to be error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b515-6\">2. The Court further charged that \u201c if the ordinary state of repairs in which the culvert was kept was not good, long time would not be an excuse; but if the culvert had been kept in an ordinarily good state of repairs before and up to the time of the flood, and you believe this was an extraordinary flood, the defendant would be relieved from responsibility, any want of proper repairs of the culvert not being the proximate or producing cause of the damage.\u201d Held, not to be error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b515-7\">3.

J., the following facts appeared:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-13\">Shaner\u2019s Run passes under the railroad of the defendant and empties into the Youghiogheny river. Where the road crosses the run was a culvert with three openings called \u201cbarrels,\u201d with divisions between them built of stone. One of these barrels was twenty-eight and three fourth inches wide and four feet seven inches high ; the second was twenty-six inches wide and four feet four inches high ; and the third was thirty-one and one half inches wide and four feet six inches high. The schoolhouse stood in the hollow above the crossing. The railroad was nine and one half inches lower than the top of the foundation of the school-house. Previous to July 26, 1879, the culvert had been sufficient to vent the water there. On that day there was a very heavy rain. The flood raised up in the hollow, overflowed the railroad and carried away the tracks and ballast. The water was two and one half feet above the rail and about three hundred feet wide. The school-house was floated off of its foundations, carried across the railroad into the river, and broken to pieces.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-14\"><em>John </em>Hamilton, for the plaintiff, testified :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u201cPrior to July 26, two of these barrels were nearly closed up. The one next McG-ughen\u2019s lot was entirely closed, and another one was nearly closed, that is, the middle one.....They were in that condition four or five years.\u201d This testimony was confirmed by other witnesses for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">A number of witnesses for the plaintiff testified that in their opinion, if the barrels had been in good condition, the school-house would not have been carried away.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-8\"><em>J. T. StntMe, </em>for the defense, testified, <em>inter alia:</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-9\">\u201cIn the morning of the 26th of July, 1879, I was cleaning out the culvert at Shaner station. It was my business to clean out the culverts. We had one barrel cleaned out altogether, and the second one partly cleaned. It would have taken a short time to finish it. The third one we hadn\u2019t touched at all. I suppose it might have taken us half an hour or an hour to finish the second one. I could see through it. There was only rubbish at the mouth of it.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-10\"><em>Bigiswmnd </em>Lowe, a civil engineer, testified for the defendant, <em>inter alia :</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-11\">\u201cIt would require a culvert with a span of forty feet and sixteen feet high to carry that amount of water through. The track is twenty-three feet from the bed of the stream. The structure required to go on the top of the culvert would have to be ten feet high, which would make the height of the track twenty-six feet. Such a culvert could not be put in there, as the dump is not that high. It requires one hundred and twenty chambers and barrels like those that are there now to carry that amount of water.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-12\">Another engineer corroborated this testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-13\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-14\">\u201cAll that can be asked at the hands of the defendant is that they have observed proper engineering skill so as to avoid injury to others that might arise from the construction of the road in obstructing the natural flow or passage of the water. If the company constructed the culvert in a reasonably skillful manner, and in such a way as to vent the water in cases of ordinary freshets, and kept the same in proper repair, they have done all that can be asked of them. Beyond this they are not held to any responsibility, and for anything else they cannot be called on to account. Therefore, if this were an extraordinary flood, unusual, and one not to be expected \u2014 in plain terms, if it was the act of Gfod that swept the house away \u2014 the defendant is not responsible, and if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>you so find your verdict should be for the defendant. No one can be called upon to provide against unforeseen occurrences.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-4\">It was the duty of the defendant, however, in the construction of the culvert, and in keeping the same in proper repair, to take into consideration the size of the stream and the extent to which the same might be swollen in*cases of ordinary freshets, and also to take into consideration the location, the surrounding territory, and the probabilities of the collection of waters from the hills adjacent in cases of ordinary freshets. All these things should have been reasonably guarded against by the defendant. If the defendant company did thus construct this culvert, and afterwards kept it in proper repair, they have done all that can be asked of them. There may be occasions, however, where damage results from the concurrent or combined act of God and the negligence or fault of a party. Where this is so, in order to render the party responsible, the negligence on his part concurrent with the act of God must be the real producing cause of the injury. Clothing our language in the words of the Supreme Court, they say that \u2018in the present case,\u2019 a case then under consideration before the Court, \u2018 if the culvert was so unskillfully and negligently constructed as to be insufficient to vent the ordinary high water of the stream, the railroad company building it would have been liable for the injury thereby caused. The apparent facts indicated the duty. The stream, though small, must find a vent or overflow the adjacent land and undermine the railroad. Its size, the character of its channel, and the declivity of the circumjacent territory which forms the water-shed, indicated the probable quantity of water to be passed through. Proper engineering skill should observe these circumstance's, and supply the means of avoiding the injury which would result from locking up the natural flow, or obstructing its passage so as to cause a reflux in times of ordinary high water. Beyond this prudent circumspection cannot be expected to look, and there is therefore no liability for extraordinary floods, those unexpected visitations, whose comings are not foreshadowed by the usual course of nature, and must be laid to the account of Providence, whose dealings, though they may afflict, wrong no one.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">Keeping in mind, therefore, these general-principles or rules of law, by which you are to be governed, you will inquire in the first place whether this was an extraordinary flood, and whether it was this extraordinary flood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>that destroyed the property of the plaintiff. If it was that alone, and was thus the act of God, and the railroad company upon their part were not to blame, then of course the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">If, upon the other hand, the railroad company, by any neglect of theirs in keeping this culvert in proper repair so as to give vent to the water in cases of ordinary floods or freshets, combined with the act of God to produce this damage or injury, and that act of the company in neglecting \u2014 if there was any neglect, and this is a question of fact for the jury \u2014 was the producing cause of the damage, then they would be responsible. You will observe that, in order to entitle the plaintiff in this case to recover, the fault must be brought home, and laid down at the feet of the railroad company, that it was by reason of their neglect, if there was any neglect, that this damage was caused to the plaintiff. In the language of the Court, this must be the producing cause and not some trivial or unimportant neglect. It must be such neglect as would be sufficient, concurring with the act of God, to produce the damage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">Counsel for the plaintiff submitted the following point: \u201cIf you believe, from all the evidence in the case, that the three barrels of the defendant\u2019s culvert, if open and free from obstructions, would have been sufficient, under the circumstances, to have vented and discharged such a quantity of water as would have prevented the damage \u25a0done to the plaintiff\u2019s school-house, the plaintiff in this action is entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\"><em>Answer. </em>\u2014 We have in our general charge commented on the principles of the law governing this case, and have substantially answered the point. You will take the instructions we have given and now affirm the point as explained in the general charge\u20181.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-8\">Counsel for the defendant presented, <em>inter </em>alia, certain points, which were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-9\">\u201c1.

That they shall find specifically the length of time the rain-fall continued; the number or amount of cubic feet of water that passed into the hollow per second when the flood was at its height; the number or amount of cubic feet of water that the barrels of the culvert would empty or vent per second, if perfectly clear.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-11\">\u201c8.

All the world knows that in a trial against a railroad corporation a measure of diligence of the defendant left to the jury cannot be perfect enough not to be condemned. It was error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>not to define specifically, either in the general charge or in the point, what proper repair was: Pa. R. R.
