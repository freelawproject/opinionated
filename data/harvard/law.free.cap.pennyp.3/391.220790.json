In rebuttal, the plaintiff was permitted to testify that he copied the entries in the order-book of the agent, and that they amounted to 20,750 pounds. <em>Held, </em>that since this evidence tended to affect the. credibility or accuracy of the testimony of the agent, it was properly admitted.</headnotes>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-6\">Before Merour, C.

Gunn and Charles M. Johnson, trading as Gunn, Johnson &amp; Company, against the- Hope Thread Company, defendants, to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract in failing to deliver to complainants 21,250 pounds of yarn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">On the trial before Fell, J., the plaintiff, Johnson, testified, <em>inter </em>alia, that in the latter part of October, 1879, he had called upon Mr. Henry, a yarn broker, \u201cwho professed to act for the Hope Thread Company,\u201d and ordered 21,250 pounds of yarn at the then market .price from 21 to 22\u00a3 cents per pound. \u201cThe order was accepted by Mr. Henry the day I was there. When I called on him, I ashed him what yarns he had for sale. He said he had some for the Hope Thread Company. He told me so at this time. He told me he could place an order with them. He said he would accept an order for the Hope Thread Company. He said he was authorized to sell the Hope Thread Company\u2019s yarn.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">About 3,000 pounds of yarn were received under the contract. Robert Henry, for the plaintiff, testified: \u201cI was authorized to make the contract, which I made with Gunn, Johnson &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The defendants gave evidence to show that they had no authorized general agent in Philadelphia, and then produced Robert Henry, who testified, <em>inter alia: </em>\u2018'G-unn, Johnson &amp; Company wanted at first 30,000 pounds of yarn. I put the order down in my book. I sent the order to the Hope Thread Company, and they did not take the whole order, but agreed to accept half. ... I wrote to other manufacturers about this order. I sent a part of this order to other parties. . . . When I received the letter from the Hope Thread Company, I called on Mr. Johnson, and told him that the Hope Thread Company would accept one half of the order, but no more.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">Upon cross-examination, he said, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cI did not have an interview with Charles M. Glunn at Pawtucket, in which I told him that the Hope Thread Company had just shipped some of the cops by steamer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">They also gave in evidence a letter from R. Henry &amp; Co. to defendants, dated November 3, 1879, saying, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cPlease place an order for Glunn, Johnson &amp; Company, as follows :........Total, 15,750 pounds,\u201d and the reply of the defendants to R. Henry &amp; Company, dated November 4, 1879, saying, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cYours of the 3d inst. is received with order of Gl. J. &amp; Co., which shall have attention.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-8\">On rebuttal, Charles M. Johnson, one of plaintiffs, was recalled, and asked: \u2018 \u2018 What quantities of yarn were entered in Henry\u2019s order-book as sold to you?\u201d Objected to. Objection over-ruled. Exception. (First assignment of error.) The witness answered. \u201cI copied the entries in Henry\u2019s order-book into my memorandum-book at the time. They are in my memorandum-book, and are as follows, (reading the items :) Total number of pounds, 20,750.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-9\">\u2022 Glunn, one of the plaintiffs, being called in rebuttal, counsel offered to prove by him, \u201ca conversation with Henry before the receipt of the cops, in which Henry assured him that defendants had just shipped them some of the cops by steamer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">The evidence was admitted under exceptions. (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-11\">The witness testified: \u201cI had a conversation with Mr. Henry. I met him at Pawtucket. I was on my way to Providence. Henry told me he was going to see the Hope Thread Company. He told me there was some yarn for us on the steamer then leaving for Philadelphia.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-12\">April 17, 1882. \u2014 Verdict for the plaintiffs for $2,300, upon which j udgment was afterward entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The defendants then took out this writ of error, assigning errors as\u2019above..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-4\"><em>J. M. Moyer </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">The question which was allowed to be put to the witness, Johnson, assumed that because R. Henry &amp; Co., who, as merchandise brokers, accepted from the plaintiffs a large order, they thereby necessarily bound the defendants for the entire amount, and ignored the fact that R. Henry &amp; Co. at the same time acted for other producers, and had placed a part of the same order with them. The agents\u2019 full power to contract must be first shown before such a question can be properly put: Moore\u2019s Exec\u2019rs <em>v. </em>Patterson, 28 Pa., 505; Hays <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 Watts, 525.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">The declarations of a purchasing agent made after the completion of the purchase are not admissible in evidence against the principal in an action by the vendor: Butter-field \u00ab. Blanchard, 2 Code R., 31.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-7\"><em>John G. Johnson </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-8\">No exception of any sort or kind to the proof of R. Henry &amp; Co.\u2019s agency, or to the Court\u2019s instructions concerning it, was taken, and the fact of its existence was found by the jury. The question put to Johnson, one of the plaintiffs below, and for the allowance of which it is argued the Court below erred, was in contradiction of Henry, who had sworn that he had only agreed with him to sell him a smaller quantity, while Johnson could prove by his answer that he had actually entered in his books at the time a larger quantity as sold. We concede that the declarations of a purchasing agent, made after the completion of the contract, are not admissible in evidence against the principal in an action by the vendor. Henry, however, -was not only the selling, but also the delivering agent; and his declamtions bearing upon a matter important to the issue were properly admissible.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b389-9\">Januaey 15, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AgV\">\u2014 Pee Cijeiam :</author>\n<p id=\"Ayl\">The evidence covered by both specifications of error was in rebuttal. In the first it tended to affect the credibility or accuracy of the testimony of the witness Henry. As he acted in the capacity of both purchasing and delivering agent, his declarations, while so acting, as to shipping tlie goods were properly admitted to affect his principal. W e discover no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Judgment affirmed. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
