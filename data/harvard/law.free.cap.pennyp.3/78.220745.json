Plea, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-12\">The facts as they appeared at the trial before Stowe, J., were as follows: On April 8, 1881, the plaintiff purchased for two dollars a sleeping-car ticket, entitling him to a berth in the sleeping coach \u201c Bordentown,\u201d running from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. The berth designated by the ticket was the upper one in the second section from the rear door on the left of, the car. The plaintiff retired immediately upon the train leaving Philadelphia, which was at 11.50* p. m. He took off his coat and vest, and put his watch, which was valued at $250, and his pocket-book, containing about $55, into the inside pocket of his vest. He then wrapped his vest up and placed it under the corner of the mattress farthest from the aisle outside. He was soon asleep, and did not wake until the train reached Huntingdon at seven o\u2019clock in the morning. He was then aroused by the passenger conductor asking for his railroad ticket. He found the ticket outside the pocket-book. The money had been taken. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>watch was also gone. He called the conductor, and a dispatch was sent forward to Tyrone, where detectives met the train and searched part of the passengers, but the missing property could not be found. There were two Pullman cars on the train, one sleeper and a hotel car. Five men wrere in charge of these cars, the conductor, a porter for the sleeper, and a cook and two waiters for the hotel car. The conductor kept watch, in accordance with the company\u2019s regulations, sitting on a camp-stool at the end of the aisle next to the large state-room until three o\u2019clock. He then went to sleep, leaving the car in the sole charge of the porter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">Two passengers had taken berths at Philadelphia for Altoona, and they left the train at Harrisburg.

(Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-19\">The Court charged the jury, <em>inter alia:</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-20\">\u201cWe used to ride around in stage coaches ; if robbed while in them the company, being under no obligation to \u2022carry a guard, was not responsible for the robbery, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>though you might go to sleep, and they knew perfectly well you would go to sleep, or ought to suppose you would, for a man could not ride half a dozen days or nights without going to sleep; but in the case of a sleeping-car company, the great convenience and inducement held out to passengers is that they will give them a comfortable night\u2019s rest. They notify them they will make them pay for it, and say to them, you may go to sleep. The principal part of the arrangement is the advantage the passenger will have over the ordinary car, that he can lie down and go to sleep. When you have gone to sleep, of course, you can\u2019t take care of yourself^ everybody knows that, and for that very reason'the fact that the company notifies you to lie down and shut your eyes and go to sleep and thus become helpless, it is their duty to take care of you while yon do sleep \u2014 not that they are insurers, not that they say you shall not be robbed or cannot be robbed, but they will use reasonable and ordinary care to prevent people intruding upon you and picking your pockets or carrying off your clothes while you are asleep. That is the principle that should underlie all of these cases, and it strikes me it is founded on good sense and good logic. They know that there are certain dangers to the sleeping passengers; their experience, common sense, without that, would say that there were dangers. They know that anybody and everybody, provided they are ordinarily respectable looking, can ride in their cars. They know the possibility of robbery, and they, therefore, when they no-tify you to close your eyes and rest, say to you and me, we will not say you shall not be robbed, but we will say we will exercise a reasonable and ordinary care to protect you from robbery. Applying that principle, you will inquire: Lid, or did not, this company, at the time this transaction occurred, on this particular car, do its duty, and if so; did the parties it had employed do their duty in guarding the car that night against just such a robbery as occurred? We have it in evidence that the company has done its whole duty as a company. They require a constant watch to be kept, some person in the body of the car where the sleepers are, watching continuously; Mr. Smithley and the conductor both say that. If watch was kept by one, I apprehend it would be sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">\u201cOf course there are many cases that no protection could guard against. It is apparent that these berths must be made in such a way that the head-boards may be easily moved \u2014 slipped out \u2014 and, without you would keep a watchman at every berth, there might be some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>fellow so expert as to be able to move one out and not be detected, just as many thieves can stand right before your face and talk to you and at the same time pick your pocket, and you never suspect it. It is a sleight of hand that seems to be peculiar. Against thefts of that kind the company are not bound to protect you ; but they are bound to protect you against such thefts as reasonable care will guard against. In this case, the evidence satisfies me, and it would seem that is the reasonable conclusion from the testimony \u2014 that, however, is for the jury \u2014 first, that the regulations of this company were reasonable and prosper. They kept a guard, according to their regulations, and intended to keep a continuous watch, so that a man sitting there could see everything that was going on without interfering with the sleepers. He would have no business to be away, except in a special case. They station him at the end of this little aisle, where he can see the whole length of the car, see anybody undertaking to crawl from one berth to another, or anybody in the aisle. It is lit up sufficiently to be able to distinguish objects. These Pullman cars seem to have been sufficiently manned. There were five employes altogether. One man seems to me to have been quite enough at a time to guard a car in the way that ordinary care would require it to be guarded. The conductor says he was awake in the car till three o\u2019clock, I believe it was, says he was there continuously and watched continuously. So far, if that is true, he must have done his duty. He left his post of observation or watch, and put the colored porter upon guard. Now, the question for you to determine, if you find that reasonable care was exercised, as I think it was, up to that time, is, did this colored man do his duty ? There is no evidence to indicate that he was not a sufficiently proper man. Therefore, the company would not be liable for having employed a man not fit for the purpose. [Did he do his duty? The regulations required him to stay in the aisle of the car continuously, to watch there continuously, until the danger was over \u2014 until daylight. Did he do it ? If so, where is the evidence of it ? We have his own declarations that he was on guard, coming from the conductor; but we have also his own declarations to the plaintiff that he went out of that apartment for a time to black a pair of boots or shoes. If he went out of that aisle, even for a very few minutes, and during that time this robbery occurred, and the jury believe that if he had been in his place of observation it would not and could not have occurred without detection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the company is liable, because he failed to do his duty to that extent that it allowed this robbery to be done. It was his fault, and is visited on the company, although they may have done everything they thought right to get a proper man. \u2018 Watching\u2019 is not simply to be on watch nominally, it is to be on watch actually, to be there, not under pretense of continuing there; there till you get tired and then go out and lie down or do something else, and let the very thing occur you are put there to avoid ; watching must be continuous and active. He could not watch a car full of sleeping people very well if he were in the front part in those little rooms or ante-chambers, or whatever they are called, where people dress and wash.\u201d] (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\">February 24, 1883, verdict for plaintiff, on which judgment was afterward entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">The defendant then took a writ of error, assigning errors as above set forth.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-6\"><em>II.

Conceding that the company is not liable in this action as an inn-keeper or common carrier, yet a reasonable and proper degree of care is imposed on the company. Whether it did exercise that degree of care under the circumstances was for the jury. The main object in taking passage in such a car is to permit the passenger to sleep. While in that helpless condition, a duty rests on the company to provide reasonable care and precaution against the valuables of a passenger being stolen from his bed or from the clothes on his person. This is not the case of a robbery by force and violence, but by stealthy larceny. Unless a watchman be kept constantly in view of the center aisle of the car, larceny from a sleeping passenger may be committed without the thief being detected in the act. While the fact that another passenger in the same car was robbed the same night was not relevant to prove that the defendant in error was in fact robbed, yet it was admissible as bearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>absence of proper, care by the company. This case was submitted to the jury in an able and correct charge. We see no error of which the company can complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
