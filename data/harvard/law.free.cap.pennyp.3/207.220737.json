They do not disqualify any person who was competent before. Clark would have been a competent witness before these acts. His liability was fixed and determined by the judgment previously entered against him, and the case was tried solely as between plaintiff and sureties upon a defense personal to themselves, in -which Clark had no interest: Good \u00ae. Calvert, 1 Penny-packer, 140 ; Miller \u00ae. Stem, 2 Barr, 286 ; Talmage \u00ae. Burlingame, 9 <em>Id., </em>21; Simpson \u00ae. Bovard, 24 P. P.

In this case the liability is several as well as joint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-11\">The evidence of Clark does not contradict the note, but merely explains the receipt, and rebuts any presumption that might arise as to an extension of time.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b206-12\">October 1, 1883. \u2014</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AnT\">Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"AIr\">Clark was not a party in the issue being tried. He was not interested in the result. As to him, the judgment had become final nine months before he was offered as a witness. His liability was fixed absolutely. The defense set up by the plaintiffs in error was personal as to the sureties. It did not raise the question of consideration or original disability on the note. The makers of the note were jointly and severally bound. The witness testified voluntarily to rebut a presumption which the sureties sought to raise from the payment of interest by the witness. The defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the sureties being purely personal, the witness was competent for the plaintiffs below: Talmage <em>v. </em>Burlingame, 9 Barr, 21; Simpson\u2019s Executor <em>v. </em>Bovard, 24 P. F. Smith, 351; Good v. Calvert, 1 Pennypacker, 140. It is very doubtful whether the receipt unexplained could have operated to the injury of the sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
