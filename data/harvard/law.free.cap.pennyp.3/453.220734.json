Bek, deceased, defendant, awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia county, to determine the genuineness of the signature to, and the existence of, a valid and sufficient consideration for a certain obligation or due bill. The due bill was written in German, and the following is the translation: \u201cI, the undersigned, L. I). Bek, acknowledge, by these presents, that I am indebted to Frederick Gentner, 314 Brown street, who has been teacher in my native place, Bissengen, on the Enz, kingdom of Wurtemburg, in the sum of $5,000 (five thousand dollars), for services he rendered to me, as well as. for recompensation, and so forth, which sum shall be paid to him, or his heirs, besides interest thereof from January 1, 1875, but not until after my death, by my executor, whoever it may be, upon producing this due bill, without any objection whatsoever, and before any of the legacies which I make in my last will shall be paid, because this is a debt of honor, and shall be paid first.

The doctor keeps upon his screen such papers as I hold in my hand and then for the purpose of use in court, the paper is placed upon this screen, and the image is thrown upon the paper to see if the two are identical, or, in other words, to prove the correctness of the drawing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The witness was then asked: \u201cWill you please show to the jury the drawing of the signature to the alleged due bill ? \u201d Objected to.

St., Rep. 9, \u201c special skill\u201d may be called upon to assist, \u201cwhen the common intelligence\u201d supposed to be possessed by the jury is not fully \u201c adequate to the occasion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-16\">We contend that the expert should be allowed to give his conclusions of skill, and illustrate these conclusions .for the assistance of the common intelligence of the jury, by showing to the jury the special characteristics and uniformity of construction of the genuine signatures in evidence. The minds of the jurymen being directed to these special characteristics, they would then take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>genuine signatures, and, comparing the contested signature with them, conclude if the latter is simulated or not: Travis \u00ab. Brown, <em>supra; </em>Ballentine White, 77 Penna., 20; Fulton <em>v. </em>Hood, 34 Penna., 365 ; Reese <em>v. </em>Reese, 7 W. N.

The evidence was amply sufficient to justify the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">We discover no error in the rejection of evidence. Some offered was clearly irrelevant. A magnified drawing of the outer lines of the signature is only the copy of a part thereof, and was clearly inadmissible for the purpose offered. It is not like a photograph of the whole signature. Comparison may be made by the jury between the disputed signature and those of the party well authenticated, and also by witnesses who have knowledge of his handwriting, but this rule does not extend to experts. They may testify whether a signature be forged or simulated, and give their conclusions: Travis <em>v. </em>Brown, 7 Wright, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
