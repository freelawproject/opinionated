N. Johnson for certain rooms, being part of a hotel property situate on the north-west part of lot No. 121, in the borough of Waynesburg, in Greene county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-12\">On the trial in the Court below before Willson, P. J., the following facts appeared :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-13\">On January 14, 1868, Maria Sutton, the plaintiff, purchased from Dr. D. W. Braden the property in dispute. She made improvements upon the property and used it as a hotel, calling it \u201cThe Sutton House.\u201d When the plaintiff commenced the hotel business, she employed Lewis N. Johnson as bar-keeper and general manager, and as such he continued in her employ until May or June, 1871, when she went to the West. She returned in the fall of 1871, and became housekeeper for Johnson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-14\">The plaintiff showed title from Braden and rested. The defendants then produced evidence to show that immediately before starting for the West, plaintiff executed a deed to Johnson for the hotel property; that Johnson died, and his title vested in defendants; that after search, the deed could not be found ; that the consideration money was $4,000 ; that a large package of money was handed by Johnson to Mrs. Sutton at the time of the delivery of tlie deed, and that this package was said by the parties to be the consideration money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Plaintiff, in rebuttal, offered to prove by Jonathan Witlatch and Robert King \u201c that they heard Maria Sutton several times demand the payment of the purchase money for the property in dispute from Lewis N. Johnson, and Lewis N. Johnson\u2019s admission that he owed it and wasn\u2019t able to pay it, and if she collected it, it would sell him out and break him up ; and her repeated statements to him that if he didn\u2019t pay the money, that she would enter the notes against the property and collect it, and that after they had conversed upon it on several occasions-for two or three weeks in this way, Mrs. Sutton said to Lewis that she would delay the matter no longer \u2014that she would either have the money or enter the notes, and that Lewis got up and says: \u2018I\u2019ll soon fix it,\u2019 and went out, and came back in a few moments with the deed and the notes, and put them in the stove and burned them up, and says: \u2018There, now, you are paid. You have got your property back just as you had it before.\u2019 This to be followed by evidence that Lewis Johnson then rented the house for the purpose of keeping a hotel, and had it under rent from that time until his death. This for the purpose of showing that Mr. Johnson had surrendered the property to Mrs. Sutton for a valuable consideration, and that he had never paid the purchase money, and for the purpose of estopping the defendants from setting up any title they may have under the alleged deed from Maria Sutton to Johnson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-6\">This testimony was admitted under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">(First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\">The plaintiff then gave evidence of the facts set forth in the offer, and fixed the date about February, 1872.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-9\"><em>John B. </em>Parker, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALkF\">testified that he had a conversation with Johnson after plaintiff returned from the West, about a purchase of the property, that Johnson said \u201cwhat was yet due from him would have to be advanced,\u201d that he said $3,000, the balance of the purchase money, would have to go Mrs. Sutton, and that in a later conversation he said he had \u201c burned the article, the deed, and the notes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-10\">Numerous other witnesses testified to subsequent declarations and acts of Johnson, going to show that he claimed no ownership in the property, and that he was in possession under a parol lease from the plaintiff, and that she paid for repairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-11\">Defendants, in sur-rebuttal, called <em>Samuel H.

Johnson, for the purpose of satisfying him, the witness, who was then acting as counsel for the assignee of Hiram Smith in the sale of some property that Mr. Johnson was talking about buying; that Mr.-Johnson showed to him that deed for the purpose of satisfying him, as the counsel for the assignee, that he was able to buy and pay for the property which was then up for sale, and that he asserted that it was the deed for this corner property to him from Maria Sutton. For the purpose of showing the strong probability that this was the deed that Mr. Montgomery saw executed and delivered in the spring of 1871, there being no evidence that there was any other deed from Mrs. Sutton, to Lewis N. Johnson than the one in question.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-7\">Objection by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-8\">The Court. \u201c So far as you confine your offer to Johnson, having shown the deed to the witness, of course it is competent, if he saw it.

So far as you offer to show that the deed was exhibited to.

Johnson to purchase and pay for the property in dispute in the spring of 1871, and for the further purpose of repelling the allegation of the plaintiff that notes were given for the balance of the purchase money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-11\">Objection by plaintiff sustained and exception sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-12\">(Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-13\">Defendants offered in evidence the record of the Court of Quarter Sessions for the year 1871, showing that Lewis Johnson hadn\u2019t a license in February, 1872, for the purpose of contradicting Whitlatch and \u201cBobby\u201d King, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>testified that the bar was open, and that he was selling liquor and had license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">Objection by plaintiff sustained.

The plaintiffs in error claim title under her, and sought to prove it by parol evidence. Under the facts found by the jury, and on sufficient evidence, we think they could not defend their possession under the deed which Johnson once held, but which he had voluntarily and fraudulently destroyed. It had never been recorded. He had not paid the purchase money. With the express purpose of avoiding payment of the notes which he had given for the purchase money, and with the avowed purpose of giving up to his vendor all interest in the property, he burned the notes and the deed, declaring to his vendor as he threw them in the stove: \u201cNow the property is yours, as it was before.\u201d She gave no consent to this destruction. She had no previous knowledge of his intention \u2014 having destroyed her evidence of his indebtedness. She accepted the situation. He gave possession to her, which she and her tenants retained until after his death. It is not the case of a parol sale from Johnson to Mrs. Sutton, so as to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>mit the Statute of Frauds to defeat the effect of his act. It is such an act of spoliation, followed by the subsequent action of the parties, as to estop him and his heirs from invoking the aid of that deed. He did not attempt to do it.
