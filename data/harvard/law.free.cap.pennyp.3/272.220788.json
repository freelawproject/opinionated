Upon the will, as probated, there were four tears on the left-hand side extending one half inch toward the ruled lines, and reaching to within seven eighths of an inch of the writing. They were made by tearing the will in one place when it was folded. They were not in it when it was returned to the testator by his counsel, and were in it when he died.

William Stewart, a brother-in-law of testator, and the custody of it was retained by said scrivener until his death, and after that it remained in the custody of Robert A. Stewart, his son, and the testator\u2019s nephew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-9\">I may, in this connection, take judicial notice of the fact that said Robert is a gentleman learned in the law, and had been a member of the bar of said county for some time prior to the conversations referred to by him in his testimony, and had by him with the testator relating to this will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-10\">The testator told said Robert one or two years before his death, \u2018that he did not intend it (said will) should be in existence \u2019 when he died ; and, in the same conversation, he requested said Robert to give him possession of it, which he, in a few days, did. A short time after it was returned to him, he, in a conversation, said to the said Robert: \u2018 Oh, Robert, I destroyed that will, * * I put it away where nobody will find it, in a safe place.\u2019 Said Robert then said to him, that that \u2018 would not do. If you were to die, they would find it, and that would not be a legal revocation. I then explained to him to destroy a will, it must be burned, torn, or canceled, and my recollection is that I got Purdon\u2019s Digest and read him the act of Assembly relating to revocation of wills.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-12\">A short time after this conversation, testator remarked as follows to said Robert: \u2018That he had destroyed the will. * * He had torn it and burned it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-13\">Testator told P. E. Shipler, the appellant, two or three days before his death, that he had destroyed the will written for him by William Stewart, and that his wife did not have it in her possession then, and he also said to him, in the presence of Dr. Monroe, the day before the night he died: \u2018Ess, (the said appellant meaning,) so certain as I lie on this bed, I destroyed that will; I tore it in two and burned one half of it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-14\">As the appellant offered no testimony tending to show that the appellee forcibly or surreptitiously took possession of and preserved said will until the testator\u2019s death, as charged in the petition, with a view of thereby avoid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ing such alleged revocation of it, and as the appellee testifies she did not, I cannot find as a fact that she did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">The will was written on a full sheet of legal cap paper, xinited at the top in the usual style of such paper, and was folded in the form lawyers usually fold such papers, to wit: in four folds. There was no writing on the outer sheet except an indorsement in the handwriting of the scrivener, \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">On the page containing the commencement of the will, and above the highest ruled line thereon, and also above all the writing in the will, and in the lead pencil handwriting of the testator, are the following words in this form:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">\u2018LAST WILL OF JOSEPH SHIPLER.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-9\">These words were not written there when said Robert A. Stewart returned the will to the testator as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-10\">The paper upon which the will is written has three perpendicularly ruled lines on the left-hand margin, and one inch and seven sixteenths of an inch from the extreme edge of the paper. There are four tears in the left-hand side of the will equi distant from each other, and extending one half inch toward said perpendicular lines. Numbering them downward, the first and third incline upward and the second and fourth downward. These tears were made by tearing the will in one place when it was folded into four folds; for when it is so folded, they are directly opposite one another both in length and direction. They were not in the will when it was returned to the testator by said Robert A. Stewart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-11\">The. evidence taken by the examiner is conflicting as to whether they were in the will when the testator died. The appellant and Robert A. Stewart testify they saw them in it the evening of the funeral, and H. A. Gamble, a clerk in the register\u2019s office, testifies they were in it when it was brought to the office for probate, and that they looked as old then as when he was testifying, and that they could not have been made within ten days preceding the time when the will was produced for probate. Robert Stewart had possession of the will the evening of the funeral, and kept it three or four days ; and he testifies they were not made while he had it; but he does not state whether or not they were then in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-12\">On the other hand, the appellee, her daughter, Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Helen M. Dight, and her husband, William M. Uight, testify they were not in it in the evening of the funeral.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">The appellant and appellee have each a direct legal interest in the result of the appeal. But the appellant\u2019s two corroborating witnesses have neither a direct nor indirect interest therein, whilst the two corroborating witnesses of the appellee have an indirect interest in supporting the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">In view of two of the appellant\u2019s witnesses being disinterested, I find, as a fact, that these tears were in the will when the testator died. I also find, as a fact, that the testator tore off and burned the outside sheet of the will, but there was no writing thereon save the indorsement, \u201cLast will of Joseph Shipler.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\">The appellee testifies that she showed the testator said will on Wednesday or Thursday before his death, and that he said \u2018 this will is a good will.\u2019 He died Friday morning. She also testifies that he wanted to erase a fif tydollar annual legacy he had therein given to his mother, but she persuaded him not to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\">The will had not been in the <em>actual </em>and <em>exclusive </em>possession of the testator for some considerable time before his death. There is no direct or indirect evidence that he intentionally made said four tears in the will, <em>animo revocandi, </em>nor evidence of any nature from which such fact should be inferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\">The revocation of this will is claimed to have been made under the thirteenth section of the act of 8 April, 1833, P. L., <em>250, </em>which reads, \u2018no will in writing concerning any real estate shall be repealed, nor shall any devise or direction therein be altered, otherwise than by some other will, or codicil in writing declaring the same,. executed and proved in the same manner as hereinbefore provided, or by burning, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the same by the testator himself, or by some one in his presence and by his express.direction.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\">It is not pretended that the testator repealed or altered this will by making another will, or codicil in writing, but he is alleged to have revoked it by one of the modes designated in the concluding clause of said section, and this clause reads, \u2018 or by burning, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the same by the testator himself, or by some one in his presence and by his express direction.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-10\">\u201cTo comply with the statutory requisition of revocation by destroying, there must be some act of destruction, or towards destruction, done <em>animo revocandi </em>\u2014 mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>words will not suffice.\u2019 Olingan <em>v. </em>Mitclieltree, 31 Pa. St. 25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">That the testator declared he would destroy said will, and that he had done so, are facts fully established by the evidence. But notwithstanding these facts are so established, these further facts are established in the same way, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">1. That he only fully burned, or destroyed, the outside sheet of the paper upon which the will was written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-8\">2. That the only words written on said outside sheet were \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler,\u2019 and these were written by the scrivener.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">3. That the sheet upon .which was written the entire scrip, or body of the will, was neither burned nor destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">4. Indorsed on the upper end of this sheet and directly above the commencement of the will, are these words, and in the following order:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">\u2018LAST WILL OF JOSEPH SHIPLER.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-14\">5. This indorsement is in lead pencil and in the handwriting of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-15\">Before the destruction of said outside sheet, Robert A. Stewart, Esq., a member of this bar, had explained to the testator the different legal modes by which he could, alone, revoke his will, and also read to him said section of said act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-16\">Ordinarily and naturally, a person contemplating the commission of a given act adopts the easiest, if not the most certain, mode of accomplishing it. If the testator intended to destroy his will by burning it, why would he, for that purpose, first separate its sheets ? If he intends to burn one sheet and preserve the other, such separation is not only natural, but necessary. Ordinarily, a person wishing to destroy, by burning, a paper written on a double sheet, would toss both sheets into the fire bodily. But, in this instance, the only sheet worth preserving was carefully separated from the worthless sheet and the latter burned or destroyed, whilst the former was not only retained, but carefully indorsed by the testator, and alleged spoiler, \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler.\u2019 And this indorsement he doubtless intended to remain in lieu of the same indorsement on the back of the destroyed sheet. With the evidence before me, I cannot separate the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>of destroying the outside sheet, and the writing of such indorsement on the preserved sheet. And if this indorsement was written at the same time, oras a part of the <em>res gestee </em>of the act of the testator when he tore off and destroyed said sheet, his intent in writing it overthrows any intent he may, from such tearing and destruction, be presumed to have had of destroying or revoking his will entirely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">Beyond the burning or destruction of said outside sheet, no \u2018 act of destruction or toward destruction done <em>animo revocandi,' </em>is to be found in the evidence, save said tears, which will, hereafter, be noticed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">As there is no evidence of anything having been written on said destroyed sheet, except the indorsement written by the scrivener, \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler,\u2019 neither the appellee nor any third party should be presumed to have had any interest in its destruction. It must not, therefore, be presumed that she or any third party destroyed it for the purpose of removing a cancellation of the will, which the testator may be conjectured to have written thereon, for before any one \u2018 can be fixed with the character of a spoiler, the purport of the paper must be proved to have been what it is surmised to have been.\u2019 McReynolds <em>v. </em>McCord, 6 W., 288.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The four tears are in the left-hand margin of the paper upon which the will is written. They are about one half inch long, and do not approach the writing of the body of the will more closely than about the seven eighths of an inch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">Tearing is not enumerated in said act of 1833 as one of the modes of revoking a will, but if the written body of a will was torn into two or more pieces, and such tearing was shown to have been done by the testator himself, or by some one in his presence and by his express direction, and with the intent on his part of revoking his will, such tearing would constitute a destruction within the meaning of said. act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">I think I have already shown that this will has, \u2022 so far as the evidence shows, never been revoked by \u2018 burning;\u2019 and that it has been revoked by \u2018 canceling or obliterating\u2019 it within the meaning of. those terms as employed in said act, is not, as I understand his counsel, pretended by the appellant. Its \u2018destruction,\u2019 therefore, by tearing, is, under the evidence, the only ground upon which its revocation can possibly be predicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">The words \u2018burning,\u2019 \u2018canceling,\u2019 \u2018obliterating,\u2019 and \u2018 destroying \u2019 in said act are used in their popular sense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and thus used, they secure the object of the Legislature\u2014 a complete manifestation of an executed intention to repeal the will, etc.: Evans\u2019 Appeal, 58 Pa. St., 238. \u2018Each word is expressive by an act done to the paper itself, a mark upon it, evincible of a present intent that it shall not operate as a will. \u2019 <em>Id. </em>\u2018 Declarations both verbal and written (of the testator) are admitted to show with what intent an act of apparent destruction or cancelation was done.\u2019 <em>Id.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">By the expression, \u2018destruction of a will,\u2019 is commonly understood a disintegration and decomposition of the material on which the will is written, but, as we see, destruction can be effected by doing something tantamount thereto, and the whole document, in order to be revoked, need not necessarily be torn, burnt, or otherwise destroyed, but there must be a destruction of so much as to impair the entirety of the will, so that it may be said that the will does not exist in the iflanner framed by the testator: Flood on Wills, 344, <em>et seq., </em>cited in note 28, on page 303 of 1 Jarman on Wills, 5th Am. Ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">This is cited to prove that where it is sought to show a \u2018destroying\u2019 of a will by a testator without proof of his words denoting an <em>animo </em>r&amp;oocandi, \u2018 there must be a destruction of so much as to impair the entirety of the will, so that it may be said that the will does not exist in the manner framed by the testator.\u2019 Now, these tears may be cut away from the paper entirely, and yet the will will still exist precisely \u2018 in the manner framed by the testator.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-8\">\u2018 The degree of tearing, canceling, or obliterating necessary to the revocation of a will is not fixed by the statute. This must depend upon the circumstances of the case. If a will be thrown into the fire and consumed, or if it be torn into many pieces by the testator, the violent presumption would be that the instrument was burnt or torn <em>animo </em>r&amp;oocandi, and it would require strong evidence to rebut this presumption; but if a will be only slightly burned or torn, there would arise no presumption from the act itself of the intention or the <em>quo animo </em>with which it had been done, and the will would not be revoked; but if the slightest burning or the slightest tearing be accompanied with satisfactory evidence, drawn aliunde, of the intention to revoke, the statute will be satisfied and the will revoked :\u2019 Johnson <em>v. </em>Brailsford, 2 Nott and McCord, (South Car.,) 272, S. C. 10, Am. De., 601. The act under which this case was ruled differs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>. from ours only in including tearing as a mode of revocation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The evidence claimed by the appellant to show that these tears were made by the testator is contained in the following extract from testimony of Robert A. Stewart: \u2018A short time after this, he (the testator) was again in the office, and he told me that he had destroyed the will. I asked him how. My best recollection is, he told me he had torn it and burned it. And I replied that that would be good and the hiding would not,\u2019 and in the following from the evidence of P. E. Shipler, the appellant: \u2018I told him that I thought he had a will that Uncle William had written for him. He said he had had such a will, but had destroyed it. I told him that I thought mother had it then in her possession. He said she had not, and repeated again, he had destroyed it.\u2019 * * * \u2018As soon as I sat down, he turned to me and said : \u2018 Ess, so certain as I lie on thfcs bed, I destroyed that will. I tore it into two and burned one half of it.\u2019 These extracts Conclusively show the testator to be of the opinion that Ms will was not revoked by tearing alone, for he always declared he had destroyed it by tearing and burning it, and never by tearing alone. It is, by any fair interpretatation of his language, impossible to find that he ever was in the <em>animo revocandi </em>by tearing alone. If the written sheet of the will with his own indorsement, \u2018 last will of Joseph Shipler,\u2019 thereon, was not in existence, there would, under the evidence, be no difficulty in finding a revocation; but it is present, and \u2018will not down.\u2019 That Joseph Shipler willfully falsified in his dying declarations upon his known death-bed, as to having destroyed this will, it is impossible to believe but that he did so mistakenly is established' beyond the possibility of doubt by its existence and production. My own theory is, that when he tore off and burned the outside sheet, and so indorsed the written sheet, he intended to destroy the latter sheet in the future, but neglected to do so for some time, and when he wished to do so, he could not find it, And he could, after several fruitless searches for it, easily and naturally fall into the belief that he had destroyed it. In such honest belief he doubtless died. But no intention to destroy in the future, even if the testator honestly but mistakenly believes at the time of his death that he has executed such intention, works a revocation : Clingan 0. Mitchp.1 tree, <em>supra. </em>But returning to the tears. The will is not shotvn by the testimony of any'one to have been exclusively in the possession of the testator at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>time of his death. In fact, the personal evidence of the appellee shows it was not. As others had had it, no presumption arises that the testator made the tears. There is no direct evidence that he did, nor is there, as before explained, any that he threatened to destroy his will by tearing of this kind. Tears like these, which leave the will to \u2018exist in the manner framed by the testator\u2019 might possibly work a revocation, if they were clearly shown <em>aliunde </em>to have been made by him <em>animo renocandi. </em>But such evidence is utterly wanting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">It must be borne in mind that the proper legal modes of revoking his will had been clearly explained to the testator, and the act of Assembly on that subject read to him. In the light of common sense it is impossible to believe that a testator, whether lawyer or layman, intelligent or ignorant, on the modes of revocation, would attempt to revoke his will by destroying it through the means of tearing it, and so tear it as to .leave it to \u2018 exist in the manner framed\u2019 by himself, or in other words, without tearing off his signature or tearing some of its written lines or words. If any presumption could arise that these tears were made by the testator <em>animo renocandi, </em>it would be followed by another presumption, to wit: that he had changed his mind before tearing the paper into the written body of the will, and, therefore, desisted from tearing the body of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">The meaning of the words \u2018burning, canceling, obliterating, or destroying\u2019 as used in said act of 1833, are thus explained by Judge Strong in Evans\u2019 Appeal, <em>supra: </em>\u2018 It is true we have to do with the meaning of the words \u2018canceling, obliterating, and destroying\u2019 as used by the Legislature, but there is nothing in the statute that requires us to attach to them any unusual signification. Let it be admitted that, collocated as they are, we are required to consider them as defining acts of a similar nature. We do. All are acts done to the will itself, and they are not used in their absolutely literal sense. Even burning does not mean entire consumption by fire. This is not claimed, and under a statute very similar it has been so ruled: Bibb <em>ex clem. </em>Mole <em>n. </em>Thomas, 2 William Blackstone, 1043 ; Heed <em>n. </em>Harris, 33 E. C. L., 57. Nor is obliteration, as meant in the act, nothing short of effacing the letters in the will, scratching them out, or blotting them so completely that they cannot be read. A line drawn through the writing is, doubtless, obliteration, though it may leave it as legible as it was before. So the destruction spoken of is not necessarily annihilation, or a change into other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>forms of matter. Tearing into fragments is unquestionably destruction, though the fragments maybe re-united. All the words are used in their popular sense, and thus used, they secure the object the Legislature had in view, a complete manifestation of an executed intention to repeal. Each word is expressive by an act done to the paper itself, a mark upon it, evincible of a present intent that it shall not operate as a will.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">There is not one word of this will which is wholly or partially burned, canceled, obliterated, or destroyed. Nor is there a tear or tears upon it \u2018 evincible of a present intent that it shall not operate as a will.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">There is no evidence tending to show whether these tears were made before or after the written sheet of the will was indorsed, \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler.\u2019 They are, therefore, just as likely to have been made before as after that, and if before, no possible presumption can arise that they were made by him <em>animo revocandi. </em>That they were made by violence is apparent, but whether this violence was inflicted intentionally is not shown by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">Even if they were shown to have been made by him <em>animo revocandi, </em>and no explanation given as to why he did not extend them into the written text of the will, or its signature, it is extremely doubtful whether the law would regard such tearing as a destruction, and, therefore, a revocation of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">The issue prayed for should not be granted unless the evidence is sufficient to warrant a jury in finding that the testator did revoke his will by tearing it into two pieces and burning one of them or one half of the will, or that he so tore it as to be the equivalent of its destruction <em>animo revocandi, </em>and in my opinion no such evidence has been adduced, because:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">1. No declared intent to revoke is a revocation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-10\"><em>2. </em>The testator\u2019s declarations that he had destroyed his will by tearing it into two pieces, and burning one of them or one half of the will, are as evidence of revocation more than neutralized by the production of the sheet iipon which is written the entire and unblemished text of the will, including the signatures of the testator and witnesses, and with the indorsement th\u00e9rein in his own handwriting, \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-11\">3. To find that the will was revoked by said tears, the following inferences must be first drawn :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-12\">I. That they were made subsequent to the testator tearing the sheets of the will apart and burning or destroying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>one of them, and indorsing the other, \u2018Last will of Joseph Shipler.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-4\">II. That he made them <em>animo revooandi.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">But there is no evidence to warrant a jury in drawing the first of these inferences, and even if there was, the law of evidence would not permit a jury to draw the second one from the first; for, in law, inference upon inference is not tolerated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\">And now, April 9, 1883, issue as prayed for refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">P.- E.

Tearing or burning a blank leaf does not ixxdicate an intention to destroy the will. Even if it were done <em>animo revocandi, </em>it would not amount to a revocation under the statute: Heise \u00bb. Heise, 31 Penna., 249 ; Evans\u2019 Ap., 58 <em>Id., </em>238. A will cannot be revoked by parol. There must be such an injury with intent to revoke as destroys the entirety of the will: Reed <em>v. </em>Harris, 6 A. and E., 209.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-12\">Appellants\u2019 counsel in reply.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-13\">If the intent be perfect, the slightest, most imperfect act will carry it into effect, provided it be such as the law prescribes, and be done to the paper on which the will is written. It is impossible to draw the line or to establish the degree in which the act mxxst be done. The acts and declarations of testator add weight to the presumption that he intended to repeal the will: 1 Jarman on Wills, 289 \u2022 Redfield on Wills, 318 ; White \u25a0\u00bb.
