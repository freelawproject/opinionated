D. Baer, the plaintiff, as sub-oontractoz*, by which Baer was to do a certain amount of work on the first or basement floor for a fixed price or round sum of money, to wit: $270, and also another contract by which he was to receive $25 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>extra work. All the work done by Baer was done by virtue of these contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-4\">Defendants submitted the following point for charge, which the Court reserved : \u201cThat under the lien as filed with the amendment thereto, together with the pleadings and evidence, there can be no recovery on the part of the plaintiff and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">The Court reserved the question upon this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">March 9, 1883. \u2014 Verdict for plaintiff for $152 53.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">The Court entered judgment for the plaintiff upon the point reserved, and filed, the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">\u201cOn the 2d of October, 1881, a rule was obtained to strike off the lien, which was denied without prejudice. Afterwards the lien was amended under act of lltli June, 1879, whereupon a special plea in the nature of demurrer was filed, and on the trial of the cause the point reserved raised the same question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">We may have been over-cautious in allowing the case to take this course, yet still the question may here be considered and ruled: Fahnestock <em>v. </em>Speer, 11 Norris, 146.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-10\">The point submitted involves two questions : <em>First, </em>is the amendment within the meaning and intent of the act of 1879, and if so, <em>second, </em>is the amended lien sufficient ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-11\">It is true that the amendment came late, but if allowable at all, it might be made in any stage of the proceeding by the terms of the act. Was then the amendment within the meaning of the act? We have had but little construction hitherto of the statute, as it is of but comparatively recent date. The question was raised in Philadelphia, in Young <em>v. </em>Harper, 12 W. N. C., 304, and the amendment there asked for allowed by the Court, but under the practice of the Court to allow amendments of a general character. In Fahnestock <em>v. </em>Wilson, 9 W. N. C., 385, an amendment similar to the one in this case was refused, reversing the Court below, but on the ground that the act of 1879 was not retroactive. In delivering the opinion of the Court, however, Mr. Justice Trunkey remarked (in answer to the position of counsel), that \u201cthe act (of 1870) confers an important right to the claimant, and subjects the building to additional liabilities and its owner to increased risks.\u201d The words of the act, viz: \u201cTo permit amendments conducive to justice and a fair trial upon the merits,\u201d would indicate that it was the intention of the Legislature to allow all amendments going to cure defects and remove technical objections.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-12\">The plaintiff, being a sub-contractor, is denied the benefit of the act of 1845, and must, proceed under or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>pend upon the act of 1836: Russell <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 Wr., 47. Does his amended lien or bill of particulars then come up to the requirements of the act of 1836 ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">The only objection we can see to it is that the bill of particulars has but one date, but the date specifies that it was the ending of the work, while in the body of the lien it is set forth that the work was done within six months past. The date is December 3, 1880, and the lien was filed April 21, 1881. The items in the claim are given, even to the names of the workmen and the <em>per diem, </em>charge for each, and the number of days. One date has been sustained: Rush <em>v. </em>Able, 9 Norris, 153; Calhoun <em>v. </em>Mahon, 2 Harris, 56; see, also, Bayer <em>v. </em>Reeside, <em>Ibid., </em>167.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">The authorities on this question are admirably collected in Trickett\u2019s Law of Liens, pp. 63, 64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">The cases largely relied upon-by defendants\u2019 counsel,' Shields <em>v. </em>Garrett, 5 W. N. C., 120, and Gray <em>v. </em>Dick, 1 Out., 142, ruled questions which came up under the act of 1849, applicable to Philadelphia and Chester counties only, and has no similarity to the act of 1879. The act of \u00cd849, as to these counties, might be looked upon as a mere supplement to the act of 1845.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">After all the research I could give \u2014 and the question is not without difficulty \u2014 I am satisfied that judgment should be entered on verdict. And now, July 30,1883, the point submitted, and which was reserved, is refused, and judgment on the verdict to be entered of record on payment of the jury fee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-9\">Defendants then took out a writ of error, and assigned as error the action of the Court in entering judgment for the plaintiff upon the point reserved, in holding that, though the evidence was a contract for a specified sum, the amendment cured the defect in the lien as originally filed, and in not striking off the lien on the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-10\"><em>W. H. Klingensmith </em>and <em>John Barton </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-11\">The lien, as originally filed, was defective, because it set out that a particular amount of work was done by a sub-contractor for a fixed price. The Court should have determined this question upon the motion to strike off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-12\">The testimony shows a contract for around or lumping charge ; and no recovery can therefore be had upon the amended statement filed. When a sub-contractor makes a contract for a definite amount of work for a stipulated sum, he cannot recover upon a lien filed against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>owner: Russell \u00ab. Bell, 8 Wr. 47; Lee \u00ab. Burke, 16 P. F. Sm., 336; Fahnestock \u00ab. Speer, 11 Norris, 146 ; Gray \u00ab. Dick, 9 W. N. 0., 555; Shields \u00ab. Garrett, 5 W. N. C., 120.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-6\">The act of 11th June, 1879, P. L.,122, allows amendments in formal parts of the lien only. It should be strictly construed like other acts relating to mechanics\u2019 liens: Fahnestock \u00ab.Wilson, 9 W. N. 0., 385. The act only relates to the adding to or striking out the names of owners, contractors, and claimants : Shields \u00ab. Garrett, 5 W. N. C., 120 ; Gray \u00ab.

Under the act of 1S36, it was held that a sub-contractor could not charge the building according to his contract with the contractor, but only according to the work done or materials furnished, though it may be for a round sum: Russell \u00ab. Bell, 8 Wr., 47; Lee \u00ab. Burke, 16 P. F. Sm., 339. Even if the original lien was irregular, the amendment fully apprized the owner of the nature of the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-10\">The act of 1879 permits all \u201camendments conducive to justice and a fair trial on the merits\u201d: Young \u00ab.
