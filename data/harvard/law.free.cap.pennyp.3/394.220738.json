A. James, administrator of the estate of A. J. Bucknor, deceased, garnishee, who was the father of A. J. Bucknor, junior, and who died December 13, 1877, intestate, leaving a widow and six children, including the said A. J. Bucknor, junior, who died in November, 1878. The administrator hied two accounts, one on September 30, 1878, and one on February 28,1879. The adjudications under these accounts did not pass upon any questions of set-off or deductions, but simply ordered that the share of A. J. Bucknor, junior, should be retained by the accountant until the final determination of the above attachments. Subsequently, upon petition, the Court opened the adjudications and recommitted the accounts to the auditing judge, Hanna, P. J., before whom it was shown, by the production of the record and proceedings in bankruptcy against Bucknor, McCammon &amp; Co., that A. J. Bucknor, junior, was, at the date of the death of his father, indebted to his father in the sum of $13,203 39, upon a due bill for $10,000, dated January 1, 1867, payable on demand ; in the sum of $3,395 46 upon a note of Bucknor, McCammon &amp; Co., due October 5, 1870, and in the sum of $9,807 93 upon an account for money loaned, due September 12, 1870; that a dividend of $382 58 had been paid thereon, and that no discharge had yet been granted. The auditing judge was of opinion \u201c that while in a suit upon said due bill by the accountant against A. J. Bucknor, junior, or his legal representatives, the plea of the statute of limitations must be sustained in the absence of evidence of a promise to pay, etc., yet it is not applicable to a suit by a legatee or a distributee to recover a legacy or distributive share, for in such event it is well settled that the executor or administrator may retain the legacy or share in part or full satisfaction of the debt,\u201d and accordingly held that A. J. Bucknor, junior, was indebted to his father\u2019s estate in the sum of $39,579 65; that his distributive share in said estate amounted to $14,-767 78, and that as neither he nor his estate would be entitled to share in the fund for distribution, his distributive share, being in part payment of his indebtedness to the estate, should be divided among the widow and children of A. J. Bucknor, senior. Under the second account the distributive share of $2,361 92 was divided and awarded to the widow and children in the same manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">To these adjudications Milne filed exceptions, which were dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">He then appealed to the Supreme Court, and on Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ruary 20, 1882, tlie decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court was reversed, G-okdow, J., delivering the following opinion .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">\u201cThe appellant, Francis F. Milne, is a creditor of A. J. Bucknor, junior, and on the 21st of January, 1878, levied two writs of attachment on the distributive shares of the debtor in the hands of William A. James, administrator of the estate of A. J. Bucknor, senior, and it is thus that Milne becomes interested in the distribution of this estate and in the decree made by the Court below. On settlements of the accounts of the administrator, the last one audited January 21, 1879, the distributive shares of the younger Bucknor were found to be $17,129 72 and so adjudged. At the time of the deathof A. J. Bucknor, senior, which occurred December 13, 1877, he held two several claims against his son: one a due bill, payable on demand, for $10,000, dated January 1, 1867; the other a claim against the firm of Bucknor, McCammon &amp; Co. made up of a note for $3,395 46, due October 5, 1870, and an account for money loaned in the sum of $9,807 93, due September 12 of the same year. This firm went into bankruptcy October 14, 1870, from which, as yet, there has been no discharge, and the claim above stated was, among others, duly proved. On the settlements in the Orphans\u2019 Court, through some inadvertence or mistake, the effect of these claims, as off-sets to the distributive shares of the younger Bucknor, was not passed upon, and on a petition of the administrator, dated June 21, 1879, setting forth this mistake which is not denied, the Court opened its former decree and proceeded to a re-adjudication. To both the above-mentioned claims against A. J. Bucknor, junior, the appellant interposed the plea of the Statute of Limitations, which was over-ruled by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and the set-off as claimed by the administrator was allowed. We have, therefore, two principal questions presented for our consideration : the power of the Orphans\u2019 Court to open and correct its decree, and the effect of the Statute of Limitations upon the claims of the estate against A. J. Bucknor, junior.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">As to the first question, we answer it by saying that we have no doubt about the power of the Orphans\u2019 Court to revise and correct its former adjudications, if in those adjudications it discovered a palpable mistake, produced either by its own inadvertence or by the blunder of the parties. A sense of fair dealing and justice would be authority enough, in the absence of any other, for so ' holding; nevertheless, other authority will be found, and that directly in point, in Greorge\u2019s Appeal, 2 Jones, 260, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>where the subject is so fully discussed that further argument from us'is unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">This out of the way, next in order comes the question involving the Statute of Limitations. If this statute is operative under the circumstances of this case, then both the claims above referred to are barred thereby, and the appellant is entitled to a reversal of the decree of the Court- below. But-, as we have seen, if it is not operative, it is not for the want of time, for the due bill as well as the claims against Bucknor, McCammon &amp; Co. were more than six years old at the time of the death of the elder Bucknor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">But it is urged that the statute does not apply to a distribution in the Orphans\u2019 Court where there is an exercise of the right to retain from a distributee\u2019s share his indebtedness to the estate. To support a doctrine such as this, nothing has been produced from our own books, but the dictum of Mr. Justice Read in Thompson Ap., 6 Wright, 346, and that is based solely on English authorities. On the other hand, the contrary was held in the recent case of Reed <em>v. </em>Marshall, 9 Norris, 345, where, on a suit for a legacy, an attempt was made to set-off a claim of the estate against the legatee which had been barred by the statute prior to the death of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">Nor is the attempted distinction between equitable and common law proceedings, as respects the Statute of Limitations, well founded. As was said in Hoch\u2019s Ap., 9 Harris, 280, a case where the Orphans\u2019 Court, on objection of a legatee, refused to allow an executor to retain a debt due'himself which was barred by the statute in the life of the testator, a court of equity will not pass upon a claim bad at law. Neither has the argument for a contrary doctrine a sound premise. It is urged that the statute 'does not pay the debt; that it only operates on the remedy. It- is true that the statute operates only upon the remedy, or action for the collection of the debt; but it thus operates because of the presumption that the claim has been paid or otherwise extinguished, if its collection has not been insisted on within six years, and that, therefore, it would be inequitable after that time, to compel its payment: Hanger \u00bb. Abbott, 6 Wallace, 538.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">Again the Court below thought that as the ten-thousand-dollar claim was a due bill, payable on demand, the statute did not commence to run from its date, but only after demand made. This was a mistake. Taylor <em>v. </em>Wit-man, 3 Grant, 138, holds that the statute begins to run, on a note payable on demand, from its date, and that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>demand is necessary before suit brought. The cases of the Girard Bank <em>v. </em>the Penn Township Bank, 3 Wright, 92, and Finkbone\u2019s Appeal, <em>5 </em>Norris, 368, are notin point. Those were suits for the recovery of deposits, and the contracts were in the nature of bailments for safe-keeping ; moreover, in the case last named, it was expressly said that the obligation sued upon was not in the nature of a due bill, but that it had rather the character of a deposit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-5\">As to the claim against Bucknor, McCammon &amp; Co., we cannot agree with the Court below that the running of the statute was suspended by the operation of the United States bankrupt act. The probate of the claim under that act is like the prosecution of any other suit; if it is successful, all is well, and the account is secured ; but if not, if the creditor is in the end obliged to resort to a new process in the State Courts for the recovery of his debt, we cannot see upon what principle, in order to avoid the running of the Statute of Limitations, he can count out the time consumed by 1ns first abortive attempt. He is not compelled to prove his claim; but if he does, it is a voluntary surrender of it, and in this it is altogether unlike those cases where a condition of war, as in Hanger <em>v. </em>Abbott, supra, or public policy, as in Hutchinson \u00ab. the Bank, 5 Wright, 42, leaves the creditor without remedy. But under such circumstances, his will is not consulted ; the courts are closed against him. Hence, of necessity, the running of the statute is suspended until the public emergency has passed, and he is again clothed with power of asserting his rights. In the case now being considered, Bucknor had two methods of redress presented for his consideration and acceptance. He might prove his claim in the bankrupt court, or he might sue in the State court. If he adopted the first method, he voluntarily abandoned all other remedies, and made an absolute surrender of his claim ; and it is only by virtue of the act of Congress of June 23, 1874, that he could be restored to his former condition, in case a discharge was refused to the bankrupt, or the proceedings were determined without a discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">Now Bucknor\u2019s claim against the firm of which his son was a member was proved some seven years before his death, and had there been no unwonted delay, a discharge would have been had long before the date of his decease. But, in that event, the indebtedness now sought to be used as an ofii-set would have been fully canceled, and the use of it, as now intended, against the after-acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>estate of the younger Bucknor, would have been out of the question. But, as yet, there has been no discharge, neither have the proceedings in bankruptcy been determined without a discharge ; hence, the act of 1874 does not apply to the claim in controversy, and it may be that it never will so apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-6\">How, then, can this surrendered claim be interposed as a set-off, or must the distribution await indefinitely for the happening of a contingency, now rendered exceedingly remote by the death of both the principal parties? We think it will not subserve the purposes of either law or equity thus to suspend the running of the statute on the mere expectation of an event that may never come to pass. If, however, the second method were adopted, the bar of the statute would be effectually prevented, and the creditor might prosecute his claim to judgment, subject only to such delays as might result from the interposition of the court having jurisdiction of the proceedings in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-7\">We conclude, then, that the delay in this case having arisen from no legal or political necessity, but from the voluntary act of the creditor, the bar of the statute is effective to defeat the appellee\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">The decree of the Court below is now reversed and set aside, and the former adjudications restored and affirmed at the cost of the appellee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-9\">On October 18, 1880, these attachment suits w'ere tried, and the garnishee\u2019s attorney requested the Court to charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-10\"><em>First. </em>That the claims of the estate of A.
