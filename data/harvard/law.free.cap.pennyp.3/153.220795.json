Douden from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Dauphin </em>County, confirming the report of an auditor and directing the assignee of John P. Woland and wife to pay to the Mifflintown and Patterson Building and Loan Association certain moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">On the 20th of February, A. D. 1878, John P. Woland and Lydia B., his wife, made an assignment for benefit of creditors to John K. McGann. The entire assigned estate consisted of a single lot of ground, situated in Halifax township, Dauphin county, Pa., and on which was erected a frame cottage. On December 7,1878, the assignee, under an order of Court, sold the said property for the sum of six hundred dollars. On the 25th of March, 1881, the assignee filed his account in obedience to a citation issued for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">On May 12, 1881, Robert Snodgrass was appointed auditor to pass upon the exceptions filed, and surcharge the accountant, if liable, and to make distributions to and among his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-13\">The auditor surcharged the assignee with interest, making the balance in the hands of the assignee for distribution to lien creditors the sum of $444 69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-14\">The lot of ground was conveyed by Adam Lime to Lydia B. Woland December 12, 1873, and the deed for the same was not recorded until January 19, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-15\">Early in the year 1874, the erection of a frame dwelling was commenced on said lot of ground and completed during that year. A. Douden, a manufacturer of lumber, owning a planing-mill at Millersburg, Pa., furnished all the lumber and wood material in the construction ahd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>erection of said building, and filed, April 26, 1875, a mechanic\u2019s lien against the said building and curtilage, under the provisions of the act of Assembly providing for such liens, for the sum of $338 31. The lien was entered against John P. Woland and Lydia B. Woland. She was not described either in the lien or bill of particulars as a married woman. A <em>scire facias </em>on this lien was regularly issued to No. 718, April term, 1880, appearance entered by defendant and judgment obtained July 26, 1880, for want of an affidavit of defense for $462 37, with interest and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">It was conceded that the Mifflintown and Patterson Building and Loan Association was entitled to the amount awarded to judgment No. 297, November term, 1877, viz: $221 83, which was a lien at the time Lydia B. Woland acquired title and since revived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">In addition to the last-mentioned judgment, the building association held a mortgage for $400 upon said real estate, given by. John P. Woland and wife, on July 27, 1874, and recorded December 3, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">The actual amount in dispute, therefore, was only $222 66, and this sum was claimed by the Building and Loan Association and also by Douden. The claim of the \u00a1former is founded upon said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">The claim of Douden was founded on his mechanic\u2019s lien. The auditor held that he could not inquire into the validity of the judgment on the <em>scire facias, </em>and awarded to the judgment on mechanic\u2019s lien of A. Douden the sum of $222 66, to which exceptions were filed by the Mifflintown and Patterson Building and Loan Association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-10\">The opinion of the Court below was delivered by Henderson, J., as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-11\">\u201cThe Mifflintown and Patterson Loan and Saving Association denies the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien of A. Douden, and the judgment thereon entered to No. 718, April term, 1880, against John P. Woland and Lydia B. Woland, and contends that the same created no lien against the estate of Mrs. Lydia P. Woland, a married woman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-12\">\u201cIt is earnestly argued and many cases are cited and relied upon to show the defective character of the claim filed, and its insufficiency to charge the lien upon the wife\u2019s separate estate. We cannot say, upon the inspection of the record merely, that this lien is absolutely void. It is entered against J. P. Woland and Lydia B. Woland, owners, or reputed owners, and contractors for lumber furnished and work done by A. Douden. The property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>out of which, the fund arises for distribution is accurately-described, and the fact is it belonged to Lydia B. Woland, a married woman, and the contract was made and lien entered during coverture. There are no averments that conclude her. This much is perhaps conceded. But a <em>scire facias </em>was issued and judgment entered upon it. What then ? \u2018 The auditor had not power to go behind the judgment in the <em>amicable scire facias </em>in the case of Emiline Lutz \u25a0\u00bb. John Edwards, and declare it void and no lien for want of a stamp, or on any other ground of irregularity\u2019: Edwards\u2019 Appeal, 16 P. F. S., 90. \u2018It is only when void that a judgment may be disregarded, because in that case it is incapable of giving or continuing a lien.\u2019 Now turn to Brunner\u2019s Appeal, 11 Wright, 75 : \u2018We hold that the judgment given by Magdalena Hoffman to the appellant was void and no lien upon the land sold. Being absolutely void, the auditor\u2019s duty was to disregard it.\u2019 So far as we can judge from the report of this case, the fact of coverture did not appear on the face of this record. The judgment was entered, apparently, against Magdalena Hoffman. But what of this <em>% </em>\u2018 Had it been only voidable, application should have been made to the Court to rid the record of it, and that might have been done either by the obligor in the bond or a mortgagee claiming under her.\u2019 \u2018But. the rule enunciated in Dyott\u2019s Estate, 2 W. and S., 557, is inapplicable to a judgment void on its face.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">\u201c Here, now, this judgment, in the light of the evidence and admitted facts, is absolutely void, and should have been so declared by the auditor. But granting that it is only voidable, the Coui\u2019t may set it aside either upon the application of the defendant or of a mortgagee claiming under her. The wife does not and need not speak during coverture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">\u2018 \u2018 To require her to do this, would deny her the protection the law throws around her in the possession and enjoyment of her separate estate, or, perhaps, expose her to unseemly contests with her husband. We must disregard this judgment in the distribution of the fund in controversy. We think, with the facts before us, the auditor erred in finding that the judgment of A. Douden was a valid lien against the property of Mrs. Lydia B. Woland, and awarding any part of the fund to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">\u201cWe direct that the auditor\u2019s report be corrected, in accordance with this opinion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-11\">The auditor afterwards filed his amended report, awarding the said balance of $222 66 to the Mifflin town Build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ing and Loan Association in accordance with the above opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">Counsel for A. Douden filed the following exceptions to the amended report:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\"><em>First. </em>The auditor erred in disallowing judgment No. 718. April T., 1880, of A. Douden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\"><em>Second. </em>He erred in passing by and disregarding said judgment of A. Douden, No. 718, April T., 1880, and in distributing amount due thereon to mortgage of Miffiintown Building and Loan Association, which was a lien upon assignor\u2019s real estate of a subsequent date to that of said judgment of A. Douden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\"><em>Third. </em>He erred in not treating said judgment of A. Douden as absolutely valid and a legal and binding lien upon said assignor\u2019s real estate, and as such entitled to participate in said distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-10\">On March 6, 1882, the exceptions were overruled and the report confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-11\">The exceptant then took out a <em>certiorari, </em>assigning as error the overruling of the exceptions and the confirmation of the report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-12\"><em>J.
