And said first parties hereby conveying their interests as heirs of said deceased,\u2019 (here Robert E.

Coyle\u2019s interest, the same as conveyed to him by said James W. Coyle and wife,\u2019 etc.,) \u2018together with all and singular, the tenements and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining, and the reversions, remainders, rents, issues, and profits thereof. And also all the estate, right, title, interest, property, claim, and demand whatsoever, as well in law as in equity, of the said parties of the first part of, in, or to the above described premises, and every part and parcel thereof, with the appurtenances.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The abdve literal extract contains the premises of this deed in full, and the <em>habendum </em>is : \u2018 To have and to hold all and singular the above-mentioned and described premises, together with the appurtenances unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns forever.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">In the premises, these parties of the first part set forth that they are \u2018heirs of William Coyle, late of Lackawannock township, Mercer county, Pennsylvania, deceased,\u2019 and most clearly and distinctly set forth that they are remising, releasing, and quit-claiming to second party for this land, as the heirs of said William Coyle, deceased ; for, after reciting the consideration, its receipt, describing the land by metes and bounds, etc., they continue, \u2018 containing one hundred and eighteen acres, more or less, being the same land formerly owned by William Coyle, deceased, and said parties hereby conveying their interest as heirs of said deceased.\u2019 Thus far no argument is necessary to demonstrate that the first party did not remise, release, nor quit-claim, nor even attempt to remise, release, or quit-claim any interest they had in said land, save that which they owned as the heirs of said William Coyle, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">The premises close thus: \u2018Together with all and singular the tenements, hereditaments, and appurtenances thereto belonging or in anywise appertaining, and the reversions, remainders, rents, issues, and profits thereof; and also all the estate, right, title, interest, property, claim, and demand whatsoever, as well in law as inequity, of the said parties o\u00a3 the first part of, in, or to the above-described premises, and every part and parcel thereof with the appurtenances.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">This is the stereotyped conclusion of the premises, given by all the form-books for either a warranty or quit-claim deed ; and has, so far as I know, always been held to have reference to t.he title, legal or equitable, which the grantor has, in .the preceding part of the premises, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>veyed, or attempted to convey, to the grantee. The office of such conclusion is to supply any omissions the grantor may, through mistake or oversight, have possibly made in passing the title to the grantee, which he had, in a former part of the deed, attempted to convey to him. This conclusion must be held to have been employed by the grantors for the sole purpose of securing to their grantee the title, whether legal or equitable, or both, which they had inherited from the said William Coyle, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">Their interest in this land, whether heirs or devisees of Manassa Coyle, is neither mentioned directly nor indirectly in the deed ; and there is neither written nor oral evidence that they had ever agreed to sell or convey it to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">The <em>habendum </em>is a form-book one, and merely defines that said grantee shall hold said property, etc., in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">When this deed was executed, the grantors, as the heirs of William Coyle, severally owned the one undivided one-ninth part of said land, and as the heirs or devisees of Manassa Coyle, they owned their several shares or interests in his said one-ninth part; and the defendant\u2019s counsel contend that because they did not, in their said deed to William A. Coyle, except out of its operations their interest in said land as the heirs or devisees of Manassa, that, therefore, it passed under the deed to William A. Coyle, as well as did the interest they owned as their father\u2019s heir. Had they conveyed all their legal and equitable title or interest to William A. Coyle without defining their source or sources of title, their interest in the land as the heirs or devisees of Manassa would, of course, have passed to the grantee, unless it had been excepted out of the operation of the deed. It must, however, be borne in mind that neither in nor <em>dehors </em>the deed is there any evidence that they had ever agreed to convey to William A. Coyle their title as heirs or devisees of Manassa. Why should one except something out of the operation of a conveyance or grant which he has never made, nor agreed to make, either in whole or in part?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-9\">To require one to do this, would be to require him to perform not only a vain, but an act impossible of performance ; for how could he except something out of the operation of a grant which he had never attempted to make, and which the evidence fails to show he ever agreed to make ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-10\">The defendant\u2019s counsel rely \u00a3on the rule of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>every man\u2019s deed shall be taken strongest against himself, and on what is laid down in Altham\u2019s case (8 Coke, 148) <em>generaMs </em>clausula, etc., it hath been insisted that general words in a release (this deed is in effect a release of title) are to be taken strongest against the releasor, and are not to be qualified or restrained by any special recital.\u2019 But herein the true rule and distinction seems to be that where there are general words all alone in a deed of release, they shall be taken most strongly against the releasor ; but where there is a particular \"recital in a deed, and then general words follow, the general words shall be qualified by the particular recital: Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, Title Release, K; see also Lyman *. Clark, 9 Mass., 235; Ballantine\u2019s Appeal, 67 P. St., 178.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">Let us apply this doctrine, that \u2018 where there is a particular recital in a deed, and then general words follow, ' the general words shall be qualified by the particular recital,\u2019 to \u2018the particular recital\u2019 in this deed as to the title intended to be released, remised, and quit-claimed, and the \u2018general words\u2019 following such particular recital, and describing the nature, or rather the extent, of the title to be held, and see what the result will be. This particular recital is : \u2018 Said first parties hereby conveying their interest as heirs of said deceased,\u2019 (William Coyle.) The general words which follow this particular recital, and under which the defendant\u2019s counsel claim that the title of the heirs of Manassa, or of his devisees, passed to William A. Coyle, are: \u2018And also all the estate, right, title, interest, property, claim, and demand whatsoever, as well in law as <em>in </em>equity, <em>of </em>the said parties of the first part of, in, or to the above-described premises,\u2019 etc. Now, according to the three authorities last above-cited, these general words are qualified and controlled by that particular recital. In other words, these general words do not enlarge the title as described by the particular recital.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">I am of the opinion that William A. Coyle only took, under said deed, the title which the grantors had therein inherited as the heirs of the said William Coyle, deceased, and that the defendant has only his title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">II. The second question is : Does the will of said Manassa Coyle vest in the plaintiff such an interest in this land that she can maintain ejectment for its recovery?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">That the testator, who wrote the will himself, was very illiterate, and that the will is very inartistically drawn, its inspection proves. It does, however, pass to his de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>visee his real and personal estate, and its provisions, so far as they relate to this case, are :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\">1.

After her death, his three single sisters, of whom the plaintiff is one, were to receive their support, and so long as they, or any of them, remained single, \u2018the rent or interest \u2019 of said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">The will does not appoint or name any trustee who should take possession of and control the said \u2018rent or interest \u2019 for the use and benefit of said <em>eestuis que trustent'.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">The testator used the words \u2018rent or interest\u2019 as synonymous with income or proceeds ; and a devise of such proceeds of land for a given period of time ; and ejectment will, therefore, lie in favor of the devisee for the recovery of the possession of land so devised: Carlyle <em>v. </em>Cannon, 3 R., 489; Tyler on Ejectment, 39.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">As Manassa\u2019s interest in said land is equal to the one undivided one ninth (\u2022$\u2022) of it, and as the plaintiff is the devisee of the one-third part of the \u2018rent or interest\u2019 of this said interest, she is, therefore, entitled to recover in this ejectment the possession of the one undivided twenty-seventh (^) part of the land described in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">And now, 11th August, 1883, judgment on the case stated in favor of the plaintiff for the one undivided one twenty-seventh (^) part of the land described in the writ.

St., 45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-7\">At the time the quit-claim deed or release to William A. Coyle was executed, Sadie E. Coyle had a mere naked possibility of interest in the one ninth of the land described in the deed, which had belonged to her brother Manassa, and this was not the subject of release. Manassa B. Coyle devised the \u201crent or interest of his estate to go to support his mother, Nancy H. Coyle, her lifetime ;\u201d then the \u201crent or interest\u201d was to go \u201cto support, or for the benefit of, his single sisters, equally divided while they remain single.\u201d At the time the quitclaim deed was executed the mother was still living. The persons who would take after the mother\u2019s life estate was spent were not ascertainable until after the death of the mother. Sadie E.

Coyle and others to William A. Coyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">It is scarcely possible to add to the reasons so well ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>pressed in the exhaustive opinion of the Court. The question is one of interest, and does not appear to us as involving any serious doubt as to the meaning of the parties. The grantors commence by describing themselves as heirs of William Coyle, and the property conveyed was acquired by descent from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In defining the subject of the conveyance, after describing the tract by its boundaries and quantity, they add, in immediate connection, and as a part of the same sentence, the following: \u201c Being the same land formerly owned by William Coyle, deceased, and said first parties hereby conveying their interest as heirs of said deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">These last words must have been inserted for some purpose. The courts have no right to reject them. We must give them a reasonable interpretation, and enforce them according to their meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">What, then, is their meaning <em>% </em>The natural import of the words is that the interest conveyed is the interest which the grantors held by virtue of their relation as heirs of William Coyle. This is what the words explicitly declare, and unless there are other words in the deed in hostility with this meaning, we are bound to construe them according to their- plain import. When they said, at the beginning of the descriptive sentence, that they released all their right, title, and interest, the grantors must be intended as meaning the whole, as distinguished from something less than the whole, of the interest immediately thereafter defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">That interest, as we have seen, was their interest in the land as heirs of William Coyle. The literal words, then, which describe the subject of the release, declare it to be all the interest which the grantors held as heirs of William Coyle in a tract of one hundred and eighteen acres of land formerly owned by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">As if to make this reading absolutely conclusive, the next sentence in the deed declares that Robert E. Coyle, one of the grantors, conveys not only his interest as heir of William Coyle, but also the undivided half of James W. Coyle\u2019s interest, which was conveyed to Robert by deed of July, 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">These words would be mere surplusage, and entirely senseless, if all the interest of all the grantors had previ jusly passed. The very fact that this additional interest was specifically mentioned proves that it was not included, and was not supposed to be included, in the previous language of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The three single sisters held a certain interest in the share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>of tlieir brother, ManassaB. Coyle, under his will, and they also held their shares, one ninth each, by descent, as heirs of William A. Coyle. These were two distinct interests, the latter of which was released by words of express mention, and the former of which was in no way alluded to, or described, in any part of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In these circumstances, to deprive them, by mere implication, of their interest in Manassa\u2019s share, would be doing violence, not only to the express terms of the grant, but also to the most familiar and elementary principles of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">There may be some question arising under the will of Manassa as to the precise interest taken by the sisters, but as they are all living, and the defendant, upon our view of the deed, has no interest in that question, and the persons who are interested in it are not before us, we forbear its consideration at this time as against the defendant. We think Sadie E. Coyle was entitled to one third of one ninth of the land in question while she is alive and single.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
