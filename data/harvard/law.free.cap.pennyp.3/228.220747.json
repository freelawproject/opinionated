E. Williams. I am acquainted to some extent with the operation of Reese Owens. I recognized W. E. Williams in 1879 as Owens\u2019 agent there. I was subject to him in shipping some lumber of Owens. The first time that I saw Williams he was introduced to me as in the place of R. B. Little. Little introduced me to him, and said any business I had to do with him or Owens, to apply to Mr. Williams. I was subject to his order in handling the balance of that lumber. I got some orders from Little directly to ship some of that lumber.

He does business in Pittsburgh. Mr. Owens had some lumber in this county that John A. Crawford was manufacturing for him. I am acquainted with Mr. Little, I think Mr. Little was a clerk or agent for Mr. Owens.' I believe he is a clerk yet for Mr. Owens. My understanding was that Williams was up here to superintend some other business and also acting as agent for John Crawford. He was to see that Reese Owens got his boards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-9\"><em>David E.

I went there and got groceries, fiour, postage stamps, and stationery. I got them from Mr. Evans. I went to Williams and spoke to him about the flour.

I had a settlement with Williams.

Williams was acting for Reese Owens in our neighborhood there in that lumbering job.. Milligan and John A. Crawford had been acting for him before Williams came there. I heard Williams say he was doing business for Reese Owens. He was doing a general business, and I believe ordered cars to ship lumber. He gave me verbal orders for goods. These goods are charged in our books to John A. Crawford. Williams told me shortly after he came to Rockdale. I had a little account on my books then against Crawford, and I told him I did not want to furnish Crawford any more, and he said the account of John A. Crawford was right, and any account I would make with Crawford would be right. He said that as the agent of Reese Owens. After that time, these goods were all furnished to John A. Crawford I furnished men that were working on the hill with goods, and men that hauled lumber to the railroad, and all parties, under the direction of W. H. Wil-, liams. Little at one time looked over the account I have here and he admitted, I believe, something over $200 of the account to be all right, as against Owens. Williams looked over it a time or two before, and he made a part of the account to Crawford and part to Owens. I wrote to Owens and got a letter in reply, signed by Reese Owens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>&amp; Co. I did not make a proposition and never had no settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-4\">Counsel for plaintiff offered in evidence the following letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">\u201c Office of Reese Owens &amp; Co.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsID\">Pittsburgh, Pa., <em>January 1880.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2a\">Mr. C.

I cannot see why, when I furnished the goods, I should not get credit with them. Have written Mr. Williams that I would send check \u00bfor $130 54, amount of account, less the credits, if you would give a receipt in full, and would hold payment on property until I heard from him, so that I could send it all in one draft, if you accepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">Truly yours,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">Reese Owens &amp; Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">It was admitted that the letter offered was in the handwriting of Little.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">Counsel for defendant objected to the offer, because it was a matter of Reese Owens &amp; Co., and contained some kind of a proposition which was not accepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-11\">The offer was admitted under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-12\">The witness, upon cross-examination, said : The account in the ledger reads: J. A. Crawford and Reese Owens. When I made out that ledger off the book of original entries, it read, first, J. A. Crawford. There was a part of this same account J. A. Crawford before Williams came there at all. It is all carried into this one account. After that account stood charged to Crawford, I wrote the Reese Owens at the heading. I cut off the tops of some accounts. I think that I did have it made out against Crawford, assumed by the agent of Reese Owens ; something of that kind; I don\u2019t remember. I did not cut the heading off and stick another on after it was sworn to. Crawford gave me a note, a judgment note, and judgment embracing this account. I entered up that note as a judgment against Crawford and issued execution on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-13\">Upon reexamination-in-chief, the witness said: Those are my books of original entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-14\">Counsel for plaintiff offered to prove \u2018 \u2018 an account having been on the books charged to John A. Crawford, the evidence having shown they were directed to so charge it by the agents of Reese Owens, for the purpose of charging Reese Owens, and this, in connection with the testimony of Mr. Evans, who heretofore testified to it, stating that he gave credit to Reese Owens and not to Crawford.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Counsel for defendant objected to offering in evidence \u201cany account charged to John A. Crawford, as this suit is against Beese Owens, the witness having already stated that he has taken a judgment note from John A. Crawford for that same account, that he has entered that note up, and has attempted to collect it by issuing an execution thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">He further objected to the offer \u201c of that account on the grounds that it is legally a forgery, having been altered for the purpose of charging Beese Owens and prejudicing his interest.\u201d \u00ab</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">The Court. We will admit the books and the items thereon charged, for the reason that the witness testifies that the charges were made against John A. Crawford, but the goods were delivered on the credit of Beese Owens. We regard the form of the transaction as quite unimportant. The question for the jury to determine is : First, whether the credit was given to Owens, and second, whether Evans was authorized, by any one having sufficient authority, to give the goods on Owens\u2019 credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">Exception by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">The witness further testified that the whole amount of the goods sold under the arrangement spoken of with Williams -was about $500, and that Little admitted about $240.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">There was further evidence as to declarations of agency by Williams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-10\">Counsel for defendant produced evidence by the defendant, Williams and Little, to show that prior to February, 1880, there was no one in Jefferson County authorized to contract debts in his name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-11\">The Court charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-12\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims to recover from the defendant the sum of $457 90. He alleges that he sold goods by the authority of the defendant to a certain John A. Crawford. The defendant recites the claim, and alleges that he gave no authority to any person to contract' debts in his name. Did the defendant authorize any person to obtain from the plaintiff goods upon his credit ? Is there anything in the evidence from which such authority can fairly be inferred? If such authority can fairly be inferred from the evidence, to what extent was the agent authorized to contract debts for and on account of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-13\">The plaintiff alleges that this authority can fairly be inferred from the evidence. He says that he has shown by a certain Mr. Cox that the defendant told him that Williams was coming up to superintend his business. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The plaintiff further says that he has shown by the oath of Mr. Owens (I think \"in a case in equity) that he admitted that Williams was his agent. [He alleges that he is in possession of a letter signed by Owens in reply to one claiming this bill, and he says that in that letter Owens offers to pay $130 of this bill.] He says that he has proved through transactions, in which Williams was the actor, that Owens ratified the acts ; he also says that he has shown by the testimony of McCollough that Owens told him that Williams was authorized to act for him, and that McCollough was not to give any goods unless Williams or Evans ordered them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-4\">He says from these and other circumstances that the jury are fairly authorized by the evidence to believe and find that an authority was given by the defendant to Williams to contract debts for him with Evans, and that under the evidence they have shown that Evans would fairly be authorized to believe that Williams had authority to contract debts in the name of Owens. Gentlemen, we leave the evidence as to this with you, instructing you that you must first find the authority ; to bind Owens, the authority must come from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">Did Owens authorize Williams or any one to run a bill in his name at the plaintiff\u2019s store, and if he did authorize Williams or any one to run a bill for him at the plaintiff\u2019s store, to what extent did he authorize them to run that bill, and on what account ? You must find that from the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">The defendant, on his side, alleges that he gave no such authority. He says himself, under oath, that he gave no authority to contract debts on his account. Mr. Little, his clerk, says he gave no authority to him to contract debts on his account, and Mr. Williams says he gave no authority to him to contract debts on his account Mr. Little says that in looking over the accounts with Evans, there were $208 that was made up of items furnished to persons who were working for Crawford in the interest of Owens. He says that he promised to pay that much, but that the balance of the claim he did not promise to pay. He says that even this promise he was not authorized to make by Owens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">It would seem, then, from that testimony that there was a part of the goods that were furnished John A. Crawford for his own benefit, and part of the goods were furnished for the benefit of the men who were working for the advantage of Owens, and that this clerk held the men who had got goods who were working for Owens' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>benefit, ought to be paid by Owens, and the other furnished to Crawford ought not to be furnished at all. You have heard his statement, and you heard Evans\u2019 statement ; it is bearing upon this branch of the case. What amount did the defendant authorize persons to buy on his credit? It bears on that question.. Under all the evidence, gentlemen, can you fairly infer that Owens authorized this indebtedness to be contracted on his account with the plaintiff ? If you find that he never authorized it, then your verdict will be for the defendant; but if he authorized debts to be contracted with the plaintiff, then you will inquire, under the evidence, how much does the evidence fairly show that he authorized to be contracted. These questions are for you. Under the evidence, we leave the case with you. Be careful, on your part, not to be influenced by any prejudice, either for or against either of these men ; they are entitled to have a completely fair trial under the evidence, and there should not be any passion in the case at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">Now, .take all the evidence on part of the plaintiff, and consider it; then take all the evidence on part of the defendant, and consider it; and from the whole evidence, has the plaintiff fairly shown any authority to contract a debt with the plaintiff in the name of the defendant, and if so, then what does the evidence fairly show \u2014 that the person contracting the debt had right to contract it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">Remember that this debt is charged in the name of Crawford. The plaintiff says that he was authorized to keep it in that name ; the defendant says not. [The defendant- says that the fact that the note of Crawford was given for the money is strong evidence that the credit was given to Crawford ; the plaintiff says not,] that Williams told him to furnish the goods ; and he says he has shown Williams was authorized by the defendant to so direct him. We leave the case with you. [If you find for the plaintiff, state how much; ] if you find for the defendant, find for the defendant generally.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to those portions of the charge inclosed between brackets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">December 15, 1881.

Crawford. It was alleged that Owens was liable for the debt because they were sold to Crawford on the verbal authority of one W. D. Williams, acting as the agent for Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">On the trial, the plaintiffs, as one of the means of establishing the agency, called a justice of the peace before whom a suit, by one Harvey against Crawford, was tried, to prove that on that trial W. D. Williams had testified that he was agent for Owens. This was objected to, and admitted under exception, and the first error assigned is to the admission of this testimony. The whole of the testimony offered and admitted under this excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tion is comprised in a single question and answer, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><em>Q. </em>Did he do anything more than say he was agent of Reese Owens ? Did he swear to it before you ?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>A. </em>Yes, he swore to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">There was clear error in admitting this testimony. The witness did not pretend to give the language of the person to whose declarations he was testifying. He did not decribe the kind of agency to which Williams had testified, and hence it is impossible to tell whether the agency, whatever it was, authorized Williams to order goods to be sold on the credit of Owens. This alone is quite enough to condemn the evidence, but, apart from that, the mode of proof was not legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">It is a perfectly familiar rule that the authority of an agent cannot be established by proof of the declarations of the agent: Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 2 Whart., 340; Chambers <em>v. </em>Davis, 3 Whart., 44; Jordan <em>v. </em>Stewart, 11 Har., 244; Grim <em>v. </em>Bonnell, 28 P. P. S., 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">As most of the proof offered consisted of the mere statement or declaration of Williams that he was agent for Owens, the fact that the declaration was made under oath, as a witness in a cause, is entirely immaterial. Owens was not a party to the cause, nor was he present at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">We do not think the second assignment can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">The letter in question was not an offer of compromise. It was a letter written by the defendant to one of the plaintiffs, in which he relates that he had written to Mr. Williams, stating that he would send a check for $130 54, if he [Evans] would give a receipt in full, and would hold payment on property until he heard from him, \u201cso that I could send all in one draft if you accepted.\u201d That is all. There is no offer in this letter. It is a mere description of the contents of another letter. It contains some evidence of the agency of Williams, and we think it was therefore admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">We think the evidence submitted under the third assignment was not competent. The witness, C. D. Evans, being on the stand, testified, in answer to a question, that certain books were his books of original entries. No preliminary examination was made as to who made the entries, or when the items were entered, or when the goods were delivered, with reference to the dates of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>charges, and the account itself was against Crawford and not against Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In this condition of the testimony, the books were admitted in a lump, and also all the items thereon charged against Crawford. Of course, in such circumstances, the book entries were not admissible. It is true that afterwards the Court did interrogate the witness as to the manner and time of making the entries, and proper answers were given, which, as against Crawford, in an action against him, might have constituted sufficient <em>prima facie </em>proof to warrant their admission. But the cross-examination had also developed that the account contained items against Crawford which were not claimed against Owens. Nevertheless, and without any selection and proof of the items claimed as against him, the account was admitted as an entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">There is much confusion in the testimony, and the account itself is not printed. We do not discover anywhere in the testimony a distinct presentation of the particular items which, it is alleged, were ordered by Williams. There is some testimony that the whole amounted to about $500, but, of course, that would not make the entire account admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We think it very clear that in no aspect of the testimony was the account competent as a book-account of original entries in the present action against Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">It is not charged to him at all, and it is very questionable whether the individual items claimed against Owens could have been given in evidence, except after distinct proof as to each of those items, accompanied with proof that they had been ordered by Owens or his authorized agent. We cannot find any such itemized proof in the testimony. As an entirety, the account certainly was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We do not think there is any merit in the remaining assignments and they are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Judgment reversed and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
