On January 14, 1881, this writ of replevin was issued and the goods delivered thereunder to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-8\">The plaintiff presented the following point of charge :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-9\">The learned Court is requested, by the plaintiff, to charge the jury that if they find that tile levy or distraint was made on January 5, and the appraisement was made on January 10, that then the proceedings were irregular, and that the defendants became trespassers, <em>ab </em>initio, and their verdict should be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-10\">The Court refused so to charge, and reserved the point for the court in banc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-11\">January 22, 1882. \u2014 Verdict for defendant: Pent in arrear, $265 60; value of goods, $245.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-12\">July 1, 1882. \u2014 Judgment for defendant on point reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-13\">Plaintiff then took out a writ of error, and assigned as error the refusal of the Court to charge the jury as requested, and the entry of judgment for defendants on the point of law reserved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-14\"><em>Arthur C.

If made on the fifth day, a sale under it renders the landlord a trespasser, <em>ab initio: </em>Brisben <em>v. </em>Wilson, 60 Penn\u2019a, 452.

Riter </em>and <em>J. Levering Jones </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-17\">The distress was a valid one. The irregularity of the appraisement did not make the distress inoperative: Act 21 Mch., 1772, Purd. Dig., p. 878, sec. 10. The landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>has no right to sell until he complies with certain preliminaries : Woglam <em>v. </em>Cowperthwaite, 2 Dali., 68. A sale after an irregular appraisement would have been void, but no trespass is committed until he actually sells: McKinney \u25a0\u00bb. Reader, 6 Watts, 40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-4\">The cases of Kerr <em>v. </em>Sharp, 14 S. &amp; R., 399 ; Brisben <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 P. F. Sm., 452, and Richards <em>v. </em>McGrath, 40 Leg. Int., 6, merely decide that an irregular sal\u00e9 under a distress makes a landlord a trespasser, <em>ab initio.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">In making the appraisement within five days no act of trespass was committed. By a distraint, the tenant loses his control over the goods, which, constructively and actually, pass to the landlord, who can remove them or put a person in charge of them. Therefore, he commits no trespass by appraising them : Bannister <em>v. </em>Hyde, 2 Ellis</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">&amp; Ellis, 627; Cox <em>v. </em>Painter, 7 C. &amp; P., 767; Woods <em>v. </em>Durr ant, 16 ; M. &amp; W., 158 ; Eagleton <em>v. </em>Gutteridge, 11M. &amp; W., 465 ; Hutchins <em>v. </em>Chambers, 1 Burr, 589.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b404-7\">January 29, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AGv\">\u2014 Per Curiam :</author>\n<p id=\"A-h\">The appraisement made on the fifth day from the day of the distress was premature. A subsequent sale of the property would have been illegal, and the defendants would thereby have become trespassers. No trespass was committed at the time the distress was made. The rent was then due and unpaid. The property was distrained in a lawful and regular manner. Without any sale being made, and merely by reason of the premature appraisement, the defendants did not become trespassers, <em>ab initio. </em>The judgment on the reserved point was, therefore, right.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
