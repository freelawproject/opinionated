It recited that it was conditioned for the payment of $6,000 lawful money at any time within one year from the date thereof, together with lawful interest in like money, payable on the second Monday of each and every month thereafter ; and that the mortgagees should also pay into the said association the sum of thirty dollars on the second Monday of each and every month thereafter, as and for the monthly contribution on thirty shares of capital stock of the said association, owned by Elam P. Witmer, one of the defendants. Said mortgage also provided \u201c that if at any time default should be made in the payment of interest on the said principal sum or the monthly contribution aforesaid, for the space of six months after any payment thereof should become due and payable,\u201d then the whole principal debt aforesaid should, at the option of the said association, become due and payable, and payment of the said 'principal sum and all interest, as well as any contribution on said thirty shares of stock then due, might be enforced and recovered at once. The <em>scire facias </em>alleged a default in the payment of interest and of the monthly contributions for more than six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">Elam F. Witmer, one of the defendants, filed an affidavit of defense, setting forth:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">\u201cThat the whole amount received from plaintiffs for and on account of said mortgage was the sum of $3,314, which amount was paid to this deponent in two separate payments, the last, to wit, the sum of $1,040, upon January 10, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-9\">That there has been paid by this deponent to said association, on account of said mortgage and interest, the sum of $3,909 08.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">That allowing interest on the amount received for said mortgage from the date when received, there would appear to be a balance in favor of plaintiffs of $696 85.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\">That said association has not furnished to this deponent any statement of its condition for over three years although frequently demanded \u2014 that deponent believes that upon a proper statement of accounts being made it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>will appear that said mortgage debt and interest has been nearly, if not fully, paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">The affidavit of Maria Witmer, the other defendant, set forth the same facts with the further averment that the amount received from plaintiff \u2018\u00a3 was paid to Elam F. Witmer, no part of which was ever received by this deponent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">The plaintiff took a rule to show cause why judgment should not be granted for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, whereupon, after argument, the Court, on January 21, 1882, granted \u00a3\u00a3judgment for amount ad-\u2019 mitted, said amount to be assessed by the prothonotary or his deputy, subject to exceptions.\u201d On February 18,. 1882, the prothonotary assessed the damages at $3,665 07. Defendants then took a rule to reduce the assessment of damages, to support which depositions were taken. It was then referred to John I. Rogers, to report upon the amount due on the judgment. On May 13, 1882, the auditor filed an interlocutory report, being unable to decide the matter from the evidence submitted before, him. The Court took no action upon this report, and on June 17, 1882, amended the record by making, absolute the rule for judgmenc for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, whereupon, on June 21, 1882, the prothonotary re-assessed the damages at $3,665 07.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">Defendants then took out a writ of error, assigning .for error the amendment of the record by making the rule absolute, and the granting of judgment against the defend-, ants, notwithstanding the interlocutory report of the auditor to whom the Court had referred 'the cause to report upon the amount due on the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">Case No. 154, between the same parties upon another mortgage for $2,000, was argued at the same time. The affidavit averred that deponent believed, upon a proper statement of accounts being made, it would appear that the mortgage debt and interest had been fully paid. The other facts and averments were the same, except as to amounts, as in No. 153.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-10\"><em>John A. Brown </em>and <em>Wm. H.

Pr., 375. The reference to the prothonotary to assess damages was superfluous, as it was his duty to do so without the reference. The reference to the auditor gave the defendant extraordinary opportunities to show any mistakes : 1 Tr. &amp; H. Pr., 375 ; Watkin *. Phillips, 2 Wh., 210 ; Bank *.

Wallace, 4 W. N. C., 53. In building association mortgages the difference between the amount received and the amount of the mortgage is bonus, which is protected by statute: Act 12, Apl., 1859, s. 4, Purd. Dig\u2019., 184; Act 29, Apl., 1874, s. 5, Purd. Dig., 1832; Act 10, Apl., 1879, P. L., 17 ; Ass\u2019n *. Keller, 2 W. N. C., 29 ; Ass\u2019n *. Neurath, 2 <em>Id., </em>95 ; Selden *.

Adams, <em>Id., </em>144. The defendants having been allowed this credit, they have no right to complain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-10\">The averment that there appears to be a balance of $696 85 does not include the premium to which plaintiff is entitled, and does not state the balance with certainty: Saving Fund *.

The specific sum averred in each affidavit of defense, to have been paid, was allowed and applied as a payment on the mortgage. The further averment of belief that, on a proper statement of accounts, it would appear in one case that the whole mortgage had been paid, and that the other was nearly, if not fully, paid, was, in each case, too general to give effect to the affidavit beyond the specific sums alleged to have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Judgment affirmed in each case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
