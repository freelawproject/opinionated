Churchman and A. K. Wright, W. V. Wright, and J. W. Wright about five hundred and fifty acres of timber land in Clearfield county, which they held as tenants in common, Churchman having one-half interterest and the Wrights one-half interest therein. At the time the suit was brought, the Wright interest was vested in W. V. Wright and the heirs of his brother, J. W. Wright. George W. Churchman died before suit was brought, leaving a will of which he appointed George Churchman and Caleb Churchman his executors, and in which, after making disposition of other real estate than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the Clearfield land, he devised as follows: \u201cI will all my other real estate and personal property to be sold whenever my executors may think it will bring its real value.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ahqu\">Before Churchman\u2019s death, the land was used \u2018 \u2018 for taking off square timber.\u201d After his death, the executors used the land just as before.

Y. Wright and William Porter, the administrators of J. W. Wright, deceased, against the executors of George W. Churchman, deceased, to recover a balance alleged to be due by that estate to the plaintiffs. [There is no question of fact in dispute in the case. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is admitted by the defendants to be correct, but the question which arises in the case is a question of law for the Court to decide, which is whether or not the executors of George W. Churchman, deceased, whether the estate of the deceased is liable for this claim, or whether George Churchman and Caleb Churchman are liable individually, and not as executors of George W. Churchman, deceased. That is the real question in this case, and for the purpose of this suit we will instruct you, gentlemen of the jury, to find for the plaintiffs the fact that this land referred to in this suit, having been purchased for lumbering purposes before the death of George W. Churchman, although not operated until after the death of George W. Churchman by his executors, the estate is bound by tneir acts and the Wrights would be entitled to recover the amount you find due under all the evidence in the case, and your verdict should be for the plaintiffs for that amount, with interest from the time it was due.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-10\">Yerdict for plaintiffs for $11,771 69, and judgment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\">The defendants thereupon took this writ, assigning for error the portion of the charge in brackets above, and the action of the Court in not submitting to the jury the question of fact as to how much, if anything, was due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the plaintiffs from the defendants upon the evidence in the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-6\"><em>Murray^ &amp; Gordon, Hood GiVpin, </em>and <em>Charles Gilpin </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">The will of George W.

Churchman, deceased, with the value of that timber so delivered. The plaintiffs in error, who are two of the heirs of G. W. Churchman, deceased, might act individually or as agents for the Wrights, who are their co-tenants in common, but cannot bind the est\u00e1te of George W. Churchman, because there is no power in the will from which such an authority could be implied: Brush <em>v. </em>Ware, 15 Peters, 111; Williams on Executors, 1, 717, 6th Am.

That there was a conversion does not help the cas\u00e9 of the defendants in error, for it was only Churchman\u2019s interest which was converted, not the Wrights\u2019. To the Wrights, they are accountable as agents; to the Churchman heirs, they are accountable as executors : Seip <em>v. </em>Drach, 2 Harris, 352.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b148-8\">May 21, 1883.</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A5f\">Per Ctjriam :</author>\n<p id=\"AzV\">The will of George W. Churchman provided for the sale of the real estate, from which the timber, which forms the subject of the present controversy, was taken, whenever his executors should think it would bring its real value. This direction not only worked a conversion of the realty, but also gave the executors the full power to dispose of it, and this power they were to exercise in such a way as to realize the greatest sum possible from the property committed to their care. Now, as the lands were timbered and unimproved, and as they were held with tenants in common, the executors seemed to think, and in this they were doubtless right, that the largest amount could be realized from them by having the timber manufactured and put into the market. Had this timber, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, been cut down and lying in the woods, I suppose that no one would contend that the executors had not the power to contract with the tenants in (Common, or others, to manufacture and market it. But as the whole property in their hands was, in effect, but personalty, we can see no good reason why they could not so contract to have it taken from the stump, manufactured, and marketed. As to the remaining assignments, we have but to say, that they complain of the Court for not doing just what it did do. The Court did submit the evidence to the jury, and told them that the Wrights would be entitled to recover the amount they might find to be due them, under all the evidence of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
