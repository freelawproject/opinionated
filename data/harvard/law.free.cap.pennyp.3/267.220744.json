M. Ulp, to recover upon a lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-12\">At the trial before McDermitt, P. J., the following facts appeared: On January 27, 1869, the plaintiff sold and conveyed to It. M. Ulp, his heirs and assigns, all the coal under a certain tract of land containing about a hundred acres in Hickory township, Mercer county, Pennsylvania, \u201cgranting to the party of the second part, (Ulp,) his heirs and assigns, as well'as their laborers and workmen, the right to enter upon said land at any time hereafter and search for coal, together with all rights and privileges incident to the mining, securing, and removing said coal, including the right of ingress and egress, and to dig, mine, explore, and occupy (with such constructions and buildings as may be necessary and useful for the full enjoyment of said coal) not more\"than three acres of land. ****** The party of the second part, by himself, his assigns, and workmen at such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>time as he may choose, within six months, agree to make search for said coal; and if he find coal of sufficient thickness, quantity, and quality to justify opening and working, then lift or his representatives or assigns shall pay unto the said first party, her representatives, or assigns the sum of five hundred dollars, ($500,) one thousand dollars ($1,000) at the expiration of eighteen months from the above date, being the 27th day of January, 1869, and two thousand dollars ($2,000) each year after the expiration of said eighteen months during the continuance of this indenture ; and the failure to make search within the said time, and the failure to make such yearly payments within ten days made upon the second party or his assigns, shall be an- abandonment of this grant, and the second party or his assigns shall have a right to abandon said lands and mining and remove all buildings and fixtures. The mining of coal by the said party or his assigns shall be a sufficient compliance by him with his covenants. The second party, by himself or his assigns, agrees to pay the first party, her legal representatives, or assigns, the sum of thirty cents for each ton (2,240 pounds) of merchantable coal mined and removed from said land herein described. The payment of rent per ton, as aforesaid, shall be made half yearly, and all payments in this indenture shall- be made and accepted in bankable funds of the State of Pennsylvania. It is understood and agreed that the payments of $500, $1,000, and $2,000, as aforesaid, when made, are to apply on the rent of coal first mined thereafter, and such yearly payments cease whenever the second party or his assigns abandons this agreement.\u201d The party of the second part was to mine seven thousand tons each year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">On August 2, 1869, Ulp assigned all his interest in the above lease to the defendants. Six months after the execution of the lease, the company defendant paid to the plaintiff $500, eighteen months after the execution of the lease they paid $1,000, and thereafter $2,000 each year until 1878. No coal was mined until July, 1878. November 13, 1879, this suit was brought to recover the balance of the annual payments then due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">The defendants gave evidence to the following effect:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">They abandoned the mine about October 28, 1881. Up to this time, the amount of coal taken out was forty-six thousand tons forty pounds. The royalty upon this, at thirty cents a ton, was $13,802 72. They had advanced to plaintiff $17,000. All the coal was taken out that was minable. It was bad and thin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The Court charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-4\">\u201cAlthough, perhaps, not at all material to this case, we are of the opinion that the half-yearly payments referred to only apply to the coal mined, the royalty upon which would exceed the above sums mentioned as payable at such stated periods. Thus, for instance, if in the first six months of any given year the royalty on the coal mined exceeded $1,000, such excess was payable at the end of said six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">Their contract also provided that said yearly payments should cease whenever the second party abandons this agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">On the 2d day of August, 1869, the said Ulp assigned all his interest in the above indenture to James Westerman and others, and the plaintiff has brought this suit against the defendants in this case, as the assignees of said Ulp. That the defendants are the assignees of said Ulp is admitted by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">[Whatever liabilities were imposed upon Ulp by the agreement between him and the plaintiff in this case are now devolved upon the defendants as his assignees, and they are personally liable to this suit.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">Ulp, under whom the defendants claim, was the sole judge of whether he found coal in sufficient thickness, quality, and quantity to justify mining it, and whether he did\" or not, he could have abandoned the agreement at any time, and thus absolved himself from any liability upon such subsequent stated payments. So his assignees, the defendants, could at any time, even without, the consent of the plaintiff, have absolved themselves from all future liability on such future payments by abandoning the agreement. If, however, they saw fit no't to abandon the agreement, but remained in possession of the premises down to the bringing of this suit, they are liable to the payment of all such stated payments, with interest thereon from the time they severally fell due, after deducting therefrom the amount which has been shown to have been paid by them to apply thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">We have been requested to answer some poi\u00fcts.
