This home is now located at the corner of Powelton avenue and Saunders avenue, in West Philadelphia. It was moved there from thirty-nine hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and something Locust street, in October, 1879. It is' immediately opposite the Old Man\u2019s Home. I have known the decedent, Miss Shields, about four years. <em>I </em>had an interview with her at 429 North Seventh street, in her front parlor, on Tuesdhy before her death. I called on Miss Shields, not knowing she was a subscriber to our home. When I handed her the report she did not look at it, but said: \u201clama subscriber to the Blind Asylum,\u201d or \u00a3 \u00a3 Blind' Institute.\u201d I think she said \u201cThe Blind Institute ; \u201d either the Blind Asylum or Blind Institute. It was the \u201cBlind Institute.\u201d Then I corrected her, and 1 said to her: \u201c Miss Shields, this is the Industrial Home for Blind Women.\u201d She said: \u201cYes, it is the one over in W est Philadelphia.\u201d The report had the name on the back. She told me at the same time, that the lady who collected her subscription was not one of the managers, but that it was a Mrs. B. Then Miss Shields got talking about the institution, and she seemed to take quite an interest in it. She did not then, or at any other time in her conversation with me, refer to the other institution at Twentieth and Hace. I called her attention to it, when she said the \u201cBlind Institute.\u201d I said that was at Twentieth and Hace, and when I said that, she said : \u201cI don\u2019t mean that, I mean the one over at West Philadelphia.\u201d She had been a subscriber to our home since 1870 or 1871. She paid $1 a year, and her brother $1 a year, and, at his death, she doubled her subscription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">Mr. Sharpless offered in evidence the private memorandum-book of the testatrix, containing twelve entries of contributions to the Industrial Home, the first being \u201cDecember 21,1S69, Industrial Home for Blind Women, $1 and the last,\u00a3 \u00a3 December 8,1879, Industrial Home for Blind' Women, $2.\u201d All of these entries were in this form except two in 1873 and 1874, which were \u00a3 \u00a3 Home for the Blind, $1.\u201d Intermingled with them were entries of contributions to \u201cOld Men\u2019s Home.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-7\">Counsel who drew her will testified that the name as it was written in the instrument was from a memorandum in her own hand. It was in evidence that she took the <em>Public Ledger </em>and that it contained through the year-1878 an advertisement as follows : \u201cInstitution for tlie Blind. Exhibition every Wednesday at half past three, p. h. Select music. Doors open at half past two. Admission, ten cents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-9\">The auditing judge filed his report as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-10\">\u201c On behalf of the Industrial Home for Blind Women, it- was contended by Messrs. Junkin and Sharpless that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the words of the will, \u2018 the Institution for the Blind of Philadelphia,\u2019 were used by the testatrix in a general sense and as a descriptive merely; that such words being equally applicable to all institutions for the blind in Philadelphia, there being several, the case was one of latent ambiguity, to be determined, under well-settled principles, by parol evidence <em>dehors </em>the will. To show that the Pennsylvania Industrial Home for Blind Women was the institution intended, it was proved that for a number of years the testatrix had been one of its regular contributors ; that her contributions appeared in her own liandTvriting in the same book with those made to the Old Man\u2019s Home \u2014 (admittedly one of her residuary legatees, and mentioned in the will in the same paragraph with the Institution for the Blind ;) that she had never been known to contribute to The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind ; that the Old Man\u2019s Home and the Industrial Home for Blind Women were both located in West Philadelphia, and were naturally, therefore, associated in the mind of the testatrix ; and that on one occasion, two days before her death, she had spoken of the Industrial Home for Blind Women as the \u201cBlind Asylum\u201d or Blind Institute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">Opposed to the claim, it appeared, however, that the testatrix was not an officer or manager of the Industrial Home for the Blind ; that she had never been known to visit or to manifest special interest in it; that her contributions were only made when called for by the ladies connected with the house ; and that they amounted in all to about $15 during a period of eleven years. It further appeared that the book showing these and the contributions to the Old Man\u2019s Home, contained also contributions to numerous other charitable or religious corporations which do not appear as legatees in her will; and that no contributions were made in her lifetime toother charities, as <em>e. g. </em>the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, <em>&amp;a., </em>&amp;c., which do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">Yery little aid, therefore, is furnished to the claim of the Industrial Home by the fact of these subscriptions, or by its association, if such it can be called, in the same book with the Old Man\u2019s Home ; and even that little entirely disappears in view of other matters to be presently mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">The only additional fact adduced in support of their claim by 'Messrs. Junkin and Sharpless was that, on a single occasion, when, two days before her death. Miss Gfutekunst, a manager of the home, called to invite the testatrix to become a contributor (not being aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>she was already one), she referred to the Home as \u00a3 \u00a3 the Blind Asylum,\u201d or \u201cthe Blind Institute;\u201d the witness being not quite certain which, though inclining to the latter designation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">If this testimony, standing by itself, were of any importance whatever, its effect is wholly neutralized by the evidence furnished by the subscription-book of the testatrix, in which, while for 1873 and 1874, the only contribution appearing is to the \u201cHome for the Blind,\u201d those made for 1869, \u201970, \u201972, \u201975, \u201976, \u201977, \u201978, \u201979, and \u201980 are in her own handwriting entered as made to the \u201cIndustrial Home for Blind AYomen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-7\">With knowledge of the correct title of the Industrial Home for Blind Women and its habitual use by the testatrix thus established, it is impossible to believe that in an instrument of so much solemnity and importance as a will she would employ general and equivocal terms to describe an intended beneficiary with whose precise name she was so perfectly familiar. The names of her residuary legatees, it was proved by Mr. Thorn, by whom the will was prepared, were furnished to him by the testatrix in her own handwriting, and were inserted just as she gave them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">If it be conceded that the words of the will are descriptive merely, it seems clear from the evidence that the Industrial Home must be excluded from taking under them \u2014 if, indeed, a gift to an institution for \u201c the blind \u201d would not by its terms exclude an institution for a single class or sex, as against an institution for the blind generally, without qualification of class, sex, or color.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-9\">But the evidence left no doubt in the mind of the auditing judge that the words of the testatrix were not used in a general sense, but as a specific and correct designation of the intended object of her bounty. It was clearly shown that, while \u201c The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind\u201d is the corporate name of the institution familiarly spoken of as the Blind Asylum, located at the corner of Pace and Twentieth streets, in the city of Philadelphia, it is well known in the community as \u201cThe Institution for the Blind,\u201d the words \u201cPennsylvania\u201d and \u201cInstruction\u201d being, for brevity, dropped out, just as is often the case with an individual having more than a single Christian name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-10\">This appears from the testimony of Miss Gutekunst, which has already been referred to, but it was established beyond controversy by the production of the advertisements of the exhibition given by the pupils of- the insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>tufcion on Wednesday of each week, which, for many years, have been published twice a week, in the <em>Public Ledger </em>(a paper shown to have been taken by the testatrix) and in the <em>Inquirer </em>\u2014 in which the title is thus uniformly given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">Upon the whole, it is clear that the only institution of the blind entitled under the will is that to which the award was made by the adjudication of the first account filed by the executor, viz : The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind; otherwise known, as the testatrix has called it, as \u201cThe Institution for the Blind and the share withheld from distribution by the adjudication filed February 7, 1882, is accordingly now so\u2019awarded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">Exceptions to the above adjudication were thereupon filed by the Pennsylvania Industrial Home for Blind Women:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-7\">\u201cThat the learned judge erred and that new and material testimony had been discovered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-8\">Upon these exceptions, the testimony of <em>Rebecca Hall Parker </em>was taken, who testified, <em>inter </em>alia, in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-9\">I knew the decedent, Miss Mary Shields, in her lifetime. I was intimate with her. There was rarely a day passed that we did not see. each other and sometimes oftener. I went with her to entertainments to the Pennsylvania Industrial Home for Blind Women. I know of her being interested in this Industrial Home for Blind Women, in West Philadelphia, by going with her that evening and by her telling me that evening that she was a subscriber to it. I never went with her to the entertainments of the Pennsylvania Institution for Instruction for the Blind, at Twentieth and Race streets, and never remember of her mentioning to me that Institution at all. If I knew her mind at all her sympathies went to working women and any who were in a struggling condition. I think she would rather have helped the one in West Philadelphia \u2014Industrial Home \u2014 than the one at Twentieth and Race. I think so from her own kindly disposition towards those who were struggling along, and towards women in particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A09\">April 22, 1882. The Court dismissed the exceptions, Hanna, P. J., filing the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aff\">\u201cWhether testatrix, in the bequest to \u2018 The Institution for the Blind of Philadelphia,\u2019 contemplated \u2018The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind,\u201d or \u2018The Industrial Home for Blind Women,\u2019 as the beneficiary, is solely a question of fact. And neither institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tion being correctly designated, her intention is to be ascertained from the evidence. Her acts and d\u00e9clarations previous to and contemporaneous with the making of the will constitute the best evidence, and that which is alone admissible to explain and remove the ambiguity arising from the language employed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-4\">The first-named institution' is popularly known and designated for the sake of conciseness, even by its officers and managers, as \u00a3 The Institution for the Blind.\u2019 Its organization dates back many years, and it has not only a city, but State and National reputation. It is one of the public charities fostered by the Commonwealth. Being thus so well known, it is not strange that it is familiarly designated as \u2018 The Institution for the Blind,\u2019- or, in still more common parlance, as * The Blind Asylum.\u2019 On the other hand, the foundation of the Home, exclusively for Blind Women, is of comparatively recent date. The testatrix, for a series of years, had been an annual subscriber toward its maintenance, and possessed an accurate knowledge of its corporate title This is apparent from entries in her handwriting in a personal expense-book, wherein she included disbursements for benevolent-objects and subscriptions to religious and charitable societies in which she was interested. But twice in eleven years she incorrectly makes use of the title, \u2018 Home for the Blind,\u2019 while in every other instance employs the name, \u2018 Industrial Home for Blind Women.\u2019 From this and other facts developed, it cannot be doubted that testatrix was well informed not only of the distinctive title, but the purposes of this deserving charity. And if it was her intention to include -it as one of her residuary legatees, it would seem most natural she would indicate that intention in the same clear and unmistakable manner in which she had during many years recorded her contributions. But on the contrary, when, she furnishes her counsel with a draft of her intended will, in her own handwriting, she indicates as an object of her beneficence \u2018The Institution for the Blind.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-5\">In the absence of any statements and declarations of testatrix, or other equally satisfactory evidence of her intention that \u2018 The Industrial Home for Blind Women\u2019 was the charity intended by her as the object of her bounty, and instead of using its corporate title, with which she was familiar, employed a name which, by common usage, had become to be generally applied to another and different institution, to indicate that intention we must reach the same conclusion as the auditing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>judge. We think the evidence fully sustains his finding, that \u2018 The Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind \u2019 was in the mind of testatrix as one of her residuary legatees, and although inaccurately described, \u25a0was intended in the use by her of the name \u2018 Institution for the Blind.\u2019 After a consideration of all the testimony, including that submitted as after-discovered, we see no reason to disturb the finding of the auditing judge. All the facts have been carefully considered by him, and his conclusion, like the verdict of a jury, should not be set aside unless clear error be made to appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-5\">The exceptions are dismissed and the adjudication confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-6\">The Pennsylvania Industrial Home for Blind Women then appealed and assigned as error the dismissal of the exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-7\">W. <em>H.
