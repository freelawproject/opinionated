The language of the bond show's a promise on the part of the May\u2019s Landing Company that defendant will pay the coupons on presentation. The indorsement shows a ratification by defendant of the promise of the other company. The whole is one original and entire transaction: Snevily <em>v. </em>Johnston, 1 W. &amp; S., 309 ; Amsbaugh <em>v. </em>Gearhart, 1 Jones, 482; Ashton <em>r&gt;. </em>Bayard, 21 P. F.

To the same effect is Amsbaugh <em>v. </em>Gearhart. Ashton <em>v. </em>Bayard rests upon the phraseology used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-12\">The indorsement is a mere guarantee: Seiple\u2019s Ap., 11 W.'N. C., 392.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-13\">A corporation cannot make a valid guarantee of the bonds of another corporation without express statutory authority, which must be affirmatively established. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Court cannot take judicial notice of the existence of a private statute giving such authority : Timlow <em>v. </em>Phila. &amp; Reading R.

Sherman, 21 P. F. Sm., 104. In Seiple\u2019s Appeal, supra, the guarantee was no part of the original contract. In Timlow \u00ae. R. R. Co., the want of authority was set up in the affidavit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">The Court -will presume from the execution of the contract the power to make it: Broom\u2019s Leg. Max., 948 ; St. Mary Magdalen \u2022\u00bb. Atty. Gen\u2019l, 6 H. of L. Cases, 189; Robins \u00bb.

It does not aver any fact giving this corporation power to guarantee the payment of a bond of another corporation. Such an act is not within its implied powers ; when the power is claimed to exist, the fact creating it should be averred. The Court committed no error in refusing to enter judgment for the plaintiff. Therefore, writ of error dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff, but without prejudice to his right to trial by jury and second writ of error after final judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
