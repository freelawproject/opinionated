The defendants, Henderson and his wife, lived at Maytown, Lancaster county, with their son, J ames D. Henderson, in whose name a general store was carried on there. In April, 1878, Mrs. Henderson became the owner of a lot of ground with an old building thereon, situated opposite the store in Maytown. Soon after, it was resolved by the Hendersons to build a dwelling-house upon this lot, and the necessary orders were given to architect, carpenters, hardware dealers, painters, and other trades-people and workmen, some of whom received instructions and payment from Mrs. Henderson, others from her husband, and some were paid by store orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-12\">In the summer of 1878, James B. Henderson ordered lumber for the house from the plaintiffs to the amount of $600. He agreed to give his notes for it at three and six months, and said he would give good indorsers. All the lumber shipped was charged to James B. Henderson.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-13\"><em>J, H. </em>Wagner, one of the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKX\">testified that the contract was made with J. B. Henderson; that he was the only person he then knew in the transaction ; that he dealt with no one else ; that the credit was given to J. B. Henderson, and not to his wife. He further testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>that, about the 1st of September, 1878, having been informed that the house was being built on the wife\u2019s land, he went to Maytown, and remained at Henderson\u2019s over night. He testified that \u201cMrs. Henderson was very much pleased with the materials furnished. * * She took me out to the house, and showed me the plans, how she wanted the porches built. * * I think she had a flower put in front of the house, and she gave directions in regard to that.\u201d The witness received orders from James B. Henderson at this visit to continue his shipments of lumber,, and, as before, shipped and charged to him only. The total amount of lumber furnished by the plaintiffs was $1,131 64, and the only credits were fora pair of shoes from the Henderson store, $3, and J. B. Henderson\u2019s check of October 18, 1878, for $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-9\">Upon the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, defendants moved that a non-suit be entered, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant a recovery against Mrs. Henderson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-10\">The motion was granted, a juror was withdrawn, and judgment of non-suit ordered and entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-11\">A rule to strike off the non-suit was subsequently discharged, whereupon plaintiffs took this writ, assigning for error the action of the Court in not setting aside the judgment of non-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-12\"><em>J, W.

It is true the lumber was used in the building of a house on the land of the wife with her knowledge. The evidence, however, does not show that she made any agreement for the purchase of the lumber whereby either she, personally, or her land should be bound. On the contrary, the evidence shows the only contract for the lumber was made with the husband in his own right. She was never asked to assume any liability. The effort now is not to recover on a contract which she did make, but on one which she did not make, and to which she was in no manner a party. The evidence was, therefore, insufficient to submit to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
