Subsequent to the date of the court of appeals opinion below, we held in <em>State ex rel. Draganic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>St.3d 461, 663 N.E.2d 929, that the commission was not required to extend permanent total disability compensation beyond the date specified in an interlocutory permanent total disability order.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Our second task involves our standard evidentiary review. In this instance, we find that the commission\u2019s order is not supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Our analysis is hindered by a commission order that is uncomfortably vague as to both claimant\u2019s medical and nonmedical capabilities. Unlike most of the permanent total disability orders that come before us, this order does not identify what the commission believes claimant\u2019s residual medical abilities to be, <em>i.e., </em>sedentary, light, medium, etc. The commission\u2019s reference to Dr. Smith\u2019s report is equally unenlightening since he, too, avoids categorizing claimant\u2019s physical abilities. His admonition that claimant avoid extreme motion and extreme spinal rotation does little to instruct us as to what types of work claimant is and is not capable of doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">This deficiency complicates our review because it is within the context of claimant\u2019s medical abilities that our review of nonmedical factors must, by necessity, fall. In this case, the commission\u2019s nbnmedical conclusions were premised not on its own independent analysis, but instead upon the reports of Barbara Burk. We find, however, that Burk does not support the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant is vocationally amenable to re-employment. To the contrary, when Burk\u2019s reports are considered cumulatively, they establish that claimant is vocationally incapable of securing or performing work within her medical capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">We find, therefore, that there is no evidence supporting the commission\u2019s assessment of a nonmedical capacity for work. As such, and consistent with our decision in <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b836-10\">Douglas, Resnxck and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ASC\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b836-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZf\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying the claimant further permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>This is a mandamus action. The standard of review of a mandamus action is whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 658 N.E.2d 1055. There is no abuse of discretion if the commission\u2019s decision is supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. The commission is the exclusive evaluator of the evidence and the claimant\u2019s disability. <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 266, 268, 680 N.E.2d 1233, 1235. Therefore, \u201cwhen some evidence for the commission\u2019s decision exists, the decision must be upheld even if contradicted by other evidence a reviewing court considers more persuasive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In the case at bar, there is medical evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings. Dr. Smith, on whom the commission relied, found lumbar tenderness, but also reported normal gait and spinal appearance. A lack of spasm was also noted. Claimant\u2019s reduced motion and tenderness prompted Dr. Smith to restrict claimant from lifting and bending. However, Dr. Smith specifically permitted the claimant to perform overhead activities and stated that routine walking, standing, or sitting by claimant would not be problematic. This implies a physical capacity by claimant for sedentary light work and is, therefore, \u201csome evidence\u201d of a medical ability to perform sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis relies on earlier vocational reports of Barbara Burk. In her January 13, 1990 report, Burk stated that, based on claimant\u2019s vocational factors, \u201cthere are no jobs which Mrs. Kinnebreu would be capable of successfully performing.\u201d However, in an October 26, 1992 letter generated by Dr. Smith\u2019s examination, Burk concluded that \u201cthere are no jobs existing <em>in significant numbers </em>which Ms. Kinnebreu would be capable of competitively performing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Obviously there is conflicting evidence on the issue of whether there are jobs the claimant can perform. However, using its discretion, the commission based its decision on Burk\u2019s October 26, 1992 letter. The commission interpreted Burk\u2019s letter as indicating that while there were not a lot of jobs within the claimant\u2019s combined physical and nonmedical capacities, some did exist. This conclusion is within the commission\u2019s province because \u201c[t]he commission alone shall be responsible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>evaluation of the weight and credibility of the evidence before it.\u201d <em>Coil Packing, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 20-21, 31 OBR at 72, 508 N.E.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Accordingly, I would hold that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying the claimant further permanent total disability compensation because the decision was supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d Therefore, I would reverse the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b838-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\">. The majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwhen Burk\u2019s reports are considered cumulatively, they establish that the claimant is vocationally incapable of securing or performing work within her medical capacities\u201d is misplaced. The <em>cumulative </em>reports to which the majority alludes specifically refer to a November 24, 1993 letter from Burk in which she attempts to clarify her earlier statement pertaining to the claimant. It is important' to note that this document did not issue until after the claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation had been determined by the commission. Therefore, it should not be considered in reviewing the commission\u2019s decision. To do so would circumvent the commission\u2019s authority as exclusive interpreter of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
