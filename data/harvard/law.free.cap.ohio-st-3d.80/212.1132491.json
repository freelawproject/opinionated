CODE ANN. \u00a7 2307.31 and \u00a7 2307.32, is a contribution defendant\u2019s liability for wrongful death extinguished by the contribution plaintiffs settlement with the underlying claimant, which settlement includes a full and final release naming both the contribution plaintiff and contribution defendant, where the contribution defendant had already been dismissed with prejudice as a matter of law from the underlying claimant\u2019s action based upon the statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u201c[2] For purposes of OHIO REV. CODE ANN. \u00a7 2307.31(B), is a contribution defendant\u2019s liability for wrongful death extinguished by the contribution plaintiffs settlement with the underlying claimant, which settlement includes a full and final release naming both the contribution plaintiff and contribution defendant, where <em>res judicata </em>barred the underlying tort claim against the contribution defendant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer each certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">At common law, contribution was \u201cthe right of a person who has been compelled to pay what another should have paid in part to require partial (usually proportionate) reimbursement and [arose] from principles of equity and natural justice.\u201d <em>Travelers Indemn. Co. v. Trowbridge </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 11, 70 O.O.2d 6, 321 N.E.2d 787, paragraph two of the syllabus, overruled on other grounds in <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Huron Rd. Hosp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 391, 653 N.E.2d 235. However, contribution was not allowed between concurrent or joint tortfeasors. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 70 O.O.2d at 8-9, 321 N.E.2d at 790. To alleviate this inequity, the General Assembly enacted a statutory scheme that enabled a tortfeasor to pursue a contribution claim against any joint tortfeasors. R.C. 2307.31 and 2307.32.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Former R.C. 2307.31(A) stated, \u201c[I]f two or more persons are jointly and severally liable in tort for * * * the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them. * * * \u201d (Now found in R.C. 2307.32[A].)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Former R.C. 2307.31(B) stated, \u201cA tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not entitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability for * * * the wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement * * (Now found in R.C. 2307.32[B].)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Former R.C. 2307.31(G) stated, \u201cWhether or not judgment has been entered in an action against two or more tortfeasors for * * * the same wrongful death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>contribution may be enforced by separate action.\u201d (Now found in R.C. 2307.32[G].)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Former R.C. 2307.32(B) stated, \u201cIf there is a judgment for * * * wrongful death against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, any separate action by him to enforce contribution shall be commenced within one year after the judgment has become final by lapse of time for appeal or after appellate review.\u201d (Now found in R.C. 2307.33[B].)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">A contribution claim may go forward notwithstanding the lack of a judgment on the underlying claim against the contribution defendant, notwithstanding even the lack of an action on the underlying claim. R.C. 2307.31(A), (B) and (G). The contribution defendant need merely be \u201cliable in tort\u201d for the same injury to be subject to a contribution claim. R.C. 2307.31(A). We conclude with respect to R.C. 2307.31(A) that \u201cliable in tort\u201d means no more than that the contribution defendant acted tortiously and thereby caused damages. This conclusion is in keeping -with the evident purpose of the statutory scheme to make contribution readily available between joint tortfeasors. That Hoffmann was not \u201csusceptible to suffer an adverse judgment in a maintainable action by [the underlying claimant]\u201d at the time the contribution action was filed is not dispositiva <em>Henry v. Consol. Stores Intematl. Corp. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 417, 422, 624 N.E.2d 796, 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Hoffmann argues that the expiration of the limitations period on the underlying tort claim extinguished its liability and therefore that a subsequent contribution action is also barred. See <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Shenefield </em>(1992), 85 Ohio App.3d 563, 620 N.E.2d 866. But, see, <em>Henry, supra. </em>Acceptance of that position by this court would enable plaintiffs to absolve chosen defendants of liability. The plaintiff could wait to file a complaint until a claim against one of the defendants, but not the other, was time-barred, thereby destroying the disfavored defendant\u2019s statutory right to contribution. See <em>Smith v. Jackson </em>(1986), 106 Wash.2d 298, 301-302, 721 P.2d 508, 509-510; <em>Sziber v. Stout </em>(1984), 419 Mich. 514, 536-537, 358 N.W.2d 330, 339-340. Such a situation is inequitable and was clearly not intended by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The injustice of the position advocated by Hoffmann is further illustrated by the \u201cintolerable paradox\u201d discussed in <em>Henry, </em>89 Ohio App.3d at 423, 624 N.E.2d at 800. Hoffmann\u2019s position is that a contribution defendant\u2019s liability is not extinguished by a settlement within the meaning of R.C. 2307.31(B), and therefore that contribution is not available, where the contribution defendant has already been dismissed with prejudice from the underlying suit. In other words, it was the dismissal, not the settlement, that extinguished Hoffmann\u2019s liability. According to this argument, a settling tortfeasor is barred from pursuing a fellow tortfeasor who was dismissed but not one who was never sued. It is apparent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>us that the General Assembly did not intend the underlying claimant\u2019s diligence, or lack of diligence, to affect the contribution plaintiffs right to contribution. This conclusion is evidenced by the fact that the statutory scheme does not require a judgment or even an action as a prerequisite to a contribution claim. R.C. 2307.31(A) and (G).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">A defendant who loses at trial to the underlying claimant has a clear right to pursue contribution from a joint tortfeasor unless the joint tortfeasor has been adjudicated not liable. To hold otherwise with respect to a defendant who \u201closes\u201d by settling would penalize tortfeasors for settling. The statutes do not support and we cannot justify such a rule. To the contrary, we should strive to remove obstacles to settlement efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Based on our analysis of the entire statutory scheme, we are convinced that the General Assembly\u2019s primary intention in enacting R.C. 2307.31(B) was to prevent the inequitable situation of a tortfeasor paying contribution to a fellow tortfeasor who has settled <em>and </em>remaining subject to liability on the underlying claim. Though the words \u201cextinguished by the settlement\u201d are not surplusage, they cannot mean that a joint tortfeasor may avoid liability for contribution because of a technical nicety. Rather, we conclude that the General Assembly intended to ensure that no contribution defendant would be subject to double liability. In this case, Hoffmann is not subject to double liability, because it was specifically named in the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The certified questions before us compel stark \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers. Such choices make our task easier, because we need do no more than answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and harder, because it is so difficult to foresee all the situations that will be governed by our answer. See Kutner, Contribution Among Tortfeasors: The Effects of Statutes of Limitations and Other Time Limitations (1980), 33 Okla. L.Rev. 203 (fourteen hypothetical cases involving contribution and statutes of limitations). With that in mind, we are convinced that a negative answer to the first certified question would frustrate the purpose of the statutory scheme and exacerbate the plight of parties seeking contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We conclude that a contribution plaintiffs claim should not be compromised merely because the underlying claimant failed to comply with a statute of limitations as to the contribution defendant. This position has been adopted by an \u201coverwhelming majority of jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Smith v. Jackson, supra, </em>106 Wash.2d at 302, 721 P.2d at 510. See Annotation, What Statute of Limitations Applies to Action for Contribution Against Joint Tortfeasor (1975), 57 A.L.R.3d 867. We answer the first certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">We turn now to the second certified question. The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>involves both claim preclusion (historically called estoppel by judgment) and issue preclusion (traditionally known as collateral estoppel). <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 381, 653 N.E.2d 226, 228. Claim preclusion \u201cprevents a party from litigating a cause of action after a prior court has rendered a final judgment on the merits of that cause as to that party.\u201d <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 107, 538 N.E.2d 1058, 1062, citing <em>Norwood v. McDonald </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 299, 27 O.O. 240, 52 N.E.2d 67, paragraph one of the syllabus. Issue preclusion \u201cprecludes the relitigation of an issue that has been \u2018actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Krahn, </em>43 Ohio St.3d at 107, 538 N.E.2d at 1062, quoting <em>Goodson v. McDonough Power Equip., Inc. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 193, 195, 2 OBR 732, 734, 443 N.E.2d 978, 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">This court recognized in <em>Natl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Whitmer </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 149, 151-152,24 O.O.3d 248, 249, 435 N.E.2d 1121, 1123, that a contribution action differs from the underlying action when it stated that \u201c[i]t is clear from the provisions of the Act [R.C. 2307.31 and 2307.32] that the liability for contribution is distinct from the liability for the jointly committed tort. * * * Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme for contribution does not concern the basic relationship of tortfeasors to one who has suffered injury but establishes the relationship of tortfeasors <em>inter se </em>when one of them discharges the common liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Based on the. distinction between a tort claim and a contribution claim noted by this court in <em>Whitmer </em>and the above analysis regarding the first certified question, we conclude that <em>res judicata </em>does not preclude a contribution claim when the underlying claim failed because of the expiration of a statute of limitations. We answer the second certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-8\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.

The applicable statute of limitations, not the release obtained by MetroHealth Medical Center (\u201cMetroHealth\u201d) in connection with its settlement, \u201cextinguished\u201d any potential liability on the part of Hoffmann-La Roche (\u201cHoffmann\u201d) for Linda Carr\u2019s death within the meaning of former R.C. 2307.31(B). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that MetroHealth possesses a statutory right to seek contribution from Hoffmann.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">A joint tortfeasor\u2019s right to seek contribution from others who may be liable for the victim\u2019s injury is derived solely from statute. Former R.C. 2307.31(B) foreclosed a settling tortfeasor from seeking contribution from any other tortfea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>sor whose potential liability for \u201cthe injury or loss to person or property or the wrongful death is not extinguished <em>by the settlement </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In interpreting a statute, courts must first look to its language to determine what the legislature intended. <em>Slingluff v. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574, paragraph two of the syllabus. Words and phrases of the statute must be read in context and accorded their common usage. R.C. 1.42. The common usages of \u201cextinguish\u201d and \u201cliable\u201d are accurately set forth by the Huron County Court of Appeals in the following passage from <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Shenefield </em>(1992), 85 Ohio App.3d 563, 567-568, 620 N.E.2d 866, 869:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u201cIn common usage, \u2018extinguish\u2019 is defined, among other things, as \u2018bring to an end,\u2019 \u2018to reduce to silence or ineffectiveness\u2019 and \u2018to cause to be void: NULLIFY.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Ninth Collegiate Dictionary (1990) 440. \u2018Liability\u2019 is a legal term which can be broadly defined, as in this case, as \u2018responsibility for torts.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 823. One who is \u2018liable\u2019 is \u2018responsible,\u2019 \u2018chargeable\u2019 or \u2018answerable.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 824. Certainly, a successful demonstration of an immunity or affirmative defense renders a plaintiff\u2019s claim of liability against a defendant ineffective and brings that liability to an end for all legal purposes. The defendant is no longer \u2018chargeable\u2019 with that liability and is not \u2018answerable\u2019 to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">When read in context with the foregoing, the clear import of the phrase \u201cby the settlement\u201d is that, for the statute to create a right of contribution in favor of the settling tortfeasor, the settlement release and no other independent event must extinguish a joint tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the victim. On the other hand, if some other independent event, such as expiration of a statute of limitations or a dismissal with prejudice, has extinguished a tortfeasor\u2019s liability to the victim prior to any settlement, liability no longer exists to be extinguished by a later settlement release.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The majority bases its interpretation of former R.C. 2307.31(B) not on the language of that division, but on an assumption that the legislature couldn\u2019t have meant what it said.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of its analysis, the majority cites the \u201cintolerable paradox\u201d discussed by the Franklin County Court of Appeals in <em>Henry v. Consol. Stores Internatl. Corp. </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 417, 624 N.E.2d 796. That the \u201cintolerable paradox\u201d is itself a fallacy, however, is apparent from analysis of the following <em>Henry </em>rationale:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201cTo accept appellee\u2019s position, under which the statute of limitations, when successfully invoked as a bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 action, may also serve as a bar to co-tortfeasor claims for contribution, is to accept an intolerable paradox: the plaintiffs\u2019 belated suit against defendant\u2019s co-tortfeasor prejudices the defendant\u2019s right to contribution, when the complete absence of a suit clearly would not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423, 624 N.E.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">With respect to the first certified question, it does not matter whether the underlying tort victim named the contribution plaintiff in the tort action, or even that the tort victim filed suit at all. What is important is whether a settlement release obtained from the tort victim extinguished any potential liability on the part of a co-tortfeasor. In this case, the applicable statute of limitations for the tort victim to sue Hoffmann expired before MetroHealth obtained its settlement release. Accordingly, there was simply no remaining liability attributable to Hoffmann for the settlement release to extinguish and, consequently, there is no basis for MetroHealth to compel Hoffmann\u2019s contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">With respect to the second certified question, it is true that \u201cbut for\u201d Hoffmann\u2019s status as a defendant in the underlying tort action there could be no <em>res judicata </em>bar. That <em>res judicata </em>operates in favor of a party <em>because </em>he prevailed in an earlier lawsuit, however, is neither \u201cintolerable\u201d nor a \u201cparadox.\u201d In this case, <em>res judicata, </em>although different in character, acted exactly like the statute of limitations in that it \u2014 not the later settlement release \u2014 extinguished any potential liability of Hoffmann to the tort victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Additionally, the majority rejects the plain language of the statute based on a hypothetical scenario where a plaintiff in a tort action \u201cwait[s] to file a complaint until a claim against one of the defendants, but not the other, is time-barred, thereby destroying the disfavored defendant\u2019s statutory right to contribution.\u201d That a circumstance may exist where application of a statute according to its terms would be undesirable, however, does not give this court authority to ignore the statute\u2019s manifest purpose as revealed by its unambiguous language. As stated in <em>State ex rel. Foster v. Evatt </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 65, 29 O.O. 4, 56 N.E.2d 265, paragraphs seven and eight of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201cCourts have no legislative authority and should not make their office of expounding statutes a cloak for supplying something omitted from an act by. the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u201cThere is no authority under any rule of statutory construction to add to, enlarge, supply, expand, extend or improve the provisions of the statute to meet a situation not provided for.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Applying the plain language of former R.C. 2307.31 and 2307.32 to the facts of this certified case, I conclude that the settlement release obtained by Metro-Health on Hoffmann\u2019s behalf did not act to extinguish Hoffmann\u2019s liability. Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>such liability already had been extinguished by the statute of limitations and <em>res judicata. </em>Accordingly, I would answer both certified questions in the negative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-4\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">.
