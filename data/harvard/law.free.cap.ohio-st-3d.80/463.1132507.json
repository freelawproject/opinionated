It is no justification that respondent\u2019s actions may have been due to stress. Respondent had a continuing responsibility in winding up his affairs as a lawyer to ensure that he took every step to comply with our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Because of respondent\u2019s contempt in this matter, we hereby sentence him to thirty days in jail, which jail sentence is suspended, and fine him $500. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-9\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Relator argued to this court that without jail time this respondent will receive no meaningful sanction, given that he resigned in the face of a recommendation of permanent disbarment. Accordingly, I agree with the judgment of the majority except that I would suspend only twenty-seven of the thirty days.</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-11\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
