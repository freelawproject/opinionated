Absent special circumstances or a \u201cdramatic fact pattern,\u201d postjudgment appeal constitutes a complete, beneficial, and speedy remedy which precludes extraordinary relief in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Toledo Metro Fed. Credit Union v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 529, 531, 678 N.E.2d 1396, 1398. The court of appeals did not err in finding insufficient special circumstances to preclude application of the foregoing rule. As the court of appeals held:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">\u201cThe R.C. 119.12 appeal remedy is complete and, if relator\u2019s contentions are correct, beneficial. There is no evidence that such a remedy would be significantly less speedy than this mandamus action. Indeed, the fact that the R.C. 119.12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>appeal process may encompass more delay and inconvenience than a mandamus action does not prevent such appeal from constituting a plain and adequate remedy at law. * * * As to relator\u2019s argument that an R.C. 119.12 appeal will not undo the alleged failure to provide him with proper notice, the same argument can be made as to this mandamus action. The board has already held its hearing and issued an order against relator. As noted above, relator\u2019s R.C. 119.12 appeal, if successful, may result in a vacation of the board\u2019s order and a remand to the board for appropriate, lawftd proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
