I respectfully dissent. I would grant relator\u2019s complaint for a writ of procedendo and order the respondent trial judge to journalize his orders denying relator\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">On June 20, 1997 relator filed a Motion for Correction or Modification of Record with the respondent. The respondent denied the motion, but allegedly failed to journalize the order. Relator then filed a Motion for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pertaining to the respondent\u2019s denial of relator\u2019s Motion for Correction or Modification of Record. The respondent also denied relator\u2019s Motion for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and again allegedly failed to journalize the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Relator seeks a writ of procedendo to compel the trial court to journalize these orders. Attached to relator\u2019s memorandum in opposition to respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is what appears to be an order by respondent pertaining to one of relator\u2019s aforementioned motions seeking to have the trial court journalize its orders. The order states: \u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Motion to Journalize is hereby denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The respondent asserts that he did journalize both orders, and therefore relator\u2019s motion is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Rule 7 of the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Ohio makes it incumbent upon a court to journalize a judgment at the request of either party where the court has yet to complete the task. If a court refuses to journalize an entry, either party may compel the trial court to do so by filing a petition for a writ of procedendo. <em>Kennedy v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 399, 402, 16 OBR 469, 471, 476 N.E.2d 683, 687. Therefore, a party has a clear legal right to have a trial court journalize a judgment but has no remedy in the ordinary course of the law to compel a court to carry out this duty. A writ is a party\u2019s only recourse because a defendant cannot appeal the court\u2019s judgment until it has been journalized. Civ.R. 58(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In effect, a court\u2019s failure to journalize an order would deprive a party of his or her right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">In the case at bar, relator has provided a copy of an order which indicates that respondent denied relator\u2019s Motion to Journalize entries pertaining to relator\u2019s case. The respondent has failed to provide this court with any documentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>evidence that would indicate that the entries dismissing relator\u2019s motions <em>were </em>journalized. Therefore, I would find that, based on the limited \u201crecord\u201d before this court, the trial court failed to journalize the orders denying relator\u2019s motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would have granted relator\u2019s complaint for a writ of procedendo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\">. A motion seeking to compel a trial judge to correct the record in a criminal case is civil in nature. See <em>State ex rel. Martinelli v. Corrigan </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 362, 626 N.E.2d 954. A motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law is also civil in nature. Civ.R. 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-12\">. I realize that there is a possibility that the respondent court\u2019s entry (attached to relator\u2019s memorandum in opposition) which denied relator\u2019s Motion to Journalize <em>may </em>have done so because it was moot. However, the entry did not make any such specification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
