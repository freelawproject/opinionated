Our Ethical Considerations expressed in EC 7-1 state that \u201c[t]he duty of a lawyer, both to his client and to the legal system, is to represent his client zealously <em>unthin the bounds of the law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Therefore, While the advocate has a duty to use legal procedure to benefit the client\u2019s cause, the advocate also has a duty not to abuse legal procedure. The law, both procedural and substantive, establishes the limits within which an advocate may proceed. We conclude from the facts in this case that respondent has abused the tools of the system to the detriment of both his clients and our system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Despite consistent rulings to the contrary in the trial and appellate courts, respondent persisted in acting on his unique view that the savings clause of R.C. 2305.19 might be employed in conjunction with Civ.R. 41 to allow a case to be refiled an indefinite number of times. As a result, several of respondent\u2019s clients lost their causes of action. DR 6-101(A)(l) requires that a lawyer not undertake a matter that he is not qualified to handle, and DR 6-101(A)(2) requires that a lawyer not handle a matter without adequate preparation. Here, respondent either was not qualified to handle those cases or handled them without adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>preparation. Further, we conclude that respondent failed to seek his clients\u2019 lawful objectives in violation of DR 7-101(A)(l), failed to carry out his contracts of employment in violation of DR 7-101(A)(2), and intentionally prejudiced or damaged his clients in violation of DR 7-101(A)(3). Thus, respondent used the tools of his profession to the detriment of his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">DR 1-102(A)(5) states that a lawyer shall not \u201c[ejngage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Fair competition in the adversary system presumes, among other things, that attorneys will not employ obstructive tactics in the discovery procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The transcripts of hearings in the various cases before the common pleas court attached to the motion for default make clear that respondent repeatedly failed to respond to the discovery requests of his opponents. When a case for which respondent was responsible was about to be dismissed for failure to respond to discovery requests, respondent\u2019s practice was to voluntarily dismiss the case under Civ.R. 41 and then refile the same action within a year. Respondent would repeat this process several times for each matter. When asked at a hearing in common pleas court why he did not respond to discovery, respondent provided rambling answers about the magnitude of his caseload, the difficulty he had in contacting clients, the fact that his paralegal had been \u201chired away\u201d or injured, and, significantly, the small amount offered by the defendant to settle the case. Thus it appears that after respondent filed a case, he would undertake no further action until confronted by the possibility of dismissal with prejudice for failure to respond to the defendant\u2019s discovery requests. Then respondent would keep the cause of action alive by the stratagem of voluntary dismissal and serial refiling, all in the hopes of obtaining an acceptable settlement offer. In short, respondent consistently employed tactics of evasion and delay, a strategy out of keeping with the purpose and intent of our system of orderly procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">' We conclude that the tactics employed by respondent to circumvent discovery, in several instances for more than five years, were prejudicial to the administration of justice and a violation of DR 1-102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">One of the goals of our legal system is the prompt resolution of disputes. Our Civil Rules are designed to achieve this result. Civ.R. 1(B) states that \u201c[tjhese rules shall be construed and applied to effect just results by eliminating delay, unnecessary expense and all other impediments to the expeditious administration of justice.\u201d Civ.R. 11 states, \u201cThe signature of an attorney * * * constitutes a certificate * * * that * * * [the document] is not interposed for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">DR 7-102(A)(l) provides that a lawyer shall not \u201cconduct a defense, delay a trial, or take other action on behalf of his client * * * when it is obvious that such action would serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another.\u201d Dilatory practices bring the administration of justice into disrepute. As the American Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Association stated in its Comment to Rule 3.2 of its Model Rules of Professional Conduct, \u201cDelay should not be indulged merely for the convenience of the advocates, or for the purpose of frustrating an opposing party\u2019s attempt to obtain rightful redress or repose.\u201d ABA/BNA Lawyers\u2019 Manual on Professional Conduct (1990), at 01:147. Engaging, as respondent did, in a procedure or tactic that had no substantial purpose other than delay constituted representation outside the bounds of the spirit and intent of our law. We conclude that the tactic of delay employed by respondent violated DR 7-102(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Moreover, respondent failed to respond to the complaint before this court. Neither in his brief nor in his oral presentation did respondent address either his failure to answer relator\u2019s complaint or his failure to respond to relator\u2019s motion for default. Instead, in replying to our order to show cause why the recommendation of the board should not be confirmed by the court, respondent filed a response and objections, a brief in support, and a motion requesting remand. To that document respondent attached five exhibits. In oral argument before this court, respondent also sought to explain his actions in the various cases with new material. As we said in <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Sterner </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 164, 167-168, 672 N.E.2d 633-635, \u201cRule V of the Rules for the Government of the Bar of Ohio, setting forth detailed procedures for [disciplinary] matters * * * has no provision for the introduction of evidence in the brief filed in this court or in the oral argument to this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">We hereby indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio.
