By failing to follow up and ensure that the settlement of Moore\u2019s case was communicated to the judge and by failing to take any action on behalf of VanKampen and Kiracofe, respondent neglected legal matters and inconvenienced his clients. Because of respondent\u2019s obvious remorse, his apparently successful efforts at rehabilitation, and his return of the retainers to his clients, we believe that the public reprimand as recommended by the board is warranted in this case. Respondent is so reprimanded. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
