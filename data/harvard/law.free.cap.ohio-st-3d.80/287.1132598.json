S.Ct. Prac.R. V(6) provides that in appeals to this court, \u201c[i]f any part of the record is not transmitted to the Supreme Court but is necessary to the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the questions presented on appeal, the Supreme Court, on its own initiative or upon stipulation of the parties or motion of a party, may direct that a supplemental record be certified and transmitted to the Clerk of the Supreme Court.\u201d The Franklin County records are not part of the applicable record here, see S.Ct.Prac.R. V(l), nor are they necessary to the court\u2019s review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the merits of this appeal. In addition, \u201c \u2018[a] reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995) , 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 162, 656 N.E.2d 1288, 1293, quoting <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus. Accordingly, we deny Brantley\u2019s motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\n<em>Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Brantley asserts in his two propositions of law that the court of appeals erred by denying the writ of habeas corpus. The court of appeals, however, properly denied the writ for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">First, as the court of appeals properly concluded, Brantley\u2019s claimed violation of his right to a speedy trial is not cognizable in habeas corpus. <em>State ex rel. Brantley v. Anderson </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 446, 674 N.E.2d 1380. Second, Brantley did not attach commitment papers pertinent to his claim challenging the APA\u2019s revocation of his parole. <em>Brown v. Rogers </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 339, 341, 650 N.E.2d 422, 423. Third, Brantley was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus on his sentence-reduction claim because he did not contend that he was thereby entitled to release from prison. <em>Swiger v. Seidner </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 685, 687, 660 N.E.2d 1214, 1216 (habeas corpus lies only if the petitioner is entitled to immediate release from custody). Finally, <em>res judicata </em>precluded Brantley\u2019s filing of successive habeas corpus petitions. See <em>State ex rel. Richard v. Seidner </em>(1996) , 77 Ohio St.3d 68, 671 N.E.2d 28; <em>Brantley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
