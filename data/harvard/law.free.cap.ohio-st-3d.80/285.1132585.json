Alford failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of R.C. 2969.25(C) in commencing his mandamus action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alford does not contend that R.C. 2969.25 is inapplicable to mandamus actions. <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 82, 85, 661 N.E.2d 728, 731, quoting R.C. 2731.09 (\u201cIssues of fact raised by the pleadings in mandamus actions \u2018must be tried, and further proceedings had, in the same manner as in civil actions.\u2019 \u201d); cf. <em>Martin v. United States </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 96 F.3d 853, 854 (question of whether mandamus action brought by federal prison inmate constitutes a \u201ccivil action\u201d for purposes of federal Prison Litigation Reform Act depends on the circumstances). The court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of Alford\u2019s complaint was further justified because habeas corpus, rather than mandamus, is the appropriate action for persons claiming entitlement to immediate release from prison. <em>State ex rel. Lemmon v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 186, 188, 677 N.E.2d 347, 349 (affirming dismissal of mandamus complaints filed by inmates).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
