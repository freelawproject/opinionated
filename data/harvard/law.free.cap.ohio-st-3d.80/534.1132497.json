Greene </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 13, 16, 655 N.E.2d 1299, 1301, we said, \u201cIt is true that the vigorous and effective representation of a client is the responsibility of all attorneys. This duty, however, does not exist in isolation from the other obligations imposed upon an attorney through our Disciplinary Rules. In addition to the commitment to a client, a lawyer\u2019s responsibilities include a devotion to the public good and to the maintenance and improvement of the administration of justice. * * * [T]he attorney\u2019s duty, as an officer of the court, is to uphold the legal process and demonstrate respect for the legal system by at all times being truthful with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>court and refraining from knowingly making statements of fact or law that are not true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Here, in each case, respondent not only made affirmative representations to the courts which were untrue, but by his silence he allowed each court to make unwarranted inferences. In the case before Judge Helmick, knowing that a continued case on a previously charged DUI would commence within a few minutes, respondent affirmatively stated that his client had not been in trouble since 1988. Also before Judge Helmick, respondent, by his silence, led the court to believe that the January DUI case had been dismissed and not refiled, when, in fact, trial was soon to continue on that January offense before Judge Black. In the case before Judge Black, respondent was asked, \u201cFirst in five[?]\u201d meaning \u201cIs this the first charge with no convictions during the previous five years?\u201d Knowing that Joyce had been convicted on a DUI charge only minutes earlier, respondent replied, \u201cFirst within five,\u201d thus affirmatively misleading the court. Also, when asked whether \u201cThis is charged as a first offense?\u201d respondent told the court, \u201cYes, this is a first offense.\u201d By his silence about the events that had just occurred, respondent misled the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Respondent contends that he did not misrepresent the facts to either Judge Helmick or Judge Black. He claims that in Judge Helmick\u2019s courtroom he correctly answered that Joyce had not had a DUI conviction in the past five years. Because he was not specifically asked the question, respondent did not believe that he was required to tell the judge that the January citation had been refiled and that a trial on that charge was actually in progress. Respondent claims that in Judge Black\u2019s courtroom, he was not asked about convictions within the preceding five years; rather, the judge asked whether the case was \u201ccharged as a first offense,\u201d and respondent replied in the affirmative, because it was, in fact, \u201ccharged\u201d as a first offense. Moreover, having occurred before the September offense, the January offense was, in fact, the first offense in five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Respondent also claims to have relied on advice he received at an American Bar Association seminar on criminal law that there is no duty for an advocate to disclose his client\u2019s record unless specifically asked. Respondent directs our attention to a discussion in ABA/BNA Lawyer\u2019s Manual on Professional Conduct 901:102 <em>et seq., </em>wherein various provisions of ABA Comm, on Professional Ethics and Grievances (1953), Formal Op. 287, are discussed. Most pertinent is the lawyer\u2019s duty prior to sentencing when the \u201cjudge asks the defendant\u2019s lawyer whether his client has a criminal record.\u201d The ABA\u2019s discussion states that \u201cFormal Opinion 287 concluded that * * * the lawyer is [not] permitted to disclose to the court the information he has concerning the client\u2019s actual criminal record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">We reject both defenses raised by respondent. First, DR 7-102(A)(5) specifically prohibits a lawyer from making a false statement of law or fact. In Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Helmick\u2019s court respondent made affirmatively false statements. Moreover, by his silence, respondent led both judges to a false appreciation of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Second, Formal Op. 287, relied upon by respondent, applies only to confidential information obtained from the client. As to the language in the Lawyer\u2019s Manual on Professional Conduct cited by respondent, the opinion states, \u201cIf the fact of the client\u2019s criminal record was learned by the lawyer <em>without communication, confidential or otherwise, from his client, </em>or on his behalf, Canon 37 would not be applicable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Formal Op. 287 concludes, \u201cThe indignation of the court * * * on learning that the lawyer had deliberately permitted him, where no privileged communication is involved, to rely on what the lawyer knew to be a misapprehension of the true facts, would be something that the lawyer could not appease on the basis of loyalty to the client. No client may demand or expect of his lawyer, in the furtherance of his cause, disloyalty to the law whose minister he is (Canon 32), or \u2018any manner of fraud or chicane\u2019 (Canon 15.)\u201d In this instance respondent\u2019s knowledge of the pending cases did not depend upon confidential communications from his client, and Formal Op. 287 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We require complete candor with courts. We agree with the Supreme Court of Nebraska, which sixty years ago said, \u201cAn attorney owes his first duty to the court. He assumed his obligations toward it before he ever had a client. His oath requires him to be absolutely honest even though his client\u2019s interests may seem to require a contrary course. The [lawyer] cannot serve two masters; and the one [he has] undertaken to serve primarily is the court.\u201d <em>In re Integration of Nebraska State Bar Assn. </em>(1937), 133 Neb. 283, 289, 275 N.W. 265, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We are particularly concerned that the instant matter arose on the criminal docket of one of our municipal courts which handles an extremely heavy caseload. Judges, especially those who must process heavy caseloads, must be able to rely on the representations of the attorneys who appear before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Section 6.12 of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Discipline provides, \u201cSuspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knows that false statements or documents are being submitted to the court or that material information is improperly being withheld, and takes no remedial action, and causes injury or potential injury to a party to the legal proceeding, or causes an adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal proceeding.\u201d Respondent was previously suspended for six months in <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Nienaber </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 459, 628 N.E.2d 1340. On these charges respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b681-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
