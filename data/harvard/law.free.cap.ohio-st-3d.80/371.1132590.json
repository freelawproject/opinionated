Based on our review, we find that Berry is competent to forgo all further reviews of his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The Public Defender argues that the Ohio Constitution gives us no jurisdiction to determine Berry\u2019s competence. Section 2(B)(1)(f), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, grants this court original jurisdiction \u201c[i]n any cause on review as may be necessary to its complete determination.\u201d However, the Public Defender argues that, because this court has decided Berry\u2019s direct appeal, Berry\u2019s case is not presently a \u201ccause on review\u201d before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\"><em>State v. Steffen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 639 N.E.2d 67, demonstrates that the term \u201ccause on review\u201d is not limited to cases currently pending on direct appeal. In <em>Steffen, </em>we issued an order prohibiting other Ohio courts from granting further stays of execution to ten condemned prisoners. Each of the ten had completed his direct appeal to this court and at least one motion for delayed reconsideration and/or reinstatement of his appeal. Nine had also completed one round of postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21. Not one had any litigation then pending before this court. See 70 Ohio St.3d at 399-405, 639 N.E.2d at 69-72. In <em>Steffen, </em>we specifically cited Section 2(B)(1)(f) to support our exercise of jurisdiction, even though the capital cases were not then before us on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 407-408, 639 N.E.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Similarly, we have regularly set execution dates and granted stays of execution well after issuing our mandate in capital appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Were the Public Defender correct, we could do neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">II. The Test of Competence: <em>Rees v. Peyton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In <em>Rees v. Peyton </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 312, 86 S.Ct. 1505,16 L.Ed.2d 583, one Rees (a condemned prisoner) filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court seeking review of a federal court judgment denying habeas corpus relief. Subsequently, Rees directed his counsel to withdraw the petition and forgo any further attacks on his conviction and sentence. Counsel had Rees examined by a psychiatrist, who concluded that Rees was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The Supreme Court, while retaining jurisdiction over the cause, directed the federal district court to determine Rees\u2019s mental competence, framing the question as follows: \u201c[W]hether he has c\u00e1pacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises.\u201d 384 U.S. at 314, 86 S.Ct. at 1506, 16 L.Ed.2d at 584-585.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The Public Defender contends that under <em>Rees, </em>if there exists even a possibility that Berry\u2019s mental disorder has affected his decisionmaking capacity in any way and to any degree, this court must find him incompetent. See <em>Rumbaugk v. Procunier </em>(C.A.5, 1985), 753 F.2d 395, 405 (Goldberg, J., dissenting). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">If a mere possibility were enough to render a defendant incompetent, there would have been no need in <em>Rees </em>for a competency determination by the federal district court. Rees had been \u201cexamined by a psychiatrist who filed a detailed report concluding that Rees was mentally incompetent.\u201d 384 U.S. at 313, 86 S.Ct. at 1506, 16 L.Ed.2d at 584. Thus, <em>before </em>the decision in <em>Rees, </em>there was already a strong possibility that Rees\u2019s decision was substantially affected by his mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">In <em>Smith v. Armontrout </em>(C.A.8, 1987), 812 F.2d 1050, the court expressly considered this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cnext-friend petitioners\u201d in that case, like the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Defender here, focused on the word \u201cmay\u201d in the second half of the <em>Rees </em>test. <em>\u201cRees, </em>they maintain, indicates through its use of the word \u2018may* that an inmate must be found incompetent where the evidence establishes even a mere <em>possibility </em>that a mental disorder substantially affected the decision.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The <em>Smith </em>court rejected that analysis:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201c[T]he petitioner\u2019s literal interpretation of the half of the <em>Rees </em>test which asks whether the prisoner suffers from \u2018a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity,\u2019 would conflict with a similarly literal interpretation of the other half of the test, which asks whether the prisoner has, rather than absolutely, certainly, or undoubtedly has, the capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice. Though <em>Rees </em>recites these two portions of the standard as disjunctive alternatives, there is necessarily an area of overlap between the category of cases in which at the threshold we see a possibility that a decision is substantially affected by a mental disorder, disease, or defect, and that of cases in which, after proceeding further, we conclude that the decision is in fact the product of a rational thought process.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u201cFurthermore, we think it very probable * * * that in every case where a death-row inmate elects to abandon further legal proceedings, there will be a possibility that the decision is the product of a mental disease, disorder, or defect. Yet, <em>Rees </em>clearly contemplates that competent waivers are possible * * * and there is little point in conducting a competency inquiry if a finding of incompetency is virtually a foregone conclusion.\u201d 812 F.2d at 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">We agree with the <em>Smith </em>court\u2019s analysis and therefore reject the notion that the bare possibility of a mental disorder\u2019s substantially affecting the condemned\u2019s decisionmaking capacity is enough to require a finding of incompetence. Ultimately, the question is not whether a defendant \u201cmay\u201d lack the capacity to make a rational choice, but whether he in fact has that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">As for the standard we enunciated earlier in this case, it is wholly consistent with <em>Rees, </em>and in fact reflects a more specific definition of the general terms used in <em>Rees. </em>Thus, in our view, a defendant \u201chas capacity to appreciate his position,\u201d <em>Rees, supra, </em>if he understands the choice between life and death, see <em>Franz v. State </em>(1988), 296 Ark. 181, 189, 754 S.W.2d 839, 843; <em>State v. Dodd </em>(1992), 120 Wash.2d 1, 23, 838 P.2d 86, 97, and he fully comprehends the ramifications of his decision to waive further legal proceedings, see <em>Cole v. State </em>(1985), 101 Nev. 585, 588, 707 P.2d 545, 547. And a defendant has the capacity to \u201cmake a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation,\u201d <em>Rees, supra, </em>if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>he can make a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent decision, <em>Franz, supra, </em>at 189-190, 754 S.W.2d at 844; <em>Dodd, supra, </em>at 23, 838 P.2d at 97; and he has the \u201cability to reason logically,\u201d <em>ie., </em>to choose \u201cmeans which relate logically to his ends,\u201d see <em>State v. Bailey </em>(Del.Super.1986), 519 A.2d 132, 137-138.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 149, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135, when a condemned prisoner refused to pursue an appeal to the state supreme court, the issue was whether a \u201cnext Mend\u201d could seek a writ of certiorari on his behalf from the United States Supreme Court. <em>Whitmore </em>held that the would-be \u201cnext Mend\u201d could not establish standing unless he could at least show that the prisoner \u201cis unable to litigate his own cause due to mental incapacity * * * or other similar disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 110 S.Ct. at 1728, 109 L.Ed.2d at 151. <em>Whitmore </em>further held that a \u201cnext Mend\u201d may not proceed on a prisoner\u2019s behalf \u201cwhere an evidentiary hearing shows that the defendant has given a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed, and his access to court is otherwise unimpeded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In <em>Whitmore, </em>the Arkansas trial court had held an evidentiary hearing and found the defendant to have the capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to knowingly and intelligently waive any and all rights to appeal his sentence. See <em>Simmons v. State </em>(1989), 298 Ark. 193, 194, 766 S.W.2d 422, 423. That being so, the would-be \u201cnext friend\u201d could not make the required showing of incapacity, and thus could not establish standing to litigate the prisoner\u2019s case against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">It appears, then, that the standard used to determine competence in Arkansas \u2014 capacity to understand the choice and to make a knowing and intelligent waiver \u2014 has been accepted by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>Dodd, </em>120 Wash.2d at 22-23, 838 P.2d at 97, citing <em>Whitmore, </em>495 U.S. at 165, 110 S.Ct. at 1728, 109 L.Ed.2d at 151-152; <em>Grasso v. State </em>(Okla.Crim.App.1993), 857 P.2d 802, 806. Cf. <em>Gilmore v. Utah </em>(1976), 429 U.S. 1012, 1013, 97 S.Ct. 436, 437, 50 L.Ed.2d 632, 633.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">III. Berry\u2019s Mental Evaluations</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Dr. Sharon L. Pearson conducted the most extensive interviews. She saw Berry three times during July and August 1995, not long after this court affirmed his convictions and sentence. Dr. Pearson spent 4.5 hours administering psychological tests, including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>also interviewed Berry for a total of 7.5 additional hours. Finally, Dr. Pearson reviewed an impressive amount of background material on Berry\u2019s mental health history.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Dr. Pearson found in Berry symptoms of a \u201cschizotypal personality disorder,\u201d a \u201crigid thought process,\u201d a tendency toward \u201cextreme isolation and withdrawal,\u201d and a tendency to have psychotic episodes under stress. She concluded that Berry was not competent to waive his rights. Her conclusion was reached with reference to what she called a \u201cclinical\u201d definition of \u201ccompetence,\u201d not a legal . one.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Dr. Philip J. Resnick interviewed Berry for 2.75 hours and reviewed extensive materials on his mental health history, as well as Dr. Pearson\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Dr. Robert W. Alcorn interviewed Berry for 1.5 hours. He did not review any materials on Berry\u2019s mental health history, but he did discuss Berry\u2019s history with Berry himself, and he also reviewed the reports of Drs. Pearson and Resnick; those reports related Berry\u2019s history to such an extent that Alcorn did not find it necessary to review the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Drs. Resnick and Alcorn diagnosed a mixed personality disorder with schizotypal, borderline, and antisocial features. Dr. Alcorn explained that a \u201cmixed personality disorder\u201d means that a patient exhibits features of more than one type of disorder, but is \u201cnot clearly in one category or another.\u201d Both psychiatrists concluded that Berry was competent to decide against pursuing further remedies, measured by the legal standard established by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">None of the three experts found Berry to be psychotic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Resnick testified that \u201cpsychosis is a major mental disorder in which a person is out of touch with reality * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">While imprisoned in Texas in the 1980s, Berry reported hallucinations, was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and was placed on antipsychotic medication. However, when he stopped taking the medicine, his hallucinations did not recur, leading Dr. Resnick to question the accuracy of the Texas diagnosis. In 1990, Dr. Robert W. Goldberg diagnosed Berry with \u201cpsychotic disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d The 1990 diagnosis was made in connection with Berry\u2019s then-upcoming aggravated murder trial, in which Dr. Goldberg was a defense witness. Dr. Resnick testified that Berry may have been malingering in 1990, but Resnick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>could give no opinion on that point. Drs. Alcorn and Pearson testified that Berry may have brief psychotic reactions under stress. However, Dr. Resnick pointed out that the consistency of Berry\u2019s desire to drop his appeals and be executed indicates that this desire is not the result of any transitory mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Berry believed that when he died, he would be judged by God and go to heaven or hell. The psychiatric profession does not regard this sort of commonly held religious belief as a sign of mental illness, according to Dr. Alcorn. Berry had no unusual or delusional beliefs about the afterlife. He has considered donating his organs. Both Dr. Resnick and Dr. Alcorn concluded that he understood the difference between life and death and the permanence of death. (Dr. Pearson was not asked her opinion on this point.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Berry told all three doctors that he would prefer freedom to death if he thought it a reasonable possibility. Dr. Pearson did not believe that he was being deceptive about that, even though she also believed Berry had a compulsive desire to be dead. Given the evidence, it seems clear that Berry understands the difference between life and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Public Defender\u2019s chief contention at the evidentiary hearing was that, due to his mental disorder, Berry does not <em>jfully </em>comprehend the ramifications of his decision. Although he clearly understands that abandoning his legal remedies will lead to his death, he does not understand that pursuing them may mean freedom, which he says he prefers to death. This lack of understanding, according to Dr. Pearson, results from the rigid thinking caused by his mental disorder. Having formed the fixed notion that he has little chance of freedom, he refuses to listen to his attorneys when they try to tell him otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Berry\u2019s \u201crigid thought process\u201d was crucial to Dr. Pearson\u2019s conclusion that Berry was incompetent. According to Dr. Pearson, rigid thinking is a result, and a symptom, of Berry\u2019s schizotypal disorder. Pearson believed that Berry\u2019s rigidity rendered him psychologically unable to absorb information from his attorneys if it conflicted with his preconceptions as to his chance of succeeding in further litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Pearson testified that Randy Ashbum of the Public Defender\u2019s Office, one of Berry\u2019s attorneys, told her Berry had a fairly good chance of success. She testified that she relayed that information to Berry, and she found him \u201cvery closed to that [idea] and very committed to the way he thought, which was he did not have any chance of prevailing.\u201d Berry\u2019s attorneys told Pearson that they had tried to convey the same information to Berry.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Dr. Pearson believed that Berry was \u201cunable to take in\u201d that information. However, her conclusion is undermined by her concession that Berry understands that the public defenders think his litigation can be successful. Furthermore, Dr. Pearson conceded that it is \u201cpossible\u201d that the rejection of his appeals by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>court and the court of appeals may have contributed to Berry\u2019s attitude, and when asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t he taking in information?\u201d she replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Moreover, Berry\u2019s unwillingness to receive this information from Dr. Pearson does not necessarily support her belief that he was unable to absorb information that conflicted with his preconceptions. There was no evidence that Dr. Pearson was giving Berry any new information; she was merely passing along the opinion of Berry\u2019s attorneys, of which Berry was already aware and which he had already rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Moreover, Berry has <em>not </em>rejected the possibility of having his conviction overturned. Berry told Dr. Resnick that he knows he is guilty of the Mitroff murder, and that <em>\u201ceven if he had a second trial, he would be found guilty again, </em>sentenced to death again and ultimately executed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) He told Dr. Alcorn that \u201cthe confession of Lozar [Berry\u2019s co-defendant] would lead to his own conviction and inevitable execution for the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Thus, Berry does not want his conviction overturned, as he believes that will lead to a result he finds undesirable, as he told Dr. Resnick, \u201cto wait around on death row for 20 years\u201d only to be executed anyway. Drs. Resnick and Alcorn stated that this was a rational choice. According to Dr. Resnick, it is common for condemned inmates to at least \u201cweigh whether they would prefer to be executed\u201d because of the \u201cmisery\u201d associated with life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Pearson said that people with schizotypal disorder \u201clatch onto one issue\u201d which becomes \u201cthe focus of the obsessive thinking and the compulsive behavior.\u201d Yet she then said that Berry\u2019s desire to waive further review of his case was his \u201cmost significant issue\u201d \u2014 implying that there might be others.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">When asked on what other issues Berry had shown rigidity, Dr. Pearson said, \u201cI have no way of knowing.\u201d Despite that, she offered other examples of Berry\u2019s rigidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Many of her examples were unpersuasive. For instance, Dr. Pearson testified that \u201cthere was some report of him writing threatening notes to a woman. * * * It may represent a rigid perception that was inaccurate that he would be acting on.\u201d However, Dr. Pearson conceded on cross-examination that she did not know whether Berry had rejected any information or advice from anyone with regard to that situation so that his perception could fairly be called \u201crigid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">According to Dr. Pearson, Berry was \u201cadamant\u201d in his belief that a lung condition he had suffered from would come back and kill him, even though it had been surgically corrected. Berry told Dr. Pearson that his surgeon had told him that \u201che was a corpse looking for a place to die.\u201d Dr. Pearson testified that she consulted \u201cmedical people\u201d and medical literature and found that \u201conce corrected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>[the condition] was pretty much corrected.\u201d She told Berry this at a later interview, but he \u201cdid not * * * take it in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">However, Dr. Pearson is not a medical doctor. Berry\u2019s refusal to consider her opinion on a medical subject, as against the opinion of his surgeon,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> does not seem to be persuasive evidence of a disabling degree of rigidity. In any case, he told Drs. Resnick and Alcorn he was not worried about his lung; while he did believe his lung condition might kill him, he seemed more worried about living a long time on death row.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Dr. Pearson said Berry was rigid in his belief that \u201cpeople can\u2019t be trusted\u201d; yet she conceded that he did trust Cynthia Yost, one of his attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Dr. Pearson said Berry is rigid in his lifelong, compulsive desire to be dead. But Berry told Dr. Pearson he would rather be free than dead, and Dr. Pearson conceded that Berry was not lying or being deceptive about this. Moreover, although Berry has a history of suicide attempts, it has been nine years since Berry\u2019s last such attempt, and he told Dr. Resnick he thought suicide was \u201cstupid.\u201d And Dr. Pearson agreed with Drs. Resnick and Alcorn that Berry does not suffer from clinical depression, although he has so suffered in the past. (Dr. Resnick noted that the consistency of Berry\u2019s desire for execution indicates that his desire is not attributable to changes in his mood.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\u201cDefensiveness\u201d or \u201cminimization\u201d occurs when a patient tries to conceal symptoms and appear healthier than he is. All three experts detected defensiveness on Berry\u2019s part. For instance, in the Alcorn and Pearson interviews, Berry initially denied ever having had hallucinations. However, he ultimately admitted to all three doctors that he <em>had </em>suffered hallucinations in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Dr. Pearson testified that, particularly when defensiveness is suspected, it is important to spend enough time with the patient to \u201cwear the person down,\u201d because \u201c[a]nybody can keep themselves <em>[sic </em>] together for a couple of hours.\u201d However, according to Dr. Resnick, prolonging the interview is not helpful in detecting defensiveness. In fact, as noted, all three experts were able to detect Berry\u2019s defensiveness and evaluate his mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Dr. Pearson administered an IQ test. Berry\u2019s IQ was one hundred, placing him \u201cin the average level of intellectual functioning,\u201d according to Dr. Pearson\u2019s report. Dr. Pearson testified that \u201cWilford is very bright and Wilford has a lot of intellectual ability.\u201d She also conceded that Berry was engaging in logical thought processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Dr. Resnick described Berry as \u201carticulate\u201d; \u201chis speech showed clear, logical thinking and no confusion or disorganization of thoughts.\u201d He showed \u201cadequate concentration, attention and memory\u201d and exhibited \u201cfair\u201d judgment. He further demonstrated reasoning ability by explaining to Dr. Resnick why he preferred electrocution to lethal injection and giving a specific, rational reason for his preference. Dr. Alcorn noted that Berry did well on tests measuring concentration. None of the three experts found any evidence of organic brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">All three experts were in agreement on many issues: that Berry has a disorder, but not a psychosis; that he is defensive; that he would prefer freedom to death; that he is logical and moderately intelligent. To the extent that they differed, we find the conclusions of Dr. Resnick and Dr. Alcorn more credible than those of Dr. Pearson.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Dr. Resnick, the Director of the Cuyahoga County Court Psychiatric Clinic since 1976, is an eminent authority in the field of forensic psychiatry. He is a professor of psychiatry at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. He is also a lecturer in law and psychiatry at the Case Western Reserve University Law School and has held \u201cdistinguished visiting professorships\u201d at four other institutions. He serves as Director of the Fellowship in Forensic Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Forensic Psychiatry at the University Hospitals of Cleveland.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Dr. Resnick is a past president of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, chairman of the Ohio Psychiatric Association Forensic Committee, vice-president of the Cleveland Psychiatric Society, a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, and a member of the Council on Accreditation for Fellowships in Forensic Psychiatry. He is certified by the American Board of Psychiatry.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Dr. Resnick has given numerous lectures on such subjects as the detection of malingering, the insanity defense, and the psychiatric prediction of violence. His <em>curriculum vitae </em>reflects fourteen major international presentations and ninety-five major American presentations. He has written or co-authored one book, twenty-five book chapters and contributions, and fifty articles in professional journals. He has testified before the Judiciary Committees of the Ohio House of Representatives and Senate and the National Commission on the Insanity Defense. Finally, he has testified numerous times in criminal cases, in Ohio and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Dr. Alcorn is also highly experienced in forensic psychiatry. After completing his residency in 1974, Dr. Alcorn worked for the Cuyahoga County Court Psychiatric Clinic between 1979 and 1995. He is Medical Director of Mental Health Services, Inc., and assistant clinical professor in the psychiatry department of the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. He has received specialized education in criminal law and \u201cpsychiatry and the law,\u201d and he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>certified by both the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and the American Board of Forensic Psychiatry. His <em>curriculum vitae </em>indicates extensive teaching experience and lists eight scientific presentations on subjects including malingering in criminal cases, the insanity defense, and depression. He has testified numerous times on competency and sanity issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">While Dr. Pearson is certainly qualified, her experience in forensic matters is limited. Dr. Pearson has been a self-employed clinical psychologist since 1988. About twenty-five percent of her practice consists of forensic examination, and she has testified in approximately twenty cases, about a third of which were criminal. Dr. Pearson is also a clinical assistant professor at the Wright State University School of Professional Psychology. Her <em>curriculum vitas </em>lists several workshops and presentations, although none seems to have specifically dealt with forensic psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In our view, Dr. Pearson\u2019s crucial testimony on the subject of \u201crigidity\u201d was unpersuasive. Moreover, we note Dr. Pearson\u2019s failure to make any reference to Berry\u2019s rigidity of thought in her written report, given her testimony that Berry\u2019s rigidity was \u201cthe primary factor in my decision that he was not able to waive his rights * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We note that Dr. Pearson was brought into the case by the Public Defender; the other two experts were court-appointed. Dr. Pearson did not apply any legal standard of competence. Instead, she used the following \u201cclinical\u201d definition of \u201ccompetence\u201d: \u201cIf someone has the capacity, ability to do something. If someone is competent that means they are functional, they are capable, able.\u201d This definition is logically circular, and therefore analytically useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Dr. Pearson did spend over twice as much time with Berry as Drs. Resnick and Alcorn combined. But Dr. Resnick testified that one need not spend a great deal of time with a patient to detect defensiveness \u2014 and both he and Dr. Alcorn <em>did </em>detect it in Berry and take it into account. Moreover, Drs. Resnick and Alcorn had the benefit of reading Dr. Pearson\u2019s report before making their own evaluations. It is difficult to conclude that Drs. Resnick and Alcorn failed to spend an adequate amount of time with Berry, especially since their conclusions were, in many pertinent respects, the same as Dr. Pearson\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">IV. Application of the <em>Rees </em>Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">We find that Berry possesses the mental capacity to appreciate his position and to make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation. While Berry does have a mental disorder, it does not substantially affect his capacity in this respect. <em>Rees v. Peyton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Berry is unquestionably a moderately intelligent man with demonstrated reasoning ability. He suffers from a mental disorder, but is in touch with reality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>and his mental disorder is not of such a nature as to preclude him from considering his options and making a voluntary, rational choice between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Specifically, we find that Berry\u2019s rejection of his counsel\u2019s advice is not attributable to his mental disorder. Berry is not using his death sentence to fulfill a death wish produced by his disorder, as the Public Defender argues. Instead, he prefers freedom to death, but prefers a speedy execution to incarceration on death row during a protracted legal struggle. Moreover, he believes that, even if his lawyers succeed in having his conviction overturned, he will simply be retried and resentenced to death. We find that this belief of Berry\u2019s, whether well founded or not, is not the product of his mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We find that Berry understands the difference between life and death and fully comprehends the ramifications of his decision to forgo further legal proceedings. We find that he has the ability to choose means that relate logically to his ends. We find that he is capable of making a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent decision to forgo further legal proceedings, and that his decision to do so is in fact voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Pursuant to the standard enunciated in <em>Rees v. Peyton, supra, </em>we find Berry competent to decide for himself whether to pursue or forgo further legal challenges to his conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">V. Claim of Judicial Bias</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The Public Defender claims that the- trial judge who conducted the evidentiary hearing was predisposed to find Berry competent. The portions of the record cited by the Public Defender do not, in our view, support this accusation. We reject this claim and find that the trial judge conducted a full and fair evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">VI. Exclusion of Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">The Public Defender further contends that the trial judge erred in excluding the testimony of attorney Alan Freedman regarding Berry\u2019s chances to succeed in federal habeas corpus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot agree. The actual strength of Berry\u2019s possible federal claim is not at issue. The question is whether Berry has the capacity to decide for himself whether to pursue those claims. It is relevant to that determination whether Berry is able to listen to and consider his attorneys\u2019 opinion, but whether their opinion is right, wrong, or arguable is not relevant at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>all. A competent person may choose to forgo even the strongest legal claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State v. Torrence </em>(1994), 317 S.C. 45, 47, 451 S.E.2d 883, 884, fn. 2: \u201cThe test is not * * * whether the defendant in fact cooperates with counsel, but whether he has sufficient mental capacity to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">VII. Claim that Postconviction Review Is Mandatory</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Finally, the Public Defender argues that Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution requires collateral review of <em>all </em>capital cases, irrespective of the defendant\u2019s wishes and whether he is mentally competent or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The clause cited states: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required; nor excessive fines imposed; <em>nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We think it extraordinary to contend that this clause, part of Ohio\u2019s basic law since 1802,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> mandates the use of a form of action that did not exist until the General Assembly created it one hundred and sixty-three years later. Even if the clause does give rise to procedural rights, there is surely nothing in the plain English of the clause that forbids a mentally competent person to waive those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The Public Defender\u2019s reading of the clause reflects a radical paternalism outside the mainstream of American law and inconsistent with the human dignity of a competent adult. A competent criminal defendant may plead guilty to a charge even though he believes himself to be innocent. <em>North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162. He may testify on his own behalf, or refuse to do so, against the advice of counsel. <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 3312, 77 L.Ed.2d 987, 993. He may choose to do without counsel altogether, and represent himself. <em>Faretta v. California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>(1975), 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562. He may decide not to present any mitigating factors on his behalf in the penalty phase of a capital case. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 27-29, 553 N.E.2d 576, 583-586; <em>People v. Lang </em>(1989), 49 Cal.3d 991, 1029-1031, 264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 411-412, 782 P.2d 627, 652-653; <em>People v. Silagy </em>(1984), 101 Ill.2d 147, 175-181, 77 Ill.Dec. 792, 806-809, 461 N.E.2d 415, 429-432. However wise or foolish his decisions, they are his.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Our law generally refuses \u201cto imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\u201d <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann </em>(1942), 317 U.S. 269, 280, 63 S.Ct. 236, 242, 87 L.Ed. 268, 275. Therefore, absent a clear textual warrant for doing so \u2014 and we have none here \u2014 we cannot insert such a philosophy into the Ohio Constitution. \u201cThe same value that guarantees a defendant a right to present mitigating evidence \u2014 \u2018the right of the defendant to be treated with dignity as a human being\u2019 * * * \u2014 also gives him the right to decide what is in his own best interest.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler, supra, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 29, 553 N.E.2d at 585, quoting Bonnie, The Dignity of the Condemned (1988), 74 Va.L.Rev. 1363, 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Nothing in the Ohio Constitution requires us to make Berry \u201ca pawn to be manipulated on a chessboard larger than his own case.\u201d <em>Lenhard v. Wolff </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 1306, 1312, 100 S.Ct. 3, 7, 61 L.Ed.2d 885, 890 (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice) (continuing stay of execution). Since he is mentally competent to decide for himself, \u201c[t]o deny him that would be to incarcerate his spirit \u2014 the one thing that remains free and which the state need not and should not imprison.\u201d <em>Lenhard v. Wolff </em>(C.A.9, 1979), 603 F.2d 91, 94 (Sneed, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">VIII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">We conclude, based on the hearing record, that Berry is competent, in that he has the capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation. <em>Rees, supra. </em>Furthermore, we hold that the Ohio Constitution does not compel us to force postconviction review upon a competent individual who has decided, for reasons of his own, not to seek it.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">We therefore order that the sentence of death heretofore imposed on Wilford Lee Berry, Jr., be carried into execution on March 3, 1998. An execution warrant will issue immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b529-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">. See, <em>e.g., State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 656 N.E.2d 643, reconsideration denied (1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1485, 657 N.E.2d 1378, stay granted (1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 1503, 659 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 643 N.E.2d 524, reconsideration denied (1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 1459, 644 N.E.2d 1031, stay granted (1995), 71 Ohio St.3d 1488, 646 N.E.2d 464, stay terminated (1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 1502, 659 N.E.2d 794, stay granted (1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 1515, 660 N.E.2d 470.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-11\">. The Public Defender cites <em>In re Heidnik </em>(C.A.3,1997), 112 F.3d 105, in support of his position, but <em>Heidnik </em>simply recites the <em>Rees </em>standard, without expressly considering whether a defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>be deemed incompetent upon a mere <em>possibility </em>that a mental disorder substantially affects his capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\">. The Public Defender questions the value of <em>Whitmore </em>and <em>Gilmore, </em>asserting that those cases turned on the issue of a next friend\u2019s standing to press a condemned prisoner\u2019s claims in federal court. But the standing issue itself turns on the question of competence, and the Public Defender does not explain why the constitutional standard of competence used in state court should differ from that used in federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\">. The Public Defender\u2019s assertion that \u201cDr. Pearson * * * evaluated Berry under the <em>Rees v. Peyton </em>standard\u201d is incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-13\">. The Public Defender asserts that Drs. Resnick and Alcorn based their findings of competence wholly upon the absence of an active psychosis. They did not, however; indeed, Dr. Resnick testified that the absence of psychosis \u201cisn\u2019t the only issue in determining whether or not he is competent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\">. Dr. Pearson seemed to doubt Berry\u2019s account of what his surgeon had told him, but there was no evidence one way or the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b527-13\">. According to Freedman\u2019s proffered testimony, Berry\u2019s confession, and perhaps other evidence as well, should have been suppressed on the ground that he was detained longer than forty-eight hours after his arrest without being brought before a judicial officer for a probable-cause determination. See <em>County of Riverside v. McLaughlin </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 44, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">. Even if the strength of Berry\u2019s <em>McLaughlin </em>claim were relevant, we would place little credence in Freedman\u2019s opinion. First, it is far from clear that the exclusionary rule will be applied to freestanding <em>McLaughlin </em>claims. See <em>Powell v. Nevada </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 79, 85, 114 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 128 L.Ed.2d 1, 8, fn.* (expressly reserving question); 3 LaFave, Search and Seizure (3 Ed.1996) 48, Section 5.1(f). Moreover, although <em>McLaughlin </em>is retroactive, see <em>Powell, swpra, </em>the application of the exclusionary rule to <em>McLaughlin </em>claims \u201cremain[ed] an unresolved question,\u201d 511 U.S. at 85, 114 S.Ct. at 1284, 128 L.Ed.2d at 8, fn. *, when Berry\u2019s conviction became final in 1995; therefore, the exclusionary rule may not be retroactively applicable to <em>McLaughlin </em>claims in habeas corpus. See, generally, <em>Teague v. Lane </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Finally, the court of appeals expressly held that Berry had waived his <em>McLaughlin </em>claim by failing to raise it in the trial court. See <em>State v. Berry </em>(Oct. 21, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 60531, unreported, at 27, 1993 WL 425370. We subsequently rejected the claim without specific explanation. 72 Ohio St.3d at 358, 650 N.E.2d at 438. A federal court would \u201clook through\u201d our unexplained decision to the last explained state-court decision. <em>Ylst v. Nunnemaker </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 797, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706. Here, the last explained state-court decision explicitly found a procedural default; such a finding generally precludes federal habeas review of a claim. See, <em>e.g\u201e Engle v. Isaac </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 107, 129, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1572, 71 L.Ed.2d 783, 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">.
