Two of the three panel members and the board disagreed, concluding that the proper sanction under the circumstances was permanent disbarment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accept the findings of the board and agree that respondent failed miserably in his responsibilities to his clients. However, we do not agree with the board\u2019s recommendation that respondent be permanently disbarred from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Rea </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 71, 676 N.E.2d 514, when an attorney neglected numerous legal matters entrusted to her, improperly retained retainers which she did not earn or return, and lied to various clients, we ordered an indefinite suspension. We also ordered an indefinite suspension in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Snyder </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 57, 676 N.E.2d 504, where, among other things, the attorney neglected several legal matters entrusted to him, failed to pay or deliver funds owing to clients, failed to deliver files to which a client was entitled, and failed to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation. See, also, <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Palmer </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 174, 642 N.E.2d 1087 (indefinite suspension for lying to several clients and neglecting their interests), and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Chavers </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 18, 562 N.E.2d 1386 (indefinite suspension for accepting numerous retainers and not performing work requested, failing to return unearned fees, and failing to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation). Respondent\u2019s misconduct in this case is substantially similar to what occurred in <em>Snyder, Palmer, </em>and <em>Chavers. </em>Also, compare, <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Trumbo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 369, 667 N.E.2d 1186 (indefinite suspension for attorney\u2019s neglecting several legal matters entrusted to her, continually lying to her clients, lying to the court, and lying to Disciplinary Counsel in the attempt to investigate her actions). Clearly, respondent\u2019s actions, while outrageous and inexcusable, are not any more egregious than what occurred in <em>Snyder, Palmer, Chavers, </em>and <em>Trumbo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Further, when imposing a sanction, we will consider not only the duty violated, but the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the actual injury caused, and whether mitigating factors exist. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Boychuk </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 93, 97, 679 N.E.2d 1081, 1084. In this case, we note respondent\u2019s personal problems that existed at the time of the violations and the fact that he has taken steps to resolve his problems. Respondent is currently receiving treatment for his depression and he has agreed to provide restitution to aggrieved clients. We also note that respondent has shown genuine remorse for the problems that he has caused his clients and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Accordingly, we believe that the appropriate sanction under the circumstances for respondent\u2019s failure to fulfill his responsibilities as a lawyer is an indefinite suspension. Pursuant to the penalty of indefinite suspension, respondent is, of course, precluded from filing a petition for reinstatement until a period of at least two years has expired subsequent to the entry of our order suspending him from the practice of law. See Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B). Moreover, respondent\u2019s reinstatement, if ever, will be subject to the conditions of Gov.Bar R. V(10)(B) <em>et seq. </em>Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-7\">Resnick, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, <em>JJ., </em>concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b345-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.
