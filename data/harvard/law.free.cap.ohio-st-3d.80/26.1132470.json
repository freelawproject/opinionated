We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The appellants would have the BTA determine true value only by taking the prior year\u2019s value and then making adjustments to that value based on changes in the income. Appellants\u2019 argument, although not stated as such, is that the prior year\u2019s valuation should be deemed to be correct, and changes in the prior year\u2019s valuation should be made only in response to changes which have occurred since the date of the last valuation. The appellants do not cite any statutory authority or decisions of this court to support their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We see a number of problems with appellants\u2019 proposal. First, the valuation for the prior year, which appellants would deem to be correct and which would serve as the base from which the change would be measured, may not be correct. Second, a hearing on valuation would change from a determination of true value at a given point in time to a determination of the amount of change since the last assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Finally, and most important, the burden of proof before the BOR in a case like this would shift from the property owner to the county auditor. This shift would occur when the value determined by the auditor was different from the value of the prior year\u2019s assessment. Thus, when a taxpayer files a complaint, it would be the auditor, not the taxpayer, who would have to defend the change, because the prior assessment would be deemed to be correct. However, the procedure before a board of revision operates differently \u2014 the burden of proof before a board of revision is not on the auditor, it is on the party seeking to change or affirm the auditor\u2019s assessment. <em>B.F. Keith Columbus Co. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 253, 269, 35 O.O. 244, 251, 74 N.E.2d 359, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Although we have not previously answered the exact argument posed, we considered a similar question in <em>Std. Oil Co. v. Zangerle </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 505, 26 O.O. 82, 49 N.E.2d 406. That question was whether a classification of property as real or personal, made for a prior tax year, was <em>res judicata </em>for a subsequent year. In holding that the classification was not <em>res judicata, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>analyzed the appeal statutes and concluded that the prior decision and classification \u201cremained final and conclusive for the current year only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 26 O.O. at 86, 49 N.E.2d at 411. See, also, <em>Swetland Co. v. Evatt </em>(1941), 139 Ohio St. 6, 19, 21 O.O. 511, 516, 37 N.E.2d 601, 607, wherein we stated, \u201cA correction by either the \u2022 county board of revision or the Board of Tax Appeals merely substitutes for the then current year complained of a valuation which is binding only for the year in question.\u201d In <em>Fiddler v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 34, 23 O.O. 232, 42 N.E.2d 151, the taxing authorities claimed that they had been reducing the appraisal for the land in question as values in the area declined. In response to that argument we stated, \u201cThe question, however, is not how much of a lowering in tax valuation has been made but, rather, what is the true value in money of the property for the year of the assessment.\u201d 140 Ohio St. at 37, 23 O.O. at 233, 42 N.E.2d at 152. See, also, <em>Zindle v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 202, 203-204, 542 N.E.2d 650, 651. When the BTA makes a determination of true value for a given year, such determination is to be based on the evidence presented to it in that case, uncontrolled by the value assessed for prior years.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Appellants also claim that the BTA erred in rejecting the valuation of their appraiser, William Becker. The BTA did so because his appraisals were not made as of the tax lien date. We disagree with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Becker submitted two written appraisals to the BTA, neither of which pertained to the tax lien date, January 1,1994. To arrive at a value as of the tax lien date, Becker states that he split the difference between the December 30, 1991 and April 5, 1996 appraisal values, added one half of the difference to his 1991 appraisal value, and rounded off the total.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The BTA rejected Becker\u2019s procedure and refused to assign any weight to his opinion of true value. The BTA stated that \u201c[t]he mere fact that the tax lien date is approximately midway between the two appraisal dates does not mean that the 1994 value must also be midway between the two appraisals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">In rejecting Becker\u2019s opinion of true value, the BTA cited a passage from The Appraisal of Real Estate (10 Ed.1992) 75, which states that because market forces are constantly changing, \u201can estimate of value is considered valid only for the exact date specified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">R.C. 5715.19(D) requires that the determination of a complaint filed for a particular tax year \u201cshall relate back to the date when the lien for taxes * * * for the current year attached.\u201d R.C. 323.11 provides that the lien for real estate taxes is the first day of January. Likewise, R.C. 5715.01, which authorizes the Tax Commissioner to direct and supervise the assessment for taxation of all real property, provides that \u201c[t]he commissioner shall neither adopt nor enforce any rule that requires true value for any tax year to be any value other than the true value in money on the tax lien date of such tax year * * Thus, the first day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>January of the tax year in question is the crucial valuation date for tax assessment purposes. <em>Olmsted Falls Village Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 552, 664 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The essence of an assessment is that it fixes the value based upon facts as they exist at a certain point in time. Becker\u2019s approach to valuation was not based upon the facts as they existed as of January 1, 1994, the tax lien date. Becker\u2019s appraisals were based upon facts as they existed on December 30, 1991 and April 5, 1996, the dates of his appraisals. Evidence of the valuation as of these two dates is not evidence of the valuation as of January 1, 1994. The real estate market may rise, fall, or stay constant between any two dates, and the assumption that a change in valuation between two given dates is constant and uniform, without proof, may properly be rejected by the finder of fact. The BTA may accept all, part, or none of the testimony presented to it by an expert. <em>Witt Co. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 155, 573 N.E.2d 661. In this case, the BTA chose not to accept Becker\u2019s valuation, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Appellants also argue that the BTA erred in accepting the testimony of appellees\u2019 appraiser concerning commercial lending rates. Appellants claim he did not introduce written confirmation of the rates. Appellees\u2019 appraiser testified that he talked with three different bankers, whom he named, concerning their interest rates as of January 1, 1994. In addition, the appellees\u2019 appraiser consulted a national mortgage commitment survey to check the figures he obtained from the local lenders. Appellants now claim the BTA erred in accepting the capitalization rate calculated by using these interest rates. We disagree with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">First, it should be pointed out that the BTA did not rely on the interest rates cited by the appellees\u2019 appraiser. The BTA relied on the opinion of value expressed by appellees\u2019 appraiser. The interest rates cited by appellees\u2019 appraiser were presented only to show the basis for the appraiser\u2019s opinion. An expert\u2019s opinion of value in a tax valuation case is of little help to the trier of fact if the expert does not explain the basis for the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">If appellants believed the interest rates used by appellees\u2019 appraiser were erroneous, then they should have developed the errors through cross-examination. However, the appellants did not object to the appellees\u2019 appraiser\u2019s testimony on interest rates, and their cross-examination on the subject merely asked whether the appraiser had any reports from the bankers. The source of the background material that the appraiser uses in arriving at his opinion of value is one of the factors that the BTA weighs in determining the credibility of an appraiser\u2019s opinion of true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Appellants\u2019 next argument is that the BTA erred in accepting the higher gross income amount used by appellees\u2019 appraiser to the extent that it included a rental amount for a unit that is being used as a lounge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>During his testimony, appellees\u2019 appraiser stated that his valuation was based upon fifty-one units, rather than the fifty units used by appellants\u2019 appraiser. The difference is due to a one-bedroom unit that has had a wall removed so it can be used a lounge. Residents can reserve the lounge for parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The BTA accepted appellees\u2019 appraisal with only a minor deduction for excess-land valuation. When the BTA accepted appellees\u2019 appraisal, it accepted the appraiser\u2019s assertion that the current lounge area should be counted as a potential revenue-producing unit for purposes of determining gross income. As we stated above, the BTA may accept or reject all, part, or none of an expert\u2019s testimony. In this case, the BTA has accepted as a factual matter that in calculating potential gross income, there are potentially fifty-one revenue-producing units. We \u201cwill not overrule BTA findings of fact that are based upon sufficient probative evidence.\u201d <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 527 N.E.2d 874, 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Next, the appellants argue that the BTA should not have disregarded the testimony of Brian Danaher. The primary basis for the appellants\u2019 argument is that because Danaher testified before the BTA in a.prior case concerning this property, his testimony should have been accepted as that of an expert in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The BTA found that Danaher was a practicing attorney with experience in the engineering field. Danaher himself admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself an appraiser.\u201d The BTA found that Danaher did not qualify as an expert appraiser of real property. The mere fact that Danaher testified before the BTA in a prior case does not make him an expert real estate appraiser. One of the requirements of an expert witness, as set forth in Evid.R. 702(B), is that \u201c[t]he witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d In this case, Danaher did not exhibit any \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d in appraising real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Finally, the appellants argue that the BTA erred in disregarding Danaher\u2019s testimony because it mistakenly believed he had not provided information concerning land value. In light of our ruling concerning Danaher\u2019s testimony, the BTA did not err in disregarding his testimony on true value.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the decision of the BTA, being supported by probative evidence of record, is reasonable and lawful, and is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b175-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
