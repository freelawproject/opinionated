Thomas contends that the sentence for his theft conviction is void based on the claims he raised in the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The court of appeals, however, correctly dismissed the petition. Habeas corpus is not available to challenge either sentencing errors or the validity or sufficiency of an indictment. <em>State ex rel. Massie v. Rogers </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 449, 449-450, 674 N.E.2d 1383; <em>Smith v. Seidner </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 172, 173, 677 N.E.2d 336. These claims can be raised on direct appeal. <em>Massie </em>and <em>Smith. </em>Similarly, Thomas had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise his remaining claim that he was not present at his sentencing. See, <em>e.g., State v. Welch </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 47, 7 O.O.3d 128, 372 N.E.2d 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
