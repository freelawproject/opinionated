Finfrock contends, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>other things, that his parole revocation hearing was void because the APA did not comply with the minimum due process requirements set forth in <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">As we recently noted, however, in affirming an appeal in a similar case, habeas corpus, rather than mandamus, is the proper action for persons claiming entitlement to immediate release from prison. <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Ohio Parole Bd. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 140, 684 N.E.2d 1227, citing <em>State ex rel. Lemmon v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 186, 188, 677 N.E.2d 347, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In addition, even if the court of appeals had considered Finfrock\u2019s action as one in habeas corpus instead of mandamus, Finfrock was also not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because he failed to attach his pertinent commitment papers, <em>i.e., </em>his conviction and sentence and his parole revocation. R.C. 2725.04(D); <em>McBroom v. Russell </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 47, 48, 671 N.E.2d 10, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Finfrock was not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b784-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
