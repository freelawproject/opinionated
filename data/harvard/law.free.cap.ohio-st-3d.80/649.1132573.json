Kroger\u2019s primary contention is that <em>res judicata </em>applies to prevent claimant from relitigating the issue of TTD compensation for periods preceding February 22, 1991. Kroger argues that this \u201csame issue was previously heard [and] decided adversely to the Claimant\u201d during the proceedings on claimant\u2019s first motion for TTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\"><em>Res judicata </em>operates \u201cto preclude the relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 9, 10, 16 OBR 361, 362, 475 N.E.2d 782, 783. This principle applies to proceedings before the Industrial Commission. <em>State ex rel. Crisp v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 507, 597 N.E.2d 119. See, also, 8 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1997) 15-427, Section 79.72(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">However, in order for <em>res judicata </em>to apply, the issue under consideration must have been \u201cpassed upon\u201d or \u201cconclusively decided\u201d in an earlier proceeding. <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel, supra, </em>16 Ohio St.3d at 10, 16 OBR at 362, 475 N.E.2d at 783; <em>Crisp, supra, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 508, 597 N.E.2d at 120. <em>\u201c[R]es judicata </em>does not apply if the issue at stake was not specifically decided in the prior proceeding. * * * \u201d 8 Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 15-478, Section 79.72(f). Thus, in <em>State ex rel. Peabody Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 639, 643, 614 N.E.2d 1044, 1047, we declined to apply <em>res judicata </em>to prohibit further TTD compensation without a medical examination, explaining that:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">\u201cWhile the [prior] order did indeed provide that claimant should be examined and a hearing held if claimant requested further temporary total compensation, the order did not <em>expressly prohibit </em>compensation payment in the interim. <em>While this may have been what the commission meant, it is not what it said. </em>As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>result, we find that the [subsequent] order did not alter the earlier final order, and <em>res judicata </em>was not violated.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The issue narrows, therefore, to whether the question of compensation for periods preceding February 22, 1991 was specifically decided in the district hearing officer\u2019s July 19, 1991 order. The pivotal sentence in that order reads: \u201cPeriods of compensation preceding 02-22-91 are omitted since there is no documentation in file at this time.\u201d Kroger contends that \u201comitted\u201d has the same meaning and effect as \u201cdenied.\u201d In support, Kroger argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">\u201cWebster\u2019s Ninth Collegiate Dictionary defines omit as \u2018to leave out or leave unmentioned, to fail to perform\u2019; deny is defined as \u2018to refuse to grant.\u2019 Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus, Fourth Edition, indicates that the word \u2018reject\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018refuse\u2019 and \u2018deny\u2019; and Roget\u2019s further finds the word \u2018exclude\u2019 to be synonymous with \u2018reject\u2019 and \u2018omit.\u2019 Thus, by \u2018omitting\u2019 compensation for relevant periods, the Commission \u2018rejected\u2019 and \u2018refused to grant\u2019 (denied) compensation for the relevant period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">It is initially apparent that \u201comit\u201d and \u201cdeny\u201d are semantically distinct \u2014 they simply have different meanings. In its attempt to equate the two words, Kroger resorts to a thesaurus to cobble together a loose chain of synonyms, an exercise which not only contorts the English language but also exposes the flaws in the argument. Using Kroger\u2019s highly selective method, the following argument could also be made. The word \u201comit\u201d is synonymous with \u201cpass over.\u201d Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (4 Ed.1977) 404. \u201cPass over\u201d is a synonym for \u201cdeliver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642. \u201cDeliver\u201d is synonymous with \u201cgive out,\u201d <em>id., </em>which is a synonym for \u201cgrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if we allowed ourselves to indulge Kroger\u2019s reasoning, we could actually find that granting compensation is tantamount to denying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Nor can we accept that the prior order, in effect, constituted a denial of compensation for periods preceding February 22, 1991. Aside from the fact that the first order \u201comitted\u201d rather than denied compensation for those periods, it did so \u201csince there is no documentation in file at this time.\u201d It is unreasonable to conclude that a district hearing officer, experienced and well-trained in workers\u2019 compensation law, would choose to employ the terms \u201comitted\u201d and \u201cat this time\u201d without contemplating future proceedings regarding those time periods. In any event, even if \u201cthis may have been what the commission meant, it is not what it said.\u201d <em>Peabody Coal Co., supra, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 643, 614 N.E.2d at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">As a result, we find that the May 18, 1992 order did not alter the earlier final order, and <em>res judicata </em>was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Kroger also contends that the commission\u2019s May 18, 1992 reliance on Dr. Lochner\u2019s attending physician\u2019s questionnaire is improper, \u201cas medical evidence once rejected cannot be later cited in support of an application,\u201d citing <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87. In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>related argument, Kroger asserts that \u201cthe District Order of May 18, 1992, does not comply with\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, \u201cbecause the \u2018A.P.Q.\u2019 report does not actually support the Commission reasoning, and no other specific evidence is cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">These arguments ignore the fact that the May 18,1992 order was not limited to reliance on Dr. Lochner\u2019s August 29, 1989 attending physician\u2019s questionnaire. Instead, the order stated: \u201cFindings based on medical <em>reports </em>of Dr. Lochner.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have repeatedly held that such a reference to or identification of the medical evidence relied upon is sufficiently precise. <em>State ex rel. Ohio City Mfg. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 532 N.E.2d 748, 750; <em>State ex rel. Lucente v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 87, 89, 15 OBR 188, 190, 472 N.E.2d 718, 720; <em>State ex rel. Hutt v. Frick-Gallagher Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 184, 185, 11 OBR 497, 498, 464 N.E.2d 1005, 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Thus, even if the questionnaire were removed from evidentiary consideration, the commission\u2019s order is supported by Dr. Lochner\u2019s other reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Last, Kroger proposes that R.C. 4123.52 prohibits the commission from awarding TTD compensation to claimant for a back period in excess of two years prior to the date claimant filed her second motion. Thus, Kroger argues, \u201c[c]ompensation simply could not be considered prior to January 23, 1990.\u201d However, the relevant filing date for purposes of R.C. 4123.52 is April 30, 1991, the date that claimant initially applied for TTD compensation. See <em>State ex rel. Gen. Refractories Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 82, 541 N.E.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Thus, the commission did not abuse its discretion in awarding claimant TTD compensation for the period from November 21, 1989 to February 21, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b797-10\">Douglas, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aymd\">Cook, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b797-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b797-12\">Moyer, C J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALt\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent because <em>res judicata </em>bars the claimant from entitlement to compensation for the period November 21, 1989 to February 21, 1991 when a prior order did not award compensation for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">The majority relies upon <em>State ex rel. Peabody Coal Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 639, 614 N.E.2d 1044, in determining that the award to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>claimant here is not barred by <em>res judicata. </em>While the majority is correct in its quotation of that case, <em>Peabody </em>may be distinguished from the instant case on several grounds. First, in <em>Peabody, </em>the prior order specifically stated a procedure by which the claimant could request further temporary total disability compensation beyond the date stated in the order. <em>Id. </em>at 640, 614 N.E.2d at 1045. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the district hearing officer did not consider the issue of claimant\u2019s temporary total disability compensation to be conclusively adjudicated. Here, by contrast, the issue does not involve an <em>additional </em>period for which compensation is sought. Compensation is sought here <em>for </em>the <em>same </em>period for which the claimant originally sought compensation in the prior order. In addition, the claimant in <em>Peabody </em>sought compensation in his second request to the Industrial Commission for an additional injury of \u201cleft ulnar neuropathy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the second motion filed by the claimant sought coverage for the same condition for which she sought compensation in the prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Finally, the defense of <em>res judicata </em>in <em>Peabody </em>was premised upon the argument that the prior order prohibited additional compensation without an additional medical examination and hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 614 N.E.2d at 1047. No such issue exists in this case. Kroger raises the defense of <em>res judicata </em>here because, as the majority states, the issue is whether the question <em>of </em>compensation for the period November 21,1989 to February 21,1991 was specifically decided in the prior order. While it is true, then, that <em>Peabody </em>considered the issue of <em>res judicata </em>within the context of temporary total disability cases, its principles cannot be squarely applied here. There is little doubt in <em>Peabody </em>that the prior order did not conclusively adjudicate the claim that was brought in the later proceeding. The order of the district hearing officer there expressly left open the question of the claimant\u2019s entitlement to future compensation. In addition, the later motion brought by the claimant sought compensation for an additional injury. Thus, we properly determined in <em>Peabody </em>that we could not apply the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>By contrast, the instant case presents a claim brought in a later proceeding for the same condition, and based primarily upon the same medical evidence as the decision rendered in the prior order. As the following analysis demonstrates, this case may be distinguished in that its facts support the application of <em>res judicata </em>to the claimant\u2019s second motion for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">For the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to apply, a valid, final judgment must have been rendered upon the merits. See 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Judgments (1982), Section 24; see, also, <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226, 229. Here, in the claimant\u2019s initial motion, she sought compensation for the period beginning on November 21, 1989. This request included the period November 21,1989 to February 21,1991. The decision of the district hearing officer denied the claimant compensation for any period prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>February 22, 1991. The claimant did not appeal this order administratively. Therefore, the decision by the district hearing officer on the first motion became a final judgment. That judgment included a determination of the request of the claimant for compensation from November 21, 1989 to February 21, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We have stated that <em>res judicata </em>applies to administrative proceedings and will be applied where a party has \u201chad an ample opportunity to litigate the issues involved in the proceeding.\u201d See <em>Superior\u2019s Brand Meats, Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 133, 16 O.O.3d 150, 403 N.E.2d 996, syllabus. Here, the claimant had an opportunity to appeal the denial of compensation in the prior order for the period in dispute. She did not do so. Instead, she filed a second motion requesting compensation for the same period for which she was denied compensation in the prior order. The claimant here certainly \u201chad an ample opportunity to litigate the issues involved in the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Subsequent to the decision rendered by the district hearing officer, the claimant then was responsible for appealing any portion of the decision she considered adverse to her cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Further, the analysis by the majority as to the word choice employed by the district hearing officer is not persuasive when the entire order is analyzed. The order stated that there was \u201cno documentation in [the] file\u201d to support an award for the period in dispute and that \u201c[t]his order is based on the medical report(s) of Dr. Lochner.\u201d Regardless of the word choice used by the district hearing officer, a fair reading of the order compels the conclusion that there was no evidence to support an award for the period which was the subject of the claimant\u2019s later motion for compensation. By removing the responsibility from the claimant to appeal this judgment rendered adversely to her in the prior administrative proceeding, the majority has allowed the claimant, in effect, a second full bite of the apple.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b799-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
