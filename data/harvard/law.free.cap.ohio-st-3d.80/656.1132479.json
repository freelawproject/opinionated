The court of appeals concluded that <em>Noll\u2019s </em>standard had not been met, and we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">\u201cSome evidence\u201d supports the commission\u2019s determination that claimant is medically capable of sustained remunerative employment. While claimant challenges the sufficiency of Dr. Holbrook\u2019s report, she does not dispute Dr. Dillahunt\u2019s assessment of an ability to do sedentary work. There is, therefore, \u201csome evidence\u201d of a sedentary work capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">The controversy surrounding the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis focuses on the Anderson vocational report. Claimant contends that the commission could not have relied on the report to deny permanent total disability, given Anderson\u2019s ultimate conclusion. The flaw in this assertion, however, is that it ignores the commission\u2019s discretion in dealing with vocational evidence, <em>i.e., </em>that the commission can accept a report\u2019s underlying facts while rejecting its conclusion. <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. McGraw Edison Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 92, 609 N.E.2d 164. Thus, the commission could accept the job availability/medical capacity figure without accepting Anderson\u2019s opinion that claimant was vocationally disqualified from those jobs \u2014 that is exactly what the commission did. This, of course, obligated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the commission to perform its own evaluation of claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors\u2014 an analysis that ultimately proves deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The commission, in finding claimant capable of work, relies overwhelmingly on claimant\u2019s past employment. Its discussion is flawed because, despite excessive verbiage, it is no more than a recitation of claimant\u2019s nonmedieal profile. The commission lists claimant\u2019s work history three times but never explains how those nonsedentary jobs equip claimant for a sedentary position. Moreover, the commission\u2019s reference to \u201csedentary low stress positions in the food service industry\u201d merits further explanation. While the commission is generally not required to enumerate the jobs of which it believes claimant to be capable, its assertion that claimant could do low stress sedentary work in an industry that is traditionally considered neither low stress nor sedentary requires further exploration.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Claimant urges us to issue a full writ of mandamus under <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, rather than return the cause pursuant to <em>Noll. </em>However, the reference in the Anderson vocational report to potential job compatibility persuades us that a return to the commission for further consideration and amended order is the preferable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b803-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
