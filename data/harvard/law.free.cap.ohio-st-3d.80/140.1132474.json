Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, when they revoked his parole. Even if Johnson\u2019s assertions are correct, he would not be entitled to reversal of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Johnson is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus for release from prison and reinstatement on parole. Habeas corpus, rather than mandamus, is the appropriate action for persons claiming entitlement to immediate release from prison. <em>State ex rel. Lemmon v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 186, 188, 677 N.E.2d 347, 349; <em>State ex rel. Pirman v. Money </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 591, 594, 635 N.E.2d 26, 30. As the court noted in <em>Lemmon, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 188, 677 N.E.2d at 349, \u201c[a] contrary holding would permit inmates seeking immediate release from prison to employ mandamus to circumvent the statutory pleading requirements for instituting a habeas corpus action, <em>i.e., </em>attachment of commitment papers and verification.\u201d Although the court of appeals did not base its judgment on this rationale, a reviewing court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because erroneous reasons were assigned as a basis thereof. <em>State ex rel. Carter v. Schotten </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 89, 92, 637 N.E.2d 306, 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In addition, even if the court of appeals had considered Johnson\u2019s action as one in habeas corpus rather than mandamus, Johnson was also not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because he failed to comply with R.C. 2725.04\u2019s verification requirement. <em>McBroom v. Russell </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 47, 48, 671 N.E.2d 10, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. In so doing, we need not address the merits of the issues raised by the parties in this appeal. <em>State ex rel. Gabriel v. Youngstown </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 618, 620, 665 N.E.2d 209, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
