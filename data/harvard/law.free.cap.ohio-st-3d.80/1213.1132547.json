I respectfully dissent. <em>Based on the record before this court, </em>I would grant relator Wilson\u2019s petition for a writ of procedendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Wilson filed a motion to abrogate sentence on July 22, 1996. On September 2, 1997, Wilson filed a petition for a writ of procedendo seeking to have this court compel respondent to rule on Wilson\u2019s motion to abrogate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The respondent court, in opposing Wilson\u2019s motion, argues that \u201c[rjelator has completely failed to demonstrate that he has a clear legal right to have his sentences \u2018abrogated\u2019 and that he had no adequate remedy at law since he could appeal the judge\u2019s sentencing ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The respondent court\u2019s opposition is misplaced. Wilson\u2019s motion does not ask this court to compel the respondent court to abrogate his sentence; it merely asks that \u201cthe Court below make a determination as to whether or not Relator has a right to abrogation of the sentences imposed * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Further, Wilson\u2019s motion to abrogate sentence is a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 679 N.E.2d 1131, syllabus. Accordingly, Wilson has a statutory right to file that motion. A defendant has a right to a writ of procedendo when a court has unnecessarily delayed proceeding to judgment on a motion for postconviction relief. <em>State ex rel. Sherrills v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 461, 462, 650 N.E.2d 899, 900. We have held that allowing such a motion to languish for twelve months is excessive. See <em>State ex rel. Turpin v. Stark Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1966), 8 Ohio St.2d 1, 37 O.O.2d 40, 220 N.E.2d 670. In the case at bar, Wilson\u2019s motion has been pending well over a year. Accordingly, I would grant Wilson\u2019s petition for a writ of procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
