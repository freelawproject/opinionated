We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Most of claimant\u2019s propositions can be disposed of summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">As to proposition of law two, part-time work constitutes sustained remunerative employment. See <em>State ex rel. Wireman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 286, 551 N.E.2d 1265; <em>State ex rel. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Morse </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 210, 648 N.E.2d 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">As to proposition of law three, the commission\u2019s 1991 interlocutory award of permanent total disability compensation for a closed period did not compel the commission to extend this compensation. <em>State ex rel. Draganic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 461, 663 N.E.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">As to proposition of law four, the commission affirmatively considered, per the order\u2019s terms, the William Fink vocational report. The commission also expressly considered claimant\u2019s allowed psychological condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">As to proposition of law five, claimant, if she prevails, is not entitled to payment of photocopy expenses as costs. Civ.R. 54(D) provides that \u201c[e]xcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute or in these rules, costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d \u201cCosts\u201d include the \u201c \u2018statutory fees to which officers, witnesses, jurors and others are entitled for their services in an action * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Centennial Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 50, 23 O.O.3d 88, 89, 430 N.E.2d 925, 926. It does not include \u201cfees and disbursements\u201d that are not statutorily authorized. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 23 O.O.3d at 89, 430 N.E.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Claimant cites no statutory authority for the allowance of the copying expenses. Moreover, we agree with <em>Cincinnati ex rel. Simons v. Cincinnati </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 258, 620 N.E.2d 940, which specifically held that photocopying expenses are not \u201ccosts.\u201d As such, claimant has no right to the award of these expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">Having dispensed with these preliminary matters, our analysis turns to the traditional permanent total disability review. The starting point is, as always, a review for \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant was medically capable of sustained remunerative employment. Here, the commission cited the absence of psychiatric restrictions and the relatively few physical restrictions noted by Dr. McCloud as justification for its conclusion that claimant was medically able to work. This constitutes support for the commission\u2019s medical conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">We further find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that claimant had some vocational skills, and that those skills offset the obstacles posed by claimant\u2019s age. She has been an accomplished seamstress since childhood, and the commission found that, at a minimum, claimant\u2019s sewing skills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>imparted significant fine-motor skills \u2014 a conclusion that claimant does not dispute. Some of the jobs that claimant\u2019s motor skills suggest \u2014 for example, assembly work \u2014 are not inconsistent with her physical restrictions as reported by the commission. It was not, therefore, an abuse of discretion for the commission to find that claimant\u2019s nonmedical profile permitted her to secure alternate employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b508-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b508-8\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., dissent and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
