The parties do not contest decedent\u2019s inability to return to his former position of employment over the period at issue. They instead debate the cause of that disability. The litigants dispute whether \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the conclusion that decedent\u2019s nonallowed hip problems prevented a return to the former position of employment. This question is, however, irrelevant, since temporary total disability compensation could still be paid if decedent\u2019s allowed back condition independently prevented his return. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The commission found \u201cno credible medical evidence\u201d that the decedent\u2019s allowed condition was independently disabling. We do not find that conclusion to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Dr. O\u2019Brien did not address decedent\u2019s allowed back condition, so it cannot support the payment of temporary total disability compensation. Likewise, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Donovan\u2019s September 23, 1988 exam \u2014 his last contact with the decedent \u2014 did not generate an opinion as to decedent\u2019s back-related disability. Dr. Donovan simply related that, <em>according to an outside source, </em>decedent had been unable to return to his job. This is not a credible certification of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The record also contains two C-84 \u201cPhysician\u2019s Reports Supplemental\u201d from Dr. Stephen M. Scott, who examined decedent on October 27, 1989, and certified him as temporarily and totally disabled due to his low back condition from August 21, 1988 through January 25, 1991. Scott, however, certified this twenty-nine-month period of disability based on a one-time exam that elicited no objective findings of impairment. Moreover, Dr. Scott certified decedent as disabled for a period part of which was prior to his October 27, 1989 exam. This fact renders that portion of the certification invalid under <em>State ex rel. Case v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 383, 28 OBR 442, 504 N.E.2d 30. Equally important, without the benefit of any additional examination that might have revealed the existence of new and changed circumstances, Dr. Scott, without explanation, later changed decedent\u2019s return-to-work date from January 1, 1990 to January 25, 1991. Viewing these factors together, it was within the commission\u2019s prerogative to reject Dr. Scott\u2019s certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We find, therefore, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that no credible medical evidence supported an award of accrued compensation. For this reason, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed. \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
