This is incorrect. Claimant must also demonstrate that she actually sought work within her capabilities. <em>State ex rel. Consolidated Freightways v. Engerer </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 241, 658 N.E.2d 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">The job search required by Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(D)(3) has an inherent qualitative component \u2014 it must be an <em>adequate </em>job search. <em>Consolidated Freightways. </em>The adequacy of a job search must be resolved on a case-by-case basis and can encompass many factors. Two of those factors stand out in this case \u2014 the number and character of job contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Claimant has submitted hundreds of individually copied classified ads to which she purportedly responded. It appears easily half of those, however, were for jobs that were clearly beyond claimant\u2019s abilities either physically, academically (high school and beauty college), or in terms of required experience. This prompted the commission to find that claimant\u2019s job search was done in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">It was within the commission\u2019s discretion to find that these contacts did not go toward a good-faith search. The problem, in our eyes, with invalidating the entire search on this basis, however, is that it ignores the number of legitimate contacts that claimant did make. If half of the total contacts are bad, then half of them are good, and, in this case, half of the total is substantial. Claimant is, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>effect, being penalized for her overzealous job search, for had she simply submitted her \u201cgood\u201d contacts, the commission may have reached a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We accordingly affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and return the cause to the commission for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-6\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
