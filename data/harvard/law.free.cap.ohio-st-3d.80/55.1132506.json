(2) Did the commission\u2019s order satisfy <em>Noll? </em>and (3) Is claimant entitled to relief pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666? We answer all three questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The first issue has been resolved by <em>State ex rel. Whetstone v. Bonded Oil Co. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 205, 652 N.E.2d 762. At issue there was the directive in <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 173, 31 OBR 369, 374, 509 N.E.2d 946, 951, that the commission \u201clook at the claimant\u2019s age, education, work record, and all other factors, such as physical, psychological, and sociological, that are contained within the record in making its determination of permanent total disability.\u201d <em>Whetstone </em>held that a claimant could not seek consideration of a nonallowed condition \u2014 in this case, preexisting personality disorder \u2014 under the guise of \u201call other factors.\u201d The commission did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in refusing to consider this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We do find that the commission abused its discretion by crafting an order that does not meet <em>Noll, supra. </em>At issue is the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis, which we find to be deficient in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The first involves the commission\u2019s treatment of claimant\u2019s work history, which is little more than a recitation of claimant\u2019s past jobs. The commission\u2019s attempt to add a substantive dimension to this recitation by using the phrases \u201cwide and varied\u201d and \u201cflexibility and adaptability\u201d fails. Such hollow phrases are reminiscent of the boilerplate previously decried in <em>Noll, </em>and simply restate what the earlier recitation had already revealed \u2014 that claimant had worked many jobs prior to injury. These phrases do not explain how claimant\u2019s occupational history enhances his reemployment potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We also find the commission\u2019s explanation to be inadequate for a second reason. The cornerstone of the commission\u2019s order is the future \u2014 the many years of work-force participation available to one of claimant\u2019s age. The commission\u2019s order, however, merely says that this availability exists. It does not address whether claimant is, or could be, vocationally capable of taking advantage of it. The order says nothing about claimant\u2019s retraining or rehabilitation potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">We conclude, therefore, that the commission\u2019s order violates <em>Noll. </em>We do not, however, find that relief pursuant to <em>Gay </em>is appropriate. <em>Gay </em>relief is intended for only the most egregious of situations, where the evidence is so one-sided as to compel but one result. This is not the case here. Claimant\u2019s young age and moderate level of impairment are inconsistent with the evidentiary one-sidedness necessary to sustain such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order pursuant to <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-5\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b202-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b202-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZr\">dissenting. The appropriate standard for this court\u2019s review is to determine whether there is \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support the stated basis for the commission\u2019s decision. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Because the record below contains \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of the commission\u2019s decision, I would affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
