As the clerk notes, however, after Thomson was granted leave to file an amended complaint, which proposed adding the Court of Claims as a new respondent, he did not file the amended complaint, and it was never served on the Court of Claims. The court of appeals acted properly in not considering the proposed amendment. See, generally, 4 Harper <em>&amp; </em>Solimine, Anderson\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice (1996) 485^486, Section 156.04; 1 Klein &amp; Darling, Ohio Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Practice (1997) 803, Section AT 15-3; cf. <em>Steiner v. Steiner </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 513, 520-522, 620 N.E.2d 152, 157-158.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In addition, even assuming that Thomson\u2019s amended complaint was properly before the court of appeals after it granted Thomson\u2019s motion to amend, Thomson\u2019s mandamus claim alleging an abuse of discretion by the Court of Claims lacked merit. A writ of mandamus will not issue to control judicial discretion, even if that discretion is abused. <em>State ex rel. Luna v. McGimpsey </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 485, 486, 659 N.E.2d 1278, 1278-1279; <em>State ex rel. Jennings v. Nurre </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 596, 598, 651 N.E.2d 1006, 1008; R.C. 2731.03; cf. <em>State ex rel. Jenkins v. Tyack </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 242, 245, 17 OBR 479, 482, 479 N.E.2d 267, 270-271 (\u201cTo force the Court of Claims to accept a legal determination by the panel [of Court of Claims commissioners] when that determination in the court\u2019s discretion was an incorrect application of the appropriate legal standard, would be an explicit attempt to control proper judicial discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Finally, the court of appeals correctly dismissed Thomson\u2019s original mandamus complaint because the clerk had no duty to transmit the Court of Claims record to the court of appeals after Thomson attempted to appeal the Court of Claims determination. See R.C. 2743.10(D) (\u201cUpon the motion of a party, the court of claims shall review the determination of the clerk upon the clerk\u2019s report and papers filed in the action and shall enter judgment consistent with its findings. <em>The judgment shall not be the subject of further appeal.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not commit any error in granting the clerk\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion and dismissing Thomson\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b641-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
