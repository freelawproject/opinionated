Lake\u2019s assertions, however, are meritless for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">First, as the court of appeals correctly determined, the APA had authority to correct Lake\u2019s release date. Cf. <em>Hattie v. Anderson </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 232, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>233, 626 N.E.2d 67, 70 (\u201c[T]he APA possesses discretion to rescind an unexecuted order for a prisoner to receive parole at a future date without providing a hearing.\u201d). Lake has no right to be released before the expiration of his actual sentence. See <em>State ex rel. Hattie v. Goldhardt </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 123, 125, 630 N.E.2d 696, 698. Second, Lake did not verify his petition. <em>McBroom v. Russell </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 47, 48, 671 N.E.2d 10, 11; R.C. 2725.04. Finally, Lake did not attach all of his pertinent commitment papers to his petition. <em>Brown v. Rogers </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 339, 340-341, 650 N.E.2d 422, 423; R.C. 2725.04(D). Although Lake claimed entitlement to release from prison based on a release date specified in the APA\u2019s March 1995 parole revocation order, he did not attach a copy of this order to his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not err in dismissing Lake\u2019s petition. No evidentiary hearing was required. See <em>Gaskins v. Shiplevy </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 380, 382, 667 N.E.2d 1194, 1196; <em>Marshall v. Lazaroff </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 443, <em>443-444, </em>674 N.E.2d 1378, 1378-1379. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
