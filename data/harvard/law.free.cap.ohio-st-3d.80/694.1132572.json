Therefore, we must determine whether the appellate court\u2019s issuance of the writ was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">This is a case of first impression: whether an employee injured at work can receive wage-loss compensation for time missed for medical treatments pertaining to the workplace injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">There are two types of workers\u2019 compensation benefits involved in this case\u2014 medical benefits (R.C. 4123.54), which the commission approved and WilliamsLaker has received, and wage-loss benefits (R.C. 4123.56[B]), which are at issue in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The crux of Williams-Laker's argument is that she is entitled to wage-loss benefits because her workplace injury caused her to need treatment, and in order to attend these treatments she had to miss work because of the unavailability of the therapy during nonworking hours. The commission argues that WilliamsLaker was medically able to work without restrictions and therefore did not suffer a <em>compensable </em>wage loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Williams-Laker alleges that she is entitled to wage-loss benefits pursuant to R.C. 4123.56(B), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">\u201cWhere an employee in a claim allowed under this chapter suffers a wage loss as a result of returning to employment other than his former position of employment or as a result of being unable to find employment consistent with the claimant\u2019s physical capabilities, he shall receive compensation * * * [as a percentage of his weekly wage].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Williams-Laker cites former Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(D)(2), a rule promulgated pursuant to R.C. 4123.56(B), which allows wage-loss benefits when \u201cthe employee returns to [her] former position but suffers a wage loss.\u201d WilliamsLaker claims that former Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(D)(2) supports her claim for wage-loss benefits because \u201cshe returned to her former position but suffered a wage loss nonetheless.\u201d Williams-Laker acknowledges that in order to receive wage-loss benefits, \u201cthe claimant must show that he or she has suffered diminished wages as a result of a medical impairment that is causally related to the industrial injury.\u201d Williams-Laker then asserts that she unequivocally suffered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>loss of earnings due to her participation in the prescribed medical treatment for the allowed condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In order to recover for wage loss, a claimant must prove actual wage loss and causal connection to his or her injury. <em>State ex rel Reamer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 450, 452, 674 N.E.2d 1384, 1385. Another prerequisite to recover wage loss is proof that a medical inability prevents the claimant from working or reduces the claimant\u2019s capacity to work. <em>State ex rel. Chora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 238, 241, 658 N.E.2d 276, 278. Therefore, if the reason for a claimant\u2019s absence from work, or physical limitation to complete work, is not due to \u201cmedical inability,\u201d then there is no causal connection between the work-related injury and any time absent from work so as to justify wage-loss compensation. See <em>State ex rel. The Andersons v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 539, 542, 597 N.E.2d 143, 146. Accordingly, we hold that when a claimant suffers a work-related injury, receives workers\u2019 compensation benefits therefor, and the claimant misses work to receive prescribed, approved treatments for the injury, that claimant may recover wage-loss compensation for the time absent from work only if the claimant proves (1) that the treatment was medically necessary for the claimant to perform his or her job, (2) that without the treatment he or she could not continue to work full time, and (3) that treatment was available only during the claimant\u2019s hours of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">In the case at bar, Williams-Laker missed approximately ten hours of work per week for her treatment at UPCC between September 30,1991 and December 30, 1991. Without question, Williams-Laker\u2019s injury was work-related and the commission authorized medical benefits for treatment of her injury. Further, there is no doubt that Williams-Laker had some wage loss during her absence from work in order to attend these treatments. In fact, her employer agreed to her period of absence for medical treatments and did not oppose the wage-loss claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The issue then becomes whether the treatment was medically necessary for her to work. The record reveals that Dr. Richard V. Gregg, Director of UPCC, requested medical treatment for Williams-Laker on July 8, 1991, stating that \u201cthis patient would benefit most from our outpatient therapy program.\u201d Dr. Patrick J. Brunner, Williams-Laker\u2019s treating physician, in a letter dated September 17, 1993 verifying that he had recommended the program and that the patient benefited significantly from it, wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">\u201cDue to the <em>available hours </em>at the Center, <em>without taking the patient off of work </em>and <em>putting her on temporary total disability, </em>she had to miss several hours of work [per week]. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">\u201cThis treatment was recommended by me and, no doubt, has helped the patient, since at the present time, she is able to work full time with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>restrictions and has had no loss of work. As stated above, her only other alternative would have been to take the patient off of work full time and collect temporary/total disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Therefore, in this particular instance, a clear inference can be drawn that the treatments were medically necessary for Williams-Laker to continue to work, and that part-time work coupled with the treatment was the least restrictive alternative to temporary total disability compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This result also comports with the general policy behind temporary disability compensation of encouraging injured employees to get back to work as soon as possible, commensurate with their medical abilities. <em>Savage v. Claussner Hosiery Co. </em>(Ky.1964), 379 S.W.2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">A contrary finding would encourage greater use of temporary total status to obtain necessary treatments and discourage employees from getting back to work. This result would be less acceptable for employers and employees alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">We note that this opinion should <em>not </em>be interpreted to allow a claimant to voluntarily take off work to receive elective treatment and receive wage-loss compensation for the time absent from work. Rather, on the rare occasions where an injured worker who is prescribed treatment for a work-related injury, which is medically necessary for the claimant to perform his or her job, without which the claimant could not continue to work full time, and treatment is available only during the claimant\u2019s work hours, the claimant can recover wage-loss compensation for the time that the claimant is absent work to receive the treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Williams-Laker has established through Dr. Gregg\u2019s and Dr. Brunner\u2019s reports that her treatments for her approved work-related injury were medically necessary for her to be able to perform her job without limitation during the period of her treatment at UPCC from September 30,1991 to December 30,1991, and that the treatments were only available during her hours of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">However, Williams-Laker failed to present any adequate medical testimony or evidence that her wage losses outside the actual period of treatment at UPCC were medically necessary. No doctor\u2019s reports explain why she had reduced wages before she began such treatments at UPCC. Williams-Laker must still carry the burden of proof on all aspects of her claim. Therefore, WilliamsLaker\u2019s wage-loss compensation is limited to the time of treatment at UPCC from September 30,1991 to December 30,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>We find that the commission abused its discretion in denying wage-loss compensation from September 30, 1991 to December 30, 1991 based on the evidence presented. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 order granting the writ of mandamus compelling the commission to award Williams-Laker wage-loss compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b843-6\">Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b843-7\">Douglas and Pfeifer, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AfW\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\">. We do not condone wage-loss compensation to a worker for taking time off to receive treatments for a work-related injury if the treatment provider has treatment times available that will not interfere with the claimant\u2019s work hours. Accordingly, to facilitate review of this type of wage-loss claim, we encourage the parties to develop the record with regard to the treatment provider\u2019s available hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b843-8\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_Y\">dissenting. Because I believe the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying wage-loss compensation, I respectfully dissent. By allowing payment of wage-loss compensation without medical evidence that absence from work and reduced earnings are the product of a medical impairment, the majority authorizes payment of such compensation beyond the scope of R.C. 4123.56.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The majority\u2019s allowance of wage-loss compensation for time absent from work to receive prescribed, approved treatment may encourage injured employees to return to work as soon as possible, but it is contrary to the statutory language and decisional law on the subject. It ignores that wage-loss compensation, like permanent total and temporary total disability compensation, requires a medical impairment. <em>State ex rel. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Morse </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 210, 215, 648 N.E.2d 827, 832; <em>State ex rel. Liposchak v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 194, 195, 652 N.E.2d 753, 755. A medical impairment does not encompass just any medically related impediment to work \u2014 the impediment instead must be a \u201cphysical impairment of junction\u201d to perform work. (Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 171, 31 OBR 369, 373, 509 N.E.2d 946, 950. More specifically, impairment means \u201cthe amount of a claimant\u2019s anatomical and/or mental loss of function\u201d as determined by medical professionals according to accepted medical and scientific standards. <em>Id.; State ex rel. Dallas v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 193, 194,11 OBR 504, 505, 464 N.E.2d 567, 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Here, Williams-Laker has not established a functional inability to work full-time hours. Rather, the evidence shows that she worked part-time to accommodate her doctors\u2019 schedules and to improve her injury-induced condition. Medical therapy to improve the lasting effects of an industrial injury, where the condition does not presently affect the claimant\u2019s performance, is not a medical impairment for which wage-loss compensation is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Accordingly, the commission\u2019s decision denying this award was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b844-4\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
