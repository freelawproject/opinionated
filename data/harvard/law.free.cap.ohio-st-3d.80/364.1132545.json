Claimant asks us either to award wage-loss compensation or return the cause for further consideration. The commission wants its order upheld as is. Our review supports the commission\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Claimant\u2019s request for wage loss rests on his assertion that his injury removed him from his former position of employment. Notwithstanding Dr. Mikolich\u2019s full release of claimant to return to his prior duties, claimant proposes that \u201cbut for\u201d his injury, he would not have missed the four years of work that left his continued employment subject to managerial prerogative. The court of appeals, however, found this perceived causal link to be too tenuous, holding that \u201cthe meaning of \u2018direct result,\u2019 as contemplated by R.C. 4123.56 and Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32, does not go so far as to extend to any result that may eventually occur down the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">We agree. To permit a claimant whose injury has, for relevant purposes, resolved to nevertheless assert a causal relationship between the injury and an inability to return to the former position of employment sets a dangerous precedent. We, therefore, find that claimant\u2019s lower paying job at Jeswald\u2019s Auto &amp; Truck Service was not related to the industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-15\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
