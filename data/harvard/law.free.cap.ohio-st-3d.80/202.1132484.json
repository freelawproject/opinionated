The department\u2019s argument is based on the fact that Regulation 53 has been enforced against liquor-permit premises, not Freedom Road. The department states that it, in fact, has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>authority to regulate the activities of charitable organizations such as Freedom Road. Accordingly, the department argues that only permit-premises owners have standing to challenge the citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">By requesting a declaratory judgment, however, Freedom Road is not directly challenging any particular administrative order of the department. Freedom Road would have no standing to make such a challenge. Instead, Freedom Road seeks judicial construction of R.C. 2915.02(D). Judicial construction of R.C. 2915.02(D), while having no direct effect on the department\u2019s administrative orders, will resolve whether the department has correctly interpreted that statute in finding a violation under Regulation 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The Declaratory Judgment Act allows \u201c[a]ny person * * * whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a * * * statute [or] rule * * * [to] have determined any question of construction * * * arising under such * * * statute [or] rule * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d R.C. 2721.03. Because (1) this action is within the scope of the Declaratory Judgment Act, (2) a justiciable controversy exists between adverse parties, and (3) speedy relief is necessary to preserve rights that may otherwise be impaired or lost, Freedom Road\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment is proper. Compare <em>Burger Brewing Co. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 93, 96-100, 63 O.O.2d 149,150-152, 296 N.E.2d 261, 263-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The remaining issues before the court involve interpretation of R.C. 2915.02(D). The first issue requires an analysis of whether Freedom Road \u201cconduct[s]\u201d the tip ticket operation, as required under R.C. 2915.02(D)(1). The second issue involves the question of whether permit premises owners or their employees derive a benefit prohibited by R.C. 2915.02(D) from their participation in otherwise lawful tip ticket operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">FREEDOM ROAD CONDUCTS THE FUNDRAISING ACTIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Analysis of the statutory terms chosen by the General Assembly to identify the potential actors under R.C. 2915.02(D) resolves the issue of what the General Assembly meant by its requirement under R.C. 2915.02(D)(1) that legal schemes of chance be \u201cconducted\u201d by charitable organizations. R.C. 2915.01(T) defines \u201cconduct\u201d as follows: \u201c\u2018Conduct\u2019 means to back, promote, organize, manage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>carry on, or prepare for the operation of a scheme or game of chance * * <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because these verbs are listed in the disjunctive, a charitable organization conducts the scheme or game of chance when it executes <em>any </em>of the actions listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">A corollary of the legislature\u2019s use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in defining the types of actions subsumed in the broader concept of \u201cconducting\u201d a scheme of chance is that a charitable organization may conduct a scheme of chance despite the fact that owners and/or employees of permit premises actually \u201ccarry on\u201d that activity. In fact, R.C. 2915.02(D) contemplates operation or assistance in the operation of a scheme or game of chance by persons other than the charitable organization, merely prohibiting such persons from being compensated for that activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u201cOperate,\u201d while not expressly defined in R.C. Chapter 2915, connotes performance of an activity, while the verbs used to define \u201cconduct\u201d would allow a charitable organization to delegate operation of the activity, while retaining a supervisory or organizational role. See, <em>e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1580-1581 (defining \u201coperate\u201d); see, also, R.C. 2915.01(U) (defining a \u201cbingo game operator\u201d as one who carries out any of the bingo gaming functions). Accordingly, the permit-premises owners\u2019 operation or carrying on of Freedom Road\u2019s tip ticket activities does not prevent Freedom Road from \u201cconducting\u201d the scheme of chance, as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES ARE NOT COMPENSATED FOR OPERATING THE FUNDRAISING ACTIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">R.C. 2915.02(D) states that \u201c[n]o person shall receive any commission, wage, salary, reward, tip, donation, gratuity, <em>or other form of compensation, </em>directly or indirectly, <em>for operating or assisting in the operation of any scheme or game of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>chance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellant argues that this provision prevents permit-premises owners and employees from participating in on-premises tip ticket operations. The evidence on the issue demonstrates that neither permit-premises owners nor their employees are paid for operating the fundraising activity and that all of the net proceeds from the activity are paid to Freedom Road. Further, the department failed to produce any evidence that permit-premises owners or their employees receive anything in the nature of compensation for operating the fundraising activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Appellant argues that permit holders and their employees necessarily receive an impermissible \u201cbenefit\u201d from any increased patronage that results from the sale of Freedom Road tip tickets in their establishments. Although the department produced no evidence regarding the effect of tip ticket sales on patronage at trial, Freedom Road\u2019s president, Lindy Douglas, acknowledged in her deposition testimony that sales of tip tickets allow participating permit premises to keep customers who otherwise might go elsewhere to engage in gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In interpreting a statute, we must begin by examining its express terms. The statute itself does not expressly prohibit one who operates or assists a scheme or game of chance from deriving any <em>benefit </em>from that activity. Instead, the statute carefully sets out a list of the types of <em>compensation </em>that such persons are forbidden from receiving. None of the listed forms of compensation may be received \u201cfor operating or assisting in the operation of a scheme or game of chance.\u201d The statute thus contemplates a <em>quid pro quo </em>\u2014 the receipt of something of value for the giving of another. The benefit of increased patronage, on the other hand, does not come in the form of compensation and therefore is not within the prohibited class.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">We conclude that the benefit of increased patronage does not fall within the prohibited class of compensation listed in R.C. 2915.02(D). Thus, there is nothing in the evidence to remove the scheme of chance from R.C. 2915.02(D)\u2019s exception to that section\u2019s general prohibition against gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">FREEDOM ROAD IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT IT SEEKS</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Along with a declaration of its rights under statute, Freedom Road requested that the court \u201ctemporarily, preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Department, its agents, employees and anyone acting in active concert or participation with it, from issuing citations as a result of Freedom Road\u2019s charitable fundraising activities on permit premises throughout the State of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>There may be any number of reasons not addressed in this action that would authorize the department to cite the permit holders under its Regulation 53. Our analysis is necessarily restrained by the limited evidence presented by the parties to this action. Accordingly, it would be improper to grant the broad injunctive relief requested by Freedom Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm, in part, the decision of the appellate court. We reverse that portion of the appellate court\u2019s decision ordering remand and issue a declaration that R.C. 2915.02(D) permits participation in the operation of a charitable organization\u2019s scheme of chance on liquor-permit premises by premises owners and/or their employees, so long as neither owners nor employees are compensated for their participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-8\">Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b351-9\">Douglas, J., concurs in the syllabus and judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b351-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">. We note that the term \u201cconduct\u201d is used elsewhere in R.C. 2915.02, both as a noun and as a verb that, in context, must be given a narrower construction than that given in our opinion. For instance, R.C. 2915.02(A)(1) prohibits persons from engaging in \u201cconduct\u201d that facilitates bookmaking and R.C. 2915.02(D)(2)(e) prohibits otherwise legal games of chance that are \u201cconducted\u201d during, or within ten hours of, a bingo game held pursuant to R.C. 2915.12. Nevertheless, in construing the verb \u201cconducted\u201d in R.C. 2915.02(D)(1) as requiring a level of action below which an otherwise lawful scheme of chance becomes unlawful, we must construe any ambiguity in that term strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the defendant. R.C. 2901.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">Accordingly, even if we were to conclude that the definition of \u201cconduct\u201d found at R.C. 2915.01(T) is inapplicable to that term\u2019s use in R.C. 2915.02(D)(1), we nevertheless would be confined to construing that term within its context in connection with its common usage. R.C. 1.42. The common usage of \u201cconduct,\u201d when used as a verb, connotes management, control, or the giving of direction. See, <em>e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 474. Accordingly, even without reference to R.C. 2915.01(T), our conclusion would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b351-11\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGR\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record before us demonstrates that Ohio liquor permit owners or employees who participate in Freedom Road\u2019s tip ticket scheme of chance as described by Freedom Road\u2019s president are not \u201ccompensat[ed], directly or indirectly, for operating or assisting in the operation of any scheme or game of chance\u201d as prohibited by R.C. 2915.02(D). Moreover, for the reasons which follow, I believe that the court of appeals correctly ordered a remand of this cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">R.C. 2915.02 and Regulation 53<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">I am unable to concur in the conclusion of the majority that R.C. 2915.02(D) includes an element of a <em>quid pro quo </em>between the charitable organization itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>and permit holders or permit holder employees who sell Freedom Road tip tickets. The last sentence of R.C. 2915.02(D) provides, \u201cNo person shall receive any commission, wage, salary, reward, tip, donation, gratuity, or other form of compensation, <em>directly or indirectly, </em>for operating or assisting in the operation of any scheme or game of chance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This broad, inclusive language should be construed as it was intended so as to proscribe the receipt of any pecuniary benefit flowing to a person based on operation or assistance in a scheme of chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Lindy Douglas, Freedom Road\u2019s president, testified that permit holders benefit from selling the tip tickets in that sale of the tickets \u201ckeep[s] the customers in their bars\u201d who otherwise might leave to engage in gambling at \u201cthe Eagles, Elks or Moose lodges or American Legions.\u201d This evidence demonstrates that permit holders indirectly received a pecuniary benefit in the form of increased patronage, <em>i.e., </em>increased income, as a result of the sale of tip tickets on their liquor establishment premises. In my view, a bar owner who increases profits as a result of offering on-premises charitable gambling thereby indirectly receives a form of compensation for operating or assisting in that scheme. Thus that permit holder falls within the proscription of the quoted last sentence of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>2915.02(D). Inclusion of a direct <em>quid pro quo </em>requirement unjustifiably diminishes the language \u201cdirect <em>or indirect </em>\u201d within the prohibition in R.C. 2915.02(D). I believe Douglas\u2019s testimony is sufficient to support the conclusion of the trial court that R.C. 2915.02(D) was violated by the sale of tip tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Moreover, if selling Freedom Road tip tickets is an express or implied employment duty of permit holder employees, then those employees are in fact compensated for their assistance in operating the scheme of chance when they receive their pay from their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Freedom Road itself acknowledged that its tip ticket system constituted a scheme of chance as defined in the Revised Code (\u201ca lottery, numbers game, pool, or other scheme in which a participant gives a valuable consideration for a chance to win a prize.\u201d R.C. 2915.01[C].). R.C. 2915.01(E) defines \u201cscheme or game of chance conducted for profit\u201d as \u201cany scheme or game of chance designed to produce income for the person who conducts or operates the scheme or game of chance * * R.C. 2915.02(A) provides, \u201cNo person shall * * * (2) [establish, promote, or operate or knowingly engage in conduct that facilitates any scheme or game of chance conducted for profit.\u201d Thus, were Freedom Road not able to invoke the charitable organization exemption provided by R.C. 2915.02(D), its scheme of chance would clearly be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">However, Freedom Road, as a charitable organization, could legally conduct a tip ticket scheme of chance pursuant to R.C. 2915.02(D). Thus, it arguably could itself conduct a scheme of chance on liquor control premises by using its own volunteers to approach liquor premises patrons and solicit them to purchase the tip tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">If, however, permit-premises employees were selling tip tickets not because they desired to volunteer a service for Freedom Road, but instead because selling the tickets was an express or implied duty of employment assigned for the purpose of increasing the income of the liquor establishment, then the employees would not be volunteers. I agree with the court of appeals that the record is insufficient to indicate whether the persons selling tip tickets were acting as employees of the permit holders or as volunteers.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">If it is true that those employees were not true volunteers, the employer permit holder directing their activities would itself be \u201cconducting\u201d the tip ticket scheme, and the scheme of chance would not be solely \u201cconducted by a charitable organization\u201d as required by R.C. 2915.02(D)(1), nor would the permit holder qualify for the statutory charitable organization exemption. Instead, the permit holder conducting the scheme would be committing a gambling offense in violation of R.C. 2915.02, and possession of the tip tickets on liquor premises would therefore fall within the proscription of Regulation 53. See, also, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>2915.02(E), which prohibits a charitable organization from transferring its right to conduct a charitable scheme of chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In determining whether permit holders themselves \u201cconduct\u201d the tip ticket scheme at issue, we look to R.C. 2915.01(T), where that term is defined in an inclusive manner to include backing, promoting, organizing, managing, carrying on, or preparing for the operation of a scheme or game of chance. Moreover, R.C. 2915.01(E) defines \u201cscheme or game of chance conducted for profit\u201d to include any such scheme \u201cdesigned to produce income\u201d for the person who conducts or operates the scheme or game.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">It is possible for more than one legal entity to be deemed to be \u201cconducting\u201d a single scheme of chance, and the testimony of Douglas shows that such a circumstance may well have existed in this case. The evidence in this case shows that Freedom Road itself did little more than periodically drop off new tip ticket supplies and pick up proceeds. On this record, in which Freedom Road\u2019s supervision of actual day-to-day sales of tip tickets was minimal at best, I conclude that the evidence could support a conclusion that permit holders themselves illegally conducted, <em>i.e., </em>backed, promoted, organized, managed, carried on, or prepared, a scheme of chance for their own profit, and not for altruistic or charitable motives, whether or not Freedom Road also may be deemed to have conducted the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">It is appropriate to mention the scale of the tip ticket scheme at issue here. Douglas testified that, prior to 1994, tip ticket sales had generated revenues totaling as much as $40,000 a week from sales in nearly three hundred fifty liquor establishments. It is doubtful that the General Assembly intended to authorize a largely unregulated gambling scheme of this magnitude when it adopted the charitable organization exemption provision found in R.C. 2915.02(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Even assuming that the proposition of law set forth in the syllabus is correct, I do not believe that it is fully dispositive of the action before us. Rather, I would affirm the court of appeals\u2019 remand of this cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Unfortunately the combined decision and judgment entry issued by the trial court is ambiguous as to whether the court intended thereby to award a declaratory judgment or, rather, to deny a declaratory judgment and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law justifying that denial. The caption to its decision reads \u201cDecision and Entry <em>Denying </em>Plaintiff Freedom Road Foundation\u2019s <em>Request for Declaratory Judgment </em>and Permanent Injunctive Relief Filed on October 19, 1994.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court expressly stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>body of its opinion that \u201cFreedom Road\u2019s requests for a declaration and an injunction are DENIED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Nevertheless, the opinion included findings of fact and conclusions of law, which might, in a general sense, be deemed declarations of law. Clearly, however, the trial court refused to grant Freedom Road the declaratory judgment it sought, that being a declaration that \u201cits charitable fundraising activities are in compliance with R.C. 2915.02 and Regulation 53.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In either event, my review of the record leads me to conclude that the trial court entered final judgment adverse to Freedom Road based solely on its determination that participating permit owners/employees were not volunteers. It failed to discuss numerous other arguments the department had made, apparently deeming them to be moot, as to why the best exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion would be complete denial of declaratory judgment. Among those arguments were contentions that no true case or controversy existed between the parties and that issuance of a declaratory judgment was precluded by <em>res judicata </em>and estoppel doctrines. Moreover, I note that R.C. 2721.12 provides, \u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration.\u201d Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that a dispute subject to resolution through declaratory judgment existed between Freedom Road and the department as to whether or not Freedom Road\u2019s actions were legal, it is clear that the interests of participating liquor permit holders were also very much at issue. Yet they were not joined as parties in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The requirement of R.C. 2721.12 that all persons who will be affected by a declaratory judgment are to be joined as parties has been held to be a substantive jurisdictional requirement. <em>Bretton Ridge Homeowners Club v. DeAngelis </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 183, 555 N.E.2d 663. Under existing Ohio precedent, Freedom Road\u2019s failure to join statutorily mandated parties in and of itself would have justified the trial court in refusing to enter declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In view of the majority\u2019s rejection of the sole basis for the trial court decision, I believe the trial court should be given the opportunity to consider the department\u2019s remaining arguments against entry of declaratory judgment. In effect, the majority has itself determined that a declaratory judgment should be issued, has formulated the terms of that declaratory judgment and has incorporated that declaration into syllabus law. The majority thereby encroaches upon the principle that issuance or denial of declaratory judgment is committed in the first instance to the sound discretion of the trial court, reversible only upon demonstration of an abuse of that discretion or error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">I do not believe the court was bound to issue a declaratory judgment at the conclusion of the trial. As noted in 2 Anderson, Actions for Declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Judgments (1951) 919-920, Section 383, \u201cthere is a distinction between the jurisdiction of a court to grant declaratory relief and the exercise of discretion pursuant to that jurisdiction. * * * [T]he final exercise of the court\u2019s discretion either to declare rights and legal relations of the parties, or to decline to pronounce a declaratory judgment, cannot be anticipated in advance of the development of the proof.\u201d Thus, even where a justiciable controversy exists, declaratory judgment may be refused if, in the exercise of a sound discretion, it appears that the determination is not proper under all of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>On the record established in this case, the trial court might well yet determine it appropriate to deny declaratory judgment if given the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">For the foregoing reasons I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to accord the trial court the opportunity to reconsider whether to issue a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-6\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-15\">.
