Upon review, we affirm that judgment, but do so for reasons other than those relied upon by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In <em>State ex rel. Draganic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 461, 663 N.E.2d 929, issued subsequent to the lower court\u2019s decision in this case, we reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. In <em>Draganic, </em>we held that the commission is not required to extend permanent total disability compensation beyond the date specified in an interlocutory permanent total disability order.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">This leaves us to address the commission\u2019s evidentiary defense of its order. Upon so doing, we find that the commission\u2019s order not only does not meet <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, but also that claimant qualifies for relief consistent with <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The commission\u2019s order clearly defies <em>Noll </em>\u2014 a deficiency that is prerequisite to any consideration of <em>Gay </em>relief. The commission\u2019s decision was based on claimant\u2019s age, a factor which the commission felt made claimant amenable to retraining. Age, however, is immaterial if claimant lacks the intellectual capacity to learn. The claimant has a sixth-grade education and is illiterate. His work history consists entirely of extremely heavy physical labor that is now well beyond his physical capacities. There is no explanation as to how or for what jobs claimant is able to retrain.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">These factors not only compel a finding of <em>Noll </em>insufficiency, but the issuance of relief pursuant to <em>Gay </em>as well. Since it is almost impossible to conceive of a sedentary position for which an illiterate person with a background in heavy labor is qualified, we find that a return of the cause to the commission for further consideration would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, but for the reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
