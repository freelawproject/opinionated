VI, and by failing to advise the Clerk of his current office address as required by Gov.Bar R. VI(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">We therefore adopt the recommendation of the board and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs of these proceedings are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
