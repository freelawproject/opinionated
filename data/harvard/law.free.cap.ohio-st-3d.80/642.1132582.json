For the reasons that follow, we hold that HCF is not subject to former Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(M), because it was not a succeeding employer under former Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B)(l), nor did it merge with Crestview and Piketon. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and issue a writ of mandamus vacating the Board Subcommittee\u2019s order. Thus, we do not reach the due process claims in HCF\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">Former Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(M) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">\u201cIf a state insurance fund employer <em>or a succeeding employer, as described in [Ohio Adm.Code Jpl21-7-02(B)(l) ], applies for the privilege of paying compensation, etc., directly, to transfer from state fund to self insurance, </em>the actuary of the bureau shall determine, on the basis of the full past experience of the commission and the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation, the amount of the liability of such employer to the bureau for losses incurred and losses which may be incurred for injuries or occupational diseases occurring during the four calendar years used in the most recent merit rating calculation as of the date of filing of the application for self-insurance plus the next subsequent calendar year. <em>If the ultimate liability of risk losses exceeds pure premium paid on payroll for those same five calendar years, the difference shall be paid by the risk to the state insurance fund. </em>If pure premium paid exceeds the ultimate liability of risk losses, then no refund of excess premium shall be made. As used in this rule, \u2018pure premium paid\u2019 means premiums actually paid under a base rating and experience rating plan, and premium due or that would have been paid under a base rating and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>experience rating plan if the employer has been participating in a retrospective rating plan. Obligations under a retrospective rating plan remain the responsibility of the employer regardless of the employer\u2019s status. <em>The same principles shall apply to cases of a merger by a self-insuring employer and a state fund employer under the self-insurer\u2019s status.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 1990-1991 Ohio Monthly Record 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Former Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B)(l) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\u201cWhere one legal entity, <em>not having coverage in the most recent experience period, </em>wholly succeeds another legal entity in the operation of a business, his or its rate shall be based on the predecessor\u2019s experience within the most recent experience period.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1979-1980 Ohio Monthly Record 4-359.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The agencies rely principally on R.C. 4123.32(D), as interpreted and applied in <em>State ex rel. Lake Erie Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 81, 578 N.E.2d 458. They argue that, for the purpose of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(M), (1) a succeeding employer is \u201csimply a transferee of a business in whole or in part,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 84, 578 N.E.2d at 460, (2) HCF\u2019s purchases represent a virtual takeover of Crestview\u2019s and Piketon\u2019s businesses, and, therefore, (3) HCF is liable for the assessed buy-out payments. We reject this argument for the reasons cited by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">R.C. 4123.32 gives BWC\u2019s administrator authority to administer the State Insurance Fund. As part of his power to collect, maintain, and disburse this fund, R.C. 4123.32(D) authorizes the BWC administrator to adopt rules establishing \u201cthe rates to be applied where one employer takes over the occupation or industry of another or where an employer first makes application for state insurance.\u201d Division (D) continues:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-9\">\u201c[T]he administrator may require that if any employer transfers his business in whole or in part or otherwise reorganizes the business, the successor in interest shall assume, in proportion to the extent of the transfer, as determined by the administrator, the employer\u2019s account and shall continue the payment of all contributions due under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">The court of appeals correctly found that R.C. 4123.32(D) is an enabling statute and does not independently impose any employer obligation. Instead, former Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(A) through (C) governed \u201cthe rate to be applied where one employer takes over the occupation or industry of another.\u201d R.C. 4123.32(D). These paragraphs explained the basic (or manual) rate at which a premium is charged and how risk coverage is transferred. Paragraphs (B)(1) through (4), in particular, established how to calculate succeeding employer premiums \u2014 a formula that depends on whether the predecessor is paying basic rate premiums or has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>a merit rating and whether the predecessor is wholly or only partially succeeded in its business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The agencies urge us to extend Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B)(1) to HCF, notwithstanding the \u201cnot having coverage\u201d clause. They argue that under <em>Lake E\u00f1e, swpr\u00e1, </em>R.C. 4123.32(D) requires only that HCF be a successor in whole or part. Thus, the rule conflicts with the statute, and the rule must yield. <em>State ex rel. Kildow v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 573, 581, 1 O.O. 235, 238, 192 N.E. 873, 876 (statutes override administrative rules whenever they conflict, and the commission is not estopped from claiming its conflicting rules invalid). Even assuming HCF\u2019s contested succession to Crestview\u2019s and Piketon\u2019s businesses, this argument does not persuade us that Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B)(l) required the claimed buy-outs.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">First, <em>Lake E\u00f1e </em>is not controlling here. <em>Lake E\u00f1e </em>involved a State Fund employer who objected to having its premium based on the poor experience of its State Fund predecessor. The court of appeals in the instant case properly recognized that <em>Lake E\u00f1e </em>had nothing at all to do with a self-insured employer\u2019s objection to a buy-out requirement. Moreover, <em>Lake Erie </em>construed R.C. 4123.32(D) as it related to Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B)(3) and (4), but not (B)(1), which is the only paragraph that contains the \u201cnot having coverage\u201d language. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 83, 578 N.E.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Second, BWC and the commission must follow their own rules as written. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 287, 288, 2 OBR 317, 319, 441 N.E.2d 829, 831. They cannot give selective effect to provisions to produce a desired result or otherwise change them without complying with the R.C. Chapter 119 rule-making procedure. <em>State ex rel. Reider\u2019s, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 242, 549 N.E.2d 532. Accordingly, the court of appeals justifiably applied the \u201cnot having coverage\u201d clause and properly rejected appellants\u2019 construction of Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-02(B)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>But our analysis does not end here. HCF must clear a second hurdle: Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(M). That rule requires a buy-out in \u201ccases of a merger by a self-insuring employer and a state fund employer under the self-insurer\u2019s status.\u201d Thus, the agencies offer an alternative argument: that HCF effectively merged with Crestview and Piketon by purchasing so much of their businesses. They again rely on <em>Lake E\u00f1e, supra, </em>asserting that Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(M) uses \u201cmerger\u201d in a broad sense, not the technical corporate sense applied to determine successor liability. We also reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In <em>Lake E\u00f1e, </em>we refused to apply common-law theories of corporate successor liability to determine when succeeding employers must assume their predecessor\u2019s experience rating. And we did not discard those principles arbitrarily. Rather, we reasoned that since R.C. 4123.32(D) itself defined a successor in interest, corporate common law was irrelevant. <em>Id., </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 83-84, 578 N.E.2d at 460-461. <em>Lake Erie, </em>therefore, provides no authority for disregarding a statutory or regulatory definition or for ascribing to a legal term some meaning that resists common understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">R.C. 4123.32(D) does not define \u201cmerger.\u201d Nor do the agencies assert that a statutory merger has occurred under R.C. Chapter 1701. Instead, their argument suggests a de facto merger. A de facto merger is the common-law method of imposing successor liability \u201cwithout an official declaration\u201d of a merger. <em>Welco Industries, Inc. v. Applied Cos. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 344, 349, 617 N.E.2d 1129, 1134. <em>Welco </em>explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">\u201cThe hallmarks of a de facto merger include (1) the continuation of the previous business activity and corporate personnel, (2) a continuity of shareholders resulting from a sale of assets in exchange for stock, (3) the immediate or rapid dissolution of the predecessor corporation, and (4) the assumption by the purchasing corporation of all liabilities and obligations ordinarily necessary to continue the predecessor\u2019s business operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 617 N.E.2d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Appellants do not cite evidence to satisfy any of these criteria. HCF continued Crestview\u2019s and Piketon\u2019s business activity, but it apparently did not retain their corporate directors or officers. Moreover, no evidence establishes an assets-for-stock exchange, arguably the <em>sine qua non </em>of a de facto merger. <em>Welco, supra, </em>at 349, 617 N.E.2d at 1134. Similarly, no evidence establishes the corporate demise of either Crestview or Piketon. The record reflects only that both corporations were in good standing with the Ohio Secretary of State at least until April 1992, and that Piketon agreed to a noncompetition clause, which implies that Piketon remained in existence. Finally, appellants cite no evidence to prove that HCF assumed any of Crestview\u2019s or Piketon\u2019s liabilities or obligations. HCF\u2019s purchases, therefore, do not represent de facto mergers. See <em>Lake Erie, supra </em>(commonality of directors, contractual agreement to retain all employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>and successor profit-sharing plan suggest that State Fund employer\u2019s purchase of predecessor\u2019s assets was more than a mere cash sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The court of appeals correctly found that HCF had no buy-out liability under the succeeding employer definition in Ohio Adm.Code 4121 \u2014 7\u201402(B)(1), and appellants have not established a merger for the purpose of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-19-03(M). Accordingly, we affirm and issue the writ of mandamus vacating the Board Subcommittee\u2019s order.
