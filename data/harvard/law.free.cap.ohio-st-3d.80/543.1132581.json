(See Appendix, <em>infra.) </em>We have carefully considered each of appellant\u2019s propositions of law and have reviewed the death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. Upon review, and for the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and uphold the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">We have held, time and again, that this court is not required to address and discuss, in opinion form, each and every proposition of law raised by the parties in a death penalty appeal. We adhere to that position today. Many of the issues raised by appellant have been addressed and rejected by this court under analogous circumstances in a number of our prior cases. Our positions on these issues have not changed. Additionally, many of appellant\u2019s arguments have been waived. Upon a careful and extensive review of the record, the governing law, and the arguments advanced by the parties, we fail to detect any errors requiring reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence. We remain absolutely convinced that appellant received a fair trial, competent legal representation, and a fair and reliable sentencing determination. We have found nothing in the record or in the arguments advanced by appellant that would, in any way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>undermine our confidence in the integrity and reliability of the trial court\u2019s findings. We address and discuss, in detail, only those issues that merit some further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Crim.R. 22 provides that \u201c[i]n serious offense cases all proceedings shall be recorded.\u201d App.R. 9(A) requires that \u201c[i]n all capital cases the trial proceedings shall include a written transcript of the record made during the trial by stenographic means.\u201d Additionally, this court has specifically held that a capital defendant is entitled to a \u201ccomplete, full, and unabridged transcript of all proceedings against him so that he may prosecute an effective appeal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Spirko v. Court of Appeals </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 13, 18, 27 OBR 432, 436, 501 N.E.2d 625, 629. However, we have never held that \u201ccomplete, full, and unabridged\u201d is synonymous with \u201cperfect.\u201d See, generally, <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 278-279, 528 N.E.2d 542, 548, and <em>State v. Spirko </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 1, 15-16, 570 N.E.2d 229, 247. Accordingly, we now hold that the requirement of a complete, full, and unabridged transcript in capital trials does not mean that the trial record must be perfect for purposes of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">In his first proposition of law, appellant contends that the record in this case is inadequate for appellate review because certain bench and chambers conferences were not recorded and made part of the trial transcript, and because no transcript was made of a jury visit to the crime scene. Therefore, appellant maintains that his convictions and death sentence must be vacated and that a new trial must be ordered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">During the years this case was on appeal to the court of appeals, appellant made an effort to complete and correct the record pursuant to App.R. 9(C) and (E). The record transmitted to the court of appeals included transcripts from certain hearings and all available transcripts covering proceedings from arraignment through sentencing. In an effort to recreate, among other things, the several bench and chambers conferences that were not recorded and transcribed, appellant requested and obtained leave to complete and supplement the record on appeal. Thereafter, appellant filed, in the court of appeals, an agreed statement of the evidence or proceedings (\u201cagreed statement\u201d) pertaining to the unrecorded bench and chambers conferences, other off-the-record discussions, and the unrecorded jury view. The agreed statement was signed by appellant\u2019s trial attorneys, appellant\u2019s appellate counsel, and the Belmont County Prosecuting Attorney. Additionally, a copy of the agreed statement was also filed with the trial court, was eventually settled and approved by entry of the trial court, and was transmitted to the court of appeals. The agreed statement summarizes what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>occurred during some of the unrecorded conferences, and identifies a few other unrecorded conferences where the recollections of the parties were insufficient to provide an accurate and detailed summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In a number of cases involving death penalty appeals, this court has clearly held that reversal of convictions and sentences on grounds of some unrecorded bench and chambers conferences, off-the-record discussions, or other unrecorded proceedings will not occur in situations where the defendant has failed to demonstrate that (1) a request was made at trial that the conferences be recorded or that objections were made to the failures to record, (2) an effort was made on appeal to comply with App.R. 9 and to reconstruct what occurred or to establish its importance, and (3) material prejudice resulted from the failure to record the proceedings at issue. See, generally, <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 481-482, 620 N.E.2d 50, 68; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 347, 581 N.E.2d 1362, 1380; <em>Spirko, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 15-16, 570 N.E.2d at 247; <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 32, 559 N.E.2d 464, 473-474; <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 41-42, 553 N.E.2d 576, 596; and <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 60-61, 549 N.E.2d 491, 501-502. In the case at bar, appellant has attempted to comply with App.R. 9 to correct the record and to reconstruct the unrecorded conferences. However, appellant has failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel ever requested recordation of the matters at issue and, most important, appellant has failed to affirmatively demonstrate any material prejudice resulting from the unrecorded matters to which he now takes exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Nevertheless, appellant suggests that because not every unrecorded bench and chambers conference could be accurately reproduced in total detail, and since no transcript exists of the jury\u2019s visit to the crime scene, he is now entitled to a presumption of prejudice arising from the failures to record. However, our cases clearly hold that prejudice will not be presumed from the mere existence of, among other things, unrecorded bench and chambers conferences in capital cases. See, <em>e.g., Grant, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 481, 620 N.E.2d at 68 (requiring a showing of prejudice from an incomplete record involving unrecorded bench and chambers conferences even where attempts had been made to complete and reconstruct the record on appeal); <em>Spirko, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 15-16, 570 N.E.2d at 247 (requiring proof of demonstrable prejudice from an incomplete record involving unrecorded bench conferences); <em>Jells, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 32, 559 N.E.2d at 473-474 (same principle); <em>Brewer, </em>48 Ohio St.3d at 60-61, 549 N.E.2d at 501-502 (rejecting presumption of prejudice from unrecorded sidebar conferences and recognizing that, in the absence of an attempt to reconstruct the substance of the remarks <em>and demonstrate prejudice, </em>the error may be considered waived); <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 41-42, 553 N.E.2d at 596 (same principle); <em>Davis, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 347, 581 N.E.2d at 1380 (same). See, also, <em>DePew, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 278-279, 528 N.E.2d at 548-549 (where transcripts contain occasional lapses due to inaudibility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>capital defendant must demonstrate prejudice resulting from the incompleteness of the record). Clearly, appellant must demonstrate the existence of some material prejudice resulting from the failures to record.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Appellant attempts to demonstrate prejudice by specifically pointing to the agreed statement and announcing that prejudice is \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cobvious.\u201d Appellant also argues that \u201cMr. Palmer was severely prejudiced because his counsel was unable to fulfill his duties to the court or raise every colorable claim for relief on appeal due to the lack of a complete record.\u201d However, such general averments do not act as a substitute for an actual showing of prejudice. See, generally, <em>DePew </em>at 279, 528 N.E.2d at 548 (allegations that information missing from the record \u201ccould be vital\u201d do not amount to the required demonstration of prejudice). Moreover, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the information contained in the agreed statement does not clearly or obviously indicate any material prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">A review of the recorded transcripts in this case reveals that most bench and chambers conferences were recorded, and that all crucial aspects of the case, such as objections to evidence and instructions, were discussed in recorded conferences. Additionally, the transcripts reveal that whenever unrecorded bench and chambers conferences did occur, defense counsel made no request on the record that they be recorded, thereby waiving the error involved. <em>Grant, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 481, 620 N.E.2d at 68. With respect to the agreed statement, the summaries suggest an absence of prejudice, not its existence. For instance, the inability of the parties, the court reporters, and the trial judge to recall certain conversations and discussions, and events that prompted certain conversations and discussions, or even the nature of some conversations and discussions, strongly indicates the relative unimportance of the matters involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The agreed statement indicates that some of the unrecorded bench and chambers conferences involved logistics issues, scheduling matters, or other issues that were later resolved. Additionally, one prospective juror was dismissed for cause due to a death in his family, and the dismissal occurred off the record. Another unrecorded conference involved a question whether one of appellant\u2019s trial attorneys knew a prospective juror, but that issue was apparently resolved. One unrecorded conference apparently involved a suggestion by the trial judge that defense and prosecuting attorneys could inquire further into some potential problems or concerns that had been expressed by certain prospective jurors. However, none of the parties or court reporters could remember the specific problems or concerns that had prompted the trial judge to make that suggestion. Another unrecorded conference involved a suspected <em>Brady </em>violation by the prosecution for failure to disclose allegedly favorable information to the defense, but defense counsel never fully pursued that issue on the record, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>agreed statement and transcripts clearly indicate that no such violation occurred. See <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The agreed statement also reveals that there was one unrecorded chambers conference in the guilt phase concerning the .22 caliber pistol included in state\u2019s exhibit 29. During the conference, defense counsel argued against the admission of the demonstrative exhibit and suggested that a limiting instruction would be insufficient if the exhibit was admitted into evidence. The various issues and arguments concerning state\u2019s exhibit 29 are also clear from the recorded transcripts in this case, and we find that the trial court did not err in admitting the exhibit into evidence with a proper limiting instruction. See discussion in Part VI, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Additionally, one of appellant\u2019s trial attorneys recalled that there was an unrecorded conference during the guilt phase where the defense allegedly raised or discussed specific objections and requests regarding the trial court\u2019s proposed jury instructions. The attorney could not recall what specific objections and requests were made, or even when the unrecorded conference occurred. Apparently, no other person involved in the trial had any similar recollection of these events. However, if the alleged off-the-record objections and requests had been considered crucial by the defense, and if those objections and requests were overruled and denied in an unrecorded conference, we have no doubt that those same objections and requests would have been raised <em>on the record </em>before the jury retired to consider its verdicts in the guilt phase. The only two objections defense counsel specifically raised <em>on the record </em>immediately prior to (and following) the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury during the guilt phase involved the absence of an instruction on the issue of self-defense and on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of aggravated murder. Appellant was entitled to neither of these two instructions. See discussion in Parts IV and V, <em>infra. </em>Moreover, we have reviewed all of the trial court\u2019s guilt-phase jury instructions and have found nothing that can reasonably be said to have adversely affected appellant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The agreed statement also indicates that there were unrecorded discussions between the parties prior to the sentencing phase of appellant\u2019s trial. The discussions apparently revolved around juror Patricia M. Jenkins and speculations that she may or may not have attended a church service wherein Reverend Bush, then a possible mitigation witness for the defense, delivered a sermon criticizing the death penalty. However, out-of-court discussions between attorneys are not \u201cproceedings\u201d and need not be recorded. In any event, we fail to see how appellant was even possibly prejudiced by the unrecorded discussions concerning Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>During oral arguments before this court, appellant took particular exception to a matter outlined in the agreed statement dealing with a pretrial motion to suppress and unrecorded discussions between the trial judge and one of appellant\u2019s defense attorneys concerning the merits of that motion. Because of the emphasis appellant has placed on this particular matter, we will address and discuss the issue in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">On September 8, 1989, appellant filed a pretrial motion to suppress the incriminating statements he had made to Deputy Hatzer at the Franklin County Jail, and the incriminating statements made to Special Deputies Busack, Taylor and Sesko at the Belmont County Jail. In a memorandum in support of the motion, appellant argued that the incriminating statements had been \u201celicited\u201d by law enforcement officers and had not been volunteered by appellant. Appellant argued that, based on <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, and its progeny, appellant should have been specifically advised by the deputies that anything appellant said to them could be.used against him at trial. According to the agreed statement, the trial judge informed defense attorney Jim Nichelson in an unrecorded discussion or discussions that the motion would be denied because of the trial judge\u2019s belief that no constitutional violation had occurred. According to the agreed statement, \u201cthe court also indicated that it would hear the Motion if it had to, but that the [sic ] there was no need to do so.\u201d Thereafter, on September 18,1989, defense counsel withdrew the motion (during a recorded motions hearing), and the trial court issued a journal entry reflecting that the motion had been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">At oral arguments before this court, counsel for appellant alleged that the events leading to the withdrawal of the pretrial motion to suppress have left this court \u201cwith absolutely no way to see what evidence might have been there to support the claims for the suppression.\u201d Counsel for appellant also suggested that because no hearing was ever conducted on the motion to suppress, there is now no way to determine whether the motion had any merit. Our response to these arguments is twofold.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">First, the language of the agreed statement indicates that the trial court did offer to conduct a hearing on the motion if a hearing on the motion was absolutely necessary. Therefore, the fact that defense counsel withdrew the motion (apparently because he knew the motion would be denied) is <em>the </em>reason no hearing on the motion occurred. If appellant\u2019s trial attorneys believed that there was any merit to the motion, we have no doubt that they would have gone forward with the motion on the record or, at the very least, would have proffered some evidence in support of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Second, a review of the recorded trial testimony of Hatzer, Busack, Taylor and Sesko demonstrates, rather convincingly, that appellant\u2019s claims of prejudice lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>merit. <em>Miranda </em>applies in situations involving custodial <em>interrogation </em>by law enforcement officials, and there is simply no suggestion from the evidence of record that <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny were violated in this case. Special Deputy Busack testified at trial that appellant began talking about the crimes while Busack was reading a book. Busack testified that \u201cI tried to keep my mind on the book, but I could not overlook the fact that he [appellant] was talking. So I would periodically listen to him and close the book for a little bit.\u201d Special Deputy Taylor also testified that he never initiated any conversation with appellant. According to Taylor, appellant talked about the crimes while Taylor was reading and studying textbooks. Special Deputy Sesko testified at trial that he had never been ordered to engage in or to initiate any conversation with appellant, and that appellant had initiated conversations concerning the murders. Accordingly, the evidence of record strongly suggests that there was no plan or involvement of law enforcement officials to elicit any information from appellant during his incarceration, and that appellant simply volunteered his story about the crimes to whoever would listen. Under these circumstances, we believe that appellant\u2019s trial counsel reasonably chose to withdraw a meritless motion to suppress. The arguments advanced by appellate counsel are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">With respect to the unrecorded jury view to which appellant now takes exception, the record is clear that the prosecution originally requested authorization for a jury view of the \u201cscene of the crime.\u201d In a motion requesting the jury view (which is contained in the record), the crime scene was described as (1) the general area surrounding County Road 2 where Vargo\u2019s body was discovered, and (2) an area seven-tenths of a mile south of that location \u201coff County Road #2, approximately 300 feet in a field.\u201d The second area referred to in the motion apparently sought to describe the general location where Sponhaltz\u2019s body and truck were discovered by police. At a recorded hearing on the motion, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated that the requested jury view was to encompass two separate scenes: \u201cCounty Road 2 and to the location where the Vargo body was, further down where the Sponhaltz body was.\u201d This statement may have resulted in some confusion, since Sponhaltz\u2019s body was only fifty feet from Vargo\u2019s body at some point during the sequence of the murders, but Sponhaltz\u2019s body was <em>also </em>later abandoned off County Road 2 approximately seven-tenths of a mile away from Vargo\u2019s body. In any event, the trial court granted the motion on the record, and defense counsel entered no objection. Defense counsel did not request recordation of the jury view, and the trial court did not order that the jury view be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The agreed statement indicates that during the unrecorded jury view, the jury was taken to certain areas that had not been requested by the prosecution and approved in advance' by the trial court. These areas included the location near Legion Road in St. Clairsville where the victims\u2019 wallets and personal effects had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>been discovered, and the Glen Robbins Road area near George Goolie\u2019s residence and near the Polish League of American Veterans Club (the \u201cPLAV Club\u201d) that Sponhaltz had visited prior to the murders. Defense counsel apparently objected to the jury\u2019s view of these areas. The jury was also taken to the area where Sponhaltz\u2019s body and truck had been discovered by police, and the agreed statement indicates that defense counsel also objected to the viewing of that area. Following the jury view, defense counsel specifically objected on the record to the jury\u2019s view of two particular areas, <em>ie., </em>the \u201cLegion Road area of St. Clairsville\u201d (where the victims\u2019 personal effects had been found), and \u201cthe Glen Robbins Road area, Pease Township\u201d (the area encompassing George Goolie\u2019s residence and the PLAV Club). The trial court overruled these objections on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Appellant argues that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to order recordation of the jury view. However, appellant has failed to demonstrate how the jury\u2019s view of the additional (but relevant) areas rises to the level of prejudice. In his brief, appellant argues that \u201c[b]ecause the record is without a transcript of the jury view, there is no indication as to what occurred and, thus, no way a meaningful review on appeal can be accomplished. Accurate restoration is impossible.\u201d We disagree. The record is more than adequate to show that the jury viewed some areas that had not been approved in advance by the trial court. Objections were made on the record to the jury\u2019s view of all or some of the areas in question. The trial court overruled the objections. We find no abuse of discretion in this regard. Additionally, the trial court specifically instructed the jury (on two separate occasions) that a jury view is not evidence. Upon a full consideration of the record and the agreed statement, we find no evidence of any prejudice resulting from the unrecorded jury view.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In this proposition, appellant also suggests that he might have been absent from certain in-chambers conferences. As to six in-chambers conferences, the agreed statement indicates that the parties or individuals interviewed for purposes of creating the agreed statement had insufficient recollection to say whether appellant was actually present for the conferences or whether he had specifically waived his right to be present. Admittedly, appellant was absent from at least one of the conferences specifically mentioned in paragraph nine of the agreed statement. However, even <em>if </em>appellant was not present for any of the conferences in question, defense counsel clearly was present to represent appellant\u2019s interests. Additionally, no timely objection was made to appellant\u2019s absence from any of the conferences listed in the agreed statement. Appellant\u2019s failure to timely object to his absences constituted a waiver of his right to be present. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 287, 6 OBR 345, 350, 452 N.E.2d 1323, 1330. Curiously, appellant advances no specific arguments concerning his alleged absences but, rather, simply states in his brief that \u201cthe record does not establish that the defendant was present during all of the critical stages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of the proceedings,\u201d and that \u201c[pjowerful inferences are easily drawn from a record which is missing such blatantly significant information.\u201d Since the inferences to which appellant refers are not readily apparent in the context of his first proposition of law, we reject appellant\u2019s \u201cpowerful inferences\u201d argument without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The court of appeals reviewed the record in this case and found it to be adequate for appellate review. The court of appeals held that \u201c[t]hough appellant\u2019s record is not absolutely complete, appellant did not request that the off-the-record proceedings be recorded, and did not demonstrate to this court how he was prejudiced by the lack of such proceedings in the record on review.\u201d Therefore, the court of appeals rejected appellant\u2019s arguments involving the incompleteness of the record. We concur in the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on this issue. Upon a careful review of the record, including the agreed statement, we find that the record in this case is quite adequate for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Accordingly, for all of the foregoing reasons, we reject appellant\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">During the guilt phase, the trial court gave the following charge to the jury concerning evidence and permissible inferences:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">\u201cEvidence may be direct or circumstantial. Direct evidence is the testimony given' by a witness who has seen or heard the facts to which he testifies. Circumstantial evidence is proof of facts or circumstances by direct evidence from which you may reasonably infer other related or connected facts which naturally and logically follow according to the common experience of mankind.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">\u201cTo infer or <em>to make an inference is to reach a reasonable conclusion of fact </em>which you may make but are not required to make <em>from other facts which you find have been established by direct evidence. </em>Whether an inference is made rests entirely with you. The view of the scene, the opening statements and the closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you but are not evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">In his second proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury concerning inferences was incomplete and erroneous. Specifically, appellant argues that the jury was improperly allowed to draw one inference from another to reach an ultimate determination of fact that appellant had specifically intended to kill his victims. Therefore, appellant urges that his aggravated murder convictions and death sentence must be reversed and that a new trial must be ordered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Initially, we note that appellant never objected on the record to the trial court\u2019s instruction on inferences. Therefore, appellant has waived all but plain error in connection with the trial court\u2019s instruction on inferences. Nevertheless, appellant urges that the alleged error was properly preserved for appellate review because the agreed statement indicates that one of appellant\u2019s defense attorneys might have made objections or requests pertaining to jury instructions during an unrecorded conference, and because trial counsel could not recall the objections or requests that were actually made. However, we find that the agreed statement falls short of preserving the alleged error involving the trial court\u2019s instruction on inferences. To properly preserve the issue, an objection should have been made on the record at the time appellant lodged objections to other aspects of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. Moreover, and in any event, regardless of whether this court invokes the plain-error analysis of Crim.R. 52(B), the harmless error analysis of Crim.R. 52(A), or any other analysis concerning the alleged error, it is clear that appellant suffered no prejudice (and, in fact, may have benefited) from the instruction at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction on inferences was insufficient and erroneous because the trial court did not also instruct the jury that an inference could not be based on another inference. However, appellant\u2019s argument that an inference cannot be based on another inference is only partially correct. As we stated in <em>Hurt v. Charles J. Rogers Tramp. Co. </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 329, 58 O.O. 122, 130 N.E.2d 820, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\u201c1. An inference based solely and entirely upon another inference, unsupported by any additional fact or another inference from other facts, is an inference on an inference and may not be indulged in by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>An inference which is based in part upon another inference and in part upon facts is a parallel inference and, if reasonable, may be indulged in by a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Here, the trial court\u2019s instruction on inferences did <em>not </em>permit the jury to make an inference based solely or entirely upon another inference. In fact, the instruction did not even go as far as it could have gone in permitting the jury to consider \u201cparallel inferences.\u201d The trial court specifically instructed the jury that inferences could be made only from <em>facts </em>the jury found to have been established by direct evidence. Thus, the instruction was somewhat narrow on the subject of inferences, which might explain why defense counsel raised no objection on the record concerning the instruction. In any event, we are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s suggestions that the jury might have based one unsubstantiated inference upon another to reach a conclusion on appellant\u2019s specific intent to kill. Appellant\u2019s theory in this regard is not supported by the language of the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury. Appellant notes, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>prosecutor made certain arguments to the jury concerning inferences. Although these arguments were made, the arguments of counsel are not evidence, and the trial court specifically instructed the jury in that regard. Additionally, the <em>trial court, </em>not the prosecuting attorney, instructs the jury on the law. We find nothing improper in the trial court\u2019s instruction on inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Moreover, we specifically reject the notion that the jury drew one impermissible inference from another to reach a conclusion that appellant specifically intended to kill his victims. The jury\u2019s findings of intent were based on the direct evidence of two bullet holes in Sponhaltz\u2019s head, one bullet hole in the left side of Vargo\u2019s head, one bullet hole in the right side of Vargo\u2019s head (with that shot having been fired from a distance of less than two feet), appellant\u2019s various admissions concerning his specific intent to kill, and the evidence concerning the type of weapon used by appellant. The fact that the trial court gave no additional instruction on inferences was of no consequence and clearly had no effect on the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Appellant also argues that \u201cthe trial court failed to instruct the jury that if an inference which supported guilt was drawn from underlying facts, the inference must be so strong so as to exclude an inference from the same facts which supported innocence.\u201d However, in <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court <em>rejected </em>the notion that evidence supporting a conviction must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of innocence. Our position on that issue has not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In his fifth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of aggravated murder. However, \u201c[e]ven though an offense may be statutorily defined as a lesser included offense of another, a charge on such lesser included offense is required only where the evidence presented at trial would reasonably support both an acquittal on the crime charged and a conviction upon the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Here, under any reasonable view of the evidence, the killing of both Sponhaltz and Vargo was purposeful. Appellant fired two shots into the left side of Sponhaltz\u2019s head. He shot Vargo in the right side and in the left side of the head, with one of the shots having been fired from point-blank range.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">At trial, appellant claimed that he did not know he was carrying the pistol until it accidentally discharged when appellant attempted to strike Sponhaltz with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>hand or fist. Appellant also claimed that he killed Sponhaltz and Vargo in the \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cmass confusion\u201d that followed the first \u201caccidental\u201d shot. However, the placement of the shots fired into Sponhaltz\u2019s head, and the paths of the projectiles through Sponhaltz\u2019s brain, clearly show the absence of any accident or mistake. Moreover, the alleged accidental shot and appellant\u2019s alleged intoxication do not even begin to explain the second shot fired into Sponhaltz\u2019s head, which was fired with unmitigated accuracy. Appellant\u2019s claims of panic and confusion are thoroughly refuted by the location and placement of the shots fired into Sponhaltz\u2019s head, and the location and placement of the shots fired into the left and into the right side of Vargo\u2019s head. Both victims were killed execution-style with a single-action revolver. The evidence concerning the type of weapon used by appellant demonstrated that the hammer mechanism had to be pulled back and cocked, and the trigger then pulled, for each round fired. Appellant\u2019s claims of accident, panic, and confusion are wholly inconsistent with the evidence. Additionally, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, no reasonable juror could have believed that these killings were the accidental byproduct of an aggravated robbery gone wrong. The number and location of the victims\u2019 wounds would lead any reasonable trier of fact to conclude that appellant acted purposefully in causing the death of each victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We find that the evidence adduced at trial could not have reasonably supported both an acquittal on aggravated murder and a conviction on the charge of involuntary manslaughter. Therefore, the trial court correctly rejected appellant\u2019s request for an involuntary manslaughter instruction. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifth proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In his sixth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of self-defense. Since self-defense is an affirmative defense, the burden of going forward with the evidence on the issue, and the burden of proof for the affirmative defense, rested entirely upon appellant. See R.C. 2901.05(A). In <em>State v. Robbins </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 74, 12 O.O.3d 84, 388 N.E.2d 755, paragraph two of the syllabus, this court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">\u201cTo establish self-defense, the following elements must be shown: (l) the slayer was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray; (2) the slayer has a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape from such danger was in the use of such force; and (3) the slayer must not have violated any duty to retreat or avoid the danger. <em>(State v. Melchior </em>[1978], 56 Ohio St.2d 15 [10 O.O.3d 8, 381 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>195], approved and followed.)\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 323, 326, 673 N.E.2d 1339, 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We find that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on the issue of self-defense. In <em>Melchior, supra, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus, this court held that \u201c[t]he proper standard for determining in a criminal case whether a defendant has successfully raised an affirmative defense under [former] R.C. 2901.05 is to inquire whether the defendant has introduced sufficient evidence, which, if believed, would raise a question in the minds of reasonable men concerning the existence of such issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Here, no reasonable jury could possibly believe that appellant used deadly force in good faith to defend himself or Hill against two unarmed men or that appellant or Hill satisfied any duty to retreat. Appellant did not produce sufficient evidence on the issue. Appellant argues, however, that he simply attempted to strike Sponhaltz, not kill him, and that the pistol accidentally discharged. Therefore, according to appellant, Sponhaltz\u2019s death resulted from appellant\u2019s proper use of nondeadly force. We find appellant\u2019s argument to be nothing short of ridiculous. The fact that appellant used deadly force is convincingly demonstrated by the two gunshot wounds to the head of each victim. Moreover, even if, as appellant suggests, he was justified in attempting to strike Sponhaltz with his fist and that the pistol appellant was carrying happened to accidentally discharge, appellant\u2019s act of firing a second shot into Sponhaltz\u2019s head, .and his act of firing two shots into Vargo\u2019s head, were certainly not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The evidence at trial was insufficient to support an instruction on self-defense, and the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on that issue. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">.VI</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Appellant\u2019s ninth proposition of law concerns the .22 caliber pistol that was admitted into evidence as a demonstrative exhibit. The circumstances surrounding the admission of that exhibit are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecution produced two weapons as state\u2019s exhibit 29, a .22 caliber pistol with the word \u201cEureka\u201d inscribed on the top of the weapon, and the .32 caliber pistol with the word \u201cDefender\u201d inscribed on top. Deputy Fred Thompson identified the two weapons as having been acquired from Mr. Fox in Martins Ferry. On cross-examination, Thompson testified that the two weapons were not the weapons used in the homicides. Thompson testified that the two pistols were offered as being similar to the type of weapon used in the murders. Thompson explained that the pistols in state\u2019s exhibit 29 had been acquired on information from Cammy Palmer that the weapon appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>had referred to in a May 15, 1989 telephone conversation with Thompson had been part of a matched set of weapons owned by Fox. Later, during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, Sheriff Thomas McCort of Belmont County testified concerning the operation of the two weapons contained in state\u2019s exhibit 29. McCort\u2019s testimony was offered to refute suggestions by the defense that Sponhaltz\u2019s murder may have been accidental. On cross-examination, McCort testified that neither weapon in state\u2019s exhibit 29 was the actual murder weapon. On redirect examination, McCort explained that the weapons had been obtained from Fox based upon information that the actual murder weapon had been part of a matched set belonging to Fox. McCort testified that Fox told police that he was missing a .22 caliber weapon from a matched set, and that the missing weapon had the word \u201cDefender\u201d inscribed on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecution sought to have state\u2019s exhibit 29 admitted into evidence. However, defense counsel argued against the admission of the exhibit, stating: \u201cThe evidence indicates these are not the weapons used; they do not, in fact, match any other weapons because our understanding is there\u2019s something about a \u2018Defender\u2019 that does not appear on the .22 caliber. Therefore, it is not a matched set of any kind, and there has been no testimony from Mr. Fox at all to link these particular weapons * * * with anything that might have been used by Mr. Palmer.\u201d On the basis of this argument, the trial court refused to admit the exhibit into evidence. However, appellant later testified on cross-examination that the .22 caliber weapon in state\u2019s exhibit 29 was \u201csimilar\u201d to the weapon used in the murders. Appellant testified that when he borrowed the murder weapon from Cammy Palmer in April 1989, Cammy told appellant that Fox \u201cowned a match to the gun.\u201d Appellant testified further that the hammer on both the murder weapon and the .22 caliber pistol in state\u2019s exhibit 29 had to be pulled back before the trigger was pulled in order to fire. Appellant also indicated that the murder weapon could not have accidentally fired without the hammer having been pulled back and cocked. After appellant testified, the state once again moved to have the .22 caliber pistol in state\u2019s exhibit 29 admitted into evidence as a demonstrative exhibit. After hearing arguments on the matter at a recorded conference, the trial court admitted the .22 caliber pistol into evidence and instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, after you were excused Tuesday, the court admitted Exhibit 29 which is the .22 revolver. As being admitted, it\u2019s being admitted for a limited purpose only. I want to explain it to you. It\u2019s being admitted because it was testified by the defendant it was similar to the gun used to kill the two victims. It is not the gun used as it is being admitted simply because it\u2019s similar, and the method of firing, by pulling back the hammer and pulling back the trigger is the same as the method that was used in the two killings. That is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>limited purpose only. You are not to consider the effort or the energy used to pull back the hammer or the energy used to pull the trigger because it may or may not be similar in force as to the actual gun. It is only for a demonstration of how the gun and what you had to do to fire the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Appellant contends that the exhibit was not properly authenticated under Evid.R. 901(A), and that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury. Therefore, appellant contends that the exhibit should have been excluded from the evidence, and that its admission into evidence requires reversal and a new trial. Appellant\u2019s arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the .22 caliber revolver into evidence as a demonstrative exhibit. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the state never claimed that the exhibit was the actual murder weapon or was anything other than a demonstrative exhibit. Thus, appellant\u2019s arguments that the exhibit was never properly authenticated as the murder weapon lacks merit. Additionally, the fact that state\u2019s exhibit 29 did not contain the actual murder weapon was made extremely clear to the jury. The prosecution claimed only that the .22 caliber revolver was a demonstrative exhibit and that it was similar to the murder weapon. According to appellant\u2019s trial testimony, the murder weapon, like the demonstrative exhibit, required that the hammer be pulled back and cocked for the weapon to fire. In this regard, the demonstrative evidence was relevant on questions such as intent, purpose, prior calculation and design, and the absence of accident or mistake. The trial court admitted the revolver only as a demonstrative exhibit and with a specific limiting instruction. Although a danger of unfair prejudice might have existed because the effort or energy needed to pull back the hammer and to pull the trigger on the state\u2019s exhibit may not have been the same level as on the actual murder weapon, that danger was entirely eliminated by the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury. We presume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction regarding the demonstrative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We find no abuse its discretion in the admission of the demonstrative exhibit. Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s ninth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">In his thirteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain his convictions on the four counts of aggravated murder, the two counts of aggravated robbery, and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specifications of aggravating circumstances premised upon aggravated robbery. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">In this proposition, appellant essentially asks us to resolve all evidentiary conflicts in his favor. However, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573. Additionally, this court \u201cmay weigh evidence only to determine whether it is of sufficient probative force to support a finding of guilt.\u201d <em>Tyler, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 33, 553 N.E.2d at 589. Thus, \u201cthe weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Appellant argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to show that he specifically intended to cause the death of each victim. However, we find that there was an abundance of evidence which, if accepted, clearly demonstrated that appellant specifically intended to kill Sponhaltz and Vargo. There is no question that appellant killed both men. Appellant has consistently admitted killing both victims ever since police first confronted appellant with the evidence placing appellant and Hill at the scene of the murders. Each victim was shot twice. There were two bullet holes in the left side of Sponhaltz\u2019s head, one bullet hole in the left side of Vargo\u2019s head, and one bullet hole in the right side of Vargo\u2019s head. The shot fired into the right side of Vargo\u2019s head had been fired from a distance of less than two feet. Evidence concerning the location and nature of the victims\u2019 wounds, standing alone or in conjunction with other evidence in the record, such as the type of weapon used to accomplish the killings, appellant\u2019s confession and his various pretrial admissions, sufficiently and overwhelmingly supported the findings of specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Next, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions on the two counts of aggravated murder charging violations of R.C. 2903.01(A). Specifically, appellant argues that the state failed to prove that he acted with \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d in causing the deaths of his victims. In <em>State v. Cotton </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 8, 10 O.O.3d 4, 381 N.E.2d 190, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court recognized that \u201c \u2018prior calculation and design\u2019 is a more stringent element than the \u2018deliberate and premeditated malice\u2019 which was required under prior law.\u201d In <em>Cotton, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus, we held that \u201c[w]here evidence adduced at trial reveals the presence of sufficient time and opportunity for the planning of an act of homicide to constitute prior calculation, and the circumstances surrounding the homicide show a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill, a finding by the trier of fact of prior calculation and design is justified.\u201d However, \u201c[instantaneous deliberation is not sufficient to constitute \u2018prior calculation and design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Recently, in <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 18-20, 676 N.E.2d 82, 88-89, we reviewed the history and meaning of the phrase \u201cprior calculation and design.\u201d We concluded, based upon a review of Ohio case law dealing with the issue, that \u201cit is not possible to formulate a bright-line test that emphatically distinguishes between the presence or absence of \u2018prior calculation and design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 676 N.E.2d at 89. In <em>Taylor, </em>Michael M. Taylor shot an acquaintance several times in the thighs and torso with a semiautomatic .9 mm pistol. Several shots had been fired while the victim was standing, and several other shots were fired after the victim fell to the floor. The k\u00f1ling occurred after a brief (two- to three-minute) argument in a bar. In <em>Taylor, </em>we determined that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the finding of prior calculation and design. <em>Id. </em>at 20-23, 676 N.E.2d at 89-91. Today, we reach a similar conclusion on the facts and circumstances of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The evidence indicates that Sponhaltz was driving in front of Hill\u2019s vehicle on County Road 2. Both vehicles drove past George Goolie\u2019s residence at the corner of County Road 2 and Glen Robbins Road. After the vehicles had passed Goolie\u2019s residence, Sponhaltz suddenly slowed down or stopped in the roadway. Hill\u2019s vehicle struck the rear of Sponhaltz\u2019s pickup truck. The record is unclear why Sponhaltz would have slowed down or stopped in the roadway. However, when appellant confessed to the murders, appellant told police that he was \u201calmost positive\u201d that Sponhaltz had purposely caused the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Following the accident, Sponhaltz and Hill got out of their vehicles and, according to appellant, Sponhaltz started an argument with Hill. Appellant then got out of Hill\u2019s car with a loaded .22 caliber single-action revolver. The evidence at trial was sufficient to show that the type of weapon used by appellant could not have been fired unless the hammer mechanism was first pulled back and cocked. Appellant conceded that the gun must have been cocked and ready to fire when he allegedly struck Sponhaltz. He also testified that he had no idea that the gun was in his hand when he got out of the car. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun was cocked and ready to fire when appellant got out of the car. Appellant claimed that he ultimately shot Sponhaltz once by mistake and a second time as a result of confusion. However, the fact that appellant got out of Hill\u2019s vehicle with a loaded pistol that was cocked and ready to fire gives rise to the inference that appellant intended to use that weapon. That inference is also independently supported by the fact that appellant shot Sponhaltz twice in the head in an execution-style killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">According to appellant\u2019s trial testimony, appellant got out of Hill\u2019s vehicle with the loaded pistol and assessed the damage to each vehicle. Meanwhile, according to appellant, Sponhaltz continued \u201cranting and raving.\u201d Appellant testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Sponhaltz then attempted to grab Hill and, when appellant swung at Sponhaltz, the pistol in appellant\u2019s hand \u201cwent off.\u201d However, the evidence at trial concerning the type of weapon used by appellant indicated that the weapon could not have discharged unless the hammer was pulled back and cocked <em>and </em>the trigger was then pulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Appellant\u2019s confession to police and his trial testimony indicate that a total of three shots may have been fired at Sponhaltz. The evidence at trial demonstrates that Sponhaltz was shot twice in the head. Thus, if three shots were fired, one of the shots obviously missed Sponhaltz, and the missed shot could have been either the first, second or the third shot fired. For each round fired, appellant had to pull back and cock the hammer mechanism, and then pull the trigger. Additionally, if three shots were fired at Sponhaltz, it is reasonable to assume that Sponhaltz was shot once while he was standing and once, after he fell to the ground or, alternatively, that appellant fired both shots into Sponhaltz\u2019s head after Sponhaltz fell to the ground. During his confession, appellant told police that he shot Sponhaltz twice after Sponhaltz fell to the ground and that he knew the shots would kill Sponhaltz. Evidence was also presented which, if believed, reveals that appellant told Special Deputy David Taylor that he shot Sponhaltz and that he then \u201cshot him again to make sure he was dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Upon a review of all the facts and circumstances surrounding Sponhaltz\u2019s death, we find that the evidence in this case was clearly sufficient for any rational trier of fact to conclude that appellant had engaged in more than a mere \u201cinstantaneous deliberation\u201d with respect to Sponhaltz\u2019s murder. The evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the state, was more than sufficient to show that appellant had adopted a plan to kill Sponhaltz prior to exiting Hill\u2019s vehicle and that, with a level of precision, appellant followed through on his calculated decision to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The evidence of prior calculation and design with respect to Vargo\u2019s murder is even more compelling. At trial, appellant claimed that after he shot Sponhaltz, he backed away from the scene, turned, and came face-to-face with Vargo. Appellant testified that, without thinking, he simply \u201cpulled the trigger\u201d and Vargo was dead. However, during his confession, appellant told police a different story. Appellant told police that after shooting Sponhaltz, appellant went back to Hill\u2019s vehicle. Hill then asked appellant to help load Sponhaltz\u2019s body into the bed of the pickup truck. While appellant and Hill were loading Sponhaltz\u2019s body into the bed of the truck, Vargo pulled up to the scene, backed up, and parked his vehicle behind Hill\u2019s vehicle. Appellant then walked to the back of Hill\u2019s vehicle and shot Vargo in the head. With respect to Vargo\u2019s murder, there was also evidence at trial which, if believed, reveals that appellant admitted killing Vargo because appellant had feared that Vargo may have witnessed the first shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Appellant\u2019s trial testimony that he backed away from Sponhaltz\u2019s body, turned, and ran directly into Vargo is also entirely inconsistent with the physical evidence at the scene of the homicides. Vargo\u2019s body was found approximately fifty feet from the location where Sponhaltz had apparently been shot. Therefore, unless appellant backed away from Sponhaltz\u2019s body for some fifty feet before he allegedly turned and ran directly into Vargo, appellant\u2019s story at trial was suspect and could have been disregarded by any rational trier of fact. Further, appellant\u2019s claim at trial that he simply \u201cpulled the trigger\u201d in order to kill Vargo was inconsistent with the evidence concerning the type of weapon appellant used to kill his victims. The evidence at trial concerning the type of weapon used by appellant would have made it impossible for him to have simply \u201cpulled the trigger\u201d to kill Vargo. Rather, appellant would have had to pull back and cock the hammer mechanism, and then pull the trigger, for each shot fired. Moreover, Vargo was shot in an execution-style manner. He was shot once in the left side of head in the temple, and once in the right side of the head in the temple. The shot fired into the right side of Vargo\u2019s head had been fired from point-blank range.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Although there may be no \u201cbright-line test\u201d that emphatically distinguishes between the presence and absence of prior calculation and design, we find that the evidence in this case, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, was more than sufficient for any reasonable jury to conclude that appellant acted with prior calculation and design in causing the death of each victim. The events giving rise to the death of each victim may have been of a short duration, but the duration of the events was quite long enough for appellant to have conceived of, adopted, and executed a calculated plan to kill each victim. The credibility of the witnesses was a matter for the jury to determine, and this jury apparently disbelieved much of appellant\u2019s trial testimony concerning the events leading up to and culminating in the death of each victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Appellant also argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for aggravated (felony) murder, aggravated robbery, and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specifications of aggravating circumstances premised on aggravated robbery because, according to appellant, he never had any intention to steal anything from either victim before the shootings. In this regard, appellant urges that the term \u201cwhile,\u201d as that term appears in R.C. 2903.01(B) and 2929.04(A)(7), requires proof that he intended to rob his victims at the time he killed them. However, in prior cases, this court has rejected any notion that R.C. 2903.01(B) and 2929.04(A)(7) require proof that the offender formed the intent to commit the pertinent underlying felony before or during the commission of the acts which resulted in the murder victim\u2019s death. See, <em>e.g., State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 576-578, 660 N.E.2d 724, 732-733, and <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 449-451, 678 N.E.2d 891, 910-912. In <em>Williams, </em>we held, \u201cNeither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>felony-murder statute nor Ohio case law requires the intent to commit a felony to precede the murder in order to find a defendant guilty of a felony-murder specification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Additionally, in <em>Williams, </em>we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cThis court has had occasion to explain the meaning of the word \u2018while\u2019 with respect to R.C. 2903.01(B), stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe term \u2018while\u2019 does not indicate * * * that the killing must occur at the same instant as the [underlying felony], or that the killing must have been caused by [it], but, rather, indicates that the killing must be directly associated with the [underlying felony] as part of one continuous occurrence * * *.\u201d * * * \u2019 <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 23, 544 N.E.2d 895, 903, quoting <em>State v. Cooper </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 163, 179-180, 6 O.O.3d 377, 386, 370 N.E.2d 725, 736.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 577, 660 N.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Here, the evidence indicates that wallets and personal effects were taken from Sponhaltz and Vargo just after they were shot. Additionally, both victims had been seen with money prior to the murders, but no money was ever found by police. A reasonable jury could have concluded that appellant played a role in the robbery of these various items. Moreover, appellant admitted during his confession that he personally took money from Sponhaltz, although he later changed his story at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Viewing the evidence in this case and the reasonable inferences to be derived therefrom in a light most favorable to the prosecution, it is clear that any rational trier of fact could have found that appellant committed the aggravated robbery<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence was sufficient to show that appellant committed a \u201ctheft offense\u201d as that term is defined in R.C. 2913.01(E)(1) (see R.C. 2913.02[A][1]) and that appellant had a deadly weapon on or about his person the entire time. R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Additionally, appellant inflicted \u201cserious physical harm\u201d within the meaning of former R.C. 2911.01(A)(2) (now found in R.C. 2911.01[A][3]), and the question whether he killed before he stole or stole before he killed is of no consequence. \u201c[T]he victim of a robbery, killed just prior to the robber\u2019s carrying off her property, is nonetheless the victim of an aggravated robbery. The victim need not be alive at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>asportation.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 284, 290, 574 N.E.2d 510, 516. Moreover, and in any event, the evidence at trial indicated that each of the victims may have been alive for a period of minutes after the shootings and, thus, they certainly could have been alive at the time of asportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The evidence was also sufficient to a support a finding that the killings were \u201cassociated with\u201d the aggravated robberies \u201cas part of one continuous occurrence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 577, 660 N.E.2d at 733. Appellant\u2019s intent to steal \u201cneed not have preceded the murderfs] for purposes of R.C. 2903.01(B) and 2929.04(A)(7),\u201d and he cannot now \u201cescape the effect of the felony-murder rule by claiming that the aggravated robbery was simply an afterthought.\u201d <em>Biros, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 451, 678 N.E.2d at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Upon a careful review of the record, we are convinced that the evidence established appellant\u2019s guilt, on all charges and specifications, beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s thirteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">In his fourteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to consider four counts of aggravated murder during the penalty phase, <em>ie., </em>two counts of aggravated murder for each victim. Appellant suggests that the prosecution should have been required to elect, before the penalty phase, which two counts of aggravated murder (one count for each killing) were to be submitted to the jury for sentencing. Appellant argues that the jury might have considered the multiple counts of aggravated murder for each killing as nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, and that the multiple counts might have \u201ccreated [an impression] in the mind of the jurors that the deaths were especially heinous because of the number of charges stemming from the deaths.\u201d However, appellant\u2019s arguments are entirely speculative and lack merit. The jury in this case was specifically instructed concerning the aggravating circumstances pertaining to each separate count of aggravated murder, and these were the only aggravating circumstances considered by the jury. Additionally, the court of appeals found that although appellant was charged with and convicted of two counts of aggravated murder for each killing, the trial court \u201cimposed only a single death penalty and, therefore, only one judgment of conviction.\u201d Since the trial court imposed only a single death penalty, we reject appellant\u2019s fourteenth proposition of law on authority of <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 78-79, 623 N.E.2d 75, 81; <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 527, 605 N.E.2d 70, 82; <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 447, 588 N.E.2d 819, 836; and <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 520 N.E.2d 568, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>In his twentieth proposition of law, appellant reminds us of the rule set forth in <em>State v. Cooey, supra, </em>46 Ohio St.3d 20, 544 N.E.2d 895, paragraph three of the syllabus: \u201cWhen a capital defendant is convicted of more than one count of aggravated murder, the penalty for each individual count must be assessed separately. Only the aggravating circumstances related to a given count may be considered in assessing the penalty for that count.\u201d Appellant argues that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury in this regard. However, we reject appellant\u2019s arguments for three reasons. First, appellant\u2019s claims of prejudicial error are, once again, purely speculative. Second, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the trial court\u2019s sentencing instructions made it very clear that the jury was to consider each count of aggravated murder separately, and that only the aggravating circumstances related to a given count were to be weighed against the mitigating factors. Third, the jury\u2019s verdict forms make it abundantly clear that the jury considered each count of aggravated murder separately, and that only the aggravating circumstances relevant to each individual count were weighed against the mitigating factors. Therefore, appellant\u2019s twentieth proposition of law lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fourteenth and twentieth propositions of law are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Appellant was found guilty of two specifications of aggravating circumstances in connection with each of the four counts of aggravated murder. The first specification common to each count of aggravated murder was based on R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and alleged that \u201cthe offense at bar was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons by the offender.\u201d The second specification common to each count of aggravated murder was based on R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and alleged that \u201cthe offense at bar was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing, aggravated robbery, and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder, or if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.\u201d Additionally, appellant was found guilty of an R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) death penalty specification in connection -with Count Six of the indictment. Count Six pertained to the aggravated (felony) murder of Vargo. The R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification in connection with that count alleged that \u201cthe offense at bar was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense committed by the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In his nineteenth proposition of law, appellant contends that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and (A)(7) specifications of aggravating circumstances in each count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of aggravated murder should have been merged prior to the penalty phase since, according to appellant, the specifications were duplicative. Appellant also suggests that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification in connection with the aggravated (felony) murder count pertaining to Vargo should have been merged with the other two specifications of aggravating' circumstances in connection with that count because, according to appellant, all three aggravating circumstances were duplicative. However, appellant did not request merger at trial and, thus, his assertions of error have been waived. Further, on the merits, appellant\u2019s arguments are not persuasive, with only one minor exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph five of the syllabus, this court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\u201cIn the penalty phase of a capital prosecution, where two or more aggravating circumstances arise from the same act or indivisible course of conduct and are thus duplicative, the duplicative aggravating circumstances will be merged for purposes of sentencing. Should this merging of aggravating circumstances take place upon appellate review of a death sentence, resentencing is not automatically required where the reviewing court independently determines that the remaining aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jury\u2019s consideration of duplicative aggravating circumstances in the penalty phase did not affect the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and (A)(7) specifications are not duplicative, since they did not arise from the same act or indivisible course of conduct. The R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification in each count arose from the commission of an aggravated robbery, whereas the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) multiple murder specification arose from the commission of another killing. Under these circumstances, no merger was required. See, generally, <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 256, 574 N.E.2d 483, 490. Additionally, on the facts of this case, we find that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification is clearly not duplicative of both of the specifications with which it was joined in Count Six of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">However, we do find that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (A)(5) specifications of aggravating circumstances in connection with Count Six arose from the same act or indivisible course of conduct, <em>ie., </em>the killing of Vargo. Thus, those two aggravating circumstances are duplicative and could have been merged prior to the penalty phase. Nevertheless, the jury\u2019s consideration of the duplicative aggravating circumstance does not warrant reversal of appellant\u2019s death sentence. By all indications, the duplicative aggravating circumstance in Count Six of the indictment had absolutely no impact on the jury\u2019s sentencing recommendation. In this regard, we note that the jury did recommend a death sentence in connection with another count of aggravated murder pertaining to Vargo (Count Four) without considering an R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification on that count during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>sentencing. Moreover, given the dearth of mitigating evidence, it is clear to us that the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial would not have been any different had the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (5) specifications of aggravating circumstances been merged prior to the penalty phase. We have reviewed the entire record and we are confident that the capital sentencing decision was not arbitrary or capricious, despite appellant\u2019s claims to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Additionally, this court can cure any error related to duplicative specifications of aggravating circumstances by merging the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (A)(5) specifications as part of our independent sentencing review. See, <em>e.g., Cook, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 527-528, 605 N.E.2d at 82-83. For purposes of our independent review, we have merged the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification into the (A)(5) specification for Vargo\u2019s death and, for each killing, we have considered only two specifications of aggravating circumstances, <em>ie., </em>the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) and (A)(7) aggravating circumstances applicable to each victim. See discussion in Part X, <em>infra. </em>Our independent review has produced no different outcome despite the merger of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) and (A)(5) aggravating circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Thus, there is no plain error, and reversal is clearly not mandated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Accordingly, we reject appellant\u2019s nineteenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Having considered appellant\u2019s propositions of law, we must now independently review the death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality. Again, we find that all specifications of aggravating circumstances of which appellant was found guilty were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">For purposes of our independent review, we have merged both counts of aggravated murder for each victim, and we have also merged the R.C. '2929.04(A)(3) specification into the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification for Vargo\u2019s death. Therefore, for each k\u00f1ling, we are left with two specifications of aggravating circumstances, <em>ie., </em>one R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) specification and one R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) specification, which are clearly shown on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">During the penalty phase, appellant presented no evidence regarding the mitigating factors set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1), (2), (3), and (6), and our review of the record reveals that these factors are inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">In mitigation, appellant presented evidence concerning his history, character, and family background. Appellant grew up without the benefit of a strong father figure. Appellant\u2019s natural father left home when appellant was an infant. During childhood and throughout high school, appellant attended church and was considered by his friends and family members to be a truthful, considerate, nonviolent, sentimental, loving, and well-behaved young man. Appellant married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Cammy Palmer in 1983 and two children were born as issue of the marriage. In 1988, appellant\u2019s marriage to Cammy ended in divorce. Appellant had great difficulties dealing with the break-up of the marriage. The evidence also indicates that appellant has a history of substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">From a review of the record, it is clear to us that appellant\u2019s childhood and his early adult life were less than ideal. However, his background appears to be no different from the background of countless other people in today\u2019s society who do not rob and kill. We find that the evidence of appellant\u2019s history, character, and family background is entitled to very little, if any, weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellant testified in mitigation and expressed remorse for having killed Sponhaltz and Vargo. Additionally, appellant consulted with Minister Keith Groves while awaiting trial in this case and, according to Groves, appellant was very remorseful. We assign this evidence some, but very modest, weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Dr. Newton L.P. Jackson, Jr., a psychologist, testified in mitigation. Dr. Jackson diagnosed appellant as suffering from a \u201cborderline personality disorder\u201d attributable, at least in part, to appellant\u2019s lack of a strong father figure during childhood. Dr. Newton testified that appellant\u2019s personality disorder made him prone to, among other things, \u201cthe expression of sudden intense bursts of anger as well as very dramatic expressions of love.\u201d He testified that appellant\u2019s personality disorder may have had something to do with the killings, but that the disorder itself did not cause appellant to kill his victims. Indeed, Jackson testified that it is common for people with borderline personality disorders to function in life without committing crimes. He also testified that the mitigating factor set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) is inapplicable in this case, meaning that at the time of the killings, appellant\u2019s psychological condition did not rise to the level of a mental disease or defect that deprived him of a substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Dr. Jackson\u2019s testimony was offered by appellant only as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) \u201cother\u201d factor. The testimony clearly does not establish the existence of an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor. We find that Jackson\u2019s testimony concerning appellant\u2019s personality disorder is entitled to some, but very minimal, weight in mitigation (R.C. 2929.04[B][7]).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) mitigating factor (youth of the offender) is only nominally satisfied by appellant\u2019s age (appellant was twenty-four years of age at the time of the offenses), and we assign this factor very little weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The record is clear that appellant lacks a significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications. Therefore, we find that this R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor is entitled to some weight. However, the signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>canee of this factor is substantially diminished since appellant, by his own admission, was a cocaine dealer from February 1989 through the date of the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">For each of these two killings, we have weighed the aggravating circumstances against the evidence presented in mitigation. For each killing, we find that the two aggravating circumstances (R.C. 2929.04[A][5] and [A][7]) easily outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Finally, we have undertaken a comparison of the sentence imposed in this case to those in which we have previously affirmed the death penalty. We have previously upheld the death sentence in cases involving murder during the course of an aggravated robbery (see, <em>e.g., Biros, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 426, 678 N.E.2d 891; <em>State v. Berry </em>[1995], 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 650 N.E.2d 433; and <em>Woodard, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 70, 623 N.E.2d 75), in cases involving multiple murders (see, <em>e.g., State v. Allard </em>[1996], 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 663 N.E.2d 1277; <em>State v. Kinley </em>[1995], 72 Ohio St.3d 491, 651 N.E.2d 419; and <em>State v. Wickline </em>[1990], 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 552 N.E.2d 913), and in cases involving robbery-murder and multiple murders (see, <em>e.g., State v. Hawkins </em>[1993], 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 612 N.E.2d 1227; and <em>State v. Montgomery </em>[1991], 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 575 N.E.2d 167). We find that appellant\u2019s death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate in comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b721-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

By judicial interpretation of the former Ohio law, murder could be premeditated even though the fatal plan was conceived and executed on the spur of the moment. * * * The section employs the phrase, \u2018prior calculation and design,\u2019 to indicate studied care in planning or analyzing the means of the crime, as well as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>scheme compassing the death of the victim. Neither the degree of care nor the length of time the offender takes to ponder the crime beforehand are critical factors in themselves, but they must amount to more than momentary deliberation.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In this case, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killings of Sponhaltz and Vargo were the product of prior calculation arid design. The murders were not the result of \u201cstudied care in planning or analyzing the means of the crime.\u201d Rather, they were the result of a spur of the moment decision by Palmer to kill two total strangers. Accordingly, I would dismiss Counts I and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">This disposition of Counts I and IV does not affect Counts III and VI, the felony-murder convictions. I join the majority opinion with respect to Counts III and VI and therefore vote to affirm the convictions and death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\"><em>\u201cProposition
