Do you know what his habits were, Mr. Miller; if so, state what they were?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. He was a very heavy drinker and was continually drinking. That is the way I would put it.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">\u201c11Q. How did he care for his wife and children and support, them?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">\u201cA. While they were living in Port Republic, I do not think he contributed to their support at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">\u201c12Q. How were they supported?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">\u201cA. By Mrs. Dinsmore.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">\u201c13Q. How did she support herself and her two children?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">\u201cA.

As I said, I don\u2019t remember exactly, but about ten or twelve years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u201c21Q. Has he ever been back to Port Republic since that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">\u201cA. Not to my knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">\u201c22Q. I believe you married Mrs. Dinsmore\u2019s sister?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-15\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">\u201cAnd further this deponent saith not.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">\u201cJohn F. Miller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">\u201cJohn I. Hamsberger, another witness on behalf of the complainant, being first duly affirmed by the commissioner, deposed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-19\">\u201cIQ. Mr. Harnsberger, state your age, residence and occupation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">\u201cA. I am sixty years of age, reside at Port Republic in this county, and a farmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">\u201c2Q. Do you know Mrs. Willie Dinsmore, the complainant, and her husband, Robert B. Dinsmore?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">\u201cA. I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">\u201c3Q. How long have you known them?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-24\">\u201cA. I knew them both before they were married. I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>known her all her life, practically, and I have known him since he first came to Port Republic, which was about twenty years ago, I expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u201c4Q. Are they now living together as man and wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u201cA. They are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201c5Q. Where did they last live together as man and wife at the time he left her?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cA. There in Port Republic, when he left her.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u201c6Q. What do you know, if anything, as to their separation; the reasons for it?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">\u201cA. I do not know any reason except he was dissipated and no-account fellow. I know that. He did not support his wife and children, and never did anything for them. With his habits, I do not see how he could have supported her and them.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">\u201c7Q. Do you know whether he had ever done anything for the support of his wife and children since he left them ?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">\u201cA. Not to my knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">\u201c8Q. You speak of his having been dissipated; in what respect was he dissipated?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">\u201cA. He was a drinking man. He would drink most anything he could get his hands on.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">\u201c9Q. How has Mrs. Dinsmore been supporting herself and her two children since her husband left her?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">\u201cA. For some years she taught school there at Port Republic, and a few years ago she was appointed postmistress there, which position she now holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">\u201c10Q. Is Mrs. Willie Dinsmore a proper person to have the care, control and custody of her two children?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">\u201cA. I think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">\u201c11Q. Is she or not an industrious person?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, she is.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-20\">\u201cBy Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">\u201c12Q. Were they living in Port Republic when he left her?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u201c13 Q. It has been stated here that that was in 1907, or about that time, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u201cA. I do not know about the date, but it has been a good many years ago. I would think about ten or perhaps twelve years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201c14Q. How long had he been living there at Port Republic before he left her?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, exactly. They had been living in West Virginia before they came to Port Republic, but I don\u2019t know exactly how long they were in Port Republic; they were there for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u201c15Q. Mrs. Dinsmore is now living in Port Republic, is she not ?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">\u201c16Q. And has been living there since her husband left her in 1907, as stated?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir; ever since he left.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">\u201cAnd further this deponent saith not.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">\u201cJohn I. Harnsberger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Upon this testimony the trial court refused to award a divorce, and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill. The reasons for the court's action are given in a memorandum accompanying the decree. From this memorandum it appears that in the judgment of the court below the instant case is controlled by the case of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>decided by this court, and reported in 120 Va. 410, 91 S. E. 180, and that the evidence cited, <em>supra, </em>measured by the \u201cwise standard established by <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker,\u201d </em>does not \u201centitle the plaintiff to a divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Each case of divorce must be decided upon the facts appearing in that case, the inquiry in such case being whether the evidence, fairly construed according to accepted principles, supports the allegations of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>The provisions of the Code (Code 1919, sec. 5103) are as follows: \u201cA divorce from the bond of matrimony may be decreed: * * * Where either party wilfully deserts or abandons the other for three years such divorce may be decreed to the party abandoned; * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The allegation of the plaintiff\u2019s bill is that the husband, Robert B. Dinsmore, \u201cdid wilfully abandon and desert the complainant.\u201d As stated, <em>supra, </em>there is no appearance for the defendant, or evidence in his behalf. The sole question presented for decision is the determination of the sufficiency of the evidence submitted to establish the allegation of wilful abandonment and desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">This court has said in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>111 Va. 525, 69 S. E. 322, that \u201cWherever there is an actual breaking off of matrimonial cohabitation, combined with the intent to desert in the mind of the offender, in such case desertion is established, long continued absence without detaining cause being the most potent means of proof of the intent to desert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">No one can read the evidence in this case without being fully satisfied of the worthlessness of the husband, of the fact of the abandonment, and its lack of justification. The desertion took place some time in 1907, and has continued to the present time without any return on the part of the defendant, communication with his wife, offer of reconciliation, or tender of support to the family which he abandoned. It is true that the wife says in one portion of her deposition that her husband abandoned her in 1912, but this was evidently an inadvertence on her part, or a mistake of the stenographer. Later in'her deposition the wife states tha,t her husband left her in the summer of 1907. In another portion of her deposition, she states that it has been twelve years since she and the husband lived together as man and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The other witnesses, without undertaking to fix the exact date of the abandonment, state that it was ten or twelve years ago. The depositions were taken in 1919, and if the abandonment occurred twelve years ago, the date of such abandonment is fixed at some point of time in 1907. Looking to the entire evidence on this point, and reasonably construing it, we have no doubt that the abandonment did take place in 1907, and not in 1912. Hence, the absence of the defendant in the instant case has been a long continued one.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">There is absolutely no evidence of a \u201cdetaining cause.\u201d But long continued absence without detaining cause is not the only evidence of the husband\u2019s intent to desert his wife. According to the testimony of the wife, her consort abandoned her with the specific accompanying statement \u201cthat he did not intend to support her or live with her any longer.\u201d Looking to the opinion in the case of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>it does not appear that the wife made any statement of her intent at the time she left her husband, nor had her abandonment at the time the depositions were, taken in that case continued for anything like the period established in the case in judgment. Summing up the evidence in the <em>Walker Case, </em>the court concluded that \u201ca separation by mutual \"consent, or because of the fault of either of the parties, might as well be inferred from the evidence submitted, as desertion by the wife.\u201d A like criticism cannot be made of the evidence in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is clearly shown that the husband was drunken and worthless, and without employment during the period that preceded the abandonment; that he failed to contribute to the support of his wife and children; that since the date of the last abandonment he has not returned or communicated with his wife, or contributed to the support of the wife and children; that he left stating that he \u201cdid not intend to support or live any longer with his wife.\u201d Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>it appears that the conduct of the wife afforded no ground, or cause, for the husband\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">According to the testimony of the witnesses, other than the complainant, the wife is a proper person to have the care of the children, is industrious and energetic, and for the past twelve years, alone and unaided, has supported herself and children by her own energy, industry and frugality.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Upon this state of facts, we have no hesitation in concluding that the plaintiff has established the charge of wilful desertion, and is entitled to a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii, </em>and the custody of the children. Indeed, we may say in the instant case, as this court said in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>117 Va. 504, 85 S. E. 475: \u201cThe uncontradicted evidence in this case abundantly shows that, without adequate cause, the defendant abandoned his wife, with the declared purpose of not returning to her; that during that time (twelve years in the instant case) he has not cohabited with her, has had no communication, has made no effort to have her resume marital relations; and has contributed nothing to her support. These facts constitute such proof of desertion, as entitle the plaintiff .to a decree of divorce fr(om the bond of matrimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The conclusion reached in the case in judgment is in no wise in conflict with the principles announced in the case of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, supra. </em>We fully agree with the statement of the opinion in that'case, that \u201cthe policy of the law is against divorce by consent, and that if the sanctity of the marriage tie is to be preserved and divorces by consent prevented, full and satisfactory evidence should be required, so that the court may determine the legal questions involved from the facts presented, and a decree for an absolute divorce for desertion should not be granted, unless the evidence proves wilful desertion without justification or excuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>No arbitrary rule is or can be established by the <em>Walker Case, </em>or any other case, as to the precise evidence in detail necessary to establish a charge of desertion. If the facts of the case under consideration establish the charge, however much those facts may differ in detail from the facts of another case, the requirements of the law are fully met.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In the case of <em>Isgett </em>v. <em>Isgett, </em>126 Va. 599, 101 S. E. 788, the trial court, upon the authority of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>refused to award a divorce. This court, reversing that decision, used the following language: \u201cThe circuit court denied the relief prayed upon the authority of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, 120 </em>Va. 410, 91 S. E. 180. We are <em>of </em>opinion, however, that the evidence sufficiently established the desertion, and that therefore the case is not controlled by the decision in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>but belongs to the class of cases, of which <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>126 Va. 256, 101 S. E. 223, and <em>Grim </em>v. <em>Grim, </em>126 Va. 245, 101 S. E. 140, are illustrations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The courts should consider the testimony in an uncontested application for a divorce with the most painstaking and scrupulous care, and if collusion or consent appears, directly or indirectly, should deny the relief sought. There is nothing to indicate either consent or collusion in the instant case. The long continued absence of the husband, his statement made at the time of his departure that he did not intend to support his wife or live with her any longer, his silence for twelve years past, his utter failure to contribute to the support of either his wife or children, are inconsistent with a,ny other conclusion than that of wilful and deliberate abandonment and desertion. The facts of some other case, of many other cases, may be insufficient to support a charge of desertion, or may be consistent with more than one conclusion, or inference, but the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>of this case, in the view of this court, irrefutably establish wilful desertion without cause, and are consistent with that inference only.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">In view of the conclusion announced, the decree of the Circuit Court of Bockingham county will be reversed, and the decree proper to have been entered in the first instance will be entered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
