Therefore, we are forced to hold that the insertion in section 532 of the Penal Code of the words \u201cwhether real or personal\u201d means nothing whatsoever, in so far as <em>real </em>property is concerned. The legislature, after the decision in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>114 Cal. 437 [46 Pac. 284], amended section 532 by inserting the words \u201cwhether real or personal,\u201d and neglected entirely in said section to make any other amendment whatsoever. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cummings, supra, </em>the supreme court stated directly, that since real estate is not the subject of larceny, the words \u201cpunishable in the same manner and to the same extent as for larceny of the money or property so obtained,\u201d are meaningless in relation to real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">This decision makes unnecessary any discussion of the other points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">A petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on July 15, 1926.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
