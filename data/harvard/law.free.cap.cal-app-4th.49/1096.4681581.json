J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOo\">Defendant James Carey Walsh appeals a judgment imposing a prison sentence after revocation of probation. Walsh contends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>court erred in not making express findings justifying the upper term and in not ordering a supplemental probation report. Walsh also seeks habeas corpus, asserting the government\u2019s failure to comply with statutory time requirements deprived the court of jurisdiction to sentence him. We grant Walsh\u2019s petition for habeas corpus and dismiss his appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">While on probation for assault with a deadly weapon plus two prison priors (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7245, subd. (a)(1), 667.5, subd. (b)), Walsh was imprisoned for another crime. The prison warden notified the probation department of Walsh\u2019s prison commitment. However, the probation department did not timely comply with statutory requirements to report such commitment to the probationary court. (\u00a7 1203.2a.) Ultimately, the court revoked Walsh\u2019s probation and sentenced him to prison. Walsh appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">During pendency of Walsh\u2019s appeal, the Supreme Court held that a probation officer\u2019s failure to comply with section 1203,2a\u2019s mandatory time requirements divested the probationary court of any remaining jurisdiction. <em>(In re Hoddinott </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 992 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 911 P.2d 1381] <em>(Hoddinott).) </em>Walsh then petitioned us for habeas corpus. We issued an order to show cause. Answering the order to show cause, the People assert Hoddinott's holding should operate prospectively only and is thus inapplicable here. However, since <em>Hoddinott </em>resolved a conflict between appellate court interpretations of section 1203.2a, its holding is not limited to prospective application. <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 24 [196 Cal.Rptr. 704, 672 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">On September 13, 1993, Walsh waved a knife at his former girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">On March 14, 1994, the People charged Walsh by information with assault with a deadly weapon. The information also alleged Walsh suffered two prison priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">On April 27, 1994, Walsh pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and admitted the two prison priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>On May 25, 1994, the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Walsh on probation for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Challenged Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">While on probation in the assault case, Walsh was convicted and sentenced to prison for 16 months in another case. On March 23, 1995, Walsh began serving his prison term in that other case at Sierra Conservation Center (Sierra).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On May 5, 1995, Walsh mailed the San Diego probation department a request for disposition of probation, waiving his rights to representation by counsel and to appear personally at the proceedings. (\u00a7 1203.2a.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">On May 14, 1995, Walsh wrote a letter to the probation department stating he was currently serving a 16-month term at Sierra.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">On May 30, 1995, Sierra\u2019s warden wrote the probation department that Walsh had been received at Sierra on March 23, 1995, under commitment to state prison, with an expected parole release date of January 19, 1996. Noting Walsh had been given probation in the assault case in May 1994, the warden\u2019s letter asked the probation department to indicate the disposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">On September 7, 1995, the superior court received notice from Walsh that he was currently imprisoned for burglary, possessing a controlled substance and battery. Walsh requested disposition of his probation, waiving his rights to representation by counsel and to appear in person at the proceedings. (\u00a7 1203.2a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">On September 12, 1995, the court revoked Walsh\u2019s probation and sentenced him in absentia to a total term of six years consisting of a four-year upper term for assault plus one year for each prison prior. The sentence was made nunc pro tunc as of May 25, 1994, and ordered to be served concurrently with any prior incomplete sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>On October 17, 1995, Walsh filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">On March 25, 1996, the Supreme Court filed its decision in <em>Hoddinott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">On April 1, 1996, Walsh petitioned us for habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On June 20, 1996, we issued an order to show cause and later held oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Citing <em>Hoddinott </em>in his petition for writ of habeas corpus, Walsh asks us to vacate the prison sentence imposed after probation revocation. Walsh contends the superior court was deprived of jurisdiction to sentence him since the probation department did not comply with the time requirements of section 1203.2a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, Walsh asserts the probation department did not notify the court of his incarceration within 30 days after receiving Sierra\u2019s warden\u2019s letter of May 30, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">A writ of habeas corpus is appropriate to vacate a sentence imposed in excess of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>(In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 750 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948]; <em>In re May </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 165, 168 [133 Cal.Rptr. 33].) Alleged noncompliance with section 1203.2a may be reviewed on petition for habeas corpus. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 171, 179 [278 Cal.Rptr. 784].)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201c[S]ection 1203.2a provides for 3 distinct jurisdictional clocks: (1) the probation officer has 30 days from the receipt of written notice of defendant\u2019s subsequent commitment within which to notify the probation-granting court (2d par.); (2) the court has 30 days from the receipt of a valid, formal request from defendant within which to impose sentence, if sentence has not previously been imposed (3d par., 4th sentence); and (3) the court has 60 days from the receipt of notice of the confinement to order execution of sentence (or make other final order) if sentence has previously been imposed (3d par., 3d sentence). Failure to comply with any one of these three time limits divests the court of any remaining jurisdiction. (5th par.)\u201d <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 999.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In <em>Hoddinott </em>the Supreme Court concluded: \u201cPursuant to the plain language of the statute, if a probation officer fails to notify the probationary court after receiving written notice of the probationer\u2019s subsequent commitment, that court loses jurisdiction to impose sentence on the original offense.\u201d (Hod<em>dinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 998.) Noting \u201c. . . this interpretation is also consistent with the statute\u2019s history of amendment and its legislative purposes[,]\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>the Supreme Court stated \u201csection 1203.2a was intended to provide a mechanism by which the probationary court could consider imposing a concurrent sentence, and to \u2018precluded inadvertent imposition of consecutive sentences by depriving the court of further jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019 when the statutory time limits are not observed. [Citation.] The statute\u2019s second and final paragraphs, interpreted according to their plain language, do serve these purposes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 999-1000.) The Supreme Court also stated: \u201cThe probation officer\u2019s 30-day reporting requirement is jurisdictional and applies once the defendant or other specified person has notified the probation officer in writing of the probationer\u2019s subsequent state prison commitment, even though the written notice may not be a valid request for absentee sentencing. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1005, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>As noted, the Supreme Court decided <em>Hoddinott </em>while Walsh\u2019s appeal was pending. Hence, as we shall explain, Hoddinott's interpretation of section 1203.2a applies here since such decision is not limited to prospective operation only.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\n<em>Hoddinott Is Not Limited to Prospective Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In <em>Hoddinott </em>the Supreme Court did not discuss the issue whether its holding was fully retroactive, partially retroactive, or prospective only. Asserting law enforcement authorities relied on earlier appellate court opinions disapproved in <em>Hoddinott, </em>the People argue for prospective application of its holding\u2014apparently to only those cases where a probation officer learns after the filing of the decision in <em>Hoddinott </em>that a probationer is imprisoned. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bustamante </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 88, 102 [177 Cal.Rptr. 576, 634 P.2d 927], abrogated on another point by constitutional amendment as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1222-1223 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 842 P.2d 1]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Edelbacher </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1003 [254 Cal.Rptr. 586, 766 P.2d l].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> \u201c \u2018As a rule, judicial decisions apply \u201cretroactively.\u201d [Citation.] Indeed, a legal system based on precedent has a built-in presumption of retroactivity.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 385, 399 [208 Cal.Rptr., 162, 690 P.2d 635].) \u201cIn determining whether a decision should be given retroactive effect, the California courts undertake first a threshold inquiry, inquiring whether the decision established new standards or a new rule of law. If it does not establish a new rule or standards, but only elucidates and enforces prior law, no question of retroactivity arises. [Citations.] Neither is there any issue of retroactivity when we resolve a conflict between lower court decisions, or address an issue not previously presented to the courts. In all such cases the ordinary assumption of retrospective operation [citations] takes full effect.\u201d <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 36-37; cited with approval <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539, 548 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826], overruled on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Malone </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 1, 25 [252 Cal.Rptr. 525, 762 P.2d 1249]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olmedo </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1085, 1091 [213 Cal.Rptr. 742]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 1001, 1009 [209 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 883].) Upon making such threshold inquiry, we conclude <em>Hoddinott </em>did not establish a new standard or rule of law to be applied prospectively only. <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 37.)  Instead, since <em>Hoddinott </em>resolved a conflict between lower court decisions, the ordinary assumption of retroactive operation applies. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pA6Y\">The People contend <em>Hoddinott </em>effected a \u201cmajor change\u201d in California law by rejecting various appellate court decisions which had construed section 1203.2a as requiring a prisoner to submit a request in strict compliance with the statute in order to trigger its mandatory time periods. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Willett </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1, 8-9 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 603]; and cases cited therein.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, there was a conflict in appellate case law more than four years before the time the probation officer learned Walsh was imprisoned in another case. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 962 [277 Cal.Rptr. 323], noting that section 1203.2a had \u201ca specific meaning that apparently was not discernible to other courts[,]\u201d the appellate court stated: \u201cA careful reading of the statute shows that it required Holt\u2019s probation officer to notify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>the court within 30 days of receiving notice from the Department of Corrections that Holt was in prison, whether or not sentence had previously been imposed.\u201d (226 Cal.App.3d at p. 965.) Hence, the appellate court concluded: \u201cOnce Holt\u2019s probation officer received notice from prison officials on September 23, 1987, that Holt was in prison, the probation officer had 30 days in which to notify the sentencing court of Holt\u2019s incarceration. The probation officer failed to so notify the court. The court therefore had no jurisdiction to sentence Holt. Holt\u2019s admission of his probation violation and its revocation by the court in 1989 were of no effect.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Como </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 604, 608-609 [123 Cal.Rptr. 86].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Willett, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th 1, relied upon by the People, the appellate court acknowledged and criticized the holding of <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 962, that \u201cthe probation officer\u2019s failure to notify the court of the defendant\u2019s imprisonment within 30 days of receiving notice caused the court to lose jurisdiction, regardless of whether sentence had been previously imposed. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Willett, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 7.) In <em>Hoddinott </em>the Supreme Court granted review expressly \u201cto resolve these conflicting interpretations of section 1203.2a.\u201d <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 996, fn. omitted.) Later, when the specific case before it became moot, the Supreme Court declined to dismiss review since \u201c[p]roper application of section 1203.2a is a recurring issue of public importance on which county probation officers and lower courts require practical guidance. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 996, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In resolving the conflicting appellate court interpretations of section 1203.2a with respect to the issue of deprivation of jurisdiction upon the probation officer\u2019s failure to comply with the statute\u2019s mandatory time requirements, a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>Hoddinott </em>cited with approval the analysis of <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 962. <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1005.) The Supreme Court rejected the \u201cerroneous interpretation\" of <em>People </em>v. <em>Willett, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th 1, as factually distinguishable and contrary to the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute. <em>(Hoddinott, supra, </em>at pp. 1002-1004.) The Supreme Court also distinguished cases relied upon in <em>Willett. (Hoddinott, supra, </em>at pp. 1004-1005.) Finally, the Supreme Court disapproved statements in those and other cases to the extent such \u201cdecisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>indicated the probation-granting court loses jurisdiction over a previously unsentenced defendant only if the court or probation officer fails to act after defendant has made a proper request for absentee sentencing . . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1005.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In sum, in <em>Hoddinott </em>the Supreme Court expressly resolved a conflict between lower court decisions. Thus, <em>Hoddinott </em>did not establish new standards or a new rule of law. Hence, the holding in <em>Hoddinott </em>is not limited to prospective operation. <em>(Donaldson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 36-37; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1700, 1709-1710 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 740]; cf. <em>Ex-Cell-O Corp. </em>v. <em>Holdener </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 25, 32 [226 Cal.Rptr. 57].) Instead, <em>Hoddinott'&amp; </em>holding may properly apply to cases not yet final at the time <em>Hoddinott </em>was decided. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1, 12 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerra, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 399-400; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valenzuela </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 381, 387 [222 Cal.Rptr. 405]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martino </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d <em>777, </em>786 [212 Cal.Rptr. 45]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Minichilli </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 660, 670 [207 Cal.Rptr. 766]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tovar </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 137, 142-143 [207 Cal.Rptr. 255].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, applying <em>Hoddinott </em>we conclude the probation department\u2019s failure to report Walsh\u2019s imprisonment to the superior court within 30 days after receiving Sierra\u2019s warden\u2019s notice of May 30, 1995, deprived the court of jurisdiction to sentence Walsh on September 12, 1995.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We need not find specific prejudice to Walsh. <em>{Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 1005.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Since the superior court exceeded its jurisdiction in sentencing Walsh, we must grant his petition for writ of habeas corpus to vacate such sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Finally, in light of our determination the superior court was divested of jurisdiction to sentence Walsh, we need not reach the issues raised in his appeal involving the court\u2019s asserted failures to make express findings justifying imposition of the upper term or to order an updated probation report.

The appellate court observed: <em>\u201cIn re Brown </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 659 [97 Cal.Rptr. 71] held the 30-day period does not begin to run until a request and waiver in compliance with section 1203.2a is received by the probation officer for transmission to the court. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 665, 667.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster </em>[(1974)] 40 Cal.App.3d 865 [115 Cal.Rptr. 572] held that although the probation officer did not report the defendant\u2019s imprisonment to the court within 30 days of being notified, the defendant\u2019s notification did not comply with section 1203.2a requirements which would allow the court to impose sentence on the defendant. Therefore, the probation officer\u2019s failure \u2018is of no significance in relation to the jurisdictional issue raised herein and furthermore resulted in absolutely no prejudice to defendant.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 871.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>[(1987)] 189 Cal.App.3d 1453 [235 Cal.Rptr. 111] held that because the defendant\u2019s letter to the probation officer was not in strict compliance with section 1203.2a, the probation officer had no duty to report the imprisonment to the court. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1455-1457.)
