We are presented with an issue of first impression as to the latter item\u2014that is, may a trial court in its discretion award successful litigants their share of the cost of unsuccessful court-ordered, but privately conducted, mediation? In the published portion of this opinion we answer this question in the affirmative. In the unpublished portion we reject appellants\u2019 claim that the award of expert witness fees was an abuse of discretion and deny respondent\u2019s request for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Plaintiff Timothy E. Gibson was injured when defendants\u2019 truck rear-ended him as he was stopped at a red light on December 19, 1992. He filed a complaint for personal injuries including damages for lost wages and future income. Liability was conceded and the only issue was the amount of damages sustained by plaintiff. On July 8, 1994, the parties attended court-ordered judicial arbitration (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1141.11),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the arbitrator awarding plaintiff $90,000. Defendants rejected that award and requested a trial de novo. (\u00a7 1141.20.) Prior to the trial de novo, on October 5, 1994, the parties attended a court-ordered mediation before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (J.A.M.S.) mediator, the Honorable Rebecca Westerfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1775.3.) That too was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">On that same day, October 5, 1994, the parties each filed statutory offers to compromise (\u00a7 998): plaintiff requesting $79,999 and defendants offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>$60,000. Both offers were rejected and the case proceeded to jury trial. On December 15, 1994, a jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $112,659. As the prevailing party, plaintiff was entitled to his costs pursuant to sections 998 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 1141.21.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Plaintiff filed a verified memorandum of costs (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 870(a)), requesting total witness fees of $8,909.48, of which $7,024.48 were for expert witness Thomas C. Thomas, Ph.D., an economist who testified as to plaintiff\u2019s past and future wage loss resulting from the accident; $100 for Filmore Rodich, M.D., whom plaintiff used as a consultant; and $1,043.75 representing costs of the court-ordered mediation. Although not specifically stated by the parties, we presume this amount reflects plaintiff\u2019s share of the mediator\u2019s fee. The memorandum of costs did not disclose the hourly rate and number of hours worked as required by the Judicial Council approved worksheet. (Judicial Council Form MC-011.)</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Defendants filed their motion to strike or tax these costs as being excessive and not properly recoverable. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 870(b).) They claimed that the expert witness fees paid to Dr. Thomas were excessive and were not limited to the \u201cactual time consumed in the examination of that witness.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) Defendants also claimed that Dr. Rodich\u2019s fees were not recoverable at all since he did not testify. Lastly, they argued that the mediation costs are not recoverable since they were not \u201creasonably related to the conduct of the litigation\u201d as required by section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2). At the hearing on the motion to tax costs, defense counsel also argued that there was no statutory authority to allow mediation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The trial court denied the motion to tax on the following grounds: (1) it found the $100 expert witness fee to Dr. Rodich was recoverable; and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>cost of mediation was found to be \u201creasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation.\u201d The court ruled that Dr. Thomas\u2019s expert witness fees were recoverable under section 998, subdivision (d), but since it could not determine the exact amount, the court continued the hearing to allow plaintiff to produce the information required by Government Code section 68092.5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Plaintiff later filed Dr. Thomas\u2019 declaration stating that his standard fee of $195 per hour was for all work, except deposition and trial testimony, and for those activities he charged $275 per hour, with a two-hour minimum. The declaration also indicated that this fee scale had been effective since January 1, 1993, and that these fees were actually charged and recovered in numerous depositions and trials conducted since that date. Two exhibits listed in the declaration appeared to have been unintentionally omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Defendants objected to this evidence, contending it was insufficient since it did not itemize how much time was spent in answering questions at trial. Plaintiff then filed an amended memorandum with the missing exhibits attached, which were two invoices. The invoice dated October 21, 1994, showed Dr. Thomas worked 7.75 hours $195/hour for a fee of $1,511.25, plus travel expenses of $29.80, for a total fee of $1,541.05. The invoice dated December 16, 1994, reflected fees for 19.25 hours $195/hour totaling $3,753.75; trial testimony of four hours $275/hour totaling $1,100; $320 for a research associate; plus $309.68 in travel and exhibit expenses for a total fee of $5,483.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">At the resumed hearing on the motion to tax costs, defense counsel objected that the unitemized statement was insufficient to sustain plaintiff\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the expert witness fees were reasonably and necessarily incurred. At the end of that hearing, the trial court granted the motion to tax the costs of $1,541.05 contained in the October 21 invoice, finding that it could not determine if this sum was double-billed in the December 16 invoice. The court denied the motion as to the remainder of the fees claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>In their appeal from the order (\u00a7 904.1, subd. (a)(2)) defendants argue: (1) the trial court erred in awarding Dr. Thomas\u2019s expert witness fees since they were not substantiated by an itemized statement detailing the actual work performed; and (2) the award of mediation costs is not authorized by any statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">I. <em>Expert Witness </em>Fees<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">II. <em>Mediation Expenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Defendants contend the court exceeded its discretionary powers in awarding costs for mediation because these costs are not statutorily authorized and were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Based on the parties\u2019 arguments, it appears the trial court awarded these fees under its discretionary authority. (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(4).) Section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(4), authorizes the trial court to exercise its discretion to award costs for items not specifically allowed nor prohibited under subdivisions (a) and (b), so long as they are \u201creasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.\u201d (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(2); see <em>Thon </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1548 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 346]; <em>Applegate </em>v. <em>St. Francis Lutheran Church </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 361, 363-364 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 436]; <em>Ladas </em>v. <em>California State Auto. Assn. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 810].)</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">An award of costs for mediation expenses is not statutorily proscribed. (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (b).) Nevertheless, defendants argue that, because the mediation statutory scheme does not expressly provide those expenses may be awarded as costs, as is the case with respect to arbitration (\u00a7 1141.21), the Legislature must have determined such expenses cannot be awarded as costs. We do not agree. Had the Legislature intended to exclude mediation expenses from items allowable as costs, it would have been a simple matter to have listed them in section 1033.5, subdivision (b), as an item which could not be awarded. In light of the general authority to award as costs \u201c[i]tems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>not mentioned in this section ... in the court\u2019s discretion\u201d (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (c)(4)), it is far more reasonable to conclude that, if the Legislature meant to exclude mediation expenses as costs, it would have done so explicitly in subdivision (b). We conclude the legislation does not foreclose an award of mediation expenses as costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Mediation, like arbitration, was created as a trial alternative to dispose of relatively small civil claims, in a \u201cfair, timely, appropriate, and cost-effective manner . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1775 [legislative findings concerning mediation; see \u00a7 1141.10 [legislative findings concerning arbitration].) In discussing the policies behind the related arbitration scheme, our courts have recognized that \u201c \u2018. . . [discouraging trial de novo is essential to the proper functioning of the judicial arbitration system. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Crampton </em>v. <em>Takegoshi </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 308, 319 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 284].) To this end, the Legislature has enacted disincentives to a trial de novo\u2014notably the imposition of significant, nonrefundable costs on the party who requests a trial de novo following arbitration, but who does not obtain a more favorable judgment. <em>(Bhullar </em>v. <em>Tayyab </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 582, 589 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 17]; \u00a7 1141.21.) Of particular relevance is subdivision (a)(iv) of section 1141.21, which authorizes recovery of \u201cthe compensation paid by the other party or parties to the arbitrator.\u201d (See <em>Cobler </em>v. <em>Stanley, Barber, Southard, Brown &amp; Associates </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 518, 533 [265 Cal.Rptr. 868] [in contractual arbitration, prevailing party entitled to recover arbitration fees as costs]; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Oscar Fisher Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 368, 382 [258 Cal.Rptr. 473] [same as to judicial arbitration].)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The same philosophy should apply to the analogous trial avoidance goal of court-ordered mediation. We note that section 1775.8 expressly provides that \u201c[t]he compensation of court-appointed mediators shall be the same as the compensation of arbitrators pursuant to Section 1141.18 . . . .\u201d As we have also noted, arbitration and mediation are mutually exclusive discrete pretrial dispute resolution techniques. (\u00a7\u00a7 1775.3,1775.4.) The interplay and corollary provisions of these mediation and judicial arbitration statutes provide persuasive grounds for treating the entitlement to their cost the same. Imposing mediation costs upon the party who refuses to settle, and who thereafter suffers a greater judgment at trial than his or her section 998 offer to compromise, operates as an incentive to settle the dispute and to avoid the cost and time occasioned by a trial. (See <em>Elrod </em>v. <em>Oregon Cummins Diesel, Inc. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 692, 698-699 [241 Cal.Rptr. 108] [\u00a7 998 encourages settlements by punishing a party who fails to accept reasonable offer from the other party].) This risk of added expense promotes the legislative scheme declared in section 1775, i.e., to reduce the judicial backlog and encourage the fair, efficient and cost-effective resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>disputes. Like the related arbitration scheme, mediation is fundamental to the conduct of litigation as it encourages the parties to settle their disputes before trial and exposes parties who fail to agree to a reasonable settlement proposal to the risk of a discretionary court determination that they should pay their opponent\u2019s share of the failed mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We recognize there are fundamental differences between arbitration and mediation. The former involves an adversarial hearing before a neutral decision maker governed by special evidentiary rules. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 1613, 1614; Knight et al\u201e Cal. Practice Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution (The Rutter Group 1995) \u00a7 4:98 et seq., pp. 4-16 to 4-21.) Mediation, on the other hand, involves \u201c. . . a process in which a neutral person or persons facilitate communication between the disputants to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 1775.1, subd. (a)(2).) Nevertheless, each is designed to provide a forum for prompt, economical resolution of civil disputes (\u00a7\u00a7 1141.10, subd. (a); 1775, subds. (a), (c)) and their differences do not suggest that disparate treatment is appropriate with regard to entitlement to costs. To the contrary, parity of treatment is strongly indicated. We hold that when an unsuccessful mediation has been court-ordered, reasonably necessary expenses incident thereto may, in the sound discretion of the trial court, be awarded after trial to a prevailing party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Whether a cost is \u201creasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation\u201d is a question of fact for the trial court, whose decision will be reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>(Applegate </em>v. <em>St. Francis Lutheran Church, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at pp. 363-364; <em>Lubetzky </em>v. <em>Friedman </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 35, 39 [278 Cal.Rptr. 706].) Defendants take a distorted, myopic view of the mediation statute in arguing that since the purpose of mediation is to <em>avoid trial, </em>the expenses incurred in mediation cannot be construed to be reasonably necessary to the <em>conduct </em>of litigation. The same could be argued about contractual or judicial arbitration which, as we have seen, may result in an award of the arbitrator\u2019s fees as costs. Indeed, the fees of a special master appointed by a trial court to \u201ccontrol discovery and to conduct settlement conferences\u201d have been awarded as costs. <em>(Winston Square Homeowner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Centex West, Inc. </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 282, 292-293 [261 Cal.Rptr. 605].) Encouraging the parties to resolve lawsuits at the earliest time and before a costly and time-consuming trial, is a necessary part of litigation as conducted in this state. The award of mediation fees is no less reasonably necessary to the conduct of litigation, than the award of arbitrator\u2019s fees affirmed in the <em>Boyd </em>decision <em>(ante, </em>p. 1208), which costs are also statutorily authorized by section 1141.21, subdivision (a)(iv). The enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>of the judicial arbitration law was seen as a necessary, efficient, and cost-effective method to speed the resolution of litigation, which goal is a legitimate function of the judicial branch. Nothing less can be said of the policy behind mediation. (\u00a7 1775, subd. (a) [\u201cThe peaceful resolution of disputes in a fair, timely, appropriate, and cost-effective manner is an essential function of the judicial branch of state government under Article VI of the California Constitution.\u201d].) Accordingly, we reject defendants\u2019 view that only those costs directly related to the preparation or the trial of a case are recoverable as being \u201creasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.\u201d This is especially true here since the mediation was court-ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">III. Sanctions<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in awarding plaintiff costs for expert witness fees and mediation expenses. The order denying defendants\u2019 motion to tax costs is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Lambden, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\"> Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First District, Division Three, assigned by the Chief Justice pursunt to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-12\"> All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-13\"> Rule 5.09C2 of the Marin County Superior Court Rules provides that \u201cThe Court shall examine and consider alternative dispute resolution programs or procedures available to the parties, including mediation, neutral case evaluation, and arbitration . . . .\u201d (See also rule 5.09.1.) We cannot explain why the parties were ordered to mediate this case. Section 1775.4 expressly prohibits mediation once the court has ordered the parties to attend a judicial arbitration hearing. Based on the limited record before us, we cannot determine the reason the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>trial court ordered mediation. At oral argument the parties conceded that they did not object to the order and believed they were compelled to follow it.
