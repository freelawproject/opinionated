Code, \u00a7 1695 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordered to pay plaintiffs Felix and Natividad Boquilon damages in the amount of $10,290.60, with prejudgment interest from October 26, 1990, plus $19,852.50 in attorney and expert fees, and $2,026.05 in court costs as authorized by section 1695.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">In the principal appeal, Beckwith contends that there was no evidence that the parties intended a \u201csale\u201d to her of the Boquilons\u2019 home and that, therefore, there could be no violation of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act. In their cross-appeal, the Boquilons argue that the trial court erred by: entering judgment in favor of Beckwith on their cause of action for fraud; finding that a codefendant, Panda Realty, was not liable for any of their damages; refusing to award exemplary damages pursuant to section 1695.7; and granting Beckwith certain credits against the judgment. The Boquilons also contend that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding only 50 percent of the amount of attorney fees they requested, on the theory that half of their attorneys\u2019 time was spent on causes of action on which they did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">We agree that the trial court improperly credited Beckwith with certain amounts paid in connection with transactions which violated the Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1703\">*1703</page-number>Equity Sales Contracts Act and that the Boquilons are, thus, entitled to additional damages in the amount of $29,273.71. However, because there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s other findings, and because we discern no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ruling on the fee award, we will affirm the judgment as modified to include a total award of $39,564.31 in \u201cactual damages.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The Boquilons purchased a home at 169 Sparrow Drive in Hercules, California, in 1979. In January 1990, Mr. Boquilon was introduced by a friend to Beckwith, who is a licensed real estate agent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the purpose of obtaining a personal loan with which to pay off his gambling debts. On January 29, 1990, Mr. Boquilon met with Beckwith in her office at Panda Realty to discuss the loan and, that day, signed a promissory note for $6,000. The note did not specify the term of the loan, and spaces for the principal sum and interest rate were left blank. Beckwith testified that she did not put an interest rate in the note because it would take too much of Mr. Boquilon\u2019s time. However, Mr. Boquilon testified that he understood he was to pay $145 per month, in interest only, on this note. Mr. Boquilon also executed a deed of trust on the Boquilons\u2019 residence, but it was never notarized or recorded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The loan proceeds were drawn on an account jointly owned by Beckwith and her husband. Mr. Boquilon made monthly payments on this first loan, with interest, until May 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">On May 16, 1990, Mr. Boquilon obtained a second personal, unsecured loan from Beckwith in the amount of $2,000. At that time, he signed an IOU prepared by Beckwith, by which he promised to repay $2,200, plus interest only on the $8,000 principal balance until October 1990 at the rate of $190.84 per month. The trial court judicially noticed that the effective rate of interest charged by Beckwith on these personal loans was 28.6 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">On September 28, 1990, the Boquilons received notice that they were in default in the amount of $6,996.90 on payments on the first mortgage on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1704\">*1704</page-number>their home held by Beneficial California, Inc. (Beneficial). At the time, the balance of the loan secured by the Beneficial mortgage was $144,000. A notice of default was recorded for $7,310.65 on September 18, 1990. Beneficial offered to refinance the loan, and Mrs. Boquilon testified that she could have borrowed money from her sister to cure the default. However, Beckwith\u2014who was aware of the notice of default, having seen a letter from Beneficial about it\u2014advised the Boquilons not to refinance through Beneficial. Beckwith told them they had been paying too much interest and could pay substantially less by refinancing through her. Apparently to that end, in early October 1990, Beckwith had the Boquilons fill out a loan application, obtained a credit report on them from Datafax,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and obtained an appraisal from Taplin, Thomas &amp; Associates, Inc. That appraisal indicated the fair market value of the house was $210,000 as of October 16, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">On October 26, 1990, the Boquilons met with Beckwith at her Panda Realty office. Mr. Boquilon told Mrs. Boquilon that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss refinancing the house. \u201cPanda Real Estate\u201d was written on the door, Beckwith\u2019s name was on her desk, and the Boquilons believed that Beckwith was at that time acting in her capacity as a real estate agent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After telling Mrs. Boquilon that Mr. Boquilon had previously borrowed $8,000, Beckwith proposed to the couple that she would make the necessary payments to cure the default with Beneficial and assist the Boquilons in refinancing their property. Beckwith further proposed that the Boquilons transfer title to her so she could refinance it in her own name at a lower interest rate than they could obtain on their own.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties agreed that, after the property had been refinanced, it would be transferred back to the Boquilons, who would then assume the new loan. Beckwith testified that she was willing to wait years to be repaid and expected that, at worst, she would have to wait seven years until the Boquilons could clear their credit after the bankruptcy. The Boquilons believed they had no choice but to accept Beckwith\u2019s proposal because she threatened to sue them on the existing promissory notes if they did not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">After the meeting at the Panda Realty Office, Beckwith drove the Boquilons to a title company to sign a grant deed conveying the property to her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1705\">*1705</page-number>as \u201ca married woman as her sole and separate property.\u201d The grant deed was recorded on October 29, 1990.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At no time did Beckwith discuss with the Boquilons the customary procedures for securing a loan by executing and recording a deed of trust, rather than a grant deed, or the difference between the two conveyances. Beckwith explained that she did not mention the possibility of executing a deed of trust instead of a grant deed because the couple had a previous foreclosure and because it \u201cwas too much bother.\u201d She also admitted that she obtained a grant deed because she was afraid Mr. Boquilon would not pay her, and she was concerned that if she used a deed of trust she herself might get foreclosed by the holder of senior security, i.\u00e9., Beneficial. Thus, it appears from her own testimony that Beckwith made a conscious decision to obtain a grant deed rather than a deed of trust to accomplish the conveyance from the Boquilons. At the time, Beckwith had never heard of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act\u2014despite the fact that the standard of practice for realtors in the area required her to know about such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">While they were at the title company on October 26, 1990, the Boquilons also signed a form lease agreement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which they understood to be for the period of time it took Beckwith to obtain a new loan on the house and transfer it back to them under an assumption of the financing. Beckwith said that the rental agreement was \u201conly for the bank\u201d while she was applying for refinancing. The monthly \u201crent\u201d was specified in the rental agreement at $2,280, even though the fair rental value at that time was only $900 to $1,000 per month.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Beckwith told the Boquilons that, once the house was refinanced, they would only have to pay her $1,400 per month. In handwritten notations added to the lease agreement after it was signed, Beckwith stated that the Boquilons, as \u201ctenant,\u201d were aware that she, the \u201cbuyer and owner,\u201d was a licensed real estate agent and that she, as the \u201cowner,\u201d had the right to sell the property if the Boquilons defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Beckwith never mentioned the amount of money the Boquilons would have to repay to redeem their property, other than the $8,000 she had loaned to Mr. Boquilon, and did not discuss what other costs, if any, might be incurred in connection with the refinancing. Nor did Beckwith tell the Boquilons anything about the procedure for assuming the new loan she was supposedly obtaining for them. Their course of dealing with Beckwith made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1706\">*1706</page-number>the Boquilons concerned that she was trying to \u201cget\u201d the property. However, Beckwith gave the Boquilons oral assurances that she was not personally interested in \u201cgetting\u201d the property as she lived in Hillsborough and was very wealthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Approximately one month after the transfer of title to Beckwith, Mrs. Boquilon called Beckwith to ask for a more precise written agreement between them as Beckwith had promised. After an angry exchange of words, Beckwith told Mrs. Boquilon, \u201cI hate to tell you this but this is my property now.\u201d When Mrs. Boquilon said she would be calling an attorney for advice, Beckwith said, \u201c[0]h you brat,\u201d and hung up the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">On November 20, 1990\u2014approximately one month after the Boquilons executed the grant deed\u2014Beckwith transferred the property to her husband and herself as joint tenants and closed escrow on a new loan of $153,750 from American Savings. Beckwith paid the following costs in connection with the refinancing with American Savings: $3,768.62 in loan fees, $703.20 for title insurance premiums, $281.25 in escrow fees, $32 for recording, $452.48 for fire insurance, $142,578.88 to pay off the principal balance of the Beneficial loan, additional interest in the amount of $1,053.55, other fees of $105, and a prepayment penalty of $7,969.18 on the Beneficial loan.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All of these costs were covered by the proceeds of the American Savings loan, except for $3,713.37 which Beckwith paid into escrow out of her own funds. Beckwith never told American Savings that she was not the true owner of the property when she applied for the new loan. After the property was refinanced, Beckwith reduced the Boquilons* monthly payments to her to $1,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">In order to get some cash out of the property to repay herself for the loans she had made to Mr. Boquilon, Beckwith refinanced the property again. She paid an amount exceeding $1,000 in costs in connection with this second refinancing. The total additional costs incurred by Beckwith and added to the loan balance as a result of the two separate refinancings were $15,014.88. Beckwith admitted she never gave the Boquilons any estimate of closing costs, which is normally done by financial institutions that make loans to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">On December 17,1990, Beckwith met with the Boquilons in her office for the stated purpose of \u201cgiving them their property back.\u201d Instead, at Beck-with\u2019s insistence, the parties signed a handwritten note prepared by Beck-with stating that Beckwith, as the \u201cowner of [the] property,\u201d would sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1707\">*1707</page-number>property and the balance would be paid to the Boquilons, as the \u201ctenant,\u201d after Beckwith had paid \u201call expenses from all escrows from title company,\u201d including the loan from Beneficial. The Boquilons testified that they never agreed to Beckwith\u2019s plan to sell their house and signed the note under duress because it was the only way they would be able to get any money out of their property now that Beckwith owned it and they had no written documents to prove their interest in the property. There was no discussion of a sale price or any other terms of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">In May 1991, Beckwith told the Boquilons that their property had been sold and that they would have to pay a reduced amount of rent to the new owner. The Boquilons asked for their equity, but Beckwith said there was no equity. The Boquilons then went to a lawyer for advice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When Beckwith found this out, she begged the Boquilons not to involve a lawyer and assured them that, if they would stop seeing the attorney, she would handle the transaction fairly and put off the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">On July 22, 1991, the Boquilons received a letter from Beckwith stating that the property had been sold to Rolando and Fe Flores. On August 15, 1991, the Boquilons were served by Beckwith with a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. On September 13, 1991, Mrs. Boquilon wrote to Beckwith, pleading: \u201cI want my property . . . back[,] let me assume your loan like you promise to us.\u201d The Boquilons and their three children were eventually evicted from their home of 15 years and, on October 21, 1991, judgment for possession and damages in the amount of $4,120 was entered in favor of Beckwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">On March 6, 1992, Beckwith closed a sale of the property to Reynaldo C. and Ester V. Frias for $194,000. Beckwith claimed a commission of $2,910 on the sale even though she was the seller and had given an exclusive listing to another realtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">The Boquilons filed their complaint on July 8, 1992, naming Beckwith and Panda Realty as defendants and alleging causes of action for fraud, breach of contract, and violation of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act. Beckwith cross-complained, and the case proceeded to a bench trial on March 7, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">The court issued a tentative decision on March 31, 1994, finding that Beckwith violated the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act; that the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1708\">*1708</page-number>transfer was October 26, 1990; that the property was worth $210,000 at the time of the transfer; and that plaintiffs were entitled to prejudgment interest and attorney fees. However, the court found against plaintiffs on the fraud causes of action, on the exemplary damages claim under the act, and on the claim that Beckwith\u2019s actions were \u201cunconscionable\u201d within the meaning of section 1695.13. Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201c[T]he Court finds no violation of Paragraph 3 of Subdivision B of Section 1695.6. Clearly, the encumbrance by American Savings was done with the knowledge, consent and agreement of the Boquilon\u2019s. [*fl] The Court further finds that Defendant\u2019s motive was not to take unconscionable advantage of the Plaintiffs in this situation. The Court finds that she acted out of a motivation to help a friend and that the primary factor in this whole transaction was the Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to make payments to Ms. Beckwith consistent with their agreements. [H Both Mr. and Mrs. Boquilon testified that they understood that Ms. Beckwith was to be paid-off and they had to assume the loan to get title back. Ms. Beckwith\u2019s testimony was that she was prepared to give them up to seven years to make those payments\u2014a period of time [in] which their credit would be cleared from the bankruptcy and foreclosure. None of that can be construed as bad faith or unconscionability on Ms. Beckwith\u2019s part.\u201d In computing damages, the court granted credits against the appraised value for: payoff of the Beneficial mortgage ($152,926); closing costs related to the eventual sale of the property by Beckwith ($10,585.15); the principal balance of the loans Beckwith made to Mr. Boquilon ($8,000); and past-due rent under the rental agreement ($6,070.00). After deducting these amounts, and giving the Boquilons credit for $9,250 in payments to Beckwith, the Boquilons were left with a tentative net damages award of $15,230, plus prejudgment interest from October 26, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">After the parties filed objections to the tentative decision, the trial court amended its decision to allow additional credits in favor of Beckwith, as follows: $6,671 for a payment she made to Beneficial on October 30, 1990, to cure the Boquilons\u2019 default; $1,706.21 Beckwith paid Beneficial on November 15, 1990; an additional month\u2019s rent at the monthly rental rate of $2,280; and refinancing \u201cescrow costs\u201d of $1,895.19, $3,713.37, and $452.48 (a total of $6,061.04) associated with the refinancing. Plaintiffs, too, received an additional credit for rent paid in the amount of $3,750. Final judgment for plaintiffs was entered on June 22, 1994, in the sum of $10,290.60, plus interest from October 26, 1990. Plaintiffs were subsequently awarded $19,852.50 in attorney fees, but this was only half the amount they had sought. The trial court reasoned that the attorney fees were allocated 50-50 between the fraud cause of action, on which plaintiffs did not prevail, and the statutory cause of action, on which they did prevail. These timely cross-appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1709\">*1709</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The Home Equity Sales Contracts Act (hereinafter, sometimes, the Act) was enacted to protect homeowners who are faced with foreclosure proceedings and may find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous individuals who \u201cinduce homeowners to sell their homes for a small fraction of their fair market values through the use of schemes which often involve oral and written misrepresentations, deceit, intimidation, and other unreasonable commercial practices.\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of course, the Legislature did not prohibit the sale of distressed properties to such individuals, but did establish a number of procedural protections and mandatory preconditions to such sales. Thus, the Legislature declared that the \u201cintent and purposes\u201d of the Act are: \u201cTo provide each homeowner with information necessary to make an informed and intelligent decision regarding the sale of his or her home to an equity purchaser; to require that the sales agreement be expressed in writing; to safeguard the public against deceit and financial hardship; to insure, foster, and encourage fair dealing in the sale and purchase of homes in foreclosure; to prohibit representations that tend to mislead; to prohibit or restrict unfair contract terms; to afford homeowners a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to rescind sales to equity purchasers; and to preserve and protect home equities for homeowners of this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(1).) The Legislature further declared that the Act \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate this intent and to achieve these purposes.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">In <em>Segura </em>v. <em>McBride </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1028 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 436] <em>(Segura), </em>Division Four of this court explained the basic structure of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act: \u201c[T]he Act seeks to regulate transactions between an equity purchaser and an equity seller resulting in the sale of residential real property in foreclosure.<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark> At the heart of the scheme is the requirement that the agreement between buyer and seller be in writing, with specific terms aimed at protecting the homeowner. (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.2, 1695.3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1710\">*1710</page-number>1695.5.) The contract must include the total consideration given, terms of payment and terms of any rental agreement; a conspicuous statement of the right to cancel within five business days or until 8 a.m. on the day scheduled for foreclosure, with an attached notice of cancellation; and a conspicuous notice that until the right to cancel has ended, the equity purchaser cannot ask the seller to sign a deed or any other documents. (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.3-1695.5.) The equity purchaser must provide, and complete, the contract in conformity with these terms. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (a).) [ffl During the \u2018cooling off\u2019 period, the equity purchaser cannot take title to the property by written instrument or recordation thereof; transfer or encumber any interest in the property; or pay the seller any consideration. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (b).) Moreover, the purchaser cannot make untrue or misleading statements about the value of the property, any foreclosure proceeds, or the terms of sale. (\u00a7 1695.5, subd. (d).) Additionally, when the seller grants the residence by an instrument purporting to be an absolute conveyance but reserves or is given an option to repurchase, the equity purchaser cannot grant any interest in the property to another without the written consent of the seller. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (e).) Finally, it is unlawful to take unconscionable advantage of the property owner in foreclosure. (\u00a7 1695.13.) Depending on the nature of the violation, the aggrieved seller may be entitled to rescission, other equitable relief or damages, including exemplary damages. (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.7, 1695.14.)\u201d <em>(Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1035-1036, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">A. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Beckwith Violated the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Beckwith contends that there was no \u201csale\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 home for purposes of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act and that, therefore, she cannot be held liable for a violation of the statute. More specifically, Beckwith contends that the Boquilons were not \u201cequity sellers\u201d within the meaning of section 1695.1, subdivision (c), because they never intended to sell their house, but only to transfer \u201cbare legal title\u201d to her \u201csolely for purposes of refinancing.\u201d These arguments are utterly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">1. <em>Beckwith Violated Section 1695.6, Subdivisions (a) and (e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">With or without a \u201csale\u201d\u2014at least as Beckwith defines that term\u2014there is in this case ample evidence to support at least two separate violations of the Act. This case is on all fours with <em>Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1028. In that case, plaintiff Segura purchased a home in Femdale from a couple, the Dilleshaws, who took back a note and deed of trust for the balance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1711\">*1711</page-number>sale price over the down payment. Segura also had a loan on his truck from the Bank of Loleta (Bank), and that Bank eventually assumed collection of the payments on the Dilleshaw note. In early 1982, Segura fell behind on his house and truck payments, so he took out an additional loan from the Bank, which secured the new loan with a second deed of trust. Subsequently, Segura defaulted on that obligation, and the Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings in July 1982. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1031-1032.) At that point, Segura approached defendant Dorothy McBride, whom he considered to be \u201clike \u2018family,\u2019 \u201d to discuss his financial predicament. Thereafter, Segura met with the manager of the Bank to say that he would try to cure the default and that McBride might be willing to assist. In November 1992, after the Bank manager had discussed the matter with McBride, the plaintiff and defendant McBride attended a meeting at the Bank at which Segura signed a grant deed conveying all of his property to McBride. In return, McBride made payments to retire the Bank loan on Segura\u2019s property, assumed the Dilleshaw obligation, and brought his taxes up to date. Thereafter, McBride made monthly payments of $180 on the Dilleshaw note, paid the taxes and insurance premiums, and charged Segura $200 a month to live in the house. Both parties expected that McBride would transfer title back to Segura in a short period of time, but disagreed about the conditions under which such a transfer would occur. Within a few months, Segura fell behind in his rent payments and McBride\u2019s bookkeeper warned him that if he did not make regular payments, McBride would have to resell the property. In November 1984, McBride conveyed an undivided one-third interest in the property to her son (Jon McBride), her granddaughter, and herself, and transferred her remaining interest to the granddaughter in June 1985. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1032.) Jon assumed responsibility for all payments on the house, and began charging Segura $350 per month to live there. After receiving only one such payment, Jon began unlawful detainer proceedings and Segura eventually left the premises voluntarily. In May 1985, Segura tendered $15,000 to \u201c \u2018buy [his] property back,\u2019 \u201d but the tender was refused. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1032-1033.) Jon and his daughter completed a sale of the property in 1988. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1033.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">On appeal, McBride contended that she was not an \u201cequity purchaser\u201d within the meaning of the Act because \u201c. . . when the Legislature enacted the above described protective scheme, it was concerned with individuals engaged in the business of purchasing equities, who solicited equity refinancing as a business practice.\u201d <em>(Segura, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1036.) Her transaction with the plaintiff, by contrast, was an \u201cisolated buy[]\u201d and she was \u201cneither soliciting nor in the business of equity purchasing.\u201d In response to that argument, the court held: \u201c[E]xcept for certain persons specifically exempted from regulation, the Act applies to <em>all </em>persons who purchase a residence subject to an outstanding notice of default, regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1712\">*1712</page-number>of whether the purchaser routinely engages in such transactions, and regardless of whether the distressed buyer initiates the negotiations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1031.) Then, looking at the particular facts of the case before it, the <em>Segura </em>court explained how McBride\u2019s conduct violated the Act: \u201cMcBride was an equity purchaser not because she was an unscrupulous person engaged in the business of buying home equities at a discount, but because she acquired title to Segura\u2019s residence while that residence was in foreclosure. Segura did not receive one penny for his equity, and eventually McBride\u2019s son was able to turn a handsome profit on the property. There was an understanding that Segura retained a right to reacquire title to the property, whether under conditions (McBride\u2019s story) or not (Segura\u2019s story), yet McBride conveyed the property summarily without notifying Segura. Her son then upped the \u2018rent,\u2019 refused Segura\u2019s tender and eventually precipitated his vacating the premises. Segura lost his home and his equity based on agreements and understandings that were never reduced to writing. <em>This the very situation which the Act intends to prevent. </em>Ffl] Segura was entitled to damages because McBride did not satisfy the statutory mandates. She did not offer him a written contract, with appropriate terms, notices and disclosures. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (a).) Although she claimed he had a right to repurchase the property if he performed by paying rent and coming up with funds to cash her out, this repurchase right was never reduced to writing and she granted an interest in the property to her son and granddaughter without Segura\u2019s consent. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (e).)\u201d <em>(Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1037-1038, italics added.) Because of these violations by McBride, Segura was entitled to recover his \u201cactual damages.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Beckwith violated the Act in precisely the same ways. First, she \u201cacquired title to [the plaintiffs\u2019] residence while that residence was in foreclosure,\u201d without a written contract, without a clearly delineated \u201ccooling off\u2019 period, and without the appropriate notices and disclosures, all in violation of section 1695.6, subdivision (a). (Cf. <em>Segura, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1037-1038.) Then, by a conveyance that appears on its face to be \u201cabsolute,\u201d but as to which there was an \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the plaintiffs \u201cretained a right to reacquire title,\u201d Beckwith granted an interest to her husband and placed an encumbrance on the property (in favor of American Savings) without the Boquilons\u2019 specific written consent, in violation of section 1695.6, subdivision (e). (Cf. <em>Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1037-1039.) These violations of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act are clearly sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s judgment on the Boquilons\u2019 statutory cause of action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1713\">*1713</page-number>2. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Beckwith Did Not Violate Section 1695.6, Subdivision (b)(3).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">It is, however, less clear there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings that the conveyance from Beckwith to her husband, the refinancing with American Savings and the subsequent sale to the Friases, did not violate section 1695.6, subdivision (b)(3), and that the Boquilons were not, therefore, entitled to a mandatory award of exemplary damages under section 1695.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">In its statement of decision, the trial court reasoned that \u201cthe encumbrance by American Savings was done with the knowledge, consent and agreement of the Boquilons.\u201d The Boquilons do not dispute that there is evidence they knowingly agreed and consented to Beckwith\u2019s plan to refinance with American Savings, but argue that exemplary damages must nevertheless be awarded because Beckwith transferred an interest in the property to her husband and encumbered the property before \u201cthe time within which the equity seller may cancel the transaction [had] fully elapsed.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">We disagree with the Boquilons\u2019 analysis, which would greatly expand the coverage of the mandatory exemplary damages provision beyond what was intended by the Legislature. Section 1695.6, subdivision (b)(3) applies to the situation where an equity purchaser has given the notices required by the Act but, nevertheless, proceeds to transfer or encumber the property within the statutory cancellation period. (See <em>Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1035 [\u201cDuring the \u2018cooling off\u2019 period, the equity purchaser cannot take title to the property by written instrument or recordation thereof; transfer or encumber any interest in the property; or pay the seller any consideration. (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (b).)\u201d].) That is, of course, not what happened here.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As we have discussed, the factual scenario presented in this case falls squarely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1714\">*1714</page-number>within the ambit of section 1695.6, subdivision (e).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That subdivision imposes <em>liability </em>on an equity purchaser who \u201cpurports to hold title as a result of any transaction in which the equity seller grants the residence in foreclosure by any instrument which purports to be an absolute conveyance[,] and reserves or is given by the equity purchaser an option to repurchase such residence\u201d <em>{ibid.) </em>and who thereafter transfers the property to a third party or places an encumbrance on the property (\u00a7 1695.7), but it does not form the basis of a mandatory award of statutory treble damages <em>{ibid.), </em>unless the element of \u201cunconscionable advantage\u201d is present (\u00a7 1695.13).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">While it is not absolutely clear why the Legislature would differentiate between these two types of equity purchasers for purposes of an exemplary damages award, it is not irrational to treat one who goes through the motions of honoring their statutory commitments, then flouts the law, as more culpable than one who, like Beckwith (despite her status as a real estate professional), is ignorant of the law\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is also reasonable to believe that the Legislature considered the factual circumstances of this case would be quite common, i.e., that the equity purchaser and seller would start out as friends, intent upon the seller recovering title at some early date, but that the relationship would deteriorate to the point that the equity purchaser would feel compelled to resell or refinance the property to cut her losses. In such a case, and contrary to the suggestion of our dissenting colleague, the Legislature rationally could have concluded that the protections afforded by the notice and cancellation provisions were less important\u2014and the violation of those provisions less serious\u2014because the parties to an \u201coption to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1715\">*1715</page-number>repurchase\u201d would have an ongoing relationship, and the equity sellers would have the right to \u201ccancel\u201d the deal and recover their equity interest, for a much longer period than provided in section 1695.4.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">By contrast, the Boquilons\u2019\u2014and the dissent\u2019s\u2014reading of section 1695.6, subdivision (b)(3), would <em>require </em>an award of treble damages in every case in which an innocent and ignorant equity purchaser failed to provide a written contract or to fulfill completely the other technical requirements of the Act, then proceeded to deal with the property as the new owner by encumbering or transferring any interest in it. Surely, such an expansive exemplary damages provision was not intended by the Legislature. (See \u00a7 1695.7.) We conclude that the Legislature intended to mandate exemplary damages only in the exceptional, not the ordinary case, and only in those cases where the violation of the Act was knowing and intentional.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">The Boquilons further contend that Beckwith is liable for treble damages under section 1695.7 because she resold the property to the Friases in violation of section 1695.6, subdivision (b)(3). We disagree. Again, section 1695.6, subdivision (e), applies to this transaction, and it is unclear whether even that section was violated because there is evidence in the record that Beckwith obtained a written \u201cconsent\u201d from the Boquilons to solicit and complete such a sale, and then notified the Boquilons in writing of the proposed sale to the Friases. (See \u00a7 1695.6, subd. (e).) However, there is also evidence that the \u201cconsent\u201d was invalid because it was obtained in circumstances amounting to economic duress\u2014a situation that would not have existed but for Beckwith\u2019s violations of the Act. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1695, 1689, subd. (b)(1).) By the time they \u201cconsented,\u201d moreover, the other more technical violations of the Act had taken their toll on the Boquilons\u2019 equity interest. Beckwith had obtained title to the property, subject only to the American Savings first mortgage, and was free to dispose of it. The Boquilons had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1716\">*1716</page-number>documentation with which to dispute her ownership interest, or to establish their \u201coption\u201d to repurchase the property. Short of filing this lawsuit, there was nothing they could do to prevent Beckwith from dealing with the property, as she did as the legal \u201cowner,\u201d without regard to their equity interest.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nevertheless, given the conflicting evidence on this point, we find no error in the refusal of the trial court to award treble damages based on the resale of the property to the Friases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">3. <em>The Boquilons Are Entitled to Recover Their Actual Damages for the Established Violations of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Beckwith concedes that she violated section 1695.6, subdivision (a), in that there was no \u201cwriting\u201d as required by that provision. She contends, however, that the Boquilons were not harmed by this \u201ctechnical violation\u201d of the Act. Beckwith is wrong. The statute requires more than a mere \u201cwriting.\u201d It requires written explication of the financial terms of the parties\u2019 agreement including the total consideration given, terms of payment, and \u201cany services of any nature which the equity purchaser represents he will perform for the equity seller before or after the sale.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.3, subds. (c), (d).) It also requires \u201ca conspicuous statement of the right to cancel within five business days or until 8 a.m. on the day scheduled for foreclosure, with an attached notice of cancellation; and a conspicuous notice that until the right to cancel has ended, the equity purchaser cannot ask the seller to sign a deed or any other documents.\u201d (Segura, <em>supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1035, citing \u00a7\u00a7 1695.3-1695.5) Had the Boquilons had the benefit of these written notices, they may well have been alerted to the need for and obtained consultation with an attorney earlier in their dealings with Beckwith, rejected Beckwith\u2019s plan to refinance in favor of a private loan from Mrs. Boquilon\u2019s sister to cure the default, or pursued a more favorable arrangement with Beneficial that might have increased their monthly outlay but allowed them to retain title to the home in which they had approximately $66,000 worth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>equity.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, by simply granting their property to Beckwith outright without the benefit of the disclosures and \u201ccooling off\u201d period prescribed by the statute (thereby enabling Beckwith to encumber and resell the property to a third party), the Boquilons\u2014just like Segura\u2014ultimately \u201clost [their] home and [their] equity based on agreements and understandings that were never reduced to writing. <em>This is the very situation which the Act intends to prevent.\" </em>(5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1038, italics added.) Accordingly, Beckwith may be held to answer in damages for the established violations of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act. (\u00a7 1695.7.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">B. <em>The Computation of Damages Must be Modified to Reflect the Boquilons\u2019 Loss of Equity as of the Date of the Violation of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act, With Offsets Only for Those Expenses That Would Have Been Incurred Independent of the Violations of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">The <em>Segura </em>court also provided some guidance on the calculation of damages for a violation of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act, holding that \u201cdamages based on the homeowner\u2019s lost equity should be assessed as of the date of the violation.\u201d (5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1038.) In that case, the court found that Segura \u201clost his equity\u201d in 1982, when he transferred his property to McBride. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1038, fn. 11.) Here, the trial court found that the first violation of the statute occurred when the Boquilons executed a grant deed in favor of Beckwith on October 26, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">Beckwith raises only one claim of error with respect to the award of damages, i.e., that she is entitled to an additional credit for a commission on the resale of the subject property to the Friases. We disagree. As the new \u201cowner\u201d of the property, Beckwith gave an exclusive listing to another real estate brokerage, Red Carpet Elite Realty, with the understanding that the standard 6 percent commission would be split 50-50 between the listing and selling agent. The trial court found that a commission of $11,640 was paid, but declined to credit Beckwith with $2,910 she personally received from the proceeds of the sale. In essence, then, the trial court ordered Beckwith to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1718\">*1718</page-number>return this sum to the Boquilons. We will not disturb this portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment. Beckwith obtained the apparent right to resell the Boquilons\u2019 property through a violation of the Act. The trial court did not err in concluding that she should not be allowed to profit from that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">For their part, the Boquilons argue that the trial court improperly gave Beckwith certain credits against the full amount of equity they had in their home as of October 26, 1990. Specifically, they contend that Beckwith received undue credits for certain costs incurred after the date of transfer, including: (1) the amount of \u201crent\u201d over and above the fair rental value, or above the agreed amounts for the period from October 26, 1990, through April 30, 1991 (at the rate of $2,280 per month) and from May 1, 1991, through the eviction in October 1991 (at the rate of $1,800 per month); (2) $10,347.52 (including the $7,969.18 in prepayment penalties), which was the amount of the Beneficial payoff of $152,926.40 in excess of the principal balance of the loan ($142,578.88) as of November 26, 1990, and $6,061.04 in additional \u201cescrow costs\u201d awarded after the parties filed objections to the trial court\u2019s tentative statement of decision; (3) $2,273.34 in interest paid on the Beneficial loan for the period November 16 to December 27, 1990, which amount was credited to Beckwith in the closing of escrow on the refinancing from American Savings, and which she also claimed as a component of the $2,280 \u201crent\u201d payments that were due during that period; and (4) $10,585.15 in closing costs incurred in connection with the sale to the Friases in March 1992 (after deducting Beckwith\u2019s share of the commission paid from the sale proceeds). We will address each of these claims of error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">While the Boquilons may have been overcharged for \u201crent,\u201d we cannot agree that they were entitled to live rent-free for over a year in the house to which Beckwith had obtained title, even though she did so through various violations of the Act. Moreover, with one limited exception, we find that the Boquilons have failed to carry their burden of demonstrating error in the trial court\u2019s calculation of the \u201crent\u201d credit. The trial court computed the Boquilons\u2019 \u201crent\u201d obligation based on a written agreement to pay $2,280 per month for the six-month period from October 26, 1990, through April 30, 1991, plus $1,800 per month for the six-month period from May 1, 1991, through October 1991. But that agreement was undisputedly designed to cover <em>both </em>the housing costs and payments on Mr. Boquilon\u2019s gambling loans. Beckwith\u2019s violations of the Act did not, after all, absolve the Boquilons of their obligation to repay, with interest, the $8,000 in personal loans she extended to cover Mr. Boquilon\u2019s gambling debts. And while the interest rates Beckwith charged were excessive, the Boquilons did not establish any other cause of action that would allow them to avoid repayment of those loans on the stated terms. The combined rent/gambling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1719\">*1719</page-number>obligation thus totaled $24,480 for the period from October 26, 1990, through the end of October 1991. The trial court reduced that amount by $13,000 for payments the Boquilons made during that period, and the Boquilons have not demonstrated that they actually paid more than that.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But the court also gave Beckwith an additional credit for a seventh month of rent at the rate of $2,280. We, therefore, conclude that the Boquilons are entitled to an additional $2,280 in damages to correct this error in the computation of the \u201crent\u201d offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">We also agree that Beckwith should not have been credited with the $7,969.18 in prepayment penalties paid to Beneficial, or the other costs incurred in connection with the American Savings refinancing. This sum of $10,347.52 should not have been charged to the Boquilons because they did not consent in writing to that transaction, as required by section 1695.6, subdivision (e). The $6,061.04 in additional \u201cescrow costs\u201d credited to Beckwith after the parties filed their objections to the tentative decision was, likewise, improperly deducted from the Boquilons\u2019 equity. Similarly, the $10,585.15 in closing costs incurred upon resale of the property should not have been deducted from the Boquilons\u2019 recovery. The Boquilons should, thus, receive an additional $26,993.71 in damages to correct these errors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Combined with the correction of the \u201crent\u201d calculation, the Boquilons\u2019 damages award must be increased by $29,273.71, for a total award of $39,564.31, plus prejudgment interest from October 26, 1990, to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">C. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Courtis Finding That Beckwith Was Not an Agent of Panda Realty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The Boquilons contend that Beckwith was the ostensible agent of Panda Realty when she violated the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act. The parties agree that the issue whether Beckwith was acting as an agent of Panda Realty in her dealings with the Boquilons is a question of fact. <em>(Preis </em>v. <em>American Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 752, 761-762 [269 Cal.Rptr. 617] [whether an insurer\u2019s agent had authority, either actual or ostensible, to act as he did was question of fact], citing <em>Thompson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number><em>Occidental Life Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 559, 564 [81 Cal.Rptr. 37].) We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s negative finding on this issue if there is substantial evidence, whether contradicted or uncontradicted, to support it. (See <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Bernards </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 873-874 [197 Cal.Rptr. 925].) We conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">As Beckwith notes, there is no real dispute that the loans made to Mr. Boquilon to pay off his gambling debts were made by Beckwith acting in her individual capacity. The funds came from Beckwith\u2019s personal checking account, and the loans were evidenced by a note and (an unrecorded) deed of trust executed in favor of Beckwith personally. More importantly, however, it is undisputed that the Boquilons conveyed their residence to Beckwith personally, not to Panda Realty (or to Beckwith in some representative capacity), and that there was no subsequent transfer to Panda Realty as an entity. Indeed, there is no evidence cited to this court to indicate Panda Realty is a separate legal entity, capable of acquiring or holding title to real property.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is this conveyance to Beckwith, without compliance with the Act, that underlies the Boquilons\u2019 successful cause of action for damages. In these circumstances, the trial court did not err in concluding that Beckwith was not an agent of Panda Realty in connection with her dealings with the Boquilons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">D. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Finding That Beckwith\u2019s Conduct Was Neither Fraudulent Nor \u201cUnconscionable\u201d Within the Meaning of Sections 1695.7 and 1695.13.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">The Boquilons next contend that there was no substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Beckwith did not defraud them or \u201ctake[] unconscionable advantage\u201d of them. (\u00a7 1695.13.) There is, of course, some evidence of sharp dealing by Beckwith in connection with the personal loans she extended to Mr. Boquilon to cover his gambling losses. For example, she charged very high\u2014arguably usurious\u2014interest rates on these unsecured loans. Furthermore, according to Mrs. Boquilon, Beckwith treated her harshly when she threatened to seek legal counsel to pursue her rights to recover the equity she and her husband had in their home. But there is also ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings that the transfer, refinancing and resale of the Boquilons\u2019 property was necessitated by their inability to keep up with required payments on both the house and Mr. Boquilon\u2019s debts, and that Beckwith\u2019s primary motive in dealing with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1721\">*1721</page-number>Boquilons was not to capture their home equity for herself but, rather, to help them out of their financial bind as a favor to a mutual friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">The Boquilons argue that Beckwith\u2019s proposal to take title solely for the purpose of refinancing in her own name, and then return title to them under an assumption of the new financing, was a sham because they could no more qualify to assume the new loan than to refinance the property in their own names. Beckwith\u2019s real plan, they contend, was to \u201cseize\u201d their property to satisfy a relatively small debt, knowing that the Boquilons would not be able to keep up under the onerous payment schedule she established. However, the trial court apparently believed Beckwith when she testified that she was willing to wait as long as seven years for the Boquilons to clear their credit after bankruptcy in order to assume the American Savings loan, so long as the Boquilons at least kept current with the PITI (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) payments she was personally obligated to make to the new mortgage holder. The trial court also apparently believed that it was not Beckwith\u2019s desire to seize the Boquilons\u2019 equity for herself,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but their failure to keep up with the payment schedule that precipitated the resale to the Friases. On this view of the evidence, the trial court did not err in concluding that Beckwith did not take \u201cunconscionable advantage\u201d of the Boquilons within the meaning of section 1695.13 and was not, therefore liable for the treble damages prescribed by the Act for such conduct (\u00a7 1695.7).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">E. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion to Determine the Amount of Attorney Fees to Be Awarded Under Section 1695.7.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">Section 1695.7 provides: \u201cAn equity seller may bring an action for the recovery of damages or other equitable relief against an equity purchaser for a violation of any subdivision of Section 1695.6 or Section 1695.13. The equity seller <em>shall recover </em>actual damages plus <em>reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d </em>(Italics added for emphasis.) Since we have already determined that the Boquilons established a violation of various subdivisions of section 1695.6, subdivisions (a) and (e), there can be no real dispute under this mandatory attorney fees provision that they were entitled to an award of</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1722\">*1722</page-number>\u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d The only issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining the amount of the fee award. (See <em>Nazemi </em>v. <em>Tseng </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1633, 1642 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 762] [determination of amount of attorney fees award will not be overturned on appeal absent a manifest abuse of discretion].) We conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s determination that only 50 percent of the fees claimed by the Boquilons were reasonably incurred in establishing their Home Equity Sales Contracts Act cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">Citing <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 424 [76 L.Ed.2d 40, 103 S.Ct. 1933], <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621 [186 Cal.Rptr. 754, 652 P.2d 985], and <em>Sundance </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 268 [237 Cal.Rptr. 269] (Sundance), the Boquilons argue that the proof required to establish their Home Equity Sales Contracts Act claim was the same as that required to establish their fraud cause of action and that, therefore, they are entitled to recover fees for all of the time spent by their attorney on this case. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">In the first place, <em>Hensley, Serrano, </em>and <em>Sundance </em>are all cases in which attorney fees were awarded under a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.) As the court noted in <em>Sundance, </em>it is unfair in that context to saddle the prevailing plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2014as opposed to the defendant\u2014with the costs of pursuing theories that prove unsuccessful or are discarded along the way to successful enforcement of important <em>public rights. </em>In that regard, \u201cSection 1021.5 itself simply states that awards are to be made to successful parties, with no mention of excluding compensation for the successful parties\u2019 unsuccessful legal theories. Moreover, as a practical matter, it is impossible for an attorney to determine before starting work on a potentially meritorious legal theory whether it will or will not be accepted by a court years later following litigation. It must be remembered that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is not a gift. It is just compensation for expenses actually incurred in vindicating a public right. To reduce the attorneys\u2019 fees of a successful party because he did not prevail on all his arguments, makes it the attorney, and not the defendant, who pays the cost of enforcing that public right.\u201d <em>(Sundance, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 273.) No such \u201cpublic right\u201d is at stake in this case. The Boquilons obtained private counsel to vindicate their personal financial interest in the equity to their home. It was incumbent upon them, and their attorney, to negotiate an acceptable agreement to provide for payment of attorney fees in the event the court did not award fees for all time spent on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Even if the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d authorities cited by the Boquilons apply in this case, however, it is still a matter within the \u201cdiscretion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1723\">*1723</page-number>trial court to determine whether time spent on an unsuccessful legal theory was reasonably incurred.\u201d <em>(Sundance, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 274.) In this case, the Boquilons spent a great deal of time at trial\u2014including the bulk of their expert\u2019s time\u2014in an attempt to show that Beckwith acted unprofessionally, with fraudulent intent, and misled them for her own financial gain. Such a showing may have been required to establish \u201cunconscionable\u201d conduct in violation of section 1695.13 and their entitlement to <em>exemplary damages </em>under the Act (\u00a7 1695.7), as well as their entitlement to tort damages for fraud. But the trial court roundly rejected the Boquilons\u2019 evidence on these issues, and no such showing was required to establish the more basic violations of the Act. We discern no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s determination that half of the court\u2019s time and, by logical extension, half of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s and expert\u2019s time, was spent in an effort to portray Beckwith as a bad actor, and that this time was not \u201creasonably\u201d spent. (Cf. <em>Sokolow </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231 [261 Cal.Rptr. 520] [trial court has discretion to award less than full amount of attorney fees sought under Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5 where prevailing party has achieved only limited success in achieving the objectives of the litigation].) Accordingly, the award of attorney fees in the amount of $19,852.50 must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is modified to reflect an award of $39,564.31 for actual damages due the Boquilons, plus prejudgment interest from October 26, 1990, to date. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. The Boquilons shall recover \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d on appeal in an amount to be determined by the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1064-10\"> Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First District, Division Three, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-11\"> All statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1065-9\"> The Boquilons correctly note that, throughout her opening brief, Beckwith studiously avoids mentioning the fact that she is a licensed real estate professional.

The Boquilons\u2019 home had been in foreclosure twice in 1989 and they had refinanced the home several times, increasing their monthly mortgage payments from $500 to $1,700 by the time of the Beneficial foreclosure.

We will sign a rental agreement for month to month. 4. We hereby hold Mary Beckwith harmless . . . .\u201d The trial court rejected this affirmative defense, and so do we. On its face, the documents does not evince an intent on the part of the Boquilons\u2019 to relinquish their Home Equity Sales Contracts Act claim or, for that matter, any other rights or claims they had against Beckwith. Moreover, to the extent the Boquilons\u2019 execution of this sketchy document can be stretched to include a waiver of their rights under the Act, it is \u201cvoid and unenforceable as contrary to public policy.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.10.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[13]\">\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">13 For purposes of the Act, \u201c \u2018Residence in foreclosure\u2019 and \u2018residential real property in foreclosure\u2019 means residential real property consisting of one- to four-family dwelling units, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1710\">*1710</page-number>one of which the owner occupies as his or her principal place of residence, and against which there is an outstanding notice of default. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1695.1, subd.

He is mistaken. Without a written contract for sale (a clear violation if section 1695.6, subdivision (a), and without a scheduled date for a \u201csale of the property pursuant to a power of sale conferred in a deed of trust\u201d (\u00a7 1695.4, subd.

It is, rather, <em>the Boquilons' theory </em>that the \u201ctime within which the equity seller. . . may cancel the transaction\u201d <em>{ibid.) </em>began running at some unspecified time, has continued running even to this day, and can <em>never </em>expire. Under this theory, even if Beckwith had waited years before transferring an interest in the property, well beyond any conceivable \u201ccooling off period,\u201d the dissent would find a violation of subdivision (b)(3), and require an award of punitive damages pursuant to section 1695.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1076-6\"> Our holding on this point is consonant with the well-worn maxim that a more specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject, as against a general provision, although the latter standing alone would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates. <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 713, 723-724 [123 P.2d 505]; see also <em>San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 577 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 828 P.2d 147].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1076-7\"> The dissent relies heavily on an assumption that Beckwith was a \u201cknowledgeable\u201d equity purchaser, who was aware of and \u201cdeliberately fail[ed]\u201d to perform her duties to provide the Boquilons with notice and a written contract of sale, as required by the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act. (See cone, and dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1725, 1726.) There is no support in the record for such an assumption. It is undisputed that Beckwith had never heard of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act when the Boquilons conveyed their property to her. If the facts were otherwise, we trust the trial court would have given them due weight in deciding whether Beckwith\u2019s conduct was \u201cunconscionable\u201d (\u00a7 1695.13), or \u201cmalicious\u201d or \u201coppressive\u201d (see \u00a7 3294), so as to justify an award of exemplary damages under section 1695.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1077-9\"> In this case, for example, the parties agreed that the Boquilons would have the right to recover the property after it was refinanced, and Beckwith testified that she was willing to wait as long as seven years for them to qualify to assume the loan, so long as they kept up with required payments. Had they done so, and ultimately recovered title, the Boquilons would have been no worse off at the end of their dealings with Beckwith than if they had, pursuant to notice, cancelled the sale and refinanced on their own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1077-10\"> The dissent contends that, under our interpretation of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act, \u201cwhenever an equity purchaser violates subdivision (a) he or she cannot violate any of the prohibitions of subdivision (b).\u201d (Cone, and dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1725-1726.) That may be a logical end point of our holding, but that is a problem to be addressed to the Legislature. We are not terribly troubled by this outcome, however, because the equity seller who establishes a violation of section 1695.6, subdivision (a), will still be able to recover any equity lost (as here) as a result of that violation. (\u00a7 1695.7.) The equity seller may also, upon a showing of unconscionability, fraud, malice, oppression or other \u201cproper\u201d grounds (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.7, 1695.13, 3294) recover exemplary damages pursuant to section 1695.7. It is only a <em>mandatory </em>award of exemplary damages that is foreclosed by our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1078-7\"> For similar reasons, we reject Beckwith\u2019s argument that the Boquilons are \u201cestopped\u201d to claim damages because they agreed to her plan to put the property up for sale even as the relevant real estate market was entering a period of decline. This circumstance only added to the economic pressure the Boquilons experienced when they realized Beckwith had full control of their property and that they had no way to realize their equity interest. Moreover, Beckwith\u2019s \u201cestoppel\u201d theory would completely vitiate the important protections provided by the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act. Under this theory, notwithstanding the clear dictates of the Act, an equity purchaser who acquired title to a \u201cresidence in foreclosure\u201d under an express or implied\u2014but unwritten\u2014agreement to resell the property would never have to answer in damages to the equity seller who lost all or part of her equity in the deal. As a matter of law, no estoppel arises in such a situation. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1695.6, subds. (a), (b), 1695.7.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1079-12\"> At a minimum, the Boquilons might have avoided the substantial prepayment penalty assessed by Beneficial when Beckwith refinanced with American Savings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1079-13\"> Beckwith also contends that her ignorance of the law, i.e., of her obligations under the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act, should be \u201cexcused.\u201d We marvel at the audacity of such an argument coming from a party who is a licensed real estate professional, but also note that even well-meaning lay people (indeed, close personal friends of the equity seller) who acquire title to a \u201cresidence in foreclosure\u201d must abide by the technical requirements of the Act for conveyance of such property, or face liability for damages to equity sellers who lose their equity in the process. <em>(Segura, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1028; cf. \u00a7 1695.1, subd.

We further understand the $2,273.34 to be part of the $26,993.16 we are restoring to the Boquilons\u2019 damages award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1082-9\"> In their complaint, the Boquilons alleged that Panda Realty is a \u201cbusiness organization, form unknown.\u201d In an answer filed on behalf of Beckwith and Panda Realty, defense counsel issued a general denial to this and all other allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 unverified pleading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1083-9\"> If that was the motivating factor, Beckwith was woefully ineffectual at accomplishing her objective. While she did manage to secure repayment of the gambling loans (plus interest), and recovered a small commission on the resale to the Friases, it appears that the bulk of the Boquilons\u2019 equity was absorbed by market depreciation, loan fees and closing costs associated with the refinancing, and commissions paid to other realtors in which Beckwith did not share.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1083-10\"> A fortiori, the trial court did not err by entering judgment for Beckwith on the plaintiffs\u2019 fraud cause of action, and refusing to award punitive damages under the general fraud statute or common law principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1085-8\">KLINE, P.

The majority\u2019s forced finding flies in the face of the language of the Home Equity Sales Contract Act (the Act) and frustrates its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1724\">*1724</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The purposes of the Act could not have been more clearly stated. In the first section, the Legislature finds that \u201cfinancially unsophisticated\" homeowners whose residences are in foreclosure \u201chave been subjected to fraud, deception and unfair dealing by home equity purchasers . . . through the use of schemes which often involve oral and written misrepresentations, deceit, intimidation, and other unreasonable commercial practices.\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (a).) Accordingly, and in order to advance \u201cthe express policy of the state to preserve and guard the precious asset of home equity,\u201d the chief purposes of the Act are \u201cto require that the sales agreement be expressed in writing; to safeguard the public against deceit and financial hardship; to insure, foster, and encourage fair dealing in the sale and purchase of homes in foreclosure; to prohibit representations that tend to mislead; to prohibit or restrict unfair contract terms; to afford homeowners a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to rescind sales to equity purchasers; and to preserve and protect home equities for the homeowners of this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">In order \u201cto effectuate this intent and to achieve these purposes,\" the Legislature also declared that the Act \u201cshall be liberally construed.\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Ignoring both this directive and the purposes it was designed to achieve, the majority creates an ambiguity that does not genuinely exist and resolves it against the sellers the Act was designed to protect and in favor of the purchasers they were to be protected against. As will be seen, the paradoxical result of the majority\u2019s strained analysis is to bar application of the mandatory exemplary damages provision of the Act to a sophisticated equity purchaser who violates its most fundamental requirements: \u201cthat the sales agreement be expressed in writing\u201d and that homeowners have \u201ca reasonable and meaningful opportunity to rescind sales to equity purchasers.\u201d (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that subdivision (b)(3) of section 1695.6 is inapplicable in this case is based on the fact that the transfer or encumbrance of a residence in foreclosure is prohibited under that statute before \u201cthe time within which the equity seller may cancel the transaction has fully elapsed . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1695.6, subd. (b).) As stated by the majority, \u201cSection 1695.6, subdivision (b)(3) applies to the situation where an equity purchaser has given the notices required by the [Home Equity Sales Contract] Act but, nevertheless, proceeds to transfer or encumber the property within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1725\">*1725</page-number>statutory cancellation period.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1713.) Because Beck-with\u2019s transfer of an interest in the Boquilons\u2019 residence to her husband did not occur within this so-called \u201c \u2018cooling off\u2019 period\u201d <em>(Segura </em>v. <em>McBride </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1035 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 436]), the majority concludes it is not within the ambit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">The reason there was no \u201ccooling off\u2019 period, of course, is that Beckwith failed to provide a written sales agreement fully advising the Boquilons of their statutory cancellation rights, as required by the Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 1695.3, subd. (g), 1695.5, subd. (b).) By holding that subdivision (b)(3) does not apply to a knowledgeable purchaser like Beckwith who never advises a seller of his or her cancellation rights, on the theory that a cancellation period that never began cannot expire, the majority enters the realm of Alice in Wonderland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">As its very title suggests, the Act was designed to protect equity sellers primarily by requiring the equity purchaser to provide a written \u201cHome Equity Sales Contract\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which must, among other things, grant the equity seller (in addition to any other right of rescission) the right to cancel the contract \u201cuntil midnight of the fifth business following the day on which the equity seller signs any contract or until 8 a.m. on the day scheduled for the sale of the property pursuant to a power of sale conferred in a deed of trust, whichever occurs first.\u201d (\u00a7 1695.4, subd. (a).) The centrality to the legislative scheme of the right of cancellation is reflected by the excruciating detail in which the right is spelled out. For example, section 1695.5 provides that \u201c[t]he contract shall contain in immediate proximity to the space reserved for the equity seller\u2019s signature a conspicuous statement in a size equal to at least 12-point bold type, if the contract is printed or in capital letters if the contract is typed, as follows: \u2018You may cancel this contract for the sale of your house without any penalty or obligation at any time before (Date and time of day).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Not only must the right of cancellation be conspicuously set forth in the contract itself, but the contract must refer to and be accompanied by a separate \u201cnotice of cancellation form\u201d which explains the right of cancellation in still greater detail. (\u00a7 1695.5, subds. (a) and (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">Subdivision (a) of section 1695.6 states that the required contract \u201cshall be provided and completed in conformity with those sections by the equity purchaser.\u201d In effect, the majority says that whenever an equity purchaser violates subdivision (a) he or she cannot violate any of the prohibitions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1726\">*1726</page-number>subdivision (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the majority, an equity purchaser who fails to provide the equity seller a written contract embodying the mandated right to cancel cannot transfer the residence before expiration of the cancellation period, in violation of the statute, because such period never began and therefore cannot terminate. This analysis will surely surprise the State Legislature, because it means that a sophisticated equity purchaser who transfers the residence to a third party after deliberately failing to provide the equity seller notice of the statutory right to cancel will receive more lenient treatment than an equity purchaser who has given notice of the right but transfers the residence to a third party before the right to cancel has expired. The Legislature cannot reasonably be thought to have intended to punish a purchaser who has at least provided a written contract providing notice of cancellation rights more severely than a knowing purchaser who has not done so. The sophisticated purchaser who transfers the residence to a third party without notifying the seller of his or her cancellation rights commits a more egregious violation of the Act than a purchaser who makes such a transfer after providing such notice but before expiration of the right to cancel. In the latter situation the seller is on notice of the right and still in a position to enforce it. A seller without a contract of sale is far less likely to be aware of the right and the time within which it lapses and is therefore at a much greater disadvantage. The fact that subdivision (b)(3) assumes that the purchaser has at least given the seller notice of the statutory cancellation rights provides no reason to protect a sophisticated purchaser who has not even done that from the exemplary damages that would otherwise apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that it would make no sense for the Legislature to impose mandatory punitive damages on an equity purchaser who fails to provide a written contract of sale flows from its belief that this requirement is merely \u201ctechnical\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1716), and is therefore presumably less vital to the purpose of the legislative scheme than the right to notice of cancellation. As analysis of the Act reveals, the opposite is true. As Justice Anderson pointed out in <em>Segura </em>v. <em>McBride, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1035, the requirement that the agreement be in writing is \u201c[a]t the heart of the scheme.\u201d It seems to me anomalous to think the Legislature intended to deny mandatory punitive damages for denial of the fundamental right to a written contract, but allow such relief for violation of a merely derivative right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1727\">*1727</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that subdivision (b)(3) of section 1695.6 is inapplicable to this case rests in part on the view that Beckwith\u2019s conduct is instead covered by subdivision (e) of that statute. Subdivision (e), which is set forth in its entirety in the margin below,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibits an equity purchaser who has previously acquired a residence in foreclosure from transferring the property to a third party without the written consent of a seller who has retained an option to repurchase. I agree with my colleagues that Beckwith has violated subdivision (e), but disagree that she cannot be held to have violated both provisions and separately penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Subdivisions (b)(3) and (e) of section 1695.6 address different situations. The former applies to the transfer or encumbrance by an equity purchaser of any interest in a residence in foreclosure to a third party prior to expiration of the period within which the equity seller has a right to cancel the contract of sale. Subdivision (e), on the other hand, does not implement or in any way relate to an equity seller\u2019s statutory right to cancel, indeed it comes into play only if the seller\u2019s right to cancel has expired. The right that subdivision (e) implements is the right of the equity seller to exercise an option to repurchase the residence in foreclosure before it is conveyed to a third party. Unlike the right to cancel, this right is not mandated by statute and comes into play only if the equity purchaser agrees to allow the equity seller a repurchase option.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">A purchaser who violates subdivision (b)(3) of section 1695.6 will not necessarily be in violation of subdivision (e) and a purchaser who violates subdivision (e) will not necessarily violate subdivision (b)(3). The majority\u2019s analysis is therefore not, as my colleagues claim, \u201cconsonant with the well-worn maxim that a more specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject, as against a general provision, although the latter standing alone would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates. [Citations.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1714, fh. 16.) Subdivision (b)(3), which the majority posits as the more general provision, is not broad enough to invariably include the subject to which subdivision (e) relates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">While it is true that a purchaser who violates section 1695.6, subdivisions (a) and (e) will always also be in violation of subdivision (b)(3), this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1728\">*1728</page-number>provides no rational basis upon which to exempt such a purchaser from the more severe penalty ordinarily attendant upon violation of subdivision (b)(3). On the contrary, the violation of an equity seller\u2019s right to cancel\u2014 either by transferring or encumbering the residence prior to expiration of the cancellation period or, as here, by depriving the seller of notice of the right to cancel\u2014relates to the ability of an owner of a residence in foreclosure to retain the property in the first place, which the Legislature thought more significant than the repurchase right that is the subject of subdivision (e), which, as noted, is not mandated by statute and exists only at the sufferance of the equity purchaser. The Legislature apparently believed it would be unwise to impose exemplary damages on an equity purchaser who provides notice of a seller\u2019s right to rescind an equity sales contract but infringes his or her option rights, since purchasers are not required by law to grant sellers an option to repurchase and might not do so if impairment of such a right would subject them to treble damages. While the interests of equity sellers are thus served by protecting equity purchasers against exemplary damages for infringement of their option rights, there is no such reason for leniency in the case of a sophisticated purchaser, like Beckwith, who not only infringes an equity seller\u2019s option rights but does not even provide contractual notice of the seller\u2019s inalienable right to rescind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">For the reasons just set forth, the overlap between subdivisions (b)(3) and (e) of section 1695.6 that occurs in the limited situation in which a knowledgeable equity purchaser violates both subdivision (a), by failing to provide the equity seller contractual notice of the right to cancel, and subdivision (e), by failing to obtain the written consent of the seller to waive his option to repurchase and permit sale of the residence to a third party, and thereby also violates subdivision (b)(3), does not create any ambiguity that needs to be resolved by a judicial selection of one violation or the other. As has been explained, the subdivisions are designed to achieve different purposes and the equity purchaser who violates both requirements should not for that reason be exempt from the more severe penalty related to the more serious of the two violations, that proscribed by subdivision (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Even if there were an ambiguity, however, settled principles would bar this court from resolving it in favor of sophisticated equity purchasers, as the majority has done. Not only are equity sellers the persons the Act is designed to protect, but the protections it affords are as against equity purchasers. Furthermore, lest there be any question about which party is intended to receive the benefit of legitimate doubts, the Legislature inserted a requirement that the Act be \u201cliberally construed\u201d to effectuate the legislative intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1729\">*1729</page-number>and achieve its purposes. (\u00a7 1695, subd. (d)(2).) By creating an ambiguity that does not exist, and then resolving it against those the Legislature felt it necessary to protect, the majority unjustifiably defeats the will of a co-equal branch of state government. This should not be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Throughout this concurring and dissenting opinion I have used the adjectives \u201csophisticated\u201d or \u201cknowledgeable\u201d when referring to the equity purchaser against whom the Act protects an equity seller. While the Act has equal application to equity purchasers who may be unsophisticated, the evils of concern to the Legislature are much more likely to be present when the equity purchaser is wise in the ways of the real estate business and the seller is not. More importantly, the equity purchaser in this case is a licensed real estate agent vastly more knowledgeable about real estate and credit transactions than the equity sellers. The record shows that the Boquilons submitted to Beckwith\u2019s will in large part because of her superior knowledge of the real estate business, and that Beckwith exploited this advantage in committing precisely the offensive acts\u2014including \u201cmisrepresentations, deceit, intimidation, and other unreasonable commercial practices\u201d\u2014the Legislature sought to prevent. (\u00a7 1695, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">The majority\u2019s indifference to these considerations is inexplicable because it does not comport even with its own analysis of the law. The majority argues that the Legislature did not intend an expansive reading of section 1695.6, subdivision (b)(3), because that \u201cwould require an award of treble damages in every case in which <em>an innocent and ignorant equity purchaser </em>failed to provide a written contract or to fulfill completely the other technical requirements of the Act, and proceeded to deal with the property as the new owner by encumbering or transferring any interest in it.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1715, original italics deleted, new italics added.) The majority concludes, therefore, that the Legislature intended to authorize exemplary damages only in the exceptional, not the ordinary case, and only in those cases where the violation of the Act was knowing and intentional. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Reasonable minds might differ as to whether the majority\u2019s analysis makes sense when applied to equity purchasers genuinely ignorant of the statutory requirement of a written contract providing notice of the right to cancel, but I think few would agree it makes sense when applied to a state licensed real estate professional. Because Beckwith is such a person, and must therefore be deemed knowledgeable of the statutory duty she failed to discharge, this is \u201cthe exceptional, not the ordinary case,\u201d in which even the majority agrees exemplary damages are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1730\">*1730</page-number>Our opinion in <em>Easton </em>v. <em>Strassburger </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 90 [199 Cal.Rptr. 383, 46 A.L.R.4th 521] is instructive in this regard. We held in that case that a real estate broker representing the seller of residential property has a duty to disclose facts, including \u201cthe affirmative duty to conduct a reasonably competent and diligent inspection of the residential property listed for sale and to disclose to prospective purchasers all facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that such an investigation would reveal.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 102, fn. omitted.) We justified imposition of a duty to disclose not only that which is known but also <em>\u201cthat which should be </em>known\u201d on two grounds, neither of which were statutory:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> first, that such a duty \u201cis a formally acknowledged professional obligation that it appears many brokers customarily impose upon themselves as an ethical matter\u201d (152 Cal.App.3d at p. 101); and, second, because of the special role played by real estate brokers. With respect to the latter consideration we recalled the statement by \u201cJudge Cardozo, as he then was, in a different but still relevant context: \u2018The real estate broker is brought by his calling into a relationship of trust and confidence. Constant are the opportunities by concealment and collusion to extract illicit gains. We know from our judicial records that the opportunities have not been lost. . . . He is accredited by his calling in the minds of the inexperienced or the ignorant with a knowledge greater than their own.\u2019 <em>(Roman </em>v. <em>Lobe </em>(1926) 243 N.Y. 51, 54-55 [152 N.E. 461, 462-463; 50 A.L.R. 1329, 1332] quoted in <em>Richards Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Real Estate Comr. </em>(1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 357, 362 [300 P.2d 893]; . . .)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">If a duty can be imposed on a real estate professional even though it does not arise under statute and relates to a person with whom the professional is not in privity, an equally important duty should a fortiori be imposed when it <em>does </em>arise under statute and relates to a person with whom the professional <em>is </em>in privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">The fact, which the majority underscores, that Beckwith \u201chad never heard of the Home Equity Sales Contracts Act when the Boquilons conveyed their property to her\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1714, fn. 17), seems to me anything but exculpatory, even if true. A state licensed real estate professional should not be permitted to use her ignorance of the basic requirement to provide a written sales contract, which is hardly an obscure duty and should be known by all real estate agents, to insulate herself from liability for its breach. The real estate broker in <em>Easton </em>v. <em>Strassburger, supra, </em>was as ignorant of the defect in the property involved in that case as Beckwith claims to be of the real estate law. There is no more reason here than there was in <em>Easton </em>to permit such ignorance to be used to advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1731\">*1731</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse that portion of the judgment refusing to award exemplary damages to the Boquilons pursuant to section 1695.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 5, 1996.
