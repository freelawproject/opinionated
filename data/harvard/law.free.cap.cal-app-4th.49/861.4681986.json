This resulted in a petition alleging that Young had committed vehicular burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, subd. (a)), and misdemeanor auto tampering (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10852). The petition was sustained and Young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>appeals, contending that \u201centry into the headlamp housings of an automobile to steal its headlamps\u201d is not an \u201centry into a vehicle\u201d within the meaning of section 459. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">As relevant, section 459 provides that \u201c[e]very person who <em>enters any . </em>. . vehicle. . . <em>when the doors are </em>locked. . . with [the] intent <em>to </em>commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d (Italics added.) Under existing case law, an entry within the meaning of section 459 includes just about any entry into an <em>interior section </em>of a <em>locked vehicle </em>with the requisite intent, including an entry through a door, window, or trunk. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Malcolm </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 217 [120 Cal.Rptr. 667] [closed wind-wing section of window of locked car]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blalock </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 1078 [98 Cal.Rptr. 231] [locked trunk]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 812 [51 Cal.Rptr. 18] [locked semi-trailer]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Toomes </em>(1957) 148 Cal.App.2d 465 [306 P.2d 953] [locked trunk].) Clearly, a headlamp housing is a horse of a different color.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">According to Young, his offense does not qualify as a burglary because an auto burglary occurs only when the vehicle is locked and entry is accomplished \u201cat worst by smashing a window, at best, by illegally unlocking it. These extremes, as well as other possible types of forcible entries, <em>necessarily involve unlawfully altering the vehicle\u2019s locked state.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Mooney </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 502, 505 [193 Cal.Rptr. 381], italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the People, a forced entry into a headlamp housing with the intent to steal headlamps qualifies as an auto burglary, on one of two theories\u2014 either because this entry is akin to an entry into the \u201cboundary\u201d of a building in that it \u201cpasses the line of the threshold\u201d of the vehicle (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ravenscroft </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 639, 643-644 [243 Cal.Rptr. 827] [insertion of ATM card into ATM machine is an entry into the bank]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franco </em>(1926) 79 Cal.App. 682 [250 P. 698] [entry into outside showcase]), or because this entry intrudes upon the \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of the owner of the property (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Nible </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 838, 843-844 [246 Cal.Rptr. 119] [finding the inhabitants\u2019 expectation of security was violated by penetration of a window screen]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>The flaw in the People\u2019s analogies is obvious. Under section 459, an entry into almost any four-sided structure is a burglary without regard to whether the structure was locked <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gibbons </em>(1928) 206 Cal. 112, 114 [273 P. 32]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mackabee </em>(1989) <em>214 </em>Cal.App.3d 1250, 1257 [263 Cal.Rptr. 183])\u2014but an entry into a vehicle is a burglary only if the vehicle was locked. (\u00a7 459; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mooney, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 505 [a van must be locked for an unlawful entry to constitute a burglary]; <em>In re Charles G. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 62, 65-66 [156 Cal.Rptr. 832] [if an entry is to qualify as auto burglary, a pickup truck must be locked]; compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 226 [169 Cal.Rptr. 179] [entry through window deliberately left rolled down is not an entry into a locked vehicle and thus not a burglary].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For this reason, we need not engage in the mental gymnastics required to dissect rules regarding boundaries, reasonable expectations, or antiquated curtilage concepts to decide whether an \u201centry\u201d into a car\u2019s headlamp housings constitutes a burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Unlike the car\u2019s interior or its trunk, headlamp housings can be \u201centered\u201d without regard to whether the car is locked, and we view the theft of headlights the same as we would the theft of windshield wipers or hubcaps. These are thefts (or attempted thefts) or auto tampering or acts of vandalism, not burglaries. As Division Two of the First District put it in <em>In re Lamont R. </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 244, 247-248 [245 Cal.Rptr. 870], \u201c[t]he language of section 459 shows that the Legislature intended it to be a more serious crime to enter a locked vehicle than an unlocked one. The crime of burglary is committed when a person, with the requisite intent, enters a dwelling or a defined class of vehicles, whether locked or unlocked. But the Legislature specifically required locking as an essential element of common vehicular burglary.\u201d What this means is that where a defendant \u201cused no pressure,\u201d \u201cbroke no seal,\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cdisengaged no mechanism that could reasonably be called a lock,\u201d he is not guilty of auto burglary. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 248; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Toomes, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.2d at p. 467 [the purpose of section 459 is to \u201cmake it a more serious offense <em>to break into the interior </em>of a car\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The finding that Young K. committed second degree burglary of a vehicle is reversed, and the judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Spencer, P. J., and Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-10\"> Unless otherwise stated, all section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> In <em>Mooney, </em>where the evidence suggested the defendant entered an unlocked car, Division One of the Fourth District reversed an auto burglary conviction because the trial court had refused to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of auto tampering. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mooney, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at pp. 504-507.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\"> A trailer coach, like a house, need not be locked. (\u00a7 459; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trimble </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1258, 1260 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 495].) Indeed, section 459 is quite specific about what has to be locked and what doesn\u2019t. A house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, bam, stable, outhouse or other building, tent or defined vessels or floating homes and railroad cars need <em>not </em>be locked; a cargo container, whether or not mounted on a vehicle, must be <em>locked or sealed\u2019, </em>defined house cars, trailer coaches, and inhabited campers need <em>not </em>be locked; vehicles \u201cdefined by the Vehicle Code\u201d must be <em>locked\u2019, </em>defined aircraft and mines (and portions of mines) need <em>not </em>be locked. (\u00a7 459.) Fortunately, resolution of the issue before us in this case does not require analysis of these distinctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
