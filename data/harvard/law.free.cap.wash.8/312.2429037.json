Moore to quiet title to block 6 of Lake Dell Addition to the city of Seattle. On August 8, 1891, the defendant William H. Moore applied to the plaintiff for a loan of money on the property. The plaintiff refused to loan on \u2022 the property because it was incumbered. Afterward Mr. Moore offered to take $1,500 for his equity in the property, provided he was given a six months\u2019 option for its purchase. Plaintiff said he would submit his proposition to his counsel, Mr. Winsor, \u2018\u00a3 and if Mr. Winsor says the title is all right and I can give you an option for six months in writing so that afterwards you cannot claim it is a mortgage, I will buy your property. \u2019 \u2019 That the two parties laid the proposition, before Mr. Winsor, who said: \u201cYes, I can draw up that kind of an agreement, provided Mr. Moore won\u2019t perjure himself six months later.\u201d Mr. Moore answered: \u201cI understand, and I will deed you this property absolutely, taking an option, and if I don\u2019t buy in six months the property is yours.\u201d Thereupon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>land was deeded to plaintiff by the defendants, and the following agreement was signed by both parties, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">\u201cJames Dignan, of Seattle, hereby agrees to sell to W.

A court of equity will construe the conveyance to be a mortgage, whatever may be the form of the contract, if the person to whom the application for the loan is made agrees to receive back his money with legal interest, or a larger amount within a specified time thereafter, and to reconvey the property. <em>Holmes v. </em>Grant, 8 Paige Ch. 243; <em>Brown v.

And express provision that the contract for reconveyance should be regarded only as a- contract to reconvey and not as an acknowledgment that the deed was intended as a mortgage, should be given effect to, if consistent with the whole transaction, as declaring the intention of the parties that it should not create a mortgage.\u201d 1 Jones, Mortgages, \u00a7\u00a7260, 261; <em>Glendenning v. </em>Johnston, 33 Wis. 351; <em>Henley v. </em>Hotaling, 41 Cal. 26; <em>Manasse v.

The criterion, whether a deed absolute on its face amounts to a mortgage, as established by the courts, is, \u201cthe continued existence of a debt or liability between the parties, so that the conveyance is in reality intended as a security for the debt, or indemnity against the liability. On the contrary, if no such relation whatsoever of debtor and creditor is left subsisting, then the transaction is not a mortgage, but a mere sale and contract of repurchase. \u2019 \u2019 3 Pomeroy, Eq.

Under the agreement all that Moore received was an option to purchase the lands in question. This was neither a sale nor an agreement to sell. The owner parts with his right to sell the lands for a limited period. The other party receives the right to elect to buy. See <em>Ide v. Leiser, </em>10 Mont. 5. The option in the contract construed by this court in the case of <em>Drown v. Ingels, </em>3 Wash. 424, is like that in this ease. Similar contracts are construed as options in the following cases: <em>Horbach v. Hill, </em>112 U. S. 144; <em>Dwyer v. Raborn, </em>6 Wash. 213; <em>Chadbourne v. Stockton Savings c&amp; Loan, Society, </em>88 Cal. 636; <em>Loveland v. Fisk, </em>32 Pac. 278; <em>Richardson v. Hardwick, </em>106 U. S. 252; <em>Cunningham v.

Y. 499.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b343-6\">Hoyt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_N\">\u2014 We deem it unnecessary to enter into a discussion of the questions of law presented in the briefs of counsel, for the reason that, conceding the law to be as claimed by appellants, the facts shown by the record will not justify their contention founded thereon. The most that appellants claim is that a deed, absolute on its face, will be held to be a mortgage when in fact it was so intended by the parties thereto, or when it was given as security for the payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The undisputed proofs in this case show that the deed under which respondent claims was not given under circumstances which make either of these reasons for holding it to be a mortgage applicable. It appears from such proofs that the respondent absolutely declined to make a loan upon the property which was afterwards deeded to him. Such property was incumbered, and the grantors in the deed were about to lose their right of redemption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Under these circumstances, after much importunity on the part of the appellants, the respondent agreed to purchase their equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">There is nothing whatever to show that he agreed to take it by way of security, or that it was understood between the parties that the money advanced by respondent was in the nature of a loan. It is true that it appeared by a separate writing that respondent agreed to reconvey the property to the appellants upon certain conditions, but there is nothing in the testimony to show that it was intended that the execution of this paper was to have any effect whatever in the construction of the deed. Instead thereof, directly the contrary is made to appear. If we should sustain the contention of the appellants, under the facts disclosed by this record, it would be in effect to hold that two persons standing upon an equal basis are incompetent to make a contract by which one of them shall sell to the other real estate, and make a deed thereto which shall be absolute as between the parties, and at the same time agree that the grantor in said deed shall have the right to repurchase the property sold. We are not prepared so to restrict the power of competent persons to' control their property and contract in regard thereto. If it appeared in the case that any unfair advantage had been taken by the grantee in the deed, that he had obtained the property for a grossly inadequate price, or that the rights of third parties were affected, a court of equity could doubtless interfere. But there is nothing of the kind shown by this record. The parties were dealing on equal terms, and the consideration was as large as under all the circumstances of the case could have been reasonably expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Dunbar, C. J., and Scott, Stiles and Anders, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
