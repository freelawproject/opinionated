The right of attachment is based upon the supposed existence of fraud in fact, and not upon what is merely voidable because against equity and good conscience, \u2022 sometimes denominated fraud in law. It is not a fraud in fact for a debtor, whether a natural person or a corporation, to prefer a creditor, and it is only because the law regards the assets of an insolvent corporation as a trust fund for all its creditors that it interferes with preferences made by debtors of that class. If the Peters &amp; Mill\u00e9r Company was an insolvent corporation at the time it transferred its property to the bank, its other creditors can have adequate relief upon alleging sufficient grounds therefor, by complaint in equity to subject its assets, in the hands of the bank, to an equal distribution, in which all its creditors can participate. The ground upon which they must base an action for that purpose will be equitable, and not purely legal. To sustain this attachment would be to permit the respondent to make itself a preferred creditor, which is the very gist of its complaint against the appellant in its treatment of another creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The action of the superior court in sustaining the attachment was, therefore, erroneous, and the order denying the motion to set aside the attachment must be reversed. So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Dunbar, C. J., and Hoyt, Anders and Scott, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
