Holland, Governor\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The confusion in the title and body of the Act arises from the fact that the ttile expreses a purpose to repeal Sections 27.23 (2) and 27.28, Florida Statutes of 1941, while the body of the Act attempts to repeal Sections 26.23 (2) and 27.28, Florida Statutes of 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Section 26.23, in which there is no sub-paragraph (2) treats a different subject matter and was no doubt included in the Act by oversight. The Act does not make sense to include it but taken as a whole it shows a clear purpose to follow the language of the title and repeal Sections 27.23 (2) and 27.28 and leave as the law regulating the subject matter Sections 27.23 (1) and 27.27. The concluding four lines of Section One of the Act leave no doubt of this. You are accordingly advised that you are authorized to countersign warrants in payment of salaries of certain State Attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and Assistant State Attorneys in compliance with Sections 27.23(1) and 27.27, Florida Statutes of 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Sincerely yours,</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-5\">RIVERS BUFORD Chief Justice</judges>\n<judges id=\"Amo\">GLENN TERRELL</judges>\n<judges id=\"AtN\">ARMSTEAD BROWN</judges>\n<judges id=\"AIY\">R.
