True, it denounces the offense of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotics but it does not touch the offense of killing one when operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. In other words, the thesis of Chapter 20578 is speed and traffic regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>on the highway while the thesis of Section 860.01 is punishment for manslaughter committed while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">We find nothing whatever in Chapter 20578 that points to an intent or purpose to repeal Section 806.01. Neither are the two acts so inconsistent or repugnant that we could say there was a repeal by implication. American Bakeries Company v. Haines City, 131 Fla. 790, 180 So. 524. A statute that has been repeatedly recognized for more than twenty-five years will not be held as repealed except on diametrical repugnance or express showing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The petition is accordingly denied and the petitioner is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b689-7\">BUFORD, C.
