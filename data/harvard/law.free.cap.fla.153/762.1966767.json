Shambow this day filed. A full statement of this case appears in our opinion filed on a former appeal. Shambow v. Shambow, 149 Fla. 278, 5 So. (2nd) 454. When the mandate went down the county judge proceeded to take additional testimony agreeable to our opinion. Subsequently appellants filed a petition to charge appellee with rent and other charges and thereafter demanded a jury trial on appellee\u2019s claim which demand was disallowed. The county judge allowed the claim of appellee\u2019s in the sum of $5488.14 and ordered the same paid and denied the petition of appellants, to charge appellee with rent and other charges. Upon the failure of the circuit court to disturb such rulings the judgment of the circuit court is appealed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">Taking up for consideration this case where we left off on its former appearance here, the question arises whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>appellee has proven his claim. We have considered the evidence and find it ample to sustain the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">It is urged that it was erroneous to allow the claim for services rendered previous to within three years of the mother\u2019s death. Such is not the law because the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the debt is due and in this case no money was due until after the mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">It is claimed that appellants had a constitutional right to a jury trial in a court of competent jurisdiction. It is fundamental that constitutional rights which are personal may be waived. Waiver may be expresed or implied. We do not decide the question, however, because the history of this litigation, as revealed by the records on appeals here, shows most clearly that appellants waived whatever rights they may have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b787-7\">BUFORD, C.
