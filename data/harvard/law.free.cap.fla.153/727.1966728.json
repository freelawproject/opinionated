Suarez v. State, 95 Fla. 42, 115 So. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">It appears that both Judges Parks and Sandler have rescued themselves from further judicial action in this case and have requested the Governor to appoint a substitute Circuit Judge to further function as Judge in this cause, as was suggested in McGregor v. Hammock, 101 Fla. 1170, 132 So. 815; Dickenson v. Parks, 104 Fla. 577, 140 So. 459-462.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">It is our conclusion that if and when such substitute judge shall have been appointed such judge so appointed will have power and jurisdiction to proceed with the disposition of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">Therefore, the petiton for mandamus is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b751-19\">BUFORD, C.
