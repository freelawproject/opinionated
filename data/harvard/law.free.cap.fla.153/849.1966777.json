The undisputed evidence is that appellant accosted the deceased, his estranged wife, and assaulted her. He escorted her to a lonely spot in the woods then killed her with a piece of wood. He buried the remains in a thickly wooded spot and concealed the grave. Shortly thereafter he was seen with blood on his clothes. He reported, however, having sent his wife away on a bus. A short time later a search was made resulting in a discovery of the body whereupon appellant confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">We find no error in the record and judgment, and the same is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b874-11\">BUFORD, C.
