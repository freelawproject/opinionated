The record discloses that the strip, and adjacent land, in 1925, was by the owner mortgaged to the Dade County Security Company, and a building program on the property was inaugurated but subsequently abandoned. Ingress and egr\u00e9ss by the owners was allowed to the public and by them used as a parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">During the year 1928 the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in the \u2022 chain acquired title by Master\u2019s deed. Taxes to the County and City on the property were paid by the owner. The owner acquiesced in the vehicular and pedestrian use of the strip. The city repaired the pavement situated thereon, but was restrained from the purchase thereof in 1934, and the suit was by stipulation of counsel dismissed in 1936. Acts of ownership by the city of the strip precipitated the suit at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The law placed the burden of proof on the city under its pleading in the case to establish dedication to the public by implication or otherwise by the owner of the strip of land described in the final decree here challenged. We have carefully considered all the testimony relied upon by the city and have concluded that it failed to carry the burden required by law and for this reason the decree entered by the chancellor was correct and free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-9\">BUFORD, C.
