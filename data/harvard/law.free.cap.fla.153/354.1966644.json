Most of the testimony, including that of the parties, was taken before the chancellor in person. He was in a much better position to judge the weight and credibility of the testimony than is this Court. There were also some letters and other written exhibits. The chancellor\u2019s conclusions and final decree are supported by the record. It certainly is not made to appear that this decree is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>TERRELL, BROWN, CHAPMAN, THOMAS, ADAMS and SEBRING, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b379-5\">BUFORD, C.

Therefore, I think .the decree. should be reversed with directions that decree of divorce be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
