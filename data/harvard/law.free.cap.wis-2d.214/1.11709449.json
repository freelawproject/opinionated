ABRAHAMSON, CHIEF JUSTICE.</author>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">\u00b6 1. This is an appeal by the Labor Association of Wisconsin, Inc., and Michael J. Ciszewski from an order of the circuit court for Ozaukee County, Lawrence F. Waddick, Judge, granting summary judgment to Ozaukee County Sheriff Michael D. Milas, Ozaukee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>County, and the Ozaukee County Law Enforcement Committee (collectively referred to as the County). The circuit court's order vacated the decision of an arbitrator relating to a disciplinary dispute involving Michael J. Ciszewski, a deputy sheriff of Ozaukee County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circuit court concluded that arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement subsequent to a disciplinary decision of the Ozaukee County Law Enforcement Committee was void because the deputy sheriffs sole and exclusive remedy following an adverse decision of the Law Enforcement Committee was review by the circuit court pursuant to the statutory appeal process set forth in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 (1991-92).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court also concluded that the County had not \"waive[d] the statutory process so as to be estopped by their actions.\" The deputy sheriff appealed to the court of appeals, which certified the appeal to this court. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.61 (1995-96).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b6 2. The court of appeals certified two issues. The first issue relates to the validity of the collective bargaining agreement allowing arbitration of a disciplinary matter involving a deputy sheriff. The question is whether the deputy sheriff s sole and exclusive remedy following an adverse decision of the Law Enforcement Committee is review by the circuit court pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 (1991-92). Wis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>consin Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 provides in pertinent part: \"The accused may appeal from the order [of the grievance committee] to the circuit court. . . .\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second issue relates to whether the County was estopped in this case from challenging the validity of the arbitration award as contravening Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 (1991-92).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold that the County is estopped in this case from challenging the validity of the arbitration award as contravening Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 (1991-92). Because we decide this case on estoppel grounds, we need not, and do not, reach the first ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>tion posed by the court of appeals. Furthermore, the arbitration provision in the collective bargaining agreement at issue in the present case no longer appears in the current collective bargaining agreement. For the reasons set forth, we reverse the order of the circuit court and remand the cause to the circuit court with directions to reinstate the arbitration award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-1\">\u00b6 3. The facts are undisputed for purposes of this appeal. In January 1993 Ozaukee County Sheriff Michael D. Milas filed disciplinary charges against deputy sheriff Michael J. Ciszewski, alleging that between the summer of 1991 and fall of 1992, the deputy sheriff had committed five acts of misconduct. The Sheriff suspended the deputy sheriff without pay and recommended to the Law Enforcement Committee that the deputy sheriff be dismissed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-2\">\u00b6 4. In February 1993 the Law Enforcement Committee reviewed the charges and determined that dismissal of the deputy sheriff was warranted. The deputy sheriff objected to the Law Enforcement Committee's decision and requested arbitration. Although the collective bargaining agreement under which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>deputy sheriff sought arbitration had expired on December 31, 1992, Ozaukee County and the deputy sheriff proceeded with arbitration in adherence to the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b6 5. In June 1993 Ozaukee County and the deputy sheriff appeared before the arbitrator for hearings on the disciplinary matter. In March 1994 the arbitrator concluded that Ozaukee County failed to prove three of the five charges against the deputy sheriff. Although the arbitrator concluded that the two proven charges were \"extremely serious,\" he found that the charges did not warrant dismissal of the deputy sheriff due to the deputy sheriffs \"extremely difficult\" personal problems. The arbitrator modified the Law Enforcement Committee's decision, treating the time following the deputy sheriffs dismissal as unpaid suspension and ordering the deputy sheriff to be returned to work after passing medical and psychological examinations to determine his fitness for duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b6 6. As required by the arbitration award, the deputy sheriff submitted proof of fitness for duty. The Sheriff, however, refused to return the deputy sheriff to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b6 7. In June 1994 the County moved to vacate the arbitration award on summary judgment, claiming that under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 (1991-92) judicial review by the circuit court was the sole and exclusive means to challenge the Law Enforcement Committee's decision. The deputy sheriff moved to confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b6 8. In January 1996 the circuit court granted the County's motion for summary judgment and vacated the arbitration award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The deputy sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>appealed the circuit court's order to the court of appeals, which certified the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">HH HH</p>\n<p id=\"Atz\">\u00b6 9. On appeal from a circuit court order granting summary judgment, this court applies the same methodology used by the circuit court, which is set forth in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 802.08(2) (1995-96). <em>See Jeske v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>183 Wis. 2d 667, 672, 515 N.W.2d 705 (1994). Whether summary judgment should be granted is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u00b6 10. When the facts and reasonable inferences therefrom are not disputed, it is a question of law whether equitable estoppel has been established. This court determines questions of law independent of the circuit court, benefiting from its analysis. <em>See Harms v. Harms, </em>174 Wis. 2d 780, 784, 498 N.W.2d 229 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"Atq\">I-H I \u2014 I h-i</p>\n<p id=\"Ae1\">\u00b6 11. The circuit court concluded that the County had not \"waive[d] the statutory appeal process so as to be estopped by their actions.\" In stating its holding the circuit court used both the words \"waiver\" and \"estop-pel.\"<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties in this case seem to argue both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>waiver and estoppel but concentrate their legal analy-ses on waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b6 12. While the words \"waiver\" and \"estoppel\" are often used interchangeably, they represent distinct but related doctrines. <em>See Von Uhl v. Trempealeau County Mut. Ins. Co., </em>33 Wis. 2d 32, 37, 146 N.W.2d 516 (1966); <em>Saverslak v. Davis-Cleaver Produce Co., </em>606 F.2d 208, 213 (7th Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b6 13. This court has defined waiver as the \"voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right\" and has stated that \"intent to relinquish [the right] is an essential element of waiver.\" <em>Von Uhl, </em>33 Wis. 2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>37 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> waiver doctrine focuses on the intent of the party against whom waiver is asserted. It is not necessary, however, to prove that the party had an actual intent to waive. <em>See Attoe v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>36 Wis. 2d 539, 545, 153 N.W.2d 575 (1967). \"[T]he intent to waive may be inferred as a matter of law from the conduct of the parties.\" <em>Nelson v. Caddo-Texas Oil Lands Co., </em>176 Wis. 327, 329, 186 N.W. 155 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">\u00b6 14. The parties in this case dispute whether the County made a voluntary and intentional waiver of a known right. The County asserts that it never made a voluntary and intentional waiver of its right to object to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The County claims it did not know until three days after the arbitration award was announced that it could object to the arbitrator's jurisdiction pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.2l(8)(b)6.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00b6 15. We need not decide whether the County voluntarily and intentionally waived its objection to a known right. For purposes of evaluating the County's argument we accept the County's position that it did not know it might object to arbitration on the basis of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 when it proceeded with arbitration. The County's knowledge of the right it asserts here to object to the arbitrator's jurisdiction is not, however, determinative of the rights of the parties. As a matter of law, the facts of the case establish equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b6 16. The estoppel doctrine, also called equitable estoppel or estoppel <em>in pais, </em>focuses on the conduct of the parties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The elements of equitable estoppel are: (1) action or non-action, (2) on the part of one against whom estoppel is asserted, (3) which induces reasonable reliance thereon by the other, either in action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>non-action, and (4) which is to his or her detriment. <em>See Department of Revenue v. Moebius Printing </em>Co., 89 Wis. 2d 610, 634, 279 N.W.2d 213 (1979).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b6 17. All the elements of equitable estoppel are present in this case. The County's actions that form the basis of estoppel occurred both before and after the County's dispute with the deputy sheriff. Prior to the deputy sheriff s discharge, the County had entered into a collective bargaining agreement that provided arbitration for disciplinary disputes. After being suspended, the deputy sheriff pursued his dismissal grievance through arbitration. Despite the fact that the collective bargaining agreement had expired, the County agreed to arbitration and appeared before the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b6 18. The County's full participation in the arbitration process implied a good faith effort to resolve the dispute through arbitration. At no time during the arbitration proceeding, which lasted from June 1993 to March 1994, did the County object to the arbitrator's jurisdiction. The first time the County objected to the arbitrator's jurisdiction was at the circuit court, 17 months after the filing of the disciplinary charges, one year after commencement of the arbitration proceeding and three months after announcement of the arbitration award. In other words, the County made no objection to the arbitrator's jurisdiction until after the arbitrator ruled against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b6 19. Relying on the County's failure to object to arbitration and on the County's full participation in the arbitration proceeding, the deputy sheriff pursued his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>grievance through arbitration. Nothing in the record demonstrates that the deputy sheriffs reliance on the County's conduct was unreasonable. Based on the record, we conclude that the deputy sheriff had no reason to doubt the arbitration would result in a binding decision and award.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b6 20. The final element of equitable estoppel is whether the party against whom estoppel is asserted caused another party to change position to his or her detriment. In the context of a claim of equitable estop-pel, \"detriment\" has been equated with \"prejudice,\" and commonly understood to mean \"injury or damage.\" <em>City of Madison v. Lange, </em>140 Wis. 2d 1, 7, 408 N.W.2d 763 (Ct. App. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b6 21. The County's actions caused the deputy sheriff to invest time and resources in the arbitration proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Had he known the County would object to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, the deputy sheriff might have sought review of the Law Enforcement Committee's decision in circuit court. Now, more than four years after the dispute arose, the County is asking that the deputy sheriff recommence his dismissal grievance, this time in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b6 22. Because the elements of the defense of equitable estoppel have been met in the present case, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>must next consider whether the defense of estoppel should be applied against the County. The doctrine of equitable estoppel \"is not applied as freely against governmental agencies as it is in the case of private persons.\" <em>Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby v. Department of Taxation, </em>260 Wis. 551, 559, 51 N.W.2d 796 (1952). Courts have recognized \"the force of the proposition that estop-pel should be applied against the Government with utmost caution and restraint, for it is not a happy occasion when the Government\u2019s hands, performing duties in behalf of the public, are tied by the acts and conduct of particular officials in their relations with particular individuals.\" <em>Schuster v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>312 F.2d 311, 317 (9th Cir. 1962).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b6 23. Nevertheless, we have recognized that estoppel may be available as a defense against the government if the government's conduct would work a serious injustice and if the public interest would not be unduly harmed by the application of estoppel. <em>See Moebius Printing Co., </em>89 Wis. 2d at 638. In each case the court must balance the public interests at stake if estoppel is applied against the injustice that might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>caused if it is not. <em>See Moebius Printing Co., </em>89 Wis. 2d at 639; <em>State v. City of Green Bay, </em>96 Wis. 2d 195, 210, 291 N.W.2d 508 (1980).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b6 24. In this case principles of justice demand that the County be prevented from forcing the deputy sheriff to begin the grievance proceeding again. It is unjust to allow the County to agree to arbitrate a disciplinary dispute and then, when the decision is adverse, to allow the County to question the arbitrator's jurisdiction over the dispute. Permitting the County to question the arbitrator's jurisdiction after it has fully participated in the arbitration proceeding would give the County \"two bites at the apple, arbitration and litigation, to obtain a favorable outcome.\" <em>United Indus. Workers, Serv., Transp., Prof'l Gov't of North Am. v. Government of the Virgin Islands, </em>987 F.2d 162, 169 (3rd Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b6 25. Applying the doctrine of estoppel in this case prevents a serious injustice to the deputy sheriff and produces no undue harm to the public interest. Although the County argues that the legislature has provided for judicial review by the circuit court rather than arbitration, it makes no showing that any public interests would be impaired if the estoppel doctrine were applied in this case. The County does not assert that the arbitration proceeding was in any way unfair to the County or contrary to the public interest. We conclude that our decision in favor of the deputy sheriff in this case would not unduly harm the public interest even if the County's interpretation of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 were to be adopted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u00b6 26. Accordingly, we conclude on the basis of the undisputed facts in the case and the reasonable inferences therefrom that the County is estopped from challenging the validity of the arbitration award as contravening Wis. Stat. \u00a7 59.21(8)(b)6 (1991-92). The circuit court order vacating the arbitration award is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the circuit court with directions to reinstate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><em>By the Court. </em>\u2014 The decision of the circuit court is reversed, and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-5\"> The deputy sheriff filed a petition with the circuit court to confirm the arbitration award.
