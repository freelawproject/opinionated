Gray died on April 6th, 1873, and his executors agreed upon a dissolution of the partnership on May ist, 1874, and empowered Joseph Brown to settle up the partnership affairs. The concern lost heavily in the panic of 1873, and a large amount of assets could not be collected, whereupon Brown at various times advanced his own money to pay debts of the firm, until the monies so advanced amounted to about $35,000. Brown thereupon brought a bill in equity against Gray\u2019s executors, setting forth the above stated facts, and asking for a decree for account and distribution. The answer admitted different allegations, averred that respondents had no knowledge of other allegations, but did not deny them. A receiver was afterwards appointed, who sold the remainder of the notes and property of Brown and Gray at a loss of over $65,000,. as compared with its cost upon the books. An examiner and master was appointed and made a report finding a balance of $19,949.86 due Joseph Brown. Various exceptions were filed, among which were that the master had no authority to state an account without a previous order of Court. Another was that the master before making his report had become counsel for A. H. Reynolds, assignee of Joseph Brown, and was not competent. The Court held a meeting at chambers, and made a decree ordering an account <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, and ordering J. Gray\u2019s executors to pay $19,949.86 to Brown or his assigns. Respondent afterwards moved to have the bill dismissed unless the assignee of Brown was made a party. This the Court refused in the following opinion, per:</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-4\">Woodward, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">The original bill in this case was filed on 31 March, 1877. The answer of defendants was filed on 1 November, 1877, and the replication thereto on 12 November, 1877. On 4 December, 1877, George R. Bedford, Esq., was appointed by the Court examiner and master, and in 19 February, 1878, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>presence of the counsel for the plaintiff, and of John Gray, one of the defendants, the examiner proceeded to take the testimony of witnesses. The taking of testimony was adjourned from time to time until finally, on the day of October, 1881, Joseph Brown was re-called for cross-examination by the defendants. This seems to have concluded the testimony, which was filed in Court on i February, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-4\">On the 17 May, 1878, Joseph Brown, the plaintiff, made a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, to Abram H. Reynolds, as assignee. No motion was made to place the assignee upon the record, as a party to the proceedings then pending, which went forward in the usual manner. The master having on 1, December, 1881, completed his report, gave notice to counsel that the same would be filed the 27th December, 1881. Exceptions were filed to the report by the counsel for the defendants. These exceptions were seven in number, but in none of them is there any claim that the bill is defective for want of proper parties. On the 20th January, 1882, the master overruled the exceptions, and his report, together with the exceptions and his opinion thereon, were filed of record'on 1 February, 1882. On the 8 February, 1882, the Court made an order fixing 4 March, 1882, at 10 a. m., for hearing the argument upon the report of the master and the exceptions thereto. On the 13th March, 1882, the Court filed an opinion concluding as follows: \u201cThe exceptions to the report of the master are dismissed, and the report is confirmed. Counsel will prepare and submit to the Court a decree in pursuance of this order.\u201d On the 18 March, 1882, counsel for plaintiff submitted to the Court the form of a decree in pursuance of the order of 13 March, 1882, to which the defendants\u2019 counsel objected. The objections were overruled and the decree was signed, whereupon the counsel for defendants filed his exceptions. Subsequently, on 30 March, 1882, the counsel for defendants filed the following motion: \u201cTo dismiss all proceedings in this case since the time of said assignment, by reason of the suit having thus become abated or defective for want of the- proper parties, and further, that the bill shall stand dismissed unless the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>er parties are brought upon the record, within thirty days of this date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">This motion has been argued by counsel, and is the matter now before us for disposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">We have considered the question presented to us by this motion, as well as the authorities referred to by the learned counsel, and have reached the conclusion that it must de denied for several reasons, which we proceed to state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\"><em>First. </em>The rule in equity practice is that a defect of parties to the bill, must be taken advantage of either by demurrer, plea, answer or at the hearing, <em>Daniels C. P., Ch. V., Sec. 3, P. 287. </em>When, however, it is manifest that a decree will have the effect of depriving third parties of their legal rights, the Court may order the case to stand over to enable the plaintiff to bring such necessary party before the Court, <em>Sharer vs. Brainerd, 29 Barb., 23. </em>In the present case the objection to the bill was not made until after the final hearing, nor is there any evidence before us, that injury will result to third parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\"><em>Secondly. </em>The defendants have waived their right to have the amendment to the bill now in question, both by failure to make the motion therefor at the proper time, and also by resting their objections to the bill and the proceedings before the master, on other grounds than the alleged failure of proper parties. \u201cIt is well settled that estoppels of record may grow out of the express or implied admission made by the parties in pleading. Not only will an express allegation or confession be conclusive on the party who makes it, but the traverse of one averment is a tacit admission of every other which is material and traversable in the same pleading.\u201d <em>Dutchess of Kingston\u2019s case, to Sm. L. C., 687. </em>In equity, when a man has been silent when in conscience he ought to have spoken, he shall be debarred from speaking when conscience requires him to be silent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\"><em>Thirdly. </em>The law does not require an assignee for the benefit of creditors, under a voluntary assignment, to be made a party to a bill pending at the time of the making the assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ment. The assignee is at liberty to make himself a party by filing a supplemental bill, and this is as far as the Law goes. <em>i Dan, C. P., Ch. v., Sec. 2, p. 281.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\">The motion is denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">Gray\u2019s executor then appealed, assigning the 'following-errors :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">The Court erred in the following particulars, to wit.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">1.

In ruling that complainant after having transferred tlu assets of Brown &amp; Gray to his own private account, and used them as his private capital for a period of years, could then as-surviving partner charge back to the account of Brown &amp; Gray, such losses as had befallen him in his said private business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-11\">5.

In proceeding with such hearing when it appeared that the files of the case had been taken from the Prothonotary\u2019s office by the complainant\u2019s counsel, contrary, to the rules of Court, and kept away during all the time from the date of the filing the master\u2019s report to the time of said hearing, so that defendants and their counsel had not opportunity to examine the same, or prepare for a hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-14\">8. In proceeding with such hearing when it was brought to' the attention of the learned judge, that the draft of the master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>report, marked and presented for consideration, was not the \u25a0draft which had been submitted to defendant\u2019s counsel for examination and exceptions.
