The Board of Health made answer \"that relator\u2019s apparatus consisted of barrels instead of tanks, and that the pump used by relator did not have a valve four inches in diameter, as provided by their regulations. The relator demurred to the return, but the Court overruled the demurrer and refused the mandamus; and this writ of error was \"then taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-3\"><em>H.

The barrels used by the relator were of good material and held 45 gallons each. That the pump of relator did not pass the material through the valve at all, and consequently that was wholly immaterial; but that the passage through which it actually went was fully large enough for the purpose. That the relator had complied with the requirements of the Act of Assembly of March 16, 1855, P. Laws, 89. It is true that the act says that the Board <em>\u25a0may </em>license, &amp;c., but when a proper case is made out it should be made to read <em>shall; </em>Supervisors vs. United States, 4 Wallace, 446; Shaeffer vs. Jack, 14 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 429.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-4\">\n<em>C.
