Nothing further appearing, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">The defendant, however, has offered a considerable amount of evidence, and from that we learn that there was a mining company of this name, and that this note was given for some shares of stock that were issued by the Company. It appears that in 1868, Mr. Steininger had purchased first, six shares of stock for which he paid $600., and then again, subsequently he purchased four shares of stock, according to his testimony, and to his present recollection he gave $200 in cash, and gave a note for $200. That note was not paid at maturity. It was placed in the hands of an attorney by the name of Mr. Wyckoff, who pressed Mr. Steininger for payment. Mr. Steininger called at his office and through some arrangement made between them, the note, which had been given in 1868, was delivered up and this note given in its place. [The suit is brought on this note, and the statement filed by the plaintiff seeks to recover on this note, and not upon the note given in 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">At this point I may as well answer the legal propositions that have been submitted. The plaintiff having brought his suit upon this note, his recovery must be upon this note. Whether the attorney had a right to give up the other note and take this in its place, we say to you is a question we are not called upon exactly to rule in this case; for the suit being brought upon this note the recovery must be upon it. The pleadings do not raise the question as to whether the attorney had a right to give up the note of 1868 or not, and we charge that so far as the note in suit is concerned recovery must be had upon it without regard to that of 1868.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>! What took place when this note was given? What agreement wTas made ? I will turn to the testimony of Mr. Steininger, and it is upon that testimony, gentlemen, that this question is eventually to turn when once you come to pass upon it. The jury will recollect that Mr. Wyckoff had this note in his possession, and Steininger went there upon invitation of Mr. Wyckoff to consult about the note of 1868, and there was considerable evidence given in regard to that, and as they got' along with the testimony, this question was put to Mr: Steininger : \u201cWhat did Mr. Wyckoff say about the old note, for \u201cwhat it was given at the time the note in suit was given? \u201cAnswer. \u2014 I showed Mr. Wyckoff the shares for which the old \u201cnote was given, and when this note was given I wanted to \u201cthrow up or give up the four shares to Wyckoff, but he said \u201c No\u2019; that he would make me another note, payable in one \u201cyear, and if nothing would come out of the shares he would \u201ctake them. I told Wyckoff how many shares of stock I had \u201cin this company. I said I had taken six shares at one time,\u2019 \u201cand had paid cash for them. I said I had another four \u201cshares, and for two of the shares I paid cash and for the other \u201ctwo shares I gave a note for $200, which was the note that \u201cMr. Wyckoff then had; I then gave the note in suit in \u201cplace of the other.\u201d The jury will consider from this what was the agreement between the parties at the time this note was given. Had Mr. Steininger under this testimony at the end of the year, if nothing came out of this stock, a right to go there and surrender up the four shares of stock, and receive back his note ? Mr. Steininger says that at the end of the year or about there, he went to Mr. Wyckoff\u2019s office, and he then gave up the four shares of stock to Mr. Wyckoff, who said that he would send them to Philadelphia to see whether they would be accepted or not. He retained the note \u2014 did not give it up. He never received the note back, and Mr. Steiningetf says that Mr. Wyckoff had said to him that he had never received any information from Philadelphia in regard to it. Steininger further says that Mr. Wyckoff did take back these shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>[Whether Mr. Wyckoff accepted these shares or not, it is for the jury to say under this testimony whether it was agreed between the parties that if nothing came out of this stock he had the right to surrender those shares of stock; and if the jury find that this Company at the end of the first year, after this note was given, was insolvent, and the shares were worthless so that nothing came out of them, and that that was the agreement between the parties, then Steininger had the right to go to Mr. Wyckoff and surrender those shares of stock to him, and even if Mr. Wyckoff did not agree to accept them, still Mr. Steininger, having complied with the terms of that contract, would be excused from the payment of this note. The whole question turns upon that point. Was it agreed that this note should be surrendered at the end of the year, if nothing came out of the stock ? Had Mr. Steininger the right to surrender this stock, and did he go there and offer to surrender up this stock? If the jury find that such was the agreement, and that he went there and did tender that stock and put it into the hands of Mr. Wyckoff, there can be no recovery.] On the other hand, if the jury find there was no such .agreement as that, the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict for the .amount of this note, with interest from the time you find the first interest due up to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-3\">Verdict for defendant. The Mining Company then took this writ of error assigning the admission of evidence of what took place when the parties were in Wyckoff\u2019s office, and the representations made when the stock was sold to Steininger, and the portions of charge in brackets, as errors. There had also been evidence that the company had executed a mortgage about 1869, which had been foreclosed, and the property sold, and it had also been sold for taxes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-4\">C.
