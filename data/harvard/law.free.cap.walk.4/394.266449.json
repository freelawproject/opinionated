Error to Common Pleas of Clinton County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-6\">On February 21st, 1874, Bridget Gallagher was adjudged insane and sent to the asylum at Danville. The County of Clinton had been charged with and paid her maintenance. On August 3, 1880, a rule was taken upon the City of Lock Haven to show cause why the Poor District of the city should not be certified as the place of Bridget Gallagher\u2019s last settlement. On June 25, 1881, the rule was made absolute. On July 16, 1881, the County of Clinton brought suit against the City of Lock Haven to recover the amount paid by said county for Bridget Gallagher\u2019s maintenance at the insane asylum. The city objected to so much of the claim as accrued more than six years prior to July 16, 1881-; and second, to any interest prior to the adjudication on June 25, 1881. The Court sustained the first objection, but overruled the second. A judgment was entered against the city, which, thereupon, took this writ of error, complaining of the allowance of the claim for interest.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-7\"><em>H.

That liability did not date merely from the time of the decree of the Court, but from the time when the pauper became a public charge, and this is, in effect, admitted, for no objection was made to charges previous to that date except so far as they were barred by the Statute of Limitations. But if this be so, on what principle can the plaintiff\u2019s claim for interest be disallowed? If Clinton County, by force of the Hospital Act, April 14, 1845, P- Laws, 440, paid bills for which the City of Lock Haven was liable, the latter certainly became a debtor to the former for the amount so paid, and it is impossible for us to comprehend what there is in a debt, such as this, which exempts it from an incident common to all other debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
