No. 424 January Term, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\">The facts of the case appear in the following portions of the charge of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\">This is an action brought to recover damages sustained in an accident caused, as alleged, by the Northern Liberties Gas-Company not keeping in repair their pipes for the conveyance-of gas, so that an explosion occurred at the house owned by the plaintiff, and injured his property. The first point I make is that this Company is not liable unless they were negligent. If an explosion occurred which was not the result of their negligence or failure of duty, there can be no recovery against them. The first question for your consideration is,, had this defendant Company any notice of any want of repair, or anything that required their attention with respect to their pipes, either their mains or service pipes, at or about these premises ? The testimony upon that point on behalf of the-plaintiff is, that from time to time for a long time before that, there was a smell of gas noticed in the neighborhood. Nobody undertook to locate particularly where it came from, except that there was a smell of gas observed from time to-time. The only party who appears to give direction to it was-Mr. Beck, and he says he smelled it strongest when the wind was from the northwest, but that was away from the region where this explosion occurred. Where the explosion occurred was to the east of Mr. Beck\u2019s; an east wind or a northeast. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>wind would likely bring it to him, but a northwest wind would indicate that the smell was coming from another quarter. I do not remember that anybody else but Mr. Beck gave any evidence that tended to indicate the locality. That one fact you must remember. There does not appear to be any evidence that the smell was noticed in the house where the injury occurred. The young lady who was on the stand this morning, was at work as late as half-past eleven o\u2019clock, preparing, to put clothes in soak, and she did not smell any gas then. It -was smelled, however, shortly afterward by the officers who went in, and I think Mr. Harris testified to it. If you are satisfied there was no gas in the house at the time when the young lady put the clothes to soak, when it was there a short time aftewards, there must have been a sudden influx into the house. Gas of that nature is apt to make its presence known. If there be a quantity of gas in the cellar, it will find its way to the upper part of the house, and you will find it more or less strongly in various parts of the house. But none of the witnesses testified that at any time preceding the explosion there was any smell of gas in the house. Mr. Harris says that he did not smell the gas, because he was accustomed to the smell. He did not say there was no smell of it. He gave a reason for not smelling it. That there was a smell in the street, I think can reasonably be concluded from the evidence. Where it proceeded from, is not satisfactorily shown. When this explosion occurred, the holes caused by the explosion which were inspejted \u2014 especially the next day, when they could make a more particular examination than they could that night \u2014 when the holes were inspected, it was found that the pipe for the supply of the gas was broken, and that there was a break also I think in the culvert. There is no testimony direct as to how these breaks were caused. Clearly there was a break in the water pipes, and it was shown that the earth had oozed or been washed away by the flow of the water, leaving the gas pipe without any support, and under the pressure upon it, and the want of support, it broke. The theory of the plaintiff is it was broken by the explosion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-3\">I want to say to the jury that from an inspection they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>can see the character of the pipe. \u25a0 These two plans (indicating diagrams in evidence) give the position of the pipe. You will have them out with you and you can examine them to aid you in your consideration of the question as to how the pipe was broken, whether by explosion or by strain. \u25a0 However, there appears somehow or other to have been a flowing of gas into this house from some cause or other, and an explosion consequent upon it. Now if this were sudden, without any premonition to the defendant Company, they would not be liable unless they had some notice either from the smell of gas in the street, or from direct information \u2014 of which there has been no testimony at all, other than that which Mr. Beck gave of having spoken to the meter inspector some six months before the explosion, that there was a smell of gas about there that required attention. Of course it was the duty of the Company if they had notice of an escape of gas to look after it, not only with respect to the public, but to their own interest, which should have led them to do so. Then as against this you have the testimony of the inspector upon these very premises within a week of the time of the explosion, who says that he discovered nothing wrong at that time. He had not been there previously for a week or ten days before the time of the explosion, having been in another district. You will take all this testimony and weigh one against the other, and arrive if you can at a just conclusion respecting the cause of the explosion. All That I can say is if there was anything to indicate to the company that there was a matter which required their attention and they neglected to give it attention or failed in their duty and the explosion occurred in consequence of it, they would be liable. If on the contrary, there was nothing to call their attention to it, and the explosion was caused by some sudden accident happening to the pipes which caused the gas to escape, permeating the earth and getting into the house and producing the explosion, then they would not be liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-3\">The Court then charged the jury as to the measure of damages if they found the Company guilty of negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-4\">The jury found a verdict for plaintiff for $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The Gas Company then took this writ of error, assigning the following errors :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-3\">1st.

Beck, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-4\">\u201cDid you give notice to any person connected with the Northern Liberties Gas Works that gas was escaping on Callowhill Street, between Second and St. John\u2019s Streets?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">The ground of objection being that the agency of the person notified must be first proved, and that the notice offered to be proved, was not such a one as naturally connected with the accident or the cause of it, the notice not being of a leak at the place of accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">2nd. The learned Judge erred in refusing to strike out the evidence of Jacob P. Beck, that he gave notice of an escape of gas to one Neill, some four or five months prior to the accident, the notice testified to not fixing any place or direction from which the escape came, and no evidence being given that the person named was in the employment of the defendant. The motion to strike out being on the grounds of want of definiteness, also want of proof of authority on the part of the recipient of the notice, and also that the time of the notice was too far off. His Honor saying, \u201cI overrule that. You have that already in your evidence.\u201d Thereby bringing his ruling within the exception already granted to the admission of the said testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">3rd.

That the learned Judge erred in refusing to affirm the defendant\u2019s eighth point, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\">\u201cThat under all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-5\"><em>Henry Budd.
