B. H. Lesher had purchased a piece of land by agreement from Ario Pardee, but had not paid the installments. On January 28, 1878, Alfred Lesher purchased this equitable interest from B. H. Lesher, and paid Pardee, and received a deed from Pardee on May 6, 1878. J. H. Harley had obtained judgment against B. H. Lesher, which was entered of record on June 29, 1877,. while B. H. Lesher had the equitable title. On this judgment B. H. Lesher\u2019s interest was sold on November 21, 1879, and purchased by Phineas Leiser, who thereupon issued proceedings to obtain possession before a justice. Notice was-served on Alfred Lesher on July 1st, 1880, and on July 3rd, 1880, the day fixed for the hearing, Alfred Lesher appeared, but judgment was rendered against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-4\">A certiorari was then taken to the Common Pleas, but the justice\u2019s judgment was affirmed in the following opinion; per</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">Rockefeller, P. J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">The Justice and Jury have found\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">1st. That the petitioner has become the purchaser of the-premises at a Sheriff\u2019s sale, and a Sheriff\u2019s deed for the same to him was duly acknowledged, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">2d. That Alfred Lesher, now in possession of said real estate, was in full possession of the same when the sale was-made and Sheriff\u2019s deed was executed and acknowledged, and that he came into the possession of the premises under B. H. Lesher, the defendant, in the judgment and execution,.. upon wh.ch the sale was made; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-9\">3d. That the person so in possession has had three months\u2019' no'.ice of such sa e, previous to the application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-10\">In the case of Brown vs. Gray, 5'Watts, 20, Gibson, Justice,, says, that \u201cwhen the above is made to appear, the complain- \u25a0 ant has entitled himself to recover. Nor will the respondent be suffered to defeat or delay him by allega ions involving principles of more difficult application than those intended to- \u2022 be. con m'tted to this tribunal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The same Judge observes on page 21, \u201con certiorari or writ of error the appellate court inspects nothing but the record, which, by the requirements of the statute, contains but a statement of the facts found for the complainant.\u201d In the case of <em>* </em>The Oakland Railway Company vs. Keenan, 6 P. F. Smith, 198, it is held that a certiorari to remove proceedings before the justice of the peace to recover possession of land bought at Sheriff\u2019s sale brings into the Court of Common Pleas nothing but the record of the proceedings before the magistrate and the jury, and on a writ of error nothing else is before the Supreme Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">This Court, therefore, has no power at this time to look into the title of these parties. I have examined the articles of agreement, the assignment thereof by B. H. Lesher to Alfred Lesher, as well as the list of judgments under which B. H. Lesher\u2019s equitable interest in the real estate was sold, but I am powerless to pronounce upon the title, and it is needless now to give an opinion if I have one. The title can be tried in action of ejectment. I cannot go behind the record in the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">The Act of Assembly requires proof of due service of the warrant upon the defendant or person in possession in case he fails to appear. If he appears, of course t \u00edere is no necessity for such proof. In case of a failure to appear there could be no hearing without proof that such service was made three days before the return. But the act further provides that if the defendant or other person in possession shall be duly summoned as aforesaid, or shall appear, the said justice shall proceed to inquire, etc. I take it, that if the party appears, it makes no difference if the summons has not been served three days before the return day. Even if it was material, there is nothing on the face of the record, so far as I have been able to discover, to show that the defendant at the time of the hearing, appeared and objected on the ground that he had not been .summoned three days before the return day. The return of the service shows service was not made full three days before the return, but the record of the justice is as follows: \u201cJuly 3d, 1880, both complainant and respondent present with their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>attorneys. Jury in this case sworn. Action opened and argued. The said justice and jury proceeded to inquire, etc.\u201d\u2019 The Court cannot go behind this record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">The proceedings of the justice and jury are affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">Lesher then took a writ of error complaining of the action of the Court in affirming the justice\u2019s judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-6\"><em>Wm. A. Sober, Esq., </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq\">argued that the Act of Assembly did not contemplate proceedings where an equitable interest was sold, but only where the legal title was. sold by the sheriff; McMullin vs. McCreary, 54 Pa., 230; Steel vs. Thompson, 3 P. &amp; W., 34; Brown vs. Gray, 5 Watts, 17,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>Oscar Foust, Esq., contra,,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW-\">argued that as Lesher appeared and made defense, he waived the statutory notice; Stroup vs. McClure, 4 Yeates, 523.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Common Pleas on May 14th, 1883, in the following opinion:</p>\n<author id=\"b381-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">This argument took a wide range. Much has been argued that is not properly before us. The judgment of the Court below was on a certiorari issued to the judgment of a justice of the peace. That was entered in a proceeding to obtain possession of land by a purchaser thereof at Sheriff\u2019s sale. The record of the justice shows jurisdiction of the party, and of the subject matter, and is sufficient to sustain the judgment which he entered. We cannot look beyond that record. The Court, below committed no error in affirming that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
