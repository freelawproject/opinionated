No. 38 January Term, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-12\">On January 1st, 1874, James W. Guthrie owned two adjoining tracts of land known as 111 and 119, containing 64 and 145 acres, respectively. In February, 1874, James Bonner went on tract No. 119, erected a shanty, and soon after put up a saw mill and began to manufacture lumber. Tract No. 111 was assessed for taxes for 1874 and 1875 'as unseated land, and sold for non-payment of taxes in 1876 to G. W. Arnold. Taxes were also levied on tract No. 119. The taxes were returned by the collector, and tract 119 was sold also to* G. W. Arnold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Arnold brought ejectment against Guthrie for the two tracts .and obtained an award of arbitrators, and took possession of tine land in 1880. W. R. and F. M. Reck had the saw mill in October, 1874, and manufactured lumber. Recks sold the saw mill to Guthrie on July 9, 1875, and took $100 in cash and some judgment notes. On August 6, 1875, W. R. and F. M. Reck entered up a judgment note against J. W. Guthrie for $2,-.661.05. On January 6, 1880, execution was issued and the \u2022two lots, hi arid 119, sold to Recks for $25, and a Sheriff\u2019s \u2022deed was executed to them dated January 29th, 1880. W. R. \u25a0and F. M. Reck then brought an action of ejectment against \u00abGuthrie and Arnold. Under instructions of the Court, the \u2022jury rendered a verdict for Arnold for lot 111. At the trial, the tax collector swore that he went to see the land, and that Guthrie told him to return it, it was all unseated. He accordingly returned it. The defendants contended that the collector\u2019s return was under the Act of April 17, 1866, P. Laws 961, conclusive of the fact that there was no personal property out of which the tax might be collected. The Court held that so much \u25a0of the Act as made the return conclusive was unconstitutional. This ruling forms the subject of the first error. The second error was the refusal of the Court to affirm defendant\u2019s fifth point as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\">That if J. W. Guthrie induced the collectors or any of them to return the land as having no personal property therein, 'lie and his privies in title, the plaintiffs in this suit, would be estopped as to G. W. Arnold, the purchaser at tax sale, from setting up as against his title that there was personal property on the land \u2014 and if the jury so find the facts their verdict should be for the defendant, G. W. Arnold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">The jury rendered a verdict in favor of G. W. and F. M. Reck for lot No. 119, containing 145 acres. G. W. Arnold then took this writ of error, the above stated assignments of error, being the only ones pressed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>Messrs.
