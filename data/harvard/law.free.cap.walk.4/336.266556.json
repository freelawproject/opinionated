The testimony of Weikel <em>&amp; </em>Spogen was rejected, and there being no evidence to overcome the force of the note the Court directed a verdict for the plaintiff. Weikel &amp; Spogen then took a writ of error complaining of the allowance of the amendment, and the rejection of the testimony of Weikel <em>&amp; </em>Spogen, and they also assigned as error that the jury had not been resworn after the amendment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-8\"><em>Messrs.
