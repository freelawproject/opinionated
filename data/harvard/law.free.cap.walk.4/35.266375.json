In. Equity. No. 135, January Term, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-12\">The master\u2019s report in this case was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-13\">The question at issue in this case may, we think, be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>duced to three affirmations on the part of the plaintiff, and three on the part of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">The plaintiff alleges :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">First. That he has a good and valid title to a farm in Lgmar Township, Clinton County, upon which there is a large and valuable spring, the water of which has been used ever since ,the occupancy of the land, by himself and those who preceded him in title, for all household purposes, for watering stock, and for all necessary uses in the cultivation of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">Second. That said spring is fed from Fishing Creek, through a subterranean passage of about one and a-half or two miles in length, that the place said passage begins is at a point on the farm of Jacob Heltman, one of the defendants^, where the natural channel of the creek leads the water against a high bluff at the foot of which are \u201csink holes\u201d into which the water flows, and from thence through said passage to the spring.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-7\">Third. That the defendants have diverted the waters of Fishing Creek from their natural channel by means of ditches dug and dams constructed for that purpose, and by these means have, at some seasons, entirely dried up the spring of plaintiff, thus inflicting on him irreparable damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-8\">The defendant affirms :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-9\">First. That the spring of plaintiff is not his only source of supply of water for household purposes, and tliat said spring is supplied from other sources than from Fishing Creek, through said \u201csink holes\u201d as alleged by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-10\">Second. That one of the ditches or channels which it is alleged is used for diverting the water of Fishing Creek from its natural channel, was dug, and one of the dams used for that purpose was built in the year 1814, under a grant in a Deed, and has been used so uninterruptedly since, thus giving them a right by prescription as well as by grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-11\">Third. That plaintiff lias a .full and complete remedy at law, and that he must pursue and establish his right to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>flow of water, as he claims it, in a Court of Law, before he can ask the interposition of a Court of Equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\">The facts are found to be as follows : James H. Porter, the Plaintiff, obtained by purchase April 1st, 1858, from A. H. Best, a farm in Lamar Township, Clinton County, containing one hundred and sixty-three acres, and allowance which has been used and occupied for farming purposes for many years. Upon this farm there was a large spring of water which has been used for household and farming purposes for more than fifty years, and which added greatly to the value and convenience of the farm. That at a place on the farm of Jacob Heltman, Fishing Creek, which is a stream of considerable .size flowing through Nittany Valley, strikes a bluff on its northern bank, at the base of which there are \u201csink holes,\u201d and into these a considerable portion of the water that flows down the natural channel of said stream flows or sinks. That the water, or a portion of it, after flowing through a subterranean channel of about one and a half miles in length, \u2022comes to the surface and feeds the spring of the Plaintiff' and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">That the supply of water in the spring of Plaintiff depends to some extent on the stage of water in Fishing Creek, whether it is high or low, but to a much greater extent on the fact as to whether the water of that stream has been allowed to flow uninterruptedly in its natural channel or has been diverted therefrom by artificial means. The spring has been known to fail in dry weather when the channel of Fishing Creek was unobstructed, but this was the exception and not the rule. The evidence shows that in almost every instance when the spring was dry and there was an ordinary stage of water in Fishing Creek, that the natural channel was obstructed, and upon the removal of the obstructions the water returned to the spring. Further, that the Defendants, by means of deepening the \u201cold channel,\u201d heightening the dam across the \u201cnatural channel\u201d at point marked \u201cA,\u201d by repairing the old channel at point marked \u201cWall,\u201d and thus preventing water from flowing from that channel to the sinks, and by opening \u201cnew channel\u201d (all these points being marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>in that way on exhibit \u201cA\u201d) did divert the water from the natural channel of Fishing Creek, and thus interferes with and prevents the flow of water to the Plaintiff\u2019s spring. That there are other sources from which Plaintiff could obtain water for the use of his household and farm, but only with additional cost and labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-4\">That on the 10th day of August, 1814, George Brown Lee and wife conveyed to Leonard Stump a tract of land containing sixty-one acres and eight perches of land, situated just below the \u201csink holes,\u201d by a Deed containing the following grant: \u201c'With the privilege of taking out water out of the channel of the Creek on the said George Brown Lee land,, and running it to the said Leonard Strurap land.\u201d That during the same year, in pursuance of said grant, a channel or ditch was dug, and a dam built, which diverted some of the water from the main channel of Fishing Creek and from the \u201csink holes,\u201d that said channel or ditch, and dam, have been used for that purpose since that time, but not uninterruptedly for twenty-one consecutive years, as claimed by Defendants. The testimony showing a number of interferences at different times, by persons whose springs were affected by such diversion of the water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">The conclusion at which we arrive from this finding of facts is: That the plaintiff is entitled to the use of so much of the water of Fishing Creek as would naturally flow into the \u201csink holes,\u201d and thence into the spring when the natural course of that stream is unobstructed, and that the Injunction prayed for must be granted, unless the Defendants by their grant, or by j)rescription, have obtained a right to obstruct its course, or unless the Plaintiff has a full and complete remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">We are led to inquire then :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">First \u2014 AVas there such a grant in the conveyance from Brown Lee and wife to Stump as justified the Defendants in diverting the waters of Fishing Creek from the \u201csink holes,\u201d and thus from Plaintiff\u2019s spring?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">It is well settled that the person through whose property a stream of water passes, has no property in the water itself; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that he may use it but must not divert or destroy it to the injury of the persons on the stream below him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">\u201cWater is a movable, wandering thing, and must of necessity continue common by the law of nature; so that I can only have a temporary, transient usufructuary, property therein.\u201d \u2014 Blackstone\u2019s Com., Shars. Ed., Yol. 1, Book <em>2r </em>page 17.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">\u2018 \u2018A proprietor of land over which a stream of water runs has, as against a lower proprietor, the use of only so much of the stream as will not materially' diminish its quantity or corrupt its quality. His right is not to be measured by the reasonable demands of his business.\u201d \u2014 Wheatly vs. Chrisman. 12th Harris, page 298.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">\u201cThe general principle undoubtedly is, that he who owns the soil has it even to the sky, and to the lowest depths. He may dig as deep, and build as high as he pleases. The maxim which embodies the principal is: \u2018Cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum et ad infernos.\u2019 If this general rule be applied to the case before us, the Plaintiff in error is justified in all that he did on the land of his principals by their direction. But there are some restrictions upon this general right of property, which it becomes necessary to notice. The natural streams of water existing by the bounty of Providence, for the benefit of the land through which they flow, are incidents annexed to the land itself. \u2014 4 Mason 400 ; 12 Wend 332. They do not begin by consent of parties, nor by prescription, but ex jure naturae, and therefore they are not extinguished by unity nor can they be obstructed or diverted to the prejudice of adjacent proprietors.\u2014 Sury v. Piggot, Popham 170 ; 3 Bulst. 339. It was said by Sir John Leach, in Wright v. Howard 1 Sim. &amp; Stuart 190. that \u2018every proprietor who claims a right either to throw the water back, above, or to diminish the quantity which is to descend below, must, in order to maintain his claim, either prove an actual grant or license from the proprietors affected by his operations, or must prove an uninterrupted enjoyment of twenty years.\u2019\u2014 1 Sim &amp; Stuart 190. It is true that there is a difference between water courses on the surface, and those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>which run under ground. \u2014Acton v. Blundell, 12 Mees &amp; Welsby 324. But this distinction does not authorize neighboring proprietors to disregard the necessities of each other\u2019s condition in respect to the latter. It is manifest that valuable rights may exist in both, and it is indisputable that wherever they do exist they must be protected by law. In limestone regions streams of great volume and power pursue their Subterranean courses for great.distances, and then emerge from their caverns, furnishing power for machinery of every description, or supplying towns and settlements with water for all the purposes of life. To say that these streams might be obstructed or diverted merely because they run through subterranean channels, is to forget the rights and duties of man in relation to flowing water. But to entitle a stream to the consideration of the law, it is certainly necessary that it be a water course, in the proper sense of the term. A spring gutter on the surface, is none the less a water course, although it is not equal in volume to a river. Small as it may be, if it have a clear and well defined channel, and a regular flow in that channel, it cannot be diverted to the injury of the proprietors below. \u2014 Jack v. Martin, 12 AVend 330. So a subterranean stream, which supplies a spring with water, cannot be diverted by the proprietor above, for the mere purpose of appropriating the water to its own use. \u2014 Smith v. Adams, 6 Paige 43\u20195. As the owner of the land below is bound to permit the stream to flow in its accustomed channel, and cannot erect obstructions so as to throw the water back on his neighbor above, so the latter is bound, as a correlative obligation, to permit it to flow to his neighbor below. Each has a right to a reasonable use of the water on his own premises, but he must so exercise his privilege as not to injure the rights of the other. \u2018Sic utere tuo ut alienum non loedas\u2019 is the maxim especially applicable to the enjoyment of these rights.\u201d ; AVheatlcy vs. Baugh, 1st Casey, 528.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">To the same effect is AVhetstone vs. Bowser, 5th Casey 59.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">Believing, therefore, that no right to divert the water was conveyed by said deed, and having found as a fact that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>bad no uninterrupted uses for Twenty-one years, and therefore cannot claim a prescriptive right, we are left the only remaining questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\">Was the Plaintiff compel1 ed to establish his right to the enjoyment of this water by an action at law before filing his bill and asking for an injunction ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">We confess that this to us seemed the most serious question of the case. After thorough investigation and mature deliberation, we have concluded that .the -present, proceeding,is right and that, even if it -were questionable, the defendants cannot, having proceeding thus far without objection, avail themselves of it now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">The case of Rhea vs. Forsyth, 1st Wright, p. 503 ; the North Pennsylvania Coal Company vs. Snowden, 6th Wright, p. 488. and cases therein referred to, were cited as authorities supporting this position that lie must so establish his right. All these cases seem to bo of such a character that a common law action would have fully decided a question of title, and not such an action as would necessarily have been instituted in a Common Law Court in this case to recover damages. The -question has however been so fully discussed by the Supreme Court in the very elaborate opinion if Judge Reade in Mc-Callum vs. The Germantown Y/ater Co., that it seems useless to refer to any other authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">The right of a Court of Equity to inform itself as to facts if it so desire, by the trial of an issue by a jury is so clearly affirmed and demonstrated, that it would be a work of supererogation for me to do aught but quote from that opinion or refer to it: The master here quoted from 54 Pa, pages 54 to 59.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">It wTould certainly not be just to dissmiss this Bill for want of jurisdiction after the Defendants had submitted themselves to the Court by answering the Bill, agreeing to the appointment of a Master and appearing clay after day in taking testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-9\">They refused the benefits of a demurrer, if benefits it had, by neglecting to avail themselves of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-10\">The language of Judge Woodward in Denny vs. Brunson, 5th Casey, p. 385, may. be pertinently quoted : \u201cThe appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>anco of Defendant and taking a chance for a decree in 'his favor on the merits, waived the irregularities of the preliminary proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\">I also refer to the following, on the same subject:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">\u201cWhether a case may be brought in the chancery forum, is only a question of form and not of jurisdiction; and the objection is waived, if not made in due season. It must be taken advantage of by demurrer, and not by an objection to-the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d \u2014 Brightly\u2019s Equity, page 49.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">\u201cThe second cause of demurrer to the jurisdiction is, that the subject of the suit is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. In general, when the plaintiff can have a remedy at law, as effectually as the one he seeks in equity, and that remedy is direct, certain and adequate, a court of equity has no jurisdiction; and theoefore a demurrer to the jurisdiction will be sustained. But to induce equity to refuse its aid to a suitor, it is not sufficient that he may have some remedy at law. An existing remedy at law to induce equity to decline the exercise of jurisdiction in favor of a suitor, must be an adequate and complete one. And where from the nature and complications of a given case, its justice can best be reached by means of the flexible machinery of a court of equity, in short, where a full, perfect, and complete remedy cannot be afforded at law, equity extends its jurisdiction in furtherance of justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">\u201cAn objection to the jurisdiction of the court, because the Plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, cannot regularly be taken after the Defendant has answered on its merits. After a Defendant lias put in an answer in chancery, submitting himself to the jurisdiction of the court without objection, it is too late to insist that the complainant has a perfect remedy at law, unless the court be wholly incompetent to grant the relief sought by the bill. Such an objection in those courts which have jurisdiction, both at common law and in equity, is considered as going rather to the form of the proceeding than to the jurisdiction ,of the court over the subject matter ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>audit can only be taken advantage, of;by, demurrer.\u201d\u2014 Brightly\u2019s Equity, pages 459 and 460.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-4\">The master, upon exceptions to his report, made the following amendment to his report of facts found :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">1st. That since 1814 until 1878 there has beeu a continuous flow of water through the \u201cold canal,\u201d but at no time, f jr twenty-one consecutive years, has the flow of water been uninterrupted as to quantity. The evidence clearly shows-that when the spring of the Plaintiff, and those who held it before him, was affected by the diversion of the water from the sink holes, the dam across the main channel of the creek, wThich had been erected for the purpose of turning the water into the \u201cold canal,\u201d was opened, and part of the water that-would have flowed into the \u201cold canal,\u201d if the dam had not been opened, ran down to the sink holes instead of into the \u201cold canal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">2d. That the water which flows through the \u201cold canal\u201d passes back into the main channel of the creek about one hundred feet below the lower sink holes, and that that water, with what flows down the channel past the sink holes, is the water supply for about ten families, their farms, stock, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">3d. The Defendants allege, that, the evidence in the cas\u00e9 does not establish such a water course between the sink holes und the Plaintiff\u2019s spring, as the law recognizes as a water course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-8\">The Court entered the following decree :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-9\">And now, May 27th, 1881, the above case came on to be heard, and after argument and consideration it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the report of the Master is confirmed and a decree be made with the following modifications :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-10\">That the said defendants be commanded forthwith to remove from the channel of Fishing Creek all obstructions placed in said channel by them, or by any person in the employ of them, or any of them for the purpose of diverting the waters of said creek from their natural channel, or that have the effect of so diverting said waters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-11\">That the said defendants be commanded forthwith to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>store the bed of the natural channel of Fishing Creek to its condition as it was in September, 1875, and that all obstructions be removed from the natural channel so that the bed of the natural channel and \u201cold channel,\u201d or canal, be placed on a level at the head of the old canal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-4\">That the said defendants be commanded to close the dug channel known as the \u201cnew channel\u201d in such manner that the flow of the water and the deviation thereof from the sinks by means of said \u201cnew channel\u201d may be completely and entirely stopped. And is further ordered and decreed that the said defendants, and every of them, their servants, employees, agents, workmen, and all persons under them, or any of them, are hereby perpetually restrained and enjoined from in any manner whatsoever, closing or obstructing said natural channel of Fishing Creek, and from changing, diverting, or in any way interfering with the natural flow of the waters of said Fishing Creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">Heltman, et al., then appealed, assigning different errors to the finding of facts, and one that the Master\u2019s fee of $300 was excessive for his report and holding eleven meetings and taking seventy-one printed pages of testimony. Another exception was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-6\">The Master erred in his conclusion that the present proceeding is right, and even if it were questionable, the defendants cannot, having proceeded this far without objection, avail themselves of it now, and in saying \u201cit would certainly not be just to dismiss this bill for want of jurisdiction after the \u25a0defendants had submitted themselves to the Court by answering the bill, agreeing to the appointment of a Master, and appearing day after day in taking testimony, they refused the benefits of a demurrer, if benefits it had, by neglecting to avail themselves of it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-7\">C.
