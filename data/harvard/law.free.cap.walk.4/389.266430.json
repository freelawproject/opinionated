No. 110, November Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-10\">This was an action of ejectment brought by Emma M. Perry, sole heir of John F. Perry, against Hugh Perry to recover two lots of ground. The plaintiff alleged that John F. Perry conveyed the two lots to Hugh Perry, under a parol agreement that he should pay certain debts of John P. Perry, and after he was reimbursed from the rents, or paid otherwise, he would reconvey the same. She also alleged that Hugh Perry was fully reimbursed, and refused to reconvey as agreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-11\">Jane H, Perry, the widow of John F. Perry, having released all her interest in the property to her daughter, was examined as a witness for plaintiff, and was allowed to testify, though objected to by the defendant. 1 he defendant was offered as a witness to contradict Jane H. Perry, but was rejected. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Hugh Perry then took a writ of error, complaining of the admission and rejection of testimony. Hugh Perry had executed a mortgage to John F. Perry, who negotiated; and thus raised money to pay part of the debt.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-12\"><em>Messrs. D. W. Bell and M. W.

It is also decided that this being the real purpose of the deed, the fact that it is through the instrumentality of a mortgage given by +he grantee, does not change the relation of the part.es, as between the grantor and grantee. In this case the testimony of Mr. Dicken, as to the use to be made of the deed, is clear, distinct and positive. If believed the testimony was satisfactory and convincing of the purpose intended. He was also strongly cortoboratsd. The effect of the evident\u00a9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of the defendant was to raise a question of credibility, merely, and this was rightly submitted to the jury. Jane H. Perry, the widow, was no party to the issue, and having released - her interest in the estate, she was a competent witness at common law. The Act of April 15, 1869, P. Laws, 30, did not apply to the case. Its purpose is not to disqualify, but to make competent, witnesses, who, before its passage, were incompetent. Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the Court below is</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
