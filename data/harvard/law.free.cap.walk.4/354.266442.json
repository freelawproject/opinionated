J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-9\">The plaintiff, on September 5, 1881, obtained a decree in equity against the defendant for the sum of $333.15 and costs. Nov. 11, 1881, an execution attachment was issued to \u25a0attach all monies in the hands of the Pennsylvania Railroad 'Company, the writ being returnable the first Monday in February, 1882. This writ was served on the defendant November 23, 1881. On December 29, 1881, the answer of the Rail\u25a0road Company, garnishee, was filed, admitting $101.66 in their hands belonging to defendant. The defendant gave notice to the garnishees that he claimed the benefit of the $300 exemption law, which said notice in writing -was returned with \u25a0the answer of the garnishee and filed with the same in the \u25a0case December 29, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">This notice was undoubtedly in time; the defendant wras not bound to make the claim to the officer serving the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-11\">It is sufficient that it was made before the term to which the writ is returnable.

The bill in \u25a0equity on which the decree in favor of the plaintiff was bad, was for a settlement of partnership accounts; the claim was <em>\u25a0ex contractu </em>and not in tort. It rests upon the implied contract of defendant to pay the plaintiff any balance due to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The defendant being entitled to the exemption and having made his claim in time, the rule for judgment against the garnishee must be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-4\">C.
