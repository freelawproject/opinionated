That in his last illness, the testator, in a conversation with him, said that if the legacy given by him to his son George was not sufficient for his comfortable support, that he should give him more. That, he is informed, and believes, that George J. Edwards, the son of testator, and father of petitioners, is without means to support and educate his said children as they should be maintained and educated in view of their interest under the will of their grandfather, Charles Edwards, deceased \u2014 but he avers and believes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that his inability to so maintain and educate them is caused by his intemperate and confirmed habit of drinking intoxicating liquors, which was known to testator at the time the will was executed. That the assets of the estate of testator in his hands amount to about $40,582.48. And he submits that the matters contained in the petition are matters for which the complainants <em>are not </em>entitled to relief from <em>the </em>Court, and he asks to be dismissed with reasonable costs, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-4\">On the presentation of said petition an Examiner was appointed to take testimony in the case and report the same to the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">From the testimony reported by the Examiner it is shown to the Court that Mary Ann Edwards was born on the 31st day of July, A.

The father\u2019s income, though considerable, bearing no proportion to the fortune bequeathed, and there being several children, the Court directed maintenance, taking the consent of the mother; 9 Ves. 470.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">In Fendall vs. Fash, in Chancery, there was a residuary bequest in favor of infant grandchildren, payable at the age of twenty-one years, or marriage, to the issue of those dead, with survivorship and accumulation until the time of payment, and \u2022a limitation over absolutely in case of the death of all without issue before that time. The father, in consequence of bankruptcy, being wholly unable to maintain his children, there was maintenance directed by the Court, taking the consent of the persons to whom the property was given over; 5 Ves., Jiv, 194, note, decided in 1779.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">If the father is in indigent circumstances, and the children are wealthy, the Court will allow for maintenance.

D., 232.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-9\">Thus it will be seen that in England Courts of Equity, for at least a century, while fully recognizing the common law obligation of a father to support his children, and generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>refusing him assistance from their estates, have, where the father is without estate o,r means, or without adequate means to maintain and educate them according to their future expectations, made an allowance out of the <em>interest </em>or <em>incomes </em>of the children\u2019s estate for that purpose, at first, on the judgment of the Court alone. More recently, however, after the report of an examiner or master, and testimony taken, showing the necessity and propriety of such allowance, and in cases of clear and manifest urgency, have not hesitated in breaking into the <em>principal </em>of a vested legacy, for the purpose of educating an infant legatee; i Ves.

In the matter of the petition of Charles Potts it was held that a <em>trustee </em>would be justified in appropriating the <em>interest </em>or even <em>part </em>of the principal of a fund placed in his hands for accumulation in trust for a minor, until such minor arrives at full age, for his <em>maintenance </em>and education, where there is no other property of the minor adequate for these purposes, where the minor is of tender age, and without any parent living, there being no devise over, and no third person interested in the fund; 1 Ash., 340. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">In Corbin vs. Wilson it was held that where a legacy has been given to an infant absolutely, payable at full age, with' no devise over, and no third person in any way interested in' <em>praesenti </em>or in <em>futuro </em>in the- fund, a court of equity would compel a <em>trustee, </em>holding such a fund, to appropriate or pay the <em>interest </em>where the legacy carried interest, or even the <em>principal, </em>where it did not, for the support, education and advancement of the infant. In this case the legacy was given by a grandfather; 2 Ash., 178.

These cases were all decided by King, President, who relies upon the English cases above cited, and quotes them as authority; 2 Ash., 411.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">In Seibert\u2019s Appeal, the Supreme Court say: Whether a legacy by a parent to his children, or grandchildren, be vested or contingent on their arrival at lawful age, the legatees during their minority may have, out of the <em>interest, </em>an allowance for their support and education decreed by the Orphans' Court; and the same doctrine is applicable, where the legacy has been given by one who has put himself in <em>loco parentis. </em>The grandfather, as well as the father, being required by the Act of June, 1836, Sec. 28, P.

Some of them will eventually and absolutely take the fund, and all have a common interest in it, and an equal chance of taking or surviving, although there is a direction in the will for the interest to accumulate for the benefit of the common fund until the death of their father, the time fixed for distribution. We have seen from the decisions of the Courts and the several Acts of Assembly cited, that on the application of their guardian, now made, we have the power to relieve their wants and necessities, by decreeing a suitable allowance out of the incomes of the bequest to them, to their guardian, for their proper maintenance and education, and have, using our discretion, authority to fix and direct -what sum shall be so paid for that purpose^ After a careful investigation of the whole case we are satisfied, that while it is absolutely necessary for the health, welfare and benefit of these infants, that allowance should be decreed for them, the sum stated by the witnesses, in the testimony reported by the learned Master, is too high for the present, as they are very young, and that the sum of one thousand dollars will be ample for one year.
