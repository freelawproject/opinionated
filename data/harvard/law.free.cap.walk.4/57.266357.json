Lardner of which he was sole executor. The will of Anna B. Lardner was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\">I give and bequeath to my sister, Elizabeth M.

Should, however, my husband die before me, then, in that case, I give and bequeath the sum of $10,000 unto and to the use of my friends, John Welsh and J. Somers Smith, of Philadelphia, Esquires, and to the survivor of them, and to the executors, administrators and assigns of such survivor, upon the trusts and uses following ; that is to say, to invest the same and to collect and receive the interest and income thereof, and after deducting therefrom the expenses of the trust, to pay the net income for the maintenance and education of my granddaughter, Virginia Lardner, during her minority, and from and after that period, to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u2022 the same to my said granddaughter for her sole and separate use during her natural life.

Lardner, Jr., had only a contingent interest in the estate at the time the will was made ; the contingency being the death of the appellee before the testatrix; and as appellee survived the testatrix he had no interest. The Court refused the citation in the following opinion, per :</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">Ross, P. J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">This record involves the construction of a will; and that \u25a0const' uc ion in this case is wholly dependent upon the intention of the testatrix. Of course, this is measurably true in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>construing every will, but it is peculiarly so liere, where no technical words, either of purchase or limitation ; no construction of the terms, \u201cheirs,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d \u201cor issue,\u201d and no-limitations upon \u201cdefinite or indefinite failure of issue\u201d arise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\">The grand cardinal rule for the construction of wills must-govern liere ; which is, that the intention of the testratrix shall be gathered from the four corners of the will, taken as a whole. It is unnecessary to pause-to cite authorities for this position, the cases will be found collected in Brightly\u2019s Dig.,, vol. 2, p. 2387, pi. 193.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">In every will there is a general design, a central idea, that is a general intent. When this is clearly ascertained, every other clause in the will , however much in conflict with this-central idea or general intent, is, and must be subordinate to it; Middleswarth vs. Blackmore, 74, Penna. St. Bep., 414 ; Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 64, Penna. St. Bep., 9; Schott\u2019s Appeal, 78, id. 40. So imperative is this, that even all purely technical rules of construction must yield to the expressed intention of the testatrix, if such intent be lawful; Beck\u2019s Appeal, 78, Pa. St. Bep., 432.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">This being the rule, the first inquiry is, what was the central idea ; the general intent of the testatrix. It was to make-her husband, if he survived her, her beneficiary. The testatrix and her husband were both aged people, and it is apparent, that after-a-moderate provision-for her sister, he was first in her mind. Her language is broad and comprehensive. She says (after having made the bequest to her sister), the rest, residue and remainder \u201cof my estate, real, personal and \u201cmixed, and all estates, whether real, personal or mixed, which \u201cI have the right or power to dispose of, I give, devise and \u201cbequeath to my most affectionate and beloved husband, \u201cBichard Penn Lardner, and to his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\u201d Larger or more comprehensive language than this cannot well be imagined; clearly, as far as the first and general intent is involved, the will ends here. The grand central idea is to give her husband everything, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>lie should survive her. He did so ; he is now living, and the will need not be perused further. It is a complete and perfect document, excepting only the appointment of an \u25a0exe.cutor. In the last clause she does this, and here again she expresses the same thought, and as it were, illustrates her general intent. She says, lastly, \u201cI nominate and appoint my \u201chusband, Richard Penn Lardner, to be the executor of my \u201clast will and testament, but should he not survive me, I then \u25a0\u201cconstitute my said friends, John Welsh and J. Somers Smith, \u201cto be the executors thereof.\u201d Here then in these clauses is a full, perfect and complete will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">Having thus fulfilled her first intent, the testatrix comes to her secondary scheme, which is conditional upon his death before she herself had departed life. If he survived her, he knew what she desired to be done. She trusted him to fulfill her wishes, but if he died first, it became necessary for her to express those wishes, and to appoint persons to see that they were carried out. As she had appointed executors other than her husband if he died before her, so she nominated trustees to execute her wishes, which she desired to be executed upon that contingency. Therefore, she begins with what may be termed her \u201csecondary\u201d will. She says, \u201cshould my husband die before me, then and in that case, I give and bequeath the sum of $10,000 unto and to the use of my friends, John Welsh and J. Somers Smith, of the City of Philadelphia, Esquires, and to the survivor of them, and to the executors, administrators and assigns of such survivor, * * * upon the uses and trusts following, that is to say.\u201d How does this springing use, or trust, come into existence ? Clearly it is conditional upon the death of her husband. If the English language can condition a bequest upon a contingency, surely it has been \u2022done here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">In this conditional bequest of $10,000, she provides for the education of her grandson, Richard Penn Lardner, Jr., upon the contingency of Virginia dying before her majority, or in the event of her dying without issue. It then occurs to her that the - contingency may not happen, still in the event of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>husband\u2019s death, to provide for the education and maintenance of her grandson, in these words she says, (and it is said in a separate paragraph), \u201cI give and bequeath the sum oi \u201c$3,000 unto and to the use of the said John Welsh and J. \u201cSomers Smith, and to the survivor of them, in trust, to invest \u201cthe same, and to collect the interest therefrom, and after deducting the expenses of the said trust, to pay the net income \u201cfor the support and education of my said grandson, Richard \u201cPenn Lardner, Jr., during his minority and upon attaining \u201cthe age of 21 years, to pay the principal to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-4\">Is this more than a separate provision for him, subject to the survivorship of her husband, and also to provide for the non-happening of the contingency expressed in the trust. It is said the two bequests are irreconcilable. I am at a loss to see why. Virginia might live to be an old woman, whether a maiden or a wife with children, the term of whose life might end before her. The education of her grandson was a mattei that must be accomplished in his minority. His support, during that period of comparative helplessness, was most material, and both were there provided for in any event, if her husband died before her. If he survived her, she treated him as her \u201cmost affectionate and beloved husband.\u201d After having made these bequests, indicating that they were preferred benefits, she goes (on ?) she says, still preserving her first general and central intent, \u201cthe rest, residue and remainder of my estates, \u201creal, personal or mixed, which I have the power to dispose of, \u201cI give, devise and bequeath, in case my husband shall die \u201cbefore me, unto the use of the said John Welsh,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">It is a broad, palpable fact that these trustees are not evoked to perform any act, to execute any intention, or to discharge any trust, save in the event of the death of her husband before her will became operative. It is, therefore, ruled that the testatrix intended to bequeath no interest and to vest no benefit upon any of her legatees, save only her husband, unless he died before herself. If he lived to survive her, he was to be master absolutely of all, in that event she thought and believed he would protect her contingent beneficiaries. If he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>died first, she protected them by her trusts. The Court does not believe that the construction of other wills, based upon the intention of the testator, can, or does throw much light upon any other testament. Each will is a law itself, and must be construed from itself as a whole. Different minds will apprehend, devise meanings, and construction will be as varied as the several instruments themselves. Still the ruling here is-in very complete accord with Biddle\u2019s Est., 4 Casey, 59.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">It is said, however, that the $8,000 bequest to Richard Penn Lardner, Jr., is an independent bequest, and that in construing the will, it should be read, as if placed before the bequest of the rest, residue and remainder. Why should it be so ? It is true, clauses in a will may be transposed. True it is that a codicil may bequeath a sum after the will has disposed of the rest, residue and remainder, but in these cases, the intention, as in the case of a codicil, is clear; and in all others must be transposed. A separate paragraph, such as this is, of itself alone, is no demonstration of such an intent; and when it is remembered that the will gives all to the husband in the event of his survivorship, that it is full; complete, and perfect in that event, that other executors are not created save upon the contingency of his death ; that no trustees are evoked save upon the same condition; and finally, that trustees are the legal takers under this will of the bequest invoked, the conclusion is irresistible, that it is conditional upon the death of her husband. As he survived her, and is still living, Richard Penn Lardner, Jr., took nothing under her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">The conclusion has been reached with regret, but it is so obvious that it is imperative. And now, December 1, 1879, after argument and due consideration, citation is dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">R. P. Lardner, Jr., then appealed to the Supreme Court,, complaining of the decision of the Court below that he had no intei\u2019est in the estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-7\">E.
