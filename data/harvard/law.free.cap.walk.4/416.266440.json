No. 123, July Term, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-14\">In July, 1S81, the firm of Steck &amp; Paschall, engaged in the morocco manufacturing business, were indebted to various-parties to the amount of about $54,000. Anthony Elton being a creditor for about $51,000. In 1879 Steck &amp; Paschall had borrowed $900 from H. B. Perkenpine and had made a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>payment thereon, reducing the debt to $804.50. It was proposed that a new partnership was to be formed by Elton joining the firm and contributing his claim; and books were-prepared and schedules made out in pursuance thereof. However, instead of forming a new partnership, it was finally concluded that Elton should buy out the firm of Steck <em>&amp; </em>Paschall, The stock account amounted to $27,194.29; bills receivable, $10,853.10. They executed a bill of sale for their stock and bills receivable to A. Elton, and further executed and delivered' two judgment notes amounting to $15,508.89 in favor of A. Elton; total, $53,556.28. Afterwards Perkenpine demanded payment of the $804.50 from Elton and upon his refusal to-pay, an action in assumpsit with common counts was brought, together with a special count- averring that Elton promised Steck &amp; Paschall to pay this debt, and another that he promised Perkenpine to pay the debt. Elton plead non-assumpsit,, and further that he received no consideration for the alleged promises averred in the declaration; and that said promises as averred in the declaration were to pay the debt of another,, and not being in writing are not enforceable. Upon the triaL there was a dispute in the testimony whether or not Elton was to pay the debts of Steck &amp; Paschall. Testimony of three, creditors of Steck &amp; Paschall that their claims were paid by A. Elton was objected to; and the admission of this evidence forms the subject of the first three assignments of error. On-behalf of A. Elton the Court was requested to charge : \u201cThat unless a consideration passed to'the defendant he is not liable\u00bb the alleged promise not having been in writing, and not made at the date the debt of Steck <em>&amp; </em>Paschall to the plaintiff was originally contracted.\u201d The Court charged : \u201cUndoubtedly the promise could not be enforced' unless a consideration passed. [The transfer of the assets of the firm would be a sufficient consideration.\u201d] (4th error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">The Cmrt negatived the three following points of the defendant :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">[That unless the jury find the consideration moved from the plaintiff himself to the defendant, the defendant is not, liable in this case.] (5th error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>[That unless the jury find that Steck &amp; Paschall were released by the plaintiff- from the liabilities, and the defendant substituted as a debtor upon the alleged promise, the defendant is not liable.

It was not necessary for Perkenpine to give up his recourse against Steck &amp; Paschall; Dock vs. Boyd, 93 Pa, 92. The contract of Elton was to pay his own debt incurred by the purchase of the Steck <em>&amp; </em>Paschall property; Wynn vs. Wood, 97 Pa., 216.

In fact the debt due to the defendant in error is one of those mentioned in the trial balance, containing the statement of debts which the. plaintiff in error assumed to pay, although it was not specified in the judgment note given. The Court made the proper distinction, substantially recognizing the rule laid down in Wynn\u2019s Administrator vs Wood, 1 Out, 216; that if one deliver money or personal property to another under a promise of the latter to deliver it or the proceeds to a third person who. has a beneficial interest therein, the latter can maintain an action therefor against the promisor. We see no error in the. admission of evidence nor in the answers to the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
