A copy of the account being twelve items of $10 each dated from July 5th to Sept. 20, 1880, was filed; and defendant filed two affidavits of defense which were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-11\">Robert Wolcott, the defendant above named, being duly sworn, says that he has a just and complete defense to the-above claim of the nature following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-12\">1. He denies that the plaintiff, Anne S. Schwarz, ever acted in the capacity of a nurse to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-13\">2. That the said plaintiff lived in the house adjoining the-defendant's and such attention as she gave to the defendant was purely voluntary and such as a neighbor would naturally give without solicitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>3. That he never contracted with the said plaintiff, nor with any other person in her behalf that she should perform the duties which constitute the grounds of her claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\">4. The defendant is advised that the copy filed, called \u201ca copy of the plaintiff\u2019s book of original entries,\u201d is not such a copy as will entitle the plaintiff to judgment for want of an affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">All of which the defendant avers to be true and expects to be able to prove at the trial of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">Robert Wolcott, the defendant above named, being duly sworn, says that he has a just and complete defense to the above claim of the nature following, namely :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-7\">1. I deny that the plaintiff, Anne S. Schwarz, ever acted in the capacity of a nurse to me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-8\">2. The plaintiff lived in the house adjoining my own, and such attention as she gave to me was purely voluntary, and such as a neighbor would naturally give without solicitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-9\">3. Grateful for such attention, while holding myself under no legal obligation for it, I have directed the trustee named in a deed of trust, executed by me on the 14th December, A. D., 1880, and recorded in Deed Book L W, No. 131, p. 317, etc., in the office for recording deeds in the county of Philadelphia, which deed I produce for the inspection of court, to pay to the said plaintiff, upon my decease, the sum of fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-10\">4. I never contracted with the said plaintiff, nor with any other person in her behalf, that she should perform the duties which constitute the grounds of her claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-11\">5. The charges of the plaintiff are excessive and unusual for the duties alleged fohave been performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-12\">6. I am advised that the copy filed, called \u201ca copy of the plaintiff\u2019s book of original entries,\u201d is not such a copy as will entitle the plaintiff to judgment for want of an affidivit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-13\">All of which I aver to be true and expect to be able to prove at the trial of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The Court granted judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Wolcott then took this writ of error complaining of the entry of judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-4\"><em>Theodore Barrett, Esq., </em>for plaintiff in error, cited :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQt\">Moeck vs. Littell, 82 Pa., 354; Bronson vs. Silverman, 77 Pa., 94; Hugg vs. Scott, 6 Wh., 274; Thompson vs. Clark, 56 Pa., 33; Liebersperger vs. Bank, 30 Pa., 531; Hale\u2019s Ex. vs. Ard\u2019s Ex., 48 Pa., 22; Harbison vs. Hawkins, 32 Sm. 142.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-5\"><em>John H.

The copy of book account filed shows the claim to be for nursing the plaintiff in error in his sickness. While the affidavits deny the defendant in error \u201cever acted in the capacity of a nurse to him,\u201d yet they are very careful not to deny that she nursed him. It matters not that he did not contract with her to perform such duties. If she rendered the services named, the law implies an obligation on his part to pay for them. His averment that the charges are excessive for such services is too general. He does not aver what part or portion of the charge is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
