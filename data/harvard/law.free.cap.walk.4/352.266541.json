He boarded with her at the time. On June 12, 1879, he entered up the note, and issued execution thereon on January 29,1881. Certain goods levied on were-claimed as belonging to her husband\u2019s estate. On February 11th, 1881, Mrs.' Clark brought suit before a Justice of the Peace against Patrick Quinn for board; and on February 16th,. 1881, the Justice gave judgment in favor of Mrs. Clark for $140. Patrick Quinn then appealed to the Common Pleas. On February 13, 1883, the jury rendered a verdict against-Quinn and in favor of Mrs. Clark for $148.21; and judgment was entered thereon on September 27th, 1883. Patrick Quinn, however, had owed William Nil\u00f3n about $40 for board; and on June 1st, 1882, transferred the judgment against Mrs. Clark for $106 and interest in payment of his debt of $40. After the judgment in favor of Mrs. Clark wTas rendered, Nil\u00f3n issued execution. Mrs. Clark then obtained a rule to set off the judgments; which, however, was discharged in the following opinion, per</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b352-9\">Woodward, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-10\">This seems to be a hard case for the plaintiff, and if we could grant her the relief sought, without violating our duty to the-law, we would gladly do so. But it seems that Quinn assigned his judgment against her to Nil\u00f3n some months before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>she obtained her own judgment, and this assignment was founded on a legal consideration existing between the parties. This, under the authorities, disposes of the right of set off, and the rule must be discharged. We refer to Horton vs. Miller, 44 Pa., 256; Ramsey\u2019s Appeal, 2 Watts, 228; Hopkins vs. Beebe, 26 Pa., 85. The rule is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\">Mrs. Clark then tendered to Nil\u00f3n the sum of $45.30, being the full amount of Quinn\u2019s indebtedness to Nil\u00f3n, with interest and costs, and, on his refusal to accept the same, took a rule to offset the balance of the judgment, after payment of the $45.30, with the judgment obtained by her. The Court discharged the rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-5\"><em>J. L. Lenahan and E. G.
