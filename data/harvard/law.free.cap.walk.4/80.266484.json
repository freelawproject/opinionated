Their establishment was designated the \u201cExcelsior Stove Works.\u201d In 1864 they began to manufacture the \u201cExcelsior\u201d range. They advertised largety, and it came into general use. It became very popular ; so much, so that parties advertising houses for sale would name the \u201cExcelsior\u201d range as one of the conveniences to recommend the property ; and builders in Philadel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>phia frequently stipulated for the \u201cExcelsior\u201d range in their specifications. More than forty thousand were sold in fifteen years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-4\">In 1878 the defendants began to make a range with similar characteristics, and placed upon it the woxds \u201cNew Excelsior,\u201d \u201cImproved Excelsior\u201d and \u201cExcelsior.\u201d It differs only in external ornamentation from the plaintiffs\u2019, and is sub stantially the same. Its component parts correspond in size and shape with the component parts of the plaintiffs\u2019 range; The plaintiffs\u2019 range can be repaired by castings made 'from the pattern of the defendants\u2019 range. Upon the several parts of the defendants\u2019 range the word \u201cExcelsior\u201d is imprinted. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJ2\">The defendants advertised in the Public Ledger as follows</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AdY\">\u201cExcelsior ranges for sale. Excelsior ranges of the different kinds and sizes ; double ovens, single oven right and left; and hot air Excelsiors always on hand for sale to dealers and builders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">Grates, cross-pieces, water-backs, or cast iron fire-plates, to fit all Excelsior ranges, always on hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">\u201cStuart, Peterson <em>&amp; </em>Co.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFv\">\u201cBroad and Noble Streets.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajf\">In addition they placed a sign-board above their \u2022.office at Broad and Willow streets, with the words \u201cExcelsior Ranges\u2019\u2019 upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">It is clearly established that \u201cExcelsior\u201d upon .plaintiffs\u2019 ranges indicated to the trade, and to the .public, 'that such ranges were made by them. Their range is widely known.to the trade and to the public as the \u201cExcelsior\u201d range. Builders generally connect it with the firm of Sheppard &amp; Co.,, and it is generally known as Sheppard\u2019s \u201cExcelsior.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\">There can be no doubt that direct injury has resulted to; the plaintiffs from the conduct of the defendants. It has suggested the idea that plaintiffs had ceased to manufacture ..the \u201cExcelsior\u201d range; and that their range had been improved by: the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-9\">The defendants deny that the use \u25a0 of the w\u00f3rds ''\u2018.\u2018New Excelsior\u201d and \u201cImprove 1 Excelsior\u201d is either intended or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>calculated to deceive the public, or to induce them to purchase as and for the ranges of the plaintiffs. It may be that the defendants did not intend to deceive the public, but it can scarcely be said that these devices were not calculated to do so. What other idea is suggested by the words \u201cNew Excelsior\u201d and \u201cImproved Excelsior,\u201d than that a newer improved \u201cExcelsior\u201d is made ? It can be neither a \u201cNew Excelsior,\u201d nor an \u201cImproved Excelsior,\u201d without suggesting an important and valuable change in the old \u201cExcelsior.\u201d Of what use can these names be unless they call to mind the old \u201cExcelsior ?\u201d And of what use would that bo unless it also recalled the usefulness and popularity of the old ? It should not be forgotten in this connection that the defendants say their \u201cobject was simply to produce a light cheap range which muid be sold in competition with the cheap range of the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\">If this were otherwise it may not be said that the assumption of the name \u201cExcelsior\u201d was not calculated to deceive the public and injure the plaintiffs. It may be that the defendants did not intend to injure the plaintiffs; but if their conduct produced injury, they must be held to have intended, that injury. In Horn vs. Last, 10 Jur. 106, it was held, refusing a motion to dissolve an injunction, that defendants having made so complete a copy of plaintiffs\u2019 mark, must be taken to have done so with an intent to give an advantage to which they were not entitled. Judge Paxson in Dixon Co. vs. Guggenheim, <em>7 </em>Phila. R. 408, cites English cases which held that: \u201cA man though not intending an injury to another should not be allowed to adopt the marks by which the goods of another are designated, if the effect of adopting them would be to prejudice the trade of such other person. It is not necessary to aver or prove wrongful intent on the part of another.\u201d If, therefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to use the word \u201cExcelsior\u201d as a trade-mark, it would follow that the defendants should be enjoined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">The defendants contend that the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim the word \u201cExcelsior\u201d as applied to their ranges as a trademark, because:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>1. Hicks, Wolf &amp; Co., of Troy, New York, have used 'the same word upon a flat-top range since 1861 continuously.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-4\">2. The word is a fancy title for stoves of various kinds in the trade generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">3. Orr, Painter &amp; Co. made and sold similar ranges with the word \u201cExcelsior\u201d upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">4. The ranges of defendants have improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-7\">5. That defendants\u2019 ranges are different.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-8\">6. The word \u201cExcelsior\u201d as used by plaintiffs does not indicate that they are owners of the ranges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-9\">7. The plaintiffs have placed other names upon some of their ranges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-10\">8. The plaintiffs have put the names of buyers upon the ranges in near connection with the word \u201cExcelsior,\u201d and have thereby abandoned the word to general use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-11\">9. Defendants have been making them for two years, and the plaintiffs did not forbid them until about a year ago.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-12\">The first and second reasons may be disposed of by the remark that the evidence shows that the ranges referred to were not the same as plaintiffs. The plaintiffs do not claim property in the word \u201cExcelsior.\u201d Their claim is that they have first appropriated that word to a specific article of their manufacture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-13\">To the third it may be said that it does not appear that plaintiffs permitted or acquiesced in the use of the word \u25a0\u201cExcelsior\u201d by Orr, Painter &amp; Co.; or that they knew of such use of it as would imply acquiescence or permission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-14\">It is perhaps sufficient to say that uo improvement in the range or difference in appearance would justify the defendants in the use of the word \u201cExcelsior.\u201d \u00edf the improvements and changes make a different kind of range they would have the right. But the improvement and changes have not substantially altered the character and appearance of defendants\u2019 ranges from that of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-15\">It is also contended that the word \u201cExcelsior,\u201d as used by the plaintiffs, is not a trademark, but a fancy name to indicate a particular kind of stove, because it does not indicate origin or ownership. To sustain this position many authorities were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cited, but that which was most relied upon was -Ferguson vs. Davol Mills, 7 Phil. 256, in which Allison, P. J., says : \u201cThe simplest case <em>of a, </em>trademark is the name and address of the claimant, and it is absolutely requisite that a device or symbol should perform the office of a fingerboard ; should indicate the name and address of the manufacturer to invest it with the attribute and entitle it to the protection of a trademark.\u201d' This language is clear, rigorous and decisive ; and there can be no doubt that the cause was determined upon this principle alone. It will be seen from an examination of the authorities-cited by the learned Judge, that he is not fully sustained by them in this advanced position. They affirm only that a trademark should indicate the \u201ctrue origin or ownership of the article offered for sale.\u201d The learned Judge was justified^ perhaps, in thus giving a sensible form to what was before a meaningless phrase, adopted and continued in almost every trademark case without necessity, without application to the cases, and without definition or explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">In the Dixon Co. vs. Guggenheim, 7 Phila. 408, Judge Paxson adopts as \u201cwell sustained by reason of authority,\u201d the doctrine of \u201ctrue origin or ownership.\u201d Tn justice to him it should be observed that it was not raised in the case before him, and his attention was not directed to its full import. In his very able and carefully prepared opinion he cites the decisions which declared \u201cRevere House,\u201d \u201cNew York Hotel,\u201d \u201cThe Captain\u2019s Live and Let Live Oyster and Dining Rooms,\u201d to be trademarks. He also says : \u201cThe name of a newspaper is a trademark and with proper judicial indignation adds ; \u2018Can it be supposed that if some one were to commence the publication in this city of,a Public Ledger of the same size, price and style as the one published by Mr. George W. Childs, that a Court of Equity, upon a proper application, would not promptly arrest the career of such a piratical ci aft by an injunction !\u201d And yet neither of these words indicate \u201corigin or ownership.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">It is not now important to ascertain how and where this doctrine-originated. It has been followed as an axiom. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>yet to the thoughtful it must alvVays have been a. perplexing enigma.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-3\">It is submitted that in neither of the cases cited by Judge Allison is the question of \u201ctrue origin and ownership,\u201d raised, or discussed or defined. .The question raised and decided was that words which designated the article itself, or its attributes, \u2022were not trademarks. This is so in all the cases which we have been able to examine.' As illustrative of all we may, take the language of C. J. Duer in Amoskeag Co. vs. Spear 2 Sand. S. C. R. 589 : \u201cA mark can only be protected as a trademark when it is used merely as indicating the true origin and ownership of the article offered for sale ; never when it is used to designate the article itself.\u201d We may be allowed in this connection to say that we have not been able to find any case except Ferguson vs. Davol Mills, in which the doctrine of \u201ctrue origin and ownership\u201d is distinctively avowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">It might, perhaps, be useful at this stage to ascertain what a trademark is, and what it indicates. In Stokes vs. Landgraff, 17 Barb. G08, Strong, J., says : \u201cThe principle is well settled that a manufacturer may, by priority of appropriation of names, letters, marks, or symbols of any kind to distinguish his manufacture, acquire a property therein, as a trademark.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">\u201cThe fight of trademark is said to be best termed an exclusive right arising from first use.\u201d \u2014 Bouvier.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">. \u201cThe rule sometimes laid down on this subject is : that if . a name, sign, mark, brand, label, word, or device of any kind, can be advantageously used to designate the goods, property, or particular place of business of a person engaged in trade, manufacture, or any similar business, he may adopt and use such as he pleases, which have not before been appropriated.\u201d Story\u2019s Equity, Sec. 951.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">\u201cThe physiology of the thing called a trademark must be .examined and carefully analyzed. It has an individuality of nature. Meaningless in itself, when placed in a certain juxtaposition, it involves an idea. It virtually says that the vendible object to which it is attached is the workmanship or the selected article of the owner of the mark. It is intended to strike the eye, and sometimes the ear, by its sound when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>spoken of, and thus incite inquiry. It should possess such salient features as might at once arrest attention, and put the intended purchaser on the alert.\u201d Brown on the Law of Trademark, Sec. 88.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-4\">\u201cThe Amoskeag Manufacturing Co. vs. Spear,- Chief Justice Duer says : \u201cEvery manufacture has an undoubted right to-distinguish his goods by -peculiar mark or device in order that they may be known to be his.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">How is a mark or device to indicate \u201ctrue origin or ownership\u201d or to indicate the name and address of the manufacturer ? \u2022 In and by itself alone this is impossible. It is only by use as the device of him who distinguishes his goods by it in order that they may be known as his, that it can ever indicate \u201ctrue origin or ownership.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">In Allegheny Fertilizer Company vs. Woodside, 1 Hughes, page 115, Giles, J., says : \u201cBut it is argued that the name adopted (\u2018Eureka\u2019 did not sufficiently indicate \u2018origin or ownership\u2019 to be regarded as a trademark. It served to distinguish the complainant\u2019s manufacture quite as effectually as names ever serve to distinguish things.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">In the Meriden Britannia Co. vs. Parker, 39 Conn. 459, the trademark consisted of the words \u201c1847 Rogers Bro., A 1.\u201d The Rogers Bros, were superintendents of the petitioners. The respondents contended that the said trademark did not indicate the true origin of the goods. Held, that the representation that the Rogers Bros, were the manufacturers was true in -a certain sense, but that the petitioners were in another sense the mancfacturers. \u201cLike all other symbols and devices used as trademarks, its import was not at first perhaps fully understood. The effect as well as the value of a trademark is the work of time and expense. This probably was no exception to the rule. However this may be, it seems to have been well understood by the trade at the date of this petition, that goods bearing that stamp were manufactured by the petitioners. Held, that the trademark sufficiently indicated the origin and ownership of the goods.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-10\">In the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. vs. Clark, 13 Wallace 311, Strong, J., says : \u201cHence, the trademark must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>either by itself or by association, point distinctly to the origin or ownership of the articles to which it is applied. The first appropriator of a name or a device pointing to his. ownership, or which by being associated with articles of trade has acquired an understood reference to the originator or manufacturer of the articles, is injured whenever another adopts the same name for similar articles.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\">In other words, the evidence must show the first \u2022 appropriation of the device by the claimant; its application by him to his goods or business : and that the trade or public recognize the article or business by that device as made or sold by him, or belonging to him. In no other way can a mark or device indicate \u201ctrue origin or ownership.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">The evidence in this case is conclusive that the plaintiffs first appropriated the word \u201cExcelsior\u201d to a specific article of their manufacture; that they have continuously used it for the last fifteen years, during which time they have made and sold more than forty thousand; that the whole trade recognized them as the makers of the articles to which the word 1\u2018Excelsior\u201d was attached. This device, therefore, pointed out the \u201ctrue origin and ownership,\u201d of the goods, and thereby became a trademark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">It woxrld be useless to waste time in collating the single and collective words and devices which have been held to be trademarks. The word \u201cExcelsior\u201d alone has been repeatedly held to be a good trademark. In Winsor vs. Clyde, 9 Phil. 513 (affirmed by the Supreme Court), \u201cKeystone Line\u201d was held to be a good trademark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">It is further contended that inasmuch as the plaintiffs, at the request of a few purchasers, placed another name upon a few of their ranges, and erased the word \u201cExcelsior,\u201d they thereby abandoned their right to the use of the word as a trademark. These instances can only be regarded as special contracts for the goods without the trademark. They can in no sense be regarded as a representation to the public of the abandonment of the trademark and the adoption of another. It is the purchaser who changes the names and it is nowhere held that the purchaser of an article protected by a trademark' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>is bound .to maintain .the name upon the article. He buys, for, use. and-consumption, and may retain the mark or not. as he-pleases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-4\">The province of a trademark is to bring seller and buyer together,, that the one may sell his merchandise and the other obtain th.e particular goods the reputation of which has won \u25a0his confidence. When this is done the office and object of the trademark is accompished. The seller has no longer any control over or interest in the article. It belongs wholly to the purchaser, and with it the incident, the trademark. As he may consume or destroy, or alter or change the article, so may he its name. What he may do by himself he may do by another ; what he may do by another, he may do by the seller. If he can do this after purchase, he may certainly contract to have it done before purchase. This is a matter in which the general public can have no interest, and therefore have no interest, or concern which should be considered. It in no way affects the usefulness of the article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">But why . should it be held that the manufacturer must place the trademark upon all his goods ? He may prefer, for his own advantage and the protection of the public, to place it only upon his best, and leave the inferior nameless, or give them another name. Honesty and fair dealings, and his own interest, would suggest this. And if this be done it should not be regarded as an abandonment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">The evidence discloses the fact that the plaintiffs in some cases when requested by dealers placed the dealers' name upon the range in proximity to the word \u201cExcelsior.\u201d It is shown, however, that this is a custom of the trade known to and acted upon by all dealers and manufacturers. It is proved that even when the names of dealers were thus placed upon the ranges, they were still known and recognized by the trade, dealers and manufacturers, as ranges made by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">It is contended that this was permitting those dealers to hold themselves them out as the manufacturers of such iranges, and was therefore an abandonment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">, It must be observed that there is nothing in connection iwith the names of these dealers to indicate that they are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>manufacturers, and there is no evidence that any one' ever supp sed they were the manufacturers. On the contrary there is ample evidence, even in the affidavits of the defendants, that they were still regarded as manufactured by the plaintiffs. Why then should wc enforce the inference that these names indicated the names of the manufacturers for the benefit of one \u25a0who wrongfully appropriates to himself another\u2019s industry; \u25a0enterprise and property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\">In considering acts from which acquiescence or abandonment are or may be inferred, it should not be forgotten that a trademark is property. In all cases of litigation it may fairly be said to be valuable property. The man who lends his horse frequently, or permits another to use it, is never said to have abandoned his horse to the public, or to acquiesce in any \u25a0claim to use the horse at pleasure. Much less can these acts justify the stranger who breaks into the stable and steals the horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">What injury can arise from this practice? Who can be deceived or betrayed into an error or an injury thereby ? The public who buy for consumption have the article they expected and bargained for, with its name, the trademark, upon it. They have in addition, as a further security, the name and endorsement of the dealer. They therefore have no cause of complaint, and the public who do not purchase have no right to complain. What is it to the man who does not buy, or want to buy, that these names may-possibly indicate that- the owners of the names have the right to manufacture the ranges ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">Such acts do not denote abandonment. The owner of a store does no injury to his right of property in his store, or its contents, or his business, by permitting the names of some ol his employees to be placed on the inside or ouside of the building, as is customary in this city. The rights of property are not so easily frittered away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">It might be that acts like these might betray a person into a violation of the right of property in a trademark. If -they did he would be excusable, but it would confer upon him no irghtto further use the mark against the protest of the owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The defendants make no such pretense as this. They do not pretend that they were induced to believe that plaintiffs had conferred upon these dealers the right to. manufacture the range and use the traderqark. On the contrary they have shown by their own evidence that they knew all about the matter, and that it was done in pursuance of a well established custom of their trade. How can the probability that the public might believe these dealers to be the manufacturers with the right to use the trademark, give the defendants the right to use the trademark when they know the fact to be otherwise ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-4\">In considering a question of trademark the customs of trade should not be ignored. The true doctrine, perhaps, should be to consider them in the light of and in aid of such customs-What the custom of trade allows the law should allow ; for such customs must be for the general good as well as the good of the special trade. Commercial custom made a promise in writing to pay in thirty days a promise to pay in thirty-three days. It is suggested, then, that the custom, which the plaintiffs recognized, should not -work a forfeiture, especially when no one was thereby betrayed into the belief that any one, other than the plaintiffs, had manufactured the articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">An explanation of this custom may be found in the fact that the ranges as made both by the plaintiffs and defendant are not complete for use as they make and sell them, They are mt ranges to the public or to the consumer until they are set up and encased in brick, as the movements of a watch are not a watch until encased. It is the dealer who makes them fit for nse. It is his trade and business to build in the ranges. When the range is completed it is his manufacture. The plaintiffs and defendants have furnished him with only one of the component parts \u2014 one of the materials.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">The manufacturer of the movements of a watch may have a trademark for his own work ; it is or may be, so far as he is concerned, a completed work. Can it be said that he loses his right to that trademark because he permits another manutacturer, who business it is to extend his work, to make it fit. for use, to place his name upon the thing called a watch ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Why, then, should it be said that the plaintiffs lose their right to their trademark for the article they furnish to the trade because they permit the dealer who uses their articles to furnish for the public a completed range to place his name upon it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-4\">To the plaintiffs and the defendants the dealers are the public. The evidence shows that they are the sole purchasers. And it also shows that no dealer or other person has been deceived by the dealer\u2019s name upon the ranges into believing that he -was the manufacturer of the parts made by the plaintiffs. On the contrary, the evidence of the respondents shows that even when such names are upon the ranges, they are still recognized and regarded as the ranges of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">It would, therefore, be stretching an inference to the bounds of probability to infer from such a license that plaintiffs had abandoned their right in the trademark to this community.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">Even if we are altogether in error in all this, it will be observed that it is conceded that the exercise of this custom of the trade by the plaintiffs was simply a license. It needs m&gt; citation of authorities to show that a license is not an abandonment \u2014 not even evidence of abandonment. It is, perhaps, the highest evidence of the assertion of the right and acquiescence therein. This doctrine was recognized in Winsor vs. Clyde, 9 Phil. 513.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">It has been strongly urged that the plaintiffs have lost their right of action by their delay in bringing suit, or in asserting their claim. It may be that even a wrong-doer may sometimes successfully defend upon this ground. It must, however, be such a delay as would lead a reasonable person to suppose that the owner had abandoned his device, or such as induced the defendants to act, or under such circumstances as required the owner to assert his right. Even in such cases the title in the trademark is not lost or deemed abandoned, but the owner is estopped from asserting it to prevent another from using the device. It is evident therefore that each case must case must be decided upon its own facts. There can be no fixed rule, and time is only a matter of evidence to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>sidered with all others. There is no evidence in this case that the defendants were encouraged or misled into their wrongful acts, or that the plaintiffs were silent when they were called upon to speak. The evidence shows that they moved with as much celerity as'was consistent with a proper vindication of their right. The delay seems to have been no greater than was necessary for a prudent, careful preparation for the legal conflict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\">The conclusions to which we have come are, that the plaintiffs have a right to the word Excelsior as a trademark ; that the defendants have wrongfully used that trademark to the injury of the plaintiffs, and should be enjoined therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">The motion to continue the special injunction is therfore allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">Richard Peterson then appealed to the Supreme Court complaining of the action of the Court continuing the special injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-7\">P.
