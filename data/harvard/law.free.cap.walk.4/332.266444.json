E. Staples, the Sheriff of Erie county, at auction for $3,521.53. A dispute having arisen as to who was entitled to \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>fund, the execution creditors ruled it into Court, and had an auditor appointed to distribute, who refused to allow the-sheriff any poundage, under the Act of June 12, 1878, P. Laws, 187.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\">The Court below refused to allow the claim for poundage in&gt; the following opinion, per</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">Galbraith, P. J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">It is apparent that the purpose of the clause in the Act of June 12th, 1878, P. Laws, 187, on which the exceptant bases-the claim that the sheriff should be allowed poundage on the-money paid by him into Court, was intended to prevent plaintiff from defeating the sheriff\u2019s poundage by receipting to the-defendant for the debt, as had no doubt sometimes been done. To the clause was added: \u201cThe same commission to be allowed when money is paid to <em>plaintiff or sheriff, </em>with or without sale;, if paid without sale, no commission shall be allowed on more than is paid over to the creditor.\u201d Evidently the writer of this-language had in his mind the purpose mentioned, as well as-the further object of saving the rights of the sheriff when the debt or a part of it was collected without actual sales of the-property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">Under the Act of 1868 the sheriff was not entitled to-poundage except when he actually received and paid over to-the plaintiff or his attorney the money; but by the addition of' this claus to the Act of 1878, he would be entitled when the-money was neither received or paid over by him, but was paid directly to the plaintiff. This being the evident purpose we-cannot presume that the language used was meant by the Legislature to give poundage to the sheriff when the money is paid by him into Court and there charged with the poundage due by law to the prothonotary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">The learned auditor would appear to be clearly right in his-conclusion on this point, and accordingly the exception is overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\">Staples then appealed to the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-10\"><em>E.

Laws, 187, allows it to the sheriff for \u201crecovering and paying money to the plaintiff or his attorney,\u201d and this last Act allows a poundage to the prothono-tary \u201cfor recovering and distributing money paid into Court.\u201d ' The statute gives the compensation, to the officer on whom is imposed the risk of safely keeping the fund and 'making a due \u2022 distribution thereof. We therefor concur in the opinion of \"the learned Judge in Terry vs. Gregg, 26 Pitts. L.
