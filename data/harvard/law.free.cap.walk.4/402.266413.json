Upon the trial in June, 1876, the In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>surance Company offered in evidence a certificate of the amount due, signed by the secretary and attested by the seal of the company, as provided by section 8 of the Act of February 25th, i860, P. Laws, 83. The defendant objected, that by the 56th section of the Act of May 1st, 1876, P. Laws, 67, the 8th section of the Act of i860, was repealed. Plaintiff contended that the Act of 1876 was unconstitutional, and that there was nothing in the title to show that it had any application to the Columbia Insurance Company. That if constitutional, the 56th section was not retrospective. The Court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection. The various objections to this ruling form the first four assignments of error. The insurance was effected on June 21st, 1873; and upon the trial, evidence that the company\u2019s agent in February, 1873, misrepresented the condition of the company to Baldwin, was admitted. The State agent stated that were no losses, which were due, and for which Baldwin would be called on to pay; when in point of fact a very large amount of losses were due to pay for which the assessment in suit was levied. This was the subject of several other errors. The jury rendered a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-3\">The Columbia Insurance Co. then took this writ of error:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-4\">/. <em>F.
