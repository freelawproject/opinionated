When the substantiate of the law appear to have been correctly performed, too much nicety cannot be required of plain men, unaccustomed to technical accuracy. We perceive no substantial error, and therefore affirm the proceedings, and order of the Court of Quarter Sessions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
