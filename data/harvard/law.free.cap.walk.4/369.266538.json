No. 90 November Term, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">There was an action of trespass brought by Andrew J. Nichols against Dingman and others to recover damages for selling certain goods claimed by Nichols at Sheriff\u2019s sale as the property of Samuel Lipton. It appeared that Lipton, a storekeeper, being indebted to various creditors, sold his whole stock of goods to Nichols, receiving $50 in cash, and notes of Nichols for $850, payable in future, and then absconded. Dingman and others, creditors of Lipton, obtained judgments against him, and levied upon and sold the goods transferred to Nichols.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-9\">Upon the trial the defendants alleged that the sale to Nichols was fraudulent, and offered to prove that Nichols was intemperate and gambled, for the purpose of showing that he had not the credit to make such a purchase bona fide. The Court refused to receive the offer. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants then took this writ of error complaining of the rejection of the above offer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-10\"><em>JB.
