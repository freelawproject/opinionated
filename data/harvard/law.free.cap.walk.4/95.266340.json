J. Valentine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">These latter averments of the bill are in the main denied by the defendant in his answer, which on this hearing is to be considered as an affidavit; Warren and Franklin Railroad Co., vs. Clarion Land and Improvement Co., 54 Pa. St., 28.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">The following averments'of the bill are established by the affidavits:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">That after her father\u2019s death, and during her minority, the plaintiff lived with her grandmother, the mother of defendant, her aunt, a sister, and the defendant; that one of her uncles, the brother of defendant, was her testamentary guardian, who had charge of her estate, and that he, in connection with James Milliken, the defendant, superintended and directed her education ; that her estate was taken- charge of by her uncle as guardian, and that she had little knowledge of its character and amount; that the deed of trust was executed twelve days after attaining her majority, and just prior to. her starting for a voyage to Europe in company with James Milliken, the defendant; that the execution of the deed was procured by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>advice of Samuel Milliken and the said James Milliken, the defendant, both uncles and beneficiaries under the deed ; that she did not have the. advice and assistance of legal counsel in regard to the provisions of said deed, but whatever explanations and advice she received were given by the trustee, James Milliken; and that on the happening of a certain contingency \u2014the death of the plaintiff without issue \u2014 her uncles, Samuel Milliken and James Milliken, the trustee, would be large beneficiaries under said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">The other material allegation that, by the execution of the deed, plaintiff believed she was constituting James Milliken her agent, and that she could revoke or alter at any time said deed, is denied in the affidavit of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">Is there sufficient in the allegations of the bill and the affidavits to justify the Court in granting present relief to the plaintiff? Ir may be conceded that the defendant sustained such a relation to the plaintiff that he could exert an influence over her. She had lived in his. mother\u2019s family, of which defendant was an inmate, from infancy. Her mother had died when she was very young, and her father died when she was but eleven years old. Her estate and her education were under the charge and control of her uncle and guardian, Samuel Milliken, and the defendant; so that, to some extent, 'the defendant stood in loco parentis to the plaintiff. Under these circumstances, the principles upon -which a .court in equity acts are well stated in the case of Archer vs. Hudson, 7 Beaven, 451. A niece, two months after she came of age, and after her guardian had fully accounted to her, entered into a voluntary security for her uncle, by whom she had been brought up, and who was considered by the Court as standing ' in loco parentis. Lord Langdale, in delivering the opinion of \u25a0 the Court, observed : \u201cNobody has ever asserted that there cannot be a pecuniary transaction between a parent and a child, the child being of age; but everybody will affirm in this Court, 'that if there be a pecuniary transaction between a parent and child just after the child attains the age of twenty-one years'and prior to what may be called a complete cmanci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>pation, without any benefit moving to the child, the presumption is that an undue influence has been exercised ; and - that it is the duty and the business of the party who endeavors to maintain such transaction to show that that presumption is adequately rebutted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">The same principal is stated by Justice Trunkey in Darling-ton\u2019s Appeal, 5 Norris, 518. \u201cOwing to the near connection between the parties in many relations, the transaction in itself. is considered so suspicious as to cast the burden of proof upon , the person who seeks to support it, to show that he has taken no advantage of his influence or knowledge, and that the arrangement'is fair and conscientious.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">To the same effect is the case of Greenfield\u2019s Estate 2, Harris, 506, in which Justice Bell, who delivered the opinion of the. Court, says, in speaking of transactions between persons standing in the situation of quasi guardians or confidential advisers \u201cOther authorities, where the transaction is one of contract and sale, conceding that it may not be absolutely void, ipso facto, throw upon the agent the burden of establishing its perfect fairness and adequacy, and that it was the deliberate act of the confiding party, after being fully informed of his rights, interests, and duties, and put upon his guard against even, the suggestions of his own inclinations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">We cite these cases to show that the burden of proof is thrown upon the defendant of sustaining the validity of this deed. This case can only be determined on a final hearing before the Master, when all the evidence has been submitted. We will not undertake in this preliminary hearing to pass upon the validity of this deed of trust. That will have to be determined when the case is heard before a Master, and comes into court for a final decree. We only decide now that, under the affidavits presented, we think it is a case calling for our interposition until the rights of the parties can be finally settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">And now, March, 14th, 1882, this cause came on to be heard and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon consideration. thereof it is ordered-, adjudged and decreed that the injunction heretofore granted be continued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that John P. Harris, of Bellefont\u00e9, Pa., be appointed Receiver, with full power and authority to receive and take possession of all the securities, moneys, and personal properties now in the possession and under the control of the said defendant, James Milliken, under and by virtue of said deed of trust, and to take possession; care, control, and management of said real estate, conveyed to said James Milliken, by said deed of trust, until final hearing. The said Receiver before entering upon the duties of his appointment to give a bond in the sum of eighty thousand dollars, with two sufficient sureties, to be approved by one of the law Judges of the Court, conditioned for the faithful care and management and accounting of said moneys, securities, and personal property, and rents and income of said real estate. Said bond to be filed' with the Clerk of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-4\">And it is further ordered that the said James Milliken deliver and pay over to such Receiver all securities, moneys, and personal property which he holds and has in his possession, or under his control, under and by virtue of said deed of trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">James Milliken then appealed, assigning three errors : 1st, in continuing the injunction; 2nd, in appointing a Receiver; 3rd, in ordering James Milliken to transfer the trust property to the receiver.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-7\">Messrs.
