The bargain was closed, the purchase being made at a full price for cash. A check for the consideration money was filled up at once by Hapgood, who had brought one with him for the purpose, drawn to his order by Plapgood, Hay <em>&amp; </em>Co., of Easton. On the same day, he and W. H. Stoddard proceeded to Easton, leaving one Smith in charge of the store, the Stoddards immediately withdrawing. On the 26th Chas. Hapgood drew the money, and, as was alleged, paid to Stoddard all that he was entitled to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-12\">The purchase was really made on behalf of L. B. Hapgood, brother of Charles, and he went to Scranton on the 26th to-take charge of the store. The next day executions were levied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>upon the goods by the defendants, judgment creditors of Stoddard &amp; Co., and the present case is a feigned issue to test the ownership of the goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-4\">At the trial the Court was asked to charge that there was no evidence of fraud in the case, and the verdict should be for the plaintiff. To this the court answered, that \u201cwe can discern no fraud in the case,\u201d but left it to the jury to determine whether any had been made out. This, together with other instructions, amounting to nearly the same thing, was assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the execution creditors and against Hapgood.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-6\"><em>W.

The object \u2022of it was to obtain a binding instruction, and to withdraw the case from the jury. Instead of doing so, the learned judge charged, that he saw no evidence of fraud, and then submitted that question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The testimony shows that the sale of the stock of goods was honestly made, so far as the purchaser was concerned. If Stoddard &amp; Co. had any design to defraud their creditors, the knowledge of their design was not brought home to the plaintiff. The mere fact that he know the firm was \u201cshaky,\u201d as the witness expressed it, is of little importance. At most, it means that the firm were not in good credit. This would not affect the plaintiff with knowledge that the firm intended to \u25a0cheat their creditors; if it would, an embarrassed firm could not sell anything to anyone, though done in the most perfect good faith. Such is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Nor does the manner in which the check was paid furnish a scintilla of evidence that the stock of merchandise was not paid for as agreed upon. The evidence is clear that the proceeds \u25a0of the check was handed over to Stoddard &amp; Co., less the sum they owed the plaintiff, and which it was agreed should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>deducted. This was proved by credible witnesses, who were neither contradicted nor impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">All the requisites of a valid sale appeared in the case. The stock was sold at a fair price, and the purchase money paid in. cash, and the requisite change of possession took place. And, as before observed, there was nothing in the case to indicate-that the plaintiff had in his mind any intent to hinder and delay the creditors of Stoddard &amp; Co., or even knew they had any creditors other than himself. Under such circumstances-it was grave error to allow the jury to find fraud without evidence, or upon such weak and inconclusive facts as furnish no proper basis for a verdict. The court should have affirmed the plaintiff's point without qualification,</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The judgment is reversed and <em>a. venire facias de novo </em>awarded,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
