The Society made answer that by bringing suit without exhausting the remedies within the society he had violated the by-laws, which provide as follows: \u201cEach and every person, on being elected a member, and also those who may be members at the time of the passage of this amendment, shall pledge himself to submit all causes of dispute, with all the facts relating thereto, to the committee appointed under the law, and abide by the decision of this committee.\u201d That upon a written charge of violating this by-law, Sweeney was tried and defended himself, but was found guilty in due form and expelled. Sweeney demurred and the Court entered judgment in his favor on the demurrer, and awarded the mandamus prayed for. The Society then took this writ of error complaining of the granting the mandamus.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-3\"><em>Messrs. J. I. Farley and P.

The answer contains no averment that either the constitution or by-laws specify expulsion of a member for a violation of a by-law. The fact that a member pledges himself to submit a cause of dispute to the committee, and abide by the decision thereof, and disregards his pledge, does not justify his expulsion, in the absence of an express provision making expulsion the penalty. Such a penalty pan not be inflicted without some express and specific authority therefor being shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
