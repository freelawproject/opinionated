Error to Common Pleas of Luzerne County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-11\">This was a scire facias to revive a judgment in the case of Reuben Seybert\u2019s administrators against Daniel F. Seybert. He filed an affidavit of defence, and plaintiffs then took out a rule to arbitrate. Defendant did not attend the arbitration proceedings, and an award was entered against him for $5,245.95 on November 22, 1879. His counsel told him it was entered November 25. On December 10th,\u201979, he wrote from Berwick, his home, to his Attorney to inquire about the bail costs and time for appeal. A letter and telegram were sent to him on the 11th of December, informing him that December 12th was the last day for the appeal. He did not receive it on the 11th, and early on the 12th he left for Hazleton with a load of grain, not returning until late at night, when it was too late to take a train for Wilkes-Barre, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>after receiving the letter and telegram. He came to Wilk\u00e9sBarre early on December 13th to enter his appeal. He took \u25a0out a rule to enter the appeal nunc pro tunc but the Court discharged the rule on Feb. 7th, 1880, in the following opinion per</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-4\">Rice, P, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">The defendant knew in ample time that an award of arbitrators had been made against him; he is presumed to know within what time his appeal must be entered. He chose to take the chances on his being in time, and by doing so, it turned out that he was a day. too late. He has no one to blame but himself. His counsel is in no way to blame. He was not prevented from entering his appeal, either by the act of the plaintiff, the acts of the arbitrators, the acts of the Prothonotary, the negligence of counsel, nor the act of God.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">The rule is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-7\">Defendant below then took a rule to strike off the award of arbitrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-8\">The Court discharged the rule on May 24th, 1880, in the following opinion, per</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">Rice, P. J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-10\">\u2022 The record entry is as follows: \u201cNow, Nov. 5, 1879, parties '\u2018appear by counsel, and Gerge K. Powell, George W. Shonk, \u201cand L. B. Landmesser are appointed arbitrators to meet at \u25a0\u201carbitration room Wilkes-Barre, Pa. on 22d November, 1879, \u201cat 9 o\u2019clock A. M.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-11\">For all the record shows then, the choice of arbitrators was regular. The defendant, however, shows by depositions that neither he nor his counsel were present. The Prothonotary and his clerk are also called by him, but they do not recollect any of the circumstances attending the particular case, but testify generally as to the practice usually followed in the office. We have examined the testimony carefully, and do not find enough in it to warrant us in overturning the record and setting aside the award after the lapse of time. But beyond that it appears from the testimony of Mr. Gates, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and his testimony is uncontradicted, that -the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>appointment of arbitrators was substantially as follows : At the hour named in the first rule, he appeared at the Prothonotary\u2019s office, the defendant and his counsel being in default; that the Prothonotary fixed the number of arbitrators at three ; that when the choice of arbitraiors was reached , the counsel told the Prothonotary to name them ; that the Prothonotary named one, and the counsel suggested that there were two other good m.en-in the same office, and the Prothonotary assented to these, and they were chosen. After which the Prothonotary named the day and hour of the arbitration, the counsel only suggesting that he wanted time enough to get service of the rule, as the defendant\u2019s counsel was out of town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">Now it is apparent, from this uncontradicted testimony, that the number of the arbitrators and the time of meeting were fixed exclusively by the Prothonotary, and this feature of the case distinguishes it from Mitchell vs. Wilhelm, 6 W. 259, where it appeared of record that the plaintiff was in default, and that the Prothonotary and the defendant agreed upon the number of arbitrators. So the case of Feehrer vs. Rudy, 7 W. &amp; S. 183, differs from this, in that the defendant was in default; and it appeared from the record that \u201cthe parties agreed upon three men, and then the plaintiff and \u201cProthonotary proceeded to nominate the men.\u201d The Court, \u201cRogers, J., said : \u201cThere can be no reasonable doubt here \u201cthat the number was fixed by the Prothonotary in conjunction with the other party.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">In the choice of arbitrators we see no substantial departure from the methods prescribed by \u25a0 the statute. The Prothonotary acted for the absent party and the fact that he named the first man instead of the plaintiff is not material, Although the strict order of nomination prescribed by the statute was not followed it appears that each named one person, and that the third was named by the plaintiff as he had a right to do, and was agreed to by the Prothonotary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">It follows from what had been said that if we stand by the record the choice of arbitrators, etc., was regular, and that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>we correct the record by the parol testimony it is also regular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The rule to strike off the award of arbitrators is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">Seybert then took a writ of error to the Supreme Court assigning the discharge of the two rules for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-6\">A.
