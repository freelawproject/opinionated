Error to Common Pleas of 'Schuylkill County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">The facts of the case appear in the opinion, per</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">Bechtel, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-10\">Pule to show cause why judgment '\u25a0 of non-suit should not be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-11\">The plaintiff instituted this suit to recover a part of the pur\u2022chase money paid to the defendants as the consideration of a certain timber right. He claims he purchased said right by the acre and paid for more acres than the tract actually contains. After he closed his testimony the defendants asked for .judgment of non-suit, which the Court allowed, hence the above rule. The contract for the sale of the timber right is evidenced by a writing dated February 24th, 1882. This instrument contains nothing that is either doubtful, uncertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u25a0or ambiguous. It transfers the right to all timber upon \u201call \u25a0that certain tract of land * * * * bounded and described according to a draft hereto attached;\u201d and the draft is attached. It mentions a round sum ($1,587,) payable in three equal payments of $529 each, as the consideration; makes no mention of any price per acre, although 19 acres and 134 perches is named as the quantity contained in the tract. This \u25a0consideration was fixed by multiplying the number of acres by $80, according to the testimony of \u2019Squire Hummel. The testimony offered shows that the surveyor made a mistake in his calculations of two acres and 86 perches. There is neither allegation nor proof of any fraud by either of the parties to this transaction, nor is there any evidence of any deceit practiced by the vendors to induce the vendee to enter into the contract of purchase. The plaintiff says that Schultz made the draft at Werner\u2019s request, and that Werner purchased the timber right for him. Schultz, the surveyor, says, that Werner employed him to make the draft, and that he claimed to be a partner of Leopold; he also says that Leopold and Schneck each paid one-half the expenses of survey. From this testimony we are inclined to believe that Surveyor Schultz, who made this draft and calculated its contents, either represented these parties jointly, or he was the agent of Leopold. The purchase money specified in the contract has all been paid by the plaintiff, the last payment being made nine or more months before this suit was instituted. Can the plaintiff recover upon this showing? Jenks vs. Fritz, 7 W. &amp; S., 201, would seem to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s contention. But an examination of the facts shows that the vendee defended against the payment of the purchase money, and was not in the position of seeking to recover a deficiency as an original and independent ground of action. In Farmers\u2019 Bank vs. Galbraith, 10 Barr, 490, the vendor\u2019s surveyor made the draft upon which the quantity contained in the tract was written, the land was exposed to sale and this draft' exhibited to the purchaser; the purchase was by the acre, and the purchase money was paid, and suit was instituted by the vendee, to recover back for a deficiency; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>error arose from an erroneous calculation of the surveyor. C. J. Gibson said \u201cthe execution of a conveyance is the consummation of a purchase; after which the parties have no recourse to each other except for imposition or fraud\u201d * * * * \u201cMutual misapprehension is not a ground to recall a contract which is past and gone.\u201d Jenks &amp; Fritz was cited and relied upon by counsel in the argument of this case. \u201cWhere (say the Supreme Court) a contract is executed by deed and bond or other security taken for the unpaid purchase money, the rule is not to open a contract so far executed, <em>to allow for deficiency of quantity, nor can there be a recovery for </em>excessCoughenour\u2019s Administrators vs. Stauft, 27 Smith, 195. In this case the Chief Justice cited and commented upon numerous authorities bearing upon this subject and among others approved of the Farmers\u2019 Bank vs. Galbraith. See also opinion of Justice Sharswood in Kreiter vs. Bomberger, 1 Norris, 63.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">In the case before us the surveyor was as much the agent of the plaintiff as of the defendants, and the contract was as fully executed as it ever can be, for a period of nine or more months before this suit was instituted. Therefore, in the absence of fraud, we cannot understand upon what ground the plaintiff can recover. But he claims that he purchased personal property and that the rule differs when the subject of purchase is personalty. We cannot thus understa nd the authorities, but believe that the question is not whether the purchase is of realty or personalty, but whether the contract has been fully executed. We understand this to be the conclusion of Justice Lewis when in McCrea vs. Longstrethno Harris, 321, in which the subject of purchase was personalty, he said : \u201cAfter the whole contract has been fully executed by the parties, the expression adopted by Yeates, J. in Steinhauer vs. Witman, 1 S. &amp; R, 448, is peculiarly applicable, \u2018the funeral has passed by, the dead cannot be resuscitated.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">And, now, January 19th, 1885, rule discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">Leopold then took a writ of error, complaining of the entry of the non-suit, and of the refusal of the Court to strike off the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>F.

It was a mutual mistake as to the number of acres. The conveyance was the consummation of the purchase.
