Error to Common Pleas of Northampton county,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-15\">Ferdinand Krieg was a passenger from Reading to New York \u25a0city on the afternoon of November 3rd, 1863. The train <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>stopped at Easton at the Lehigh Valley depot 10 or 15 minutes, and Krieg went to the refreshment room and got some oysters. Afterwards he came out, and desiring to urinate he-looked for the water closet. The night was dark and misty, and the platform was not lighted up. At this point the track was built upon trestles about twenty feet from the ground. The platform is provided with a stout railing;'but Krieg walked beyond it and fell on the ground, sustaining-severe injuries, which disabled him for about a year, There-were no signs indicating where water closets were and there was no employee to point them out. Suit was brought against the R. R. Co. for damages for injuries sustained. The following is a portion of the charge of the Court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-4\">He (Krieg) \u201csaid he was on the platform at the depot and1 got down upon the track, and went around the end of the-railing at the west end of the platform to urinate and fell from there to the ground. * * * * This evidence is uncontradicted\u2014 and we have the fact therefore beyond dispute, that he received the serious injui ies of which he complains-through his own negligence or carelessness. He did not regard the railing at the end of the depot and platform, which had been erected to prevent persons from going or falling off, but got down upon the railroad track and attempted to go-around the end of the railing beyond the platform of the depot and from which point, as was before stated to you, the-evidence shows that the bed of the railroad was laid on trestle work about 20 feet from the ground. We cannot say to you that this portion of the road built on trestle work west of the depot and platform was part of the depot, or that passengers had any right whatever to go upon the railroad track west of the depot. * * * * The company were not bound to-put any fixtures upon that part of the line of their road to prevent persons from falling off who might venture there without right. * * * * We direct a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">Krieg then took a writ of error complaining of the charge of the Court, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-8\"><em>M.
