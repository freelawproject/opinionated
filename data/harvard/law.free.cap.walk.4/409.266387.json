L. Buskirk and Henry Shook were administrators of James Buskirk. G. L. Buskirk purchased various articles at the administrators\u2019 sale and gave two notes amounting to '$623.76 to the administrators in payment. Afterwards the administrators filed an account, and paid over, in 1872, to John Myers, guardian of the two minor children of James Buskirk, certain notes amounting to about $1,000, as the estate of his wards. Myers advanced money to his wards and took the notes himself. One note, given by Samuel Streepy to James Buskirk, for $300, was collected by John Myers. G. L. BusLirk swore that the Streepy note was given by mistake. Myers swore that it was part of the $1,000 which accounted for. G. L. Buskirk\u2019s notes were renewed- from time to time, and on January 22, 1877, a judgment for $1,072.76 was entered upon a judgment note given by G. L. Buskirk to John Myers, who assigned it to D. E. Bell. Execution was issued in 1881, and then G. L. Buskirk took a rule to open the judgment, alleging that he was entitled to credit on account of the Streepy note. The Court discharged the rule to open the judgment on June 18, 1881, in the following opinion by</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\">Woodward, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-9\">The rule in this case must be discharged; a mere conflict of testimony between the parties, plaintiff and defendant, themselves, will not as a general rule, justify us in opening a judgment. In this instance the defendant\u2019s testimony is not sufficiently distinct to warrant any relaxation of the rule.
