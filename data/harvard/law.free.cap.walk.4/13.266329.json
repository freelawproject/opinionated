That the plaintiff supplied, and the defendant used, by means of connections with the water mains of the plaintiff, the water as follows : Here follows statement amounting to $602.02.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-15\">6. That before this suit was brought the plaintiff demanded \u25a0of the defendant payments for the amounts claimed in this action. The same was not paid, nor any warrant therefor issued. The date of demand does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-16\">7. The allegation of the defendant that there was a contract entered into with the Reading Water Company, of which the plaintiff is the grantee and successor, that water was to be furnished at the Court House and Jail without charge, is not sustained. There is no evidence from which it can be found that any agreement was ever concluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-17\">From the foregoing facts I arrive at the following conclusions of law :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-18\">I. That the Commissioners of the County, by connecting the pipes in the public buildings with the mains of the plaintiff, and by making use of the water thus obtained, (and for purposes necessary for the proper arrangement of the affairs of the County,) made the County liable to psu* for the use of the water at the rates fixed by the city authorities. The County thus became indebted to the plaintiff prior to the bringing of this suit in the sum of $602.02. To this sum is to be added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>interest, from the date of suit (January 13th, 1871) making a. total indebtedness of $993.32.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-4\">II. That inasmuch as the remedies provided by the Act of Assembly of 1865 for the enforcing of the claim, 'could not be pursued and made effective against the County, as there could be no distress by the collector, nor lien obtained by a filing of the unpaid claim in the Prothonotary\u2019s office, and conse\" quently no proceeding upon such registered claim, therefore the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action. There must be judgment for the plaintiff for $993.32.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">OPINION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\">The Act of April 22d, 1874, P. Laws 109, relating to trials by the Court without a jury provides that the decision of the Court shall be in writing, stating separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to points and the conclusions of law. While I do not believe that said Act imposes upon the Judge any further duties, I will, without attempt at elaboration, state some of the reasons which led to the conclusions arrived at.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\">That the County is liable for the expense of a proper supply of water at the Court House and prison scarcely needs demonstration. It is as necessary as fuel to warm, and gas or oil to light said buildings. In truth, so far as relates to the Prison, which in this case is a large institution on the penitentiary plan, a supply of water is indispensible ; that all efforts to obtain an adequate supply by means of surface springs, drifts and reservoirs were unavailing is shown by the testimony\u2014 it having been shown that the water was in fact supplied by the plaintiff, that the rates demanded were fixed as required by law, and it having been admitted that a demand had been made before suit was brought against the County, it is only necessary to examine the question upon which the defence is mainly based, to wit: Can there be a recovery in this action, the claim not having been registered in the Prothonotary\u2019s office as provided by the special Acts of Assembly, relating to the city of Reading ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-9\">The Act of 21st of March, 18G5, supplemental to the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>vised Charter of said city, declares that all water rates shall be charged to the owners of the real estate on which said water is used, and if the same shall not be paid for, liens shall be filed in the Prothonotary\u2019s office ; said rates to be collected in the same manner and under the same restrictions as are provided for by the City Charter for the collection of city taxes on real estate. (See \u00a7 \u00a7 9 and 10.) The Act of April 26th, 1864, known as the Revised Charter of said city, provides that the duplicates for city taxes shall be placed in the hands of the Treasurer, who shall receive taxes until the first day of October in each year, after which date the same shall bo given to collectors, to be appointed by Councils, the collectors to have the power to distrain or convey the delinquent to prison. After the first day of January the taxes then still unpaid shall, by the City Solicitor, be caused to be registered in the office of the Prothonotary of Berks County, and all taxes so registered shall be liens on the real estate upon which they have been assessed for the term of five years. Recoveiy for registered taxes may be had in the Court of Common Pleas of said County of Berks, by action of debt to recover a general judgment against the debtor or by scire facias, as in the case of mechanics\u2019 liens, and the claim so registered shall be prima facie evidence of the amount thereof, and of the same being due and owing, and judgment shall be entered by default therefor, unless the defendant shall file his affidavit of defence. It is-provided that there may be an apportionment of the claim where the property has been divided, but with a further proviso that such apportionment shall not affect the personal liability of the owner at the time of the assessment. There is also a penalty of five per centum in case of delay of payment. (\u00a7 \u00a7 41, 42 and 43.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-4\">Could any of these remedies have been made effective against the County of Berks? In Wilson vs. the Commissioners of Huntingdon, 7 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 197; it was decided that the Court House, Jail, etc., of a county are not such buildings as come within the meaning of the Acts giving mechanics and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>material-men liens. The inconvenience of a different construction is pointed out, and also the fact that under the /let of 15th of April, 1884, a judgment against a County shall be enforced by a mandamus commanding the Commissioners to pay, and not otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-4\">In Foster vs. Fowler, 60 Pa. 27, the question presented was: whether a mechanic\u2019s lien could be filed against the property of a company chartered to supply water to a town, and it was argued that the Court should consider the question of lien without reference to its possible enforcement. Because the company was a public corporation it was held that the remedy by lien did not apply. As to the question of lien without regard to its enforcement, the Supreme Court said: \u201cThis would be too abstract and impractical; for the lien, abstractly, is nothing ; its consequences and results everything. * * We cannot, therefore, look to the question of lien without reference to the legal consequences of it; and if they would contravene settled principles it is evident that such an effect should not be given and was not intended by the law, and if it was incapable of the practical results assigned by law to it, it is inoperative ; it is no lien.\u201d The conclusion arrived at was, that a mechanic\u2019s lien is the foundation for process for sale, and that \u201cwhere there could be no execution there could be no action,\u201d quoting from Williams vs. The Controllers, 18 Pa. 275.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">In the special Acts under consideration, the effect of\u2018the filing of the claim in the Prothonotary\u2019s office is to create a lien, for five years and a foundation for an action. It is plain that for neither purpose would a registry of the claim against the County be available. And the claim against the County could not be enforced by means of the warrant in the hands of the collector. The conclusion, therefore, is ineyitable that the special provisions of the statute do not apply to an indebtedness of the County for water used in the public buildings, and, that as there is an obligation to pay, the remedy must be by a common law action. That the claim should have been-filed for the purpose of using it as evidence, requires no refutation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>As the Act is inapplicable in its material provisions \u2014 lien and remedy \u2014 it also must be held inapplicable as to the incidental and secondary provisions, of its being prime facie evidence for the plaintiff of its claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-4\">Where a remedy is given by statute it must be followed.\u2014 This is the rule of the common law, and the mandate of the Act of 1806. But here the claim is against a party where the statute remedy given to the City of Reading for the enforcement of its claim for the use of water does not apply. Therefore we hold that this action lies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">The plaintiff may recover in this form of action. Overseers \u25a0of South Whitehall vs. North Whitehall, 3 S. &amp; R., 117. See .also Turnpike Co., vs. Rutter, 4 S. &amp; R., 6; where the language of Justice Story in Bank of Columbia vs. Patterson, 7 \u25a0Cranch, 299, is given; \u201cwhen a corporation is acting within the scope of the legitimate purpose of its institution, all parol .contracts made by its authorized agents are express promises of the corporation, and all duties imposed on them by law, and all benfits conferred, at their request, raise implied promises for which an action lies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">By the City Charter every one making use of the water is obliged to pay according to the rates established by ordinance, where owners of real estate upon streets where the mains were laid, made no use of the water, they were exempt from any &lt;|emand where it appeared that they were supplied from other \u00a1sources, and that no water was used belonging to the City; \u00a7 10, Act of 1865. The County accepted, and made use of the water, which at fixed rates was offered to all. By so doing the Commissioners did not exceed the authority vested in them by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">This is not, as has been contended an exercise of the taxing \u2022\u25a0power; it is not.the case of the municipality as such imposing \u25a0a tax upon the County of Berks. While a City may engage in supplying gas and water, yet it is not bound to do so; when the City undertakes to do so it acts not by virtue of any right \u25a0of sovereignty, but exercises merely the functions of a private \u2022corporation; Girard Life Ins. Co., vs- Philadelphia, 7 W. N., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>69., Western Savings Fund vs. City 7 Cas., 175; Wheeler vs. City, 77 Pa. 338.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-4\">The plaintiff claims interest from the time the several sums fell clue. I am of the opinion that this cannot be allowed.\u2014 The plaintiff deemed it necessary to a recovery to show that demand had been made before the bringing of suit. This was a pre-requisite to the maintenance of the action; Luzerne Co., vs. Day, 23 Pa. 141.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-5\">The same reason which.makes.it intolerable that a County should be liable to suit upon the multifarious claims against it without demand, is decisive against the claim for interest. In my opinion, on a claim of this character interest can be recovered from the date of demand and refusal of a warrant on the treasurer. It is admitted in this case, that there was a demand before suit. But when it was made does not appear. Therefore, interest will be allowed from the date of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-6\">I will add that there is no narr in this case. It has been said that the pleadings had been lost long before the cause was removed to Lehigh County. It seems that none of the counsel who originally appeared have now any connection with the case. What the narr was, I do not know. It is safe to assume that it set forth the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, as developed at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">Berks County then took this Writ of Error, alleging that the Court erred in holding that plaintiff below could bring suit, and was not confined to the statutory remedy of filing a lien against the property to which the water was supplied.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-8\">E.
