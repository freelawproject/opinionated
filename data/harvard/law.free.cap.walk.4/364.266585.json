During the work, the adjoining property, No. 1204, owned by Mary E. Bradley, wife of James Bradley, was injured by reason of the repairs. Suit was brought to recover damages for the injury thus sustained; and on February 2, 1883, the jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff for $175. Testimony was given to the effect that Wilkinson had frequently visited the work; and Mrs. Bradley testified that when she complained of the injury and said the Thompsons were not capable builders, Mr. Wilkinson replied: \u201cThey did as I ordered;\u201d he said he was satisfied with them ; he endorsed all they did, good or bad. Two written points of the plaintiff in error were affirmed, but an oral request to direct the jury to find for defendant was negatived. The refusal of the request forms the subject of the writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Peter Boyd., Esq , </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">argued that where a man employs a competent contractor to build for him and does not interfere with the work, he is not liable for injuries to a stranger, caused by negligence in the work ; School District vs. Fuess, 11 W.
