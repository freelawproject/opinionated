Plenry Horstmann, and the sisters, Emma Thibault and Lavinia Patterson. The auditing judge sustained this view.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\">The appellees filed exceptions to this adjudication, which were sustained by the Court in banc, in the following opinion, per:</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-9\">Penrose, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-10\">While the will of Sigmund Horstmann unquestionably gave his interest in his mother\u2019s estate to his surviving sisters and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>'brothers and the issue of such of them as might die in his lifetime, to the exclusion of his own children, we can find nothing evincing in any manner an intention to exclude them from participating in the distribution, of the shares of the first takers, at the death of the latter. Such an intention is not to be inferred in the absence of express provisions or necessary intendment. Heirs or next of kin are never deprived of their rights by any forced construction, and all doubts are to be resolved in their favor; Brendlinger vs. Brendlinger, 2 Casey, 132; Rupp vs. Eberly, 29 Smith, 141. Not only is there no evidence of an intention to exclude from such future distribution, but by the references to the will of his mother and the provision that the estate given by him shall pass in the same manner, with the same limitations and provisions as are expressed and declared in her will in respect to the shares of the said brothers and sisters and to her estate, it becomes clear that children were intended to participate whenever under the terms of his mother\u2019s will they would do so. The subsequent declaration that his wish was to relinquish all his interest in his mother\u2019s estate in favor of his brothers and sisters and the issue of such of them as may be then deceased, makes no change in this respect. The reference to issue of brothers and sisters was simply to determine the persons taking at the time of his own death, and has nothing to do with the future devolution of the estate so given. By the mother\u2019s will, which is thus, so far as the present question is concerned, to be regarded, under the maxim <em>\u201cVerba relata \u2019\u2019 </em>&amp;c., as if its provisions were inserted at length in his own, the shares of sisters were to be held in trust for them for life, with remainder in the event of their death without leaving a husband or issue, to the surviving brothers and sisters or the issue of such as might be then dead. This provision in the mother\u2019s will of course included the children of Sigmund living at the death of a daughter; and as he has said that the shares given by him shall be held in the \u201csame manner and with the same limitations\u201d as expressed in the mother\u2019s will, it would seem that a construction of his will which would carry them in a different manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>cannot be the correct one. If his children are excluded at the death of the sisters,, they must be equally so at the death of the brothers; but no one will contend that in the event of the death of a brother intestate and without issue, the children of Sigmund would not be entitled to come in under the intestate-laws. The only difference between the shares of the brothers, and those of the sisters is that the devolution of the one is determined by the statute, and of the other by the provision of the mother\u2019s will. That the children of William, whose will was drawn in precisely the same form as that of his brother, believed that their father intended to exclude them from future distributions, and, acting under the belief, executed a deed to carry such intention into effect, is, of course, wholly immaterial. Their belief is wholly without force, so far as the present question is concerned, even as an argument. Indeed, as an argument, the inference would be from the execution of the deed, that the will had failed to express the intention in the manner that the parties to the deed understood that it really was. We can only construe the will from what it says, and have nothing to do with any supposed intention not appearing on its face, and contrary not only to the language, but to what it is natural to suppose would be the wish of a testator with regard to his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-3\">Exceptions sustained, and distribution modified accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\">G.
