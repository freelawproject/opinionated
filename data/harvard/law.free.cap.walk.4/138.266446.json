All of which is true to the best of deponent\u2019s knowledge, information and belief, and all of which he expects to be. able to prove upon a trial of this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">The Court gave judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of\u2019 defence, in the following opinion, per:</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">Sassaman, J.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-7\">Upon an examination of the papers on file in this case I am of the opinion that in the settlement between the parties when defendant g'ave his notes to the plaintiff he stood in the character of a debtor to the plaintiff and not in the relation of trustee or agent having deposited in the bank of the plaintiff\u2019s own selection. The relation of indebtedness at the maturity of the several notes w'as continuing and the defendant was liable for their payment, and the notes in contemplation of law were such that judgment could be entered thereon for want of an affidavit of defence. The affidavit and supplemental filed in this case raise no good and legal defence, except <em>protanto for </em>the amount of a legal set-off of $75-99, which must be deducted from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>amount of the several notes at the bringing of this suit to which, as I understand it, the counter claim dates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\">The rule for judgment is made absolute and the Prothonotary is directed to enter judgment in accordance with this opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">Kuser then took this writ of error complaining of the entry of judgment against him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-6\"><em>Cyrus G.

N.

The reasonable deduction from all the. facts alleged is, that they were given on a settlement of the rights of the parties to the money 011 deposit in the Dime Savings Bank. The plaintiff in error does not aver that any fraud or imposition was practiced on him, nor that he gave the notes in ignorance of any fact. The notes were given on a sufficient consideration. He acquired an exclusive right to the money in that bank, and all remedies for its collection. As the affidavit does not aver facts sufficient to defeat an action in the name of the payee, the allegation that they are still the property of the payee is of no force.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
