C. Quin, Esq., to recover $169.23, which she alleges she was unjustly compelled to pay by reason of defendant\u2019s misconduct. AVm. Kier borrowed $600 of the Homeward Building Association and gave a mortgage for that amount. He died soon after, and his widow, Elizabeth Kier, continued to make pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>meats until 1881. In the latter part of that year E. C. Quin,., attorney for the Building Association, notified her to pay $80.50 arrears. She demanded to know the whole claim, and received word from Quin that the Association would settle for $411.10, crediting all payments on the stock to the mortgage. Mrs. Kier did not accept the settlement proposed, and soon afterwards a <em>sci. fa. </em>was issued upon the mortgage, and judgment was taken upon two <em>nihils </em>and damages assessed at $800.80. A <em>sci. fa. </em>was issued, and then Mrs. Kier applied to open the judgment; the Court discharged the rule upon the association\u2019s filing a remittitur for all above $411.10. Mrs. Kief then brought this suit against Quin to recover $169.23;: attorney fees, costs and expenses actually paid in, having the\u2019 judgment reduced to $411.10, on the ground that he had abused the process of the Court to collect a claim he knew was not all due. After hearing plaintiffs evidence, the Court directed a non-suit to be entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\">Mrs. Kier then took this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-5\"><em>Hunn Hanson, Esq., </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adl\">argued that an attorney is personally liable for any tort or wrong committed in his office; Baker vs. Braham, 3 Wilson, 368; Bates vs. Piling, 6 B. &amp; C., 38; Codrington vs. Lloyd, 8 Ad. &amp; E., 449; Lynch vs. Commonwealth, 16 S. &amp; R., 361; Ellingham vs. Clark, 1 Phila., 51.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>D.
