Lunacy proceedings were instituted July 25, 1863; inquisition was taken .and report filed August 8th, 1868, and confirmed August 15th, 1868.

She was not be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>fore the jury of inquest, She afterwards applied to have the proceedings set aside, and the Court made the following order: \u201cUpon consideration of the petition of the said Amelia G.

It was insufficient to remove the effect of the inquest. The averment of record by the plaintiff that she was restored to a sound state*, of mind impliedly admits that it was unsound when so found! by the inquest. Hence, instead of impeaching the correctness of the finding of lunacy, the effect was to confirm it. Due force must therefore be given to the inquest. It protects the* action of the defendants taken under it, and exempts them from liability in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
