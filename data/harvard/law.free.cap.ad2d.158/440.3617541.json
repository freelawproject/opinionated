Therefore, summary judgment was properly denied <em>(see, Leamy v Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </em>39 NY2d 271; <em>Simon v Government Employees Life Ins. Co., </em>79 AD2d 705; <em>Wittner v IDS Ins. Co., </em>96 AD2d 1053). In addition, there is a question of fact as to whether the plaintiff and the decedent were indeed business partners as the plaintiff claims. Thompson, J. P., Lawrence, Eiber and Balletta, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
