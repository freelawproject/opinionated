KAPLAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Parmalat Finanziaria, S.p.A., Parmalat S.p.A. and their affiliates (collectively, \u201cParmalat\u201d) collapsed upon the discovery of a massive fraud that reportedly involved the understatement of Parmalat\u2019s debt by nearly $10 billion and the overstatement of its net assets by $16.4 billion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, purchasers of Parmalat securities, Dr. Enrico Bondi, the Italian-appointed representative of Parmalat\u2019s estate, and a Parmalat affiliate, seek damages against Parmalat\u2019s accountants, banks and others. The matter now is before the Court on the motions of Grant Thornton International (\u201cGTI\u201d) and Grant Thornton LLP (\u201cGT US\u201d) for summary judgment dismissing the complaints. The motion raises issues similar to those resolved in a recent opinion in involving another large accounting firm, familiarity with which is assumed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-18\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-19\">Plaintiffs sue under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their claims against GTI and GT U.S. rest on the premise that those defendants are vicariously liable for the alleged fraud of GT Italy, one of Parmalat\u2019s former auditors, which has not joined in the motion. The Court assumes familiarity with plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to the Parmalat scandal and GT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Italy\u2019s role. Accordingly, it suffices for present purposes to outline briefly Grant Thornton\u2019s structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">GTI is a non-profit corporation organized under Illinois law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It describes itself as an \u201cinternational membership organization\u201d or \u201cumbrella\u201d organization of member firms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These member firms, including Grant Thornton S.p.A. (\u201cGT Italy\u201d) and GT US, are organized under the laws of their respective jurisdictions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is the member firms that actually carry out the auditing and accounting functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Accounting and auditing standards and regulation of the accounting profession often are country specific. In addition to complying with any locally applicable rules, however, Grant Thornton member firms follow professional standards and auditing procedures and use software promulgated by GTI in conducting their audits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Member firms are required to submit to regular quality assurance reviews and almost universally practice under the name \u201cGrant Thornton.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They must promote other GT member firms to their international clients and provide information about international clients to GTI.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Partners of member firms attend GTI meetings and serve on GTI committees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Although disclaimers on GTI\u2019s website assert the legal separateness of GTI and its members,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> GTI in 2001 directed its member firms to omit \u201cInternational\u201d from its name and to use a standardized description of the organization in publications, press releases and on websites. This description referred to GTI as \u201cGrant Thornton\u201d and member firms as \u201clocal firms.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The change was part of a rebranding effort by GTI designed to demonstrate that member firms are part of \u201cone confident and unified organization.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">\n<em>A. Summary Judgment Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Where, as here, the burden of proof at trial would fall on the nonmoving party, it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a lack of evidence to go to the trier of fact on an essential element of the non-movant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that event, the non-moving party must come forward with admissible evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact for trial in order to avoid summary judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\n<em>B. Respondeat Superior Liability for Section 10(b) Violations by GT Italy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Whether GTI and GT U.S. may be held liable for the securities violations and other actions of GT Italy turns on whether they had principal-agent relationships with GT Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">An agency relationship exists under Illinois law<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> when the principal has the right to control the manner and method in which the agent performs its work.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cAn agent\u2019s authority may be either actual or apparent, and actual authority may be either express or implied.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The exisfence of an agency relationship may be established by direct or \u201ccircumstantial evidence, including the situation of the parties, their acts, and other relevant circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The alleged agent\u2019s authority, however, may be established only by the words or conduct of the alleged principal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">\n<em>1. Right to Control GT-Italy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">\u201cThere is no rigid rule for determining whether a person is an agent.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Courts consider a number of factors, \u201cbut the right to control the manner in which the work is performed is considered to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>predominant factor.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Court therefore first will consider the issue of control.</p>\n<p id=\"ACx\">\n<em>a. GTI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Plaintiffs point to numerous facts indicating that GTI exercised control over \u201cthe manner and method\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by which its member firms, including GT Italy, performed their work.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> GTI executed an agreement with each of its member firms in which the member firm agreed to conduct itself \u201cin a manner consistent with GTI policies, procedures, guidelines, specifications and directions issued by GTI ... including ... the GTI Policies and Procedures Manual and any GTI communications on technical and professional matters.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> GTI\u2019s audit manual, in turn, provided nearly 200 pages of detailed auditing procedures and methods, known as the Horizon Audit Approach, \u201cto be followed by all partners and staff.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> GTI required member firms to use its Explorer auditing software.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Evidence of GTI\u2019s control extends beyond the manner in which member firms audited their clients. GTI required member firms to adopt its quality control standards and code of ethics.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While it did not require member firms to adopt a specific risk management policy, it demanded that member firms either implement a policy that met specifications set out in GTI\u2019s quality assurance manual or adopt GTI\u2019s risk management policy.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Plaintiffs point also to evidence that GTI controlled the manner in which member firms branded and marketed themselves to clients. GTI required member firms to \u201cadopt the Grant Thornton style\u201d on their stationery and business cards in order to maintain a \u201c[cjonsistent look and feel\u201d among member firms.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> GTI could require member firms to submit their forms and publications to GTI to ensure compliance with GTI\u2019s guidelines.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Member firms\u2019 web sites had to conform to GTI guidelines as well.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> GTI even mandated where in their offices member firms hung signs carrying the Grant Thornton name.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">GTI established detailed guidelines about how member firms should refer to GTI and themselves. After observing that the use of the phrase \u201cGrant Thornton International\u201d caused prospective clients to question the structure and organization of the firm, GTI instructed member firms to refer only to \u201cGrant Thornton,\u201d not \u201cGrant Thornton International,\u201d in promotional materials and to use a new \u201cGrant Thornton\u201d logo.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It circulated a memorandum providing examples of permissible language to describe both GTI and member firms. These referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>GTI as an \u201cinternational organisation\u201d and directed prospective clients to \u201ccontact [their] local Grant Thornton office for details.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> GTI instructed member firms not to use a list of terms including \u201cmember firm,\u201d \u201ccorrespondent firm,\u201d and \u201cnetwork,\u201d in part because they \u201cdr[e]w attention to the structure\u201d of the firm.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Additionally, plaintiffs presented evidence that GTI controlled member firms\u2019 actions through its periodic reviews and disciplinary measures. Each member firm was expected to submit to a comprehensive review of its operations, policies, and procedures every three years.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> As part of the review process, a representative from GTI or another member firm examined the member firm\u2019s audit work.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">GTI possessed \u201ca range of different possible actions\u201d to discipline a member firm.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Sanctions included the demotion of a member firm to correspondent status, hiring of new partners for the member firm, termination of existing personnel, and expulsion of the member firm.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In practice, it in fact imposed at least some of these sanctions on member firms. Following an adverse review, GTI reclassified the El Salvador member firm as a correspondent firm, which included loss of the right to use the Grant Thornton name, and required that it hire new partners.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> After an Indonesian member firm feuded publically with a second Indonesian member firm, GTI sanctioned the offending firm by imposing nine non-negotiable requirements, including the resignation of one of the member firm\u2019s directors.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Additionally, in the wake of the Parmalat collapse, GTI threatened GT Italy with expulsion unless managing partner Lorenzo Penca resigned from that position immediately whereupon GT Italy suspended Penca and a second partner and Parmalat auditor.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">GTI contends that it nevertheless is entitled to summary judgment because there is no evidence that, if credited, would permit a finding that GTI controlled the specific GT Italy audit work that allegedly gave rise to plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries. But GTI overstates its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-17\">For centuries, the principal has been liable for the torts, including the intentional torts, of its agent as long as the agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>acted within the scope of its employment\u2014 and regardless of whether the principal directed or caused' the agent to engage in the tortious activity. Justice Story\u2019s early treatise on agency put the matter aptly years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">\u201cIt is a general doctrine of law, that, although the principal is not ordinarily liable ... in a criminal suit, for the acts or misdeeds of his agent ... yet he is held liable to third persons in a civil suit for frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances or misfeasances and omissions of duty of his agent in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or, indeed, know of such misconduct ....\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Or, as the Restatement now puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201c(1) An employer is subject to vicarious liability for a tort committed by its employee acting within the scope of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">\u201c(2) An employee acts within the scope of employment when performing work assigned by the employer or engaging in a course of conduct subject to the employer\u2019s control. An employee\u2019s act is not within the scope of employment when it occurs within an independent course of conduct not intended by the employee to serve any purpose of the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">\u201c(3) For purposes of this section, (a) an employee is an agent whose principal controls or has the right to control the manner and means of the agent\u2019s performance of work, and (b) the fact that work is performed gratuitously does not relieve a principal of liability.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">As GTI does not question that GT Italy, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it was an agent, acted within the scope of its agency, the only material question as to vicarious liability here is whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a rational jury to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that GTI controlled <em>or </em>had the right to control GT Italy\u2019s work on the Parmalat audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">GT Italy contracted in its member firm agreement to conduct itself \u201cin a manner consistent with GTI policies, procedures, guidelines, specifications and directions issued by GTI ... and any GTI communications on technical and professional matters.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> GTI required member firms to follow its Horizon audit methodology and use its proprietary Explorer software.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> These tools prescribed the \u201cmanner and method\u201d by which member firms conducted audits. They went beyond mere \u201cguidelines\u201d or \u201cprofessional standards,\u201d dictating step-by-step instructions for auditors. For example, one chapter of the GTI Audit Manual set forth the \u201cprocedures that <em>must </em>be performed in all audits to enable the audit team to understand and document\u201d the client\u2019s accounting system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>and internal controls.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Another chapter described when and how various \u201canalytical procedures\u201d should be used during an audit.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Thus, the evidence here plainly would justify a finding that GTI controlled or, at least, had the right to control the manner in which GT Italy conducted its allegedly fraudulent audits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The fact that GT Italy and individual auditors may have exercised some independent judgment in conducting audits<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> or could tailor some of the instructions contained in the audit manual to fit the legal rules of a particular country<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> would not require a contrary conclusion. The fact that a professional employee or agent exercises independent judgment in the course of his or her employment does not preclude holding the principal liable.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Moreover, GT Italy\u2019s tailoring of the audit methodology was limited. GT Italy partner Massimo Barbaria testified that \u201cadapting\u201d GTI audit to the \u201cItalian situation\u201d meant translating it into Italian and using only those procedures applicable to a specific client. He explained that the methodology and the software as provided by GTI were \u201cparticularly suitable for ... big companies or listed companies[ ] such as Parmalat.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">GTI argues further that any control it exerted through its audit methodology requirements and software would not have prevented GT Italy\u2019s deliberate fraud.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> But that is quite beside the point in view of the fact that principals are liable for the torts of their agents committed within the scope of their agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">GTI contends also it did not control GT Italy because two GT Italy partners who worked on the Parmalat audit did not even know there was an entity called GTI and, in any event, there were no GTI personnel on GT Italy\u2019s audit team.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> GTI\u2019s first argument is less than compelling.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>even if GTI were correct, it would not change the result. Even clear evidence that two GT Italy partners on the Parmalat account did not know of GTI would be insufficient to refute plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that GTI controlled GT Italy. Furthermore, GTI\u2019s argument that GTI personnel did not perform the daily \u201ctasks essential to serving GT Italy\u2019s clients\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> misses the point. A principal may be held liable vicariously for acts committed by its agents in the course of the principal\u2019s business even if the principal did not itself participate in those acts.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Finally, GTI argues that its request that GT Italy suspend two auditors and GTI\u2019s subsequent termination of GT Italy\u2019s member firm agreement do not demonstrate control as a matter of law,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> While this may be true,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> plaintiffs are not required at this juncture to demonstrate control as a matter of law. They must demonstrate only that there is a genuine issue of material fact that GTI controlled GT Italy. This they have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>b. GT US</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">GT U.S. seeks summary judgment on a somewhat different ground. Its position is that GT U.S. controlled neither GTI nor GT Italy and therefore is entitled to dismissal even if GT Italy was GTI\u2019s agent. Plaintiffs contend that GT U.S. controlled GTI, and thus indirectly controlled GT Italy, making GT Italy its subagent.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">According to traditional agency principles, an agent may appoint subagents to perform the tasks or functions the agent has agreed to perform for the principal.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> As the Restatement describes it, \u201c[t]he relationships between a subagent and the appointing agent and between the sub-agent and the appointing agent\u2019s principal are relationships of agency.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> In view of the fact that a jury would be entitled to conclude that GTI controlled GT Italy, the fundamental question presented by GT US\u2019s motion is whether plaintiffs have put forth sufficient evidence to justify a finding that GT U.S. controlled GTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">The evidence suggests that GTI is disproportionately dependent upon and influenced by a single member firm: GT-US. First, GT U.S. had the power to veto significant decisions related to GTI governance and structure. It held two seats on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the at least twelve member GTI board of directors.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The two GT U.S. directors held veto power over GTI\u2019s addition of new member or correspondent firms, amendment of GTI\u2019s bylaws, articles of incorporation, member firm agreements and name use agreements.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Additionally, GT U.S. could veto a decision to change the number of members on the GTI board and to elect or remove GTI\u2019s managing director or officers.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Second, GT U.S. provided GTI with funding, office space and employees. During the relevant period, GTI depended on annual contributions from member firms for funding, and GT U.S. was the largest contributor.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Third, GTI had no offices or employees of its own.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> GTI operated out of GT US\u2019s Chicago offices and GT UK\u2019s London offices and relied on personnel largely from GT U.S. and GT UK.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> For example, GTI\u2019s chief executive always has been either a partner or former partner of GT U.S. or GT UK. Robert Kleckner, a former GT U.S. partner, served GTI as managing director from 1991 to 2001.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> David McDonnell, a GT UK partner, replaced Kleckner as GTI\u2019s chief executive officer in 2001,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> GT U.S. personnel provided all financial and accounting functions for GTI at the expense of GT US, and a GT U.S. partner acted as GTI\u2019s secretary treasurer.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> During at least part of the time period relevant here, GTI\u2019s director of audit and quality control and the chair of GTI\u2019s information technology committee were GT U.S. partners.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Additionally, GT US\u2019s general counsel provided legal advice to GTI.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Finally, there is evidence that GT U.S. controlled significant GTI decisions through its role in the Executive Partners Group (\u201cEP Group\u201d).<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> This informal advisory group consisted of the chief executive officers of GTI, GT US, GT UK, and the two Canadian member firms.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> However, according to GTI managing director Robert Kleckner, the GT U.S. and GT UK representatives played a larger role than their Canadian counterparts.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Kleckner testified that the approval of the EP Group was \u201cimportant\u201d because it \u201chad control over the resources.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> For this reason he discussed \u201cgeneral strategic issues[,] ... governance changes\u201d and \u201cinitiatives requiring resources with\u201d this group before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>presenting such initiatives to GTI\u2019s board.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Kleckner believed that \u201csignificant change worldwide can only take place through the joint leadership of\u2019 GT U.S. and GT UK.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">There is evidence of at least one instance in which the EP Group actually exerted control over GTI\u2019s decision making. Before a GTI board meeting, Kleckner floated a proposal he intended to share with the GTI board to the EP Group. When the EP Group rejected the proposal, Kleckner summarily removed it from the GTI board\u2019s agenda. Kleckner explained, \u201cwhy clutter the agenda ... with something I know is going to be a dead issue.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">GT U.S. counters these indicia of GT US\u2019s power to control the actions of GTI essentially by taking many in isolation and contending that each, considered alone, would not compel a finding of control. It argues, for example, that the veto power of the GT U.S. representatives on the GTI board did not carry with it formal authority to require GTI to act affirmatively as GT U.S. directed, that the fact that senior officers of GTI simultaneously served in senior positions at GT U.S. did not make their actions while wearing their GTI hats the actions of GT US, and that the influence of the GT U.S. members of the EP Group was limited by the participation in that group of executive partners of other member firms. But these arguments once again miss central points.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The beauty of the Bayeaux tapestry or the genius of a Bach concerto cannot be appreciated by looking only at individual stitches on the fabric or by listening only to the B flats. Just so here. The question whether GT U.S. controlled GTI cannot or, at least, need not be resolved by looking at each individual piece of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">In the last analysis, the question before the Court is whether the evidence as a whole is sufficient to permit \u2014 not compel\u2014 a rational jury to conclude that GT U.S. controlled GTI. Considering all of the evidence as a whole, the Court holds that it is. That is not to say that the points advanced by GT U.S. lack force. It is to say only that it is beyond the Court\u2019s proper function to resolve the conflicting inferences and conclusions that may be drawn from evidence that, in the Court\u2019s view, quite plainly cuts in different directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">\n<em>2. Consent to Agency Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">Defendants argue that GTI and GT U.S. denied GT Italy the ability to act as their agent, relying upon provisions of the member firm and name use agreements.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Section 12.3 of the member firm agreement, for example, provided that a member firm \u201cmay not act for or bind any other member firm or GTI, for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">The short answer to this contention is that disclaimers contained in the agreements between and among GT US, GTI and GT Italy, whatever their effect on the rights of those parties <em>inter se, </em>are not conclusive of the question as against non-parties. They at best are some evidence favorable to GTI and GT US.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> And they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>are insufficient to require summary judgment of dismissal in light of the other evidence favorable to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Defendants argue also that an agency relationship cannot be created without the consent of both parties and that such consent is lacking here. Defendants\u2019 initial premise is correct as far as it goes.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> But the conclusion does not follow. Consent may be inferred from actions, not merely the words, of the putative principal and agent.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> The evidence is sufficient to infer such consent here. By way of example only, GTI\u2019s and GT US\u2019s actions (1) encouraging member firms to practice under the Grant Thornton name, (2) promulgating and enforcing policies and procedures governing most aspects of member firms\u2019 operation, and (3) working to achieve a certain level of quality in member firms\u2019 work arguably demonstrated their consent to allow GT Italy to act on their behalf. Likewise, GT Italy\u2019s submission to defendants\u2019 regulation would permit a reasonable jury to infer that GT Italy consented to act as defendants\u2019 agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>C.Alter Ego</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">As an alternative to their agency argument, plaintiffs contend that GTI was GT US\u2019s <em>alter ego </em>which GT U.S. used to conduct its own business.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> As plaintiffs have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether GT U.S. controlled GTI, the Court does not reach plaintiffs\u2019 <em>alter ego </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">\n<em>D. Section 20(a) Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">Defendants contend they are entitled to summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 Exchange Act Se\u00e9tion 20(a) claim. They argue that control of a primary violator under Section 20(a) must extend to the transaction in question \u2014 GT Italy\u2019s audits of Parmalat \u2014 whether or not such control was exercised.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> However, this Court recently ruled that the plain language of Section 20(a) requires only control of a person or entity liable under the chapter, not participation in or direction of the transaction constituting the violation.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> As discussed above, plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence that GTI and GT U.S. had the ability to control the manner and method of the preparation of member firms\u2019 audit reports. The Court thus concludes there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether GTI and GT U.S. were controlling persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">\n<em>E. Vicarious Liability After Stoneridge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">Defendants argue also that plaintiffs\u2019 claim that GTI and GT U.S. are vicariously liable for the alleged federal securities law violations of their agent, GT Italy, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>survive the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>91</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court recently concluded that <em>Stoneridge </em>does not foreclose an Exchange Act claim based on the vicarious liability of a principal for a violation committed by its agent acting within that agent\u2019s scope of employment.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on theories of vicarious liability survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaints [04 Civ. 0030 docket item 983; 04 MD 1653 docket item 1585; 04 Civ. 9771 docket item 613; 06 Civ. 2991 docket item 183] is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\">.

Grant Thornton International, et al., </em>No. 06 Civ. 2991(LAK), from the Northern District of Illinois to this Court for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. As the transferee forum, the Court applies the substantive law that would have been applied by the transferor forum. <em>See Menowitz v.
