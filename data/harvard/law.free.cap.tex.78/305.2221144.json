The court erred in refusing the special charge asked by defendant: \u201cIf you find and believe from the evidence that the message from W. M. Andrews to T. G. Andrews was delivered to him prior to the burial of Mrs. Anna Andrews, and the relatives of Mrs. Anna Andrews, notwithstanding the delivery of said message, buried her, then you are instructed that plaintiff can not recover the damages claimed by him for being denied the privilege of being present at the burial of his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-16\">2. The verdict of the jury is against the evidence in this, that the evidence showed that the message was delivered prior to the arrangements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>for burial that evening. Mrs. Andrews was buried before the first train leaving Greenville could reach Jacksonville; the burial was had with full knowledge that plaintiff was coming on the train he had been requested to come on, because, as proven, of the threatening weather and uncertainty of the train.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-5\"><em>Perkins, Gilbert &amp; Perkins, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqT\">\u2014 It is not error to refuse a special charge asked if it has been substantially and correctly submitted in the court\u2019s general charge. The court in its general charge uses this language:- \u201cBut if you do not believe from the evidence that defendant was guilty of negligence as aforesaid in transmitting said message, or if negligent you do not believe that such negligence was the proximate cause of said burial taking place before plaintiff\u2019s arrival, or if you believe that such burial would have been made before plaintiff\u2019s arrival, even though said message had been delivered at the proper time, if it was not so delivered, you will find for the defendant.\u201d Railway v. Medaris, 64 Texas,92.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-6\">HOBBY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AoR\">There is error, we think, in the judgment rendered in the7court below. W. M. Andrews, the appellee in this case, resided in the town of Greenville, Texas. His mother died in the town of Jacksonville, Texas, on the 22d of January, 1888, a few minutes after 5 o\u2019clock in the evening. At about 11 o\u2019clock that night he received the following message, sent from <em>W.JML- </em>English from Jacksonville: \u201c'Gome on first train. Your mother fell dead.\u201d The first <em>train </em>which could have taken him to Jacksonville after the receipt of the message left Greenville between 4 and 5 o\u2019clock p. m. on January 23 and reached Jacksonville at 10 o\u2019clock p. m. on the same day. This train h\u00e9 took and arrived at Jacksonville at 10 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Before leaving Greenville he sent through appellant\u2019s agents the following message to his brother at Jacksonville: \u201cI will be there to-night.\u201d This message reached that place about 10 o\u2019clock on the morning of January 23, and was delivered to his brother on the same day about 4 o\u2019clock p. m., and prior to the burial of his mother and about the time preparations were being made to start with the body to the cemetery. The burial, however, was not delayed, but took place about five hours before Andrews arrived at 10 o\u2019clock p. m. Such are the facts, in substance, on which this suit was brought by him against the appellant to recover $5000 actual and $5000 exemplary damages resulting from the delay on the part of appellant in delivering appellee\u2019s message to his brother announcing his intention to arrive at Jacksonville that night, and by reason of which he was prevented from being p'resent at the burial of his mother. The right to recover is predicated on the claim that if the telegram had been delivered earlier the burial of his mother would have been postponed until his arrival, and that having been delivered on the 23d January at about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>4 o\u2019clock p. m. it was too late to postpone said burial, and he was deprived thereby o\u00ed the privilege of being present at such burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">There was a verdict and judgment for appellee for $250. This judgis before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Several errors are assigned. \"VVe do no not think it necessary to consider each of them. Among them is the third, which complains of the refusal of the court to give this charge: \"If you find and believe from the evidence that the message from W. M. Andrews to T. G. Andrews was delivered to him prior to the burial of Mrs. Anna Andrews, and the relatives of Mrs. Anna Andrews, notwithstanding the delivery of said message, buried her, then you are instructed that plaintiff can not recover the damages claimed by him for being denied the privilege of being present at the burial of the mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Although the court may have in general terms submitted the question contained in the foregoing instruction, the facts of this case required that it should have been pointedly presented to the jury, as indicated in the requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict and judgment is questioned by the last assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">It is unquestionably beyond controversy that at the time of the receipt by appellee of the message, at 11 o\u2019clock at night of January 22, announcing his mother\u2019s death he could not under any circumstances disclosed by the proof have reached Jacksonville before 10 o\u2019clock on the night of January 23. This was a fact as obvious to those sending the message as it was to him. Yet his relatives at Jacksonville made all the necessary preparations for the funeral and buried his mother about five hours prior to the earliest period of time they knew it was possible for him to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">The message announcing his coming was received by his relatives before the burial, and it could have been postponed- until he arrived. This, however, was not done by those who alone possessed the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Whatever damage he sustained was, we think, occasioned manifestly by the failure of his relatives to postpone the burial until his arrival. Under such facts it can not be seriously insisted that appellant is liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">We think the judgment should be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\"><em>Reversed and </em>remanded\u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">Adopted October 28, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
