Failure to Answer to\" a Cross-Interrogatory.\u2014Motion to suppress depositions of a witness on ground that witness had failed to answer a material cross-interrogatory.

Conversations with a Deceased.\u2014Conversations when otherwise pertinent and competent are not grounds of error because the objecting party sought to prove that the property was owned by the deceased.

The court did not err in admitting the testimony to the declarations of Thomas Barron, deceased, as to the ownership of the jack in dispute.

The court did not err in admitting the testimony of appellee in regard to statements made about the ownership of the jack by Thomas Barron in his lifetime, there being no issue in this case between the estate of Thomas Barron, deceased, and appellee, Thomas Barron having merely been the agent of appellee in the purchase of said jacks, and appellant being clearly a naked trespasser seeking by parol to set up an equitable title in estate of Thomas Barron, deceased, to the jack.

The court did not err in sustaining appellee\u2019s objections to the introduction of the order of sale, report of sale, and bill of sale to appellant. Appellee\u2019s objection to said testimony being, first, because the testimony was irrelevant; second, because the instrument offered did not tend to show title in appellant to the jack in controvery; third, because the inventory of said estate as was admitted showed only three Spanish jacks and one'jenny, all of the aggregate value of 8150, and none of the instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ments offered conveyed or attempted to convey any jacks whatever.

A recorded mark and brand is prima facie evidence of ownership, and is notice to all subsequent purchasers. 47 Texas, 568; 1 Ct. App. C. C., sec. 858; Rev.

W. Bush to recover a certain jack claimed by plaintiff, and alleged to have been taken and converted by defendant on December 1, 1886. The suit was instituted in May, 1887. The value of the jack was alleged to be 8525, and damages for his use were laid at 8500.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The defendant pleaded a general denial, statute of limitations of two years, and title in himself. A trial before the jury resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of 8300, the value of the animal, and 8150 damages. This judgment is appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">The first error assigned is the action of the court in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the depositions of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses Joe Barron and Neil Morrison, for the reasons stated in bills of exception Nos. 1 and 2. The objections to the depositions were that they-were not taken before an officer authorized by law to take the same; that the certificate of the officer fails to give the name and official character of said officer, and does not state that the answers to the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories were made and signed and sworn to before said officer by the witness Joe Barron.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The officer\u2019s certificate.is as follows: \u201cSworn to and subscribed before me this August 25, A. D. 1887. John H. Smith, justice of the peace, Ellis County, Texas.\u201d The receipt of the postmaster recites that he received the depositions from \u201c J. H. Smith, J. P., Ellis Co.,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Subdivision 1 of article 2226 of the Revised Statutes provides in substance that the commission to take the answers of a witness residing in the State, when his evidence may be desired in the form of depositions, shall be executed, etc., by <em>\u201c </em>any clerk of the District Court, judge or clerk of the County Court, or any notary public of the proper county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">It does not authorize a justice of the peace, unless it does by reason of the fact that he is under our law ex officio a notary public. In the present case it might be admitted that the certificate sufficiently shows the officer to be an ex officio notary public, and still the assignment of error is well taken and the motion to suppress the deposition should have prevailed. The officer\u2019s certificate, we think, failed to show, as the statute required it should, that the answers to the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories were signed by the witness before him. It is essential that the certificate should show this; or if it does not appear therefrom alone, the caption may be resorted to to aid in this respect the certificate, and if from both it satisfactorily appears it will be sufficient. In this case the caption is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>simply as follows: \u201cAnswers to interrogatories propounded by plaintiff to Joe Barron, a resident of Ellis County, Texas.\u201d This does not, when read in connection with the certificate, show that the answers were signed by the witness before the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The motion to suppress the depositions of the witness Joe Barron we think should have been sustained. Chapman v. Allen, 15 Texas, 282; Thompson v. Haile, 12 Texas, 139; Slaughter v. Rivenbark, 35 Texas, 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The grounds of objection to the deposition of the witness Heil Morrison were that he had failed and refused to answer defendant\u2019s cross-interrogatory Ho. 1 in this, that he failed to state \u201c when and where the conversation about the subject matter occurred between him and Thomas Barron.\u201d The witness was asked, in substance, \u201cif he related any conversation had, etc., between Thomas Barron and any one else in relation to the jack, state when and Avhere you heard it,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The answer was, \u201cI don\u2019t remember any one being present; our conversation was of a private nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">This witness had stated in answer to the direct interrogatory that \u201c Thomas Barron, at his house in Ellis County, in 1880, had told him when taking the jack to appellee\u2019s ranch in Fisher County that he had bought it for appellee at. his direction and with his money.\u201d This we think fully answered the question of appellant as to when and where the conversation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">It is true that the answer to the cross-interrogatory is not responsive. But the answer to the direct interrogatory does contain the information as to the time and place of the conversation referred to, and no more than this could have been attained had the answer to the cross-interrogatory contained the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">The second assignment is that the court erred in allowing the plaintiff Solomon Barron to testify to conversations had with the deceased and statements made by the latter with reference to the title to the jack, the said Thomas Barron having since died.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">There was no error in admitting this evidence. Solomon Barron, the appellee, was not claiming the animal as the heir of Thomas Barron, deceased, or under him. Ho judgment could have been rendered against him or for him as such heir. He was claiming in his own right and denying that Thomas Barron or any other person had any title adverse to him. Article 2248 of the Revised Statutes has no application to his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-13\">The appellant\u2019s next assignment is, in substance, that there Avas error in admitting the testimony of the Avitnesses Joe Barron, Heil Morrison, and Hamp Collett as to the declarations of Thomas Barron to the effect that he had purchased the animal with his father\u2019s (appellee\u2019s) money and under his directions for him. The objection urged to this evidence was that Thomas Barron was appellant\u2019s vendor. There was no evidence of any title or claim to the property in controversy from Thomas Barron to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>appellant. The statements testified to by the witnesses named were made during Barron\u2019s lifetime and before appellant set up any claim. Appellant\u2019s claim was under an alleged sale by Barron\u2019s administrator. The objection to the evidence, we think, was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\">Neither do we think there was error in excluding the order of sale, report, and confirmation thereof by the Probate Court of Nolan County, and the bill of sale from the administratrix of the estate of Thomas Barron to appellant conveying the remainder of the stock of horses of said estate. It was not pretended that the jack in controvery was embraced in this bill of sale or that this animal constituted any part of the estate of Thomas Barron. It seems to have been admitted that the inventory of the estate showed of this character of property only <em>\u201cthree </em>Spanish jacks and one jenny,\u201d and that prior to this sale no jacks had been sold by the estate. The evidence was immaterial and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">The charge of the court that the <em>\u201c </em>recorded brand and mark of Solomon Barron was evidence proper to consider in connection with all the facts,\u201d etc., is objected to. We think there was no error in giving this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The appellant complains that the court refused to give a special charge to the jury to the effect that if appellant or those under whom he claimed, etc., had had two years adverse, etc., possession of the jack prior to this suit, they would find for him. The court did instruct the jury as above indicated, omitting the language \u201cor those under whom he claims.\u201d This, we are of opinion, was in accord with the facts proved. There was no evidence of any adverse possession of the animal by Thomas Barron or his estate or any one under whom defendant claimed, and it would have been error to charge upon the theory of such possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The assignment to the effect that the verdict is contrary to and not supported by the testimony is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The verdict is supported by the proof in the case. But we are not able to say to what extent this verdict was influenced by the testimony of the witnesses erroneously admitted. The deposition of the witness Joe Barron was upon a vital issue\u2014the ownership of the property. That testimony was emphatic as to the declarations of Thomas Barron, deceased, that the property belonged to appellee; that he purchased it for him at his request and with his money. As this testimony, although there was other to the same effect, was well calculated to control the verdict and was improperly admitted, we think the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Adopted June 17, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
