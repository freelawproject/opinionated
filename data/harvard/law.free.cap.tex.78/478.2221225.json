Usury\u2014Pleading.\u2014-Where the pleadings of the party claiming a recovery upon a contract show that it is usurious the defense of usury may be raised by exception.

Usury.\u2014On September 5, 1878, an agreement in writing was made by which a maker of a promissory note bearing 10 per cent interest agreed to pay 12 per cent per annum, in consideration of two years extension from June 28, 1878. The time of extension secured being less than two years, the stipulated interest was more than 12 per cent per annum, and was usurious.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b494-12\">3.

Krause could not make a valid agreement on August 12, 1878, or at any period after that date, to pay 12 per cent interest annually from \u25a0June 23, lS^'S, because that would bea greater interest than the law allows and greater than the allegations charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-9\">4.

Pope, the appellee, on the 12th day of February, 1889, upon two promissory notes, and to foreclose lien upon certain tracts of land. Both notes were made by Krause, and were payable to the order of John Hancock. Both were for the sum of $3000, and dated June 23, 1875. Both retained a vendor\u2019s lien upon land described, and bore interest from date at the rate of 10 per cent per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">One of them became due in twelve months and the other one in twenty-four months after date. The last described note expressed that the interest on it was to be paid \u201cannually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The petition charged and the evidence showed that both notes were transferred by Hancock to the plaintiff on the 12th day of August, 1878.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">For the purpose of foreclosing the lien, in addition to the maker of the notes\u2014F.

Krause, Sr., for the sum of $1142.00 for attorney fees, without enforcing any lien for that part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">The court\u2019s conclusions of law with regard to interest are stated asfollows:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">\u201c1. Calculate interest on first note due without compounding at 10 per cent per annum toJune23, 1878, allowing credits as endorsed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-18\">\u201c2.

From June 23, 1878, calculate interest on both notes at 12 per cent per annum, compounded on last one due but not on first, up to February 19, 1884, after which time compound on both to date, allowing credits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Among other defenses the defendant F. Krause, Sr., demurred to tir\u00f3 petition on the ground that \u201csaid contract as set out in plaintiff's petition appears to be usurious and in violation of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The court overruled the exception and the ruling is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Appellee makes the point that \u201cthe allegation that there is usury in the contract is not sworn to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The statute on the subject only requires the answer setting up the defense of usury to be sworn to when the usury does not otherwise appear of record. Rev. Stats., art. 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">When the pleadings of the party seeking a recovery upon a contract show that it is usurious the defense may be properly raised by exception. The petition of the plaintiff very clearly shows that his right to recover of the defendants interest at the rate of 12 per cent instead of 10 per cent as originally contracted for depends upon the obligation of F. Krause dated the 5th day of September, 1878.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Our Constitution provides that all interest charged above 12 per cent per annum \u201cshall be deemed usurious.\u201d The obligation referred to was given in consideration of an extension of two years from the 23rd day of June, 1878. In fact Krause on the 5th day of September, 1878, suit not having been then instituted on the notes, had already had indulgence, without contract or consideration, for the period of time intervening between the 23rd day of June and the 5th day of September, 1878. What he really acquired by the contract was indulgence from the 5th day of September, 1878, to the 23rd day of June, 1880, a period of less than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">For this indulgence he promised to pay 24 per cent interest, which made the interest for the period of extension actually given something more than 12 per cent per annum, and consequently usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">It will be seen that by the instrument of writing dated the 19th day of February, 1884, and attached by plaintiff to his petition as exhibit B, he made his right to recover 12 per cent interest instead of 10 per cent depend upon the obligation dated September 5, 1878. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">It is sufficient for us to say\" that the rate of interest, or usury, predicated upon this obligation was carried into all of the subsequent agreements and made them obnoxious to the same objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">All agreements to pay interest at a greater rate than the 10 per cent originally agreed upon must be held null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">The original promises to pay interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum were not impaired by the subsequent unlawful promises. Cousins v. Grey, 60 Texas, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The agreement in the note that matured on the 23rd day of June, 1877, made the interest accruing on that note payable at the end of each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">If not paid when it matured the holder of the note was entitled by the terms of the note to interest on past due interest, to be computed at the rate of 10 per cent per annum on each installment as it matured until paid; but the terms of the note did not provide that the interest should be compounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The first agreement that we find for compounding interest is the one \u25a0dated the 19th day of February, 1884. The object of that agreement was not to compound, the interest lawfully accruing on the Jiotes, but it was an undertaking by the jnaker of the notes to pay compound interest on a stipulated amount made up largely of usurious and compound interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On account of the element of usury embodied in this part of the contract, it can not be enforced; and it does not become necessary for us to undertake to say what effect the stipulations with regard to intei'est upon interest, or compounding, would have had if they had been free from the vice of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The several agreements contain acknowledgments of the notes as subsisting demands, and the one last referred to contains a promise to pay \u201cif said notes be collected by suit an additional 10 per cent as attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">We find nothing objectionable in these features of the agreements. The attorney fees are a charge against the maker of the notes, and are not a lien upon the land, and the percentage is to be estimated upon the amount for which judgment is rendered against the maker of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">We find no valid agreement making the interest on the note that first became due bear interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">We conclude that plaintiff should have judgment against F. Krause, Sr., for the amount remaining due on the note that first matured, estimating interest without compounding from the date of the note to the date of the judgment at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, after deducting all credits shown by the findings of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">And for the amount due upon the note that matured last, with interest calculated by the same method and at the same rate, less credits found as aforesaid; and that interest at the same rate be allowed upon each annual installment of interest upon the last described note as it became due, calculated up to the date of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">And that his vendoi-,s lien should be foreclosed against all of the defendants upon the several tracts of land described in his petition and exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">And for attorney fees of 10 per cent upon the amount due him at the date of judgment upon the notes sued upon, with execution therefor against the defendant F. Krause, Sr., but without any lien as to that part of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The judgment here rendered must bear interest upon the gross amount thereof at the rate of 10 per cent per annum.
