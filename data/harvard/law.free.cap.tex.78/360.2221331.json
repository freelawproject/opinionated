Brown answered as receiver of the Texas Pacific Railway Company, and no further notice seems to have been taken of the other receiver against whom with Brown' the action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Missouri Pacific Railway Company answered, and there was a trial that resulted in a judgment against that company alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">There is nothing in the entire record to show that the action was discontinued as to the receivers or either of them, yet the court submitted the case to the jury as though the Missouri Pacific Railway Company was the only defendant, and the jury returned a verdict as follows: \"We the jury find for the plaintiff in the sum of $1324.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">On this verdict a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff against the Missouri Pacific Railway Company alone, no disposition whatever being made of the case as to either of the receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The case is submitted on many assignments of error relating to the conduct of the trial and its result, but it is evident that no final judgment has been rendered in the cause from which an appeal will lie, for the judgment does not dispose of the case as to all the defendants.
