If the facts published constitute a criminal libel their truth can not be set up by the defendants in justification or excuse. The plea of justification on the ground of truth must be as broad as the charge and must justify the precise charge. The facts must be stated with certainty, so that the plaintiff might have an opportunity of denying and taking - issue upon the facts alleged. Penal Code, arts. 616, 617, 642; Towns, on SI. and Lib., 3 ed., secs. 212, 355, 357, 361; Fidler v. Delavan, 20 Wend., 57; Van Hess v. Hamilton, 19 Johns., 349; Wachter v. Queenzer, \u00a189 H.

The court erred in admitting in evidence the testimony of Peter Ivey, defendant and a witness for defendants, over the objections of th\u00e9 plaintiff, upon the grounds that there, was no averment in the defendants\u2019 answer setting up said facts, and no allegations in said defendants\u2019 answer and plea of justification putting the plaintiff on notice that he would be called upon to meet such testimony; and because it was not competent to prove any specific acts or offenses of plaintiff not embraced in defendants\u2019 answer and plea of the truth of the alleged libelous article.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-17\">3. The plea of justification on the ground of truth must be as broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>as the charge and must justify the precise charge.

That steer was sold to Frank Kuhn, the aforesaid butcher, and he leaving it there until Sunday afternoon, butch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ered said steer, hauled it out to the slaughter pen, and there it was dressed and the meat brought from there to his market and offered for sale to his customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">This charge we think sufficiently specific; the petition set it out, and the averment of the answer that it was true we think was sufficient to-authorize proof of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">A witness was placed on the stand who proved the facts stated as above in the publication referred to, and it is urged that the court should have excluded his evidence for want of a sufficiently specific statement in the answer of the facts alleged to be true. What has been said as to the sufficiency of the answer'renders further consideration of the objection to the evidence unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">On the trial in the court below the defendants offered to prove and did prove by Peter Ivey, defendant and witness for defendants, \u201cthat about two months before the 9th of August, 1886, the plaintiff Kuhn bought a blue steer at the stock pens that had been wounded in a wreck by having two of his ribs broken, one of which said ribs was stuck through the steer\u2019s kidney; that said Kuhn slaughtered said steer for beef, and when it was slaughtered there was a blue bucketful of corruption in the steer\u2019s side; that said Kuhn hauled the beef of said steer to his market house for sale.\u201d To the introduction of said testimony the plaintiff objected, upon the ground that \u201cthere was no averment in the defendants\u2019 answer setting up said facts, and no allegations in defendants\u2019 answer and plea of justification putting the plaintiff on notice that he would be called upon to meet such testimony, and because it was not competent to prove any acts or offenses of plaintiff not embraced in the defendants\u2019 answer and plea of the truth of the alleged libelous article,\u201d which objections were overruled by the court and the testimony allowed to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The date of publication of the paper alleged to be libelous was alleged to have been August 9, 1886, and it contained the following: \u201cIt has been reported that one of our butchers has been in the habit of purchasing diseased and disabled cattle that were injured in transportation and left at the stock yards at this place, and after dressing their carcasses offers the meat for sale to his customers at his market.\u201d Then follows the statement before copied, and it must be conceded that the paper published was calculated to create the impression that the writer or writers of it intended to charge that appellant was guilty of the acts which it was stated were reported of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">If the charge be but a conclusion from facts not stated, as that the-person referred to is a thief or murderer, it is no doubt necessary for an answer alleging the truth of the charge to state the facts which make the party a thief or murderer and to allege that these exist; such, however, is not the indefinite nature of the charge made in the publication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and it was not error to admit the evidence complained of under the answer which alleged the facts stated in the publication to be true. There is no error in the judgment, and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Delivered October 31, 1890.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
