The names of the beneficiaries are not in writing; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">2.

I desire to state that I am insured in the Catholic Mutual Benefit Association in the sum of two thousand ($2,000) dollars, made payable to Lew F.

At the audit, when he was asked what his instructions were in respect of this fund, said that as.they were of a confidential character he must decline to answer, unless so ordered by the court, and when counsel stated he had reason to believe the beneficiaries were charities and within the statute, the witness was or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>dered to answer; whereupon he stated that the original instructions were that $1,000 were to be used for the education of his illegitimate son, $500 for masses and $500 for St. Francis Hospital, but that when the last will was made his sister Mary was substituted for his son as legatee, the other legacies to stand. The instructions to Mr. Holtzman were verbal. The premiums on the policy were paid by Mr. Kelley. Mr. Holtzman claims no interest in the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\">The court struck the fund from the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-6\"><em>Marr\u00f3n McQ-irr, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad0\">Parol evidence is not admissible : Sims v.

But his language in relation to this money \u2014 substantially identical in the two wills \u2014 was in no sense a testamentary disposition of it. Each will contained merely a recital of a fact antedating both, viz.: a disposition of the money already made through private instructions given by the testator to the beneficiary to whom it was payable. Neither will contains any further provision respecting the distribution of this fund, but the matter is left to rest on the directions previously given to the beneficiary ; and both wills dispose only of the residue of the testator\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">While the testator states that he is \u201c insured \u201d in the asso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ciation named, no copy of the instrument creating such insurance is contained in the paper-book of either party. In the appellant\u2019s history of the case, this instrument is described as a \u201c certificate of insurance.\u201d The appellee\u2019s petition avers that the money was paid to the beneficiary under the charter and by-laws of the association, and no denial of this appears in either the record or the appellant\u2019s argument. But neither the charter or by-laws are printed in either paper-book, nor was either, or the certificate of insurance, offered in evidence. Hence it is impossible to determine, from the record, the character of the testator\u2019s dominion over.the so-called insurance, or the extent to which it is to be deemed part of his estate. Apparently, the association was, in its nature, a fraternal order, with the disposition of its insurance fund fixed by its charter and by-laws, and not governed by the principles regulating ordinary insurance. Prima facie, the beneficiary was, in that character, entitled to the money; and a parol trust for its distribution was entirely lawful. This trust, so far as it relates to charities or religious uses, was created more than ten years before the testator\u2019s death, and was never revoked. The force of the directions from which it arose was not affected, by their repetition in connection with the instructions given for the last will within a calendar month preceding the testator\u2019s death. Those directions were entirely independent of both wills, and nothing was added to or taken from them by the reference to them in the wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">There is nothing in the record to show that the money paid by the association formed part of the testator\u2019s estate, and its inclusion in the administration account was obviously erroneous. Whether the appellee, would have been estopped by the confirmation of the account, without objection, or might have maintained his claim on distribution, and whether the beneficiary might have been required to pay the money in accordance with the parol trust, after including it in his account as executor, we need not now consider On his own petition, he would have been allowed to withdraw the item from the account. It has been withdrawn on petition of a party interested in the parol trust, and there appears no good reason for disturbing this adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
