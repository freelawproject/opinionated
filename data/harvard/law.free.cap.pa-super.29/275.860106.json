Because the bill of indictment is not based upon the information made before the committing magistrate and warrant issued in pursuance thereof, to-wit: April 22,1904, upon which defendant was arrested and after hearing gave bail for appearance to court, in that the record shows the information was made and warrant issued April 22, 1904, charging the perjury to have been committed on April 8, 1904, and indictment charges the offense to have been committed on April 22, 1904, being a separate and distinct offense for which defendant was never arrested nor preliminary hearing awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-13\">2. Because the bill of indictment purports to have been based upon an information made April 28, 1904, for which no warrant was ever issued by the committing magistrate, arrest made or any preliminary hearing held or awarded and is, therefore, invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>3. Because the record and bill of indictment shows that no warrant was issued or arrest ever made for the alleged crime set forth in the bill, the county detective having made a second complaint six days after the plaintiff\u2019s arrest for the alleged crime set forth in the indictment, but no warrant was ever issued or arrest made pursuant to said complaint made April 28, 1904, being six days after defendant\u2019s arrest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-3\">4. Because two.separate and distinct charges of perjury are set forth in the bill of indictment to-wit: the one alleged to have been committed on April 22, 1904, and the other on June 6, 1904. And neither of which is based upon an information made before the committing magistrate. The only information upon which the warrant was issued and arrest made being dated April 22, 1904, charging the offense to have been committed April 8, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">5. Because what purports to be a bill of indictment is vague, uncertain and indefinite, in that it does not sufficiently inform the defendant of the nature and cause of the accusation against her, nor does not show upon its face that the witnesses were sworn before the grand jury, nor that a true bill was found, there being indorsed on the cover of the indictment proper the names of witnesses and \u201c a true bill \u201d indorsed thereon by the foreman, said cover being pinned to the indictment. But what purports to be a bill of indictment is in truth and in fact two separate and independent indictments, charging different dates and both signed by the district attorney, and returned by the foreman to the court as one bill. No indorsement of the witnesses\u2019 names or prosecutor\u2019s appears on either of the bills. The only declaration that witnesses were called by the grand jury and sworn is the indorsement on the said cover of said indictments of eight witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">6. Because the indictment does not show on its face that the defendant was sworn in a judicial proceeding, nor that the testimony was material to that issue. Nor does it sufficiently set forth the character of the issue nor the purpose of the inquisition, and the bill therefore is bad for duplicity and uncertainty. Nor can perjury be maintained upon incompetent testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">7.

Here each count is in form a complete indictment, signed by the district attorney. But the legal effect of this joinder is not changed by the form of the counts, or by, the district attorney\u2019s signature to each ; the instrument remains in law an indictment containing two counts. And when a written instrument is contained on two or more sheets, it may be necessary that these should be fastened together to show their relation. The manner in which this is done is not material; it is sufficient that they are so attached to each other as to show that they are parts of one instrument. In the present case this lias been done, and the action of the grand jury and the court has been on the connected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sheets as a single indictment. Hence the appellant\u2019s objections on. this point are not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">The legal rules relating to the date of the offense, as laid in an indictment, have been sufficiently stated in the preceding case, which was based on the same transaction from which the indictment in the. present case arose. One of these rules is that the date must not be uncertain, and that two dates must not be laid for an offense completed on a single day. Tested by this rule, the first count of the indictment before us is fatally defective. In its essential points, it avers the holding of a coroner\u2019s inquest on April 7, 1904, in which the defendant was among the witnesses sworn and examined; an adjournment of the inquest to April 22, when the defendant was further examined; it then sets forth the matters which it was material for the inquest to know; and follows with the averment, \u201c That the said Lizzie Nailor, sworn as aforesaid, did then and there unlawfully, willfully, corruptly and falsely swear and testify \u201d to the matters assigned as perjury. Here are two dates, to which, in the structure of the indictment, the words \u201c then and there,\u201d as the time and place of the offense, equally apply; \u2022 hence the date to which they refer is wholly uncertain. If they may be understood as referring to both, the result is a charge of the same offense on each day, and is, in effect, duplicity, as charging two offenses in one count. A further defect appears, which is of itself fatal. It is a settled principle that when a statute describes, defines,' or creates an offense, and fixes a penalty, the indictment must charge the offense, substantially, in the statutory language. Section 14 of the penal code of March 31,1860, P. L. 382, provides that \u201c If any person shall willfully and corruptly commit willful and corrupt perjury,\u201d the penalty therein prescribed shall be imposed. Here the count under consideration, after negativing the truth of the defendant\u2019s testimony, avers that she well knew that it was \u201c false, perjured and corrupt, contrary to the form of the act of the general assembly,\u201d etc., but fails to aver that the de-\u2019 fendant, in manner and form aforesaid, then and there willfully and corruptly did commit willful and corrupt perjury. It charges no offense, either at common law or under the statute. As to this count, therefore, the judgment cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In the second count, June 6, 1904, is laid as the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>offense charged. This is subsequent to the complaint and hearing on which the count is based. Yet being prior to the finding of the indictment, subsequent to the statut\u00e9 describing the offense and fixing the penalty, and within the period prescribed by the statute of limitations, it is well laid, according to the principles referred to in the preceding case.'</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The contention that the defendant cannot legally be tried for the perjury charged, pending the indictment for abortion, cannot, under the circumstances, be sustained. The rule that the proceeding in which, it is charged, the perjury was committed, must be ended before the accused can be tried for perjury, so far as it applies to the case in hand, supports the commonwealth\u2019s contention in the premises. While the present indictment grew out of the coroner\u2019s inquest, its relation to that proceeding is not such as to bring it within the established rule. The present prosecution was not commenced until after the inquest had ended, and is a totally distinct proceeding. Had it been commenced by the commitment of the defendant by the coroner, on a verdict charging her with having caused the death under investigation, a different question would be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">It is the duty of a coroner to hold an inquest super visum corporis when there is reasonable ground to believe that death was caused by unlawful violence or other undue means. Should the evidence before him fail to show such cause of death, his jurisdiction in the premises is not thereby ousted, yet, upon a charge of perjury on the part of a witness, the materiality of the testimony which is the subject of the charge remains to he considered. To sustain the charge of perjury, the testimony must be not only false, but material to the issue. Among the cases illustrating this point are Crookshank v. Gray, 20 Johns. 344; Ross v. Rouse, 1 Wend. 475; Power v. Price, 12 Wend. 500; Power v. Price, 16 Wend. 450; Com. v. Pollard, 53 Mass. 225; Com. v. Grant, 116 Mass. 17. On a coroner\u2019s inquest, the issue is whether the death was caused by unlawful means. Evidence, either direct or circumstantial, tending to show that it was thus caused, is material, and so, also, is evidence in contradiction of this. But when it is shown that death was not due to such means, evidence relating to some act which in no way contributed to it is not material to the inquiry, and testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>on such a point lacks the materiality which is an essential ingredient of perjury. The case in hand presents a striking illustration. ' The inquest was held upon suspicion that death was the consequence of a miscarriage, unlawfully produced. The only operation shown to have been performed on the deceased was a not uncommon one for the replacement of a displaced uterus, and the evidence shows no relation between this and the death of the patient four months later. The testimony on this point was wholly immaterial, since it failed to support or contradict the view that death resulted from a criminal operation. If, indeed, the testimony of the accused had been the only evidence on which this conclusion rested, the question of its mate, riality would present a different aspect. But it was fully sus-, tained by the medical testimony produced by the commonwealth, and on the trial it was expressly admitted by the commonwealth \u201c that the operation was not a criminal operation, and a perfectly proper one.\u201d By this admission, and the evidence on which it was based, the question of death from unlawful meanso was eliminated from the case. Testimony in denial of an operation admittedly proper, and without bearing on' the cause of death, was wholly immaterial to the purpose of the inquest,\u2014 as much so as if it had related to the reduction of a dislocation, or the paring' of the finger nails. The matter in issue before. the coroner was apparently obscured by. the form of the question put to the witness. This related to \u201can operation,\u201d a term of indefinite scope, ranging, technically, from the extraction of a splinter with an instrument of any kind to an amputation, or the removal of a malignant growth, or of a fetus. It \"does not appear how the defendant understood the word, or how the coroner intended it to be understood. If she understood it as meaning a miscarriage, her denial that there was an operation was corroborated by the medical testimony on the part of the commonwealth showing that there was no miscarriage. If she understood it otherwise, her testimony respecting it was immaterial, since there was no evidence that death was due to any operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">In this view of the controlling features of th\u00e9 case, the defendant\u2019s \u25a0 testimony in denial of declarations alleged to have been made by her is immaterial. Further than this, the evidence in contradiction lacks the weight and certainty requisite, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to convict, even in the absence of the direct evidence in disproof of death by unlawful means.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">There are some unusual features connected with the two prosecutions of the defendant in this case, which we may properly notice. Though not formally accused before the coroner, her examination was obviously conducted on the theory that she was guilty of having taken part in a criminal operation, and aimed at obtaining admissions criminating herself. If such a course is to be permitted, it should certainly be with the caution that the witness is not legally required to make such admissions. The only caution that appears to have been given the witness was a notice, by the district attorney, that \u201c if she didn\u2019t tell the truth there was ten years waiting for her.\u201d The prosecution of the defendant, on both charges, appears marked by peculiar rancor. Though, on the trial for perjury, the commonwealth admitted that the operation in the case was not criminal, but perfectly proper, in the subsequent trial for abortion, on substantially the same evidenc\u00e9, it pressed for the conviction of the defendant for aiding in this operation, as a criminal abortion. And while the defendant has been convicted of both the offenses charged, the professional operators in the affair \u2014 the principal culprits if, as the commonwealth insisted, an abortion had been committed, \u2014 have been allowed to escape prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Judgment reversed and defendant discharged from her recognizance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
