This is conceded to have been their offer, and the question in dispute was confined to the sale of three pianos which the plaintiff contended were sold through her \u201c prospect,\u201d and by the defendants, that they were sold on an individual inquiry, directly made to the firm without her intervention or by reason of any other influence or suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">It was clearly shown on the trial that the plaintiff had registered a \u201cprospect \u201d for a sale to the Josephine Widener School and that three pianos were sold some six or seven months subsequently. Her theory that the sale was made on a \u201cprospect,\u201d and not to an unsolicited customer was supported by the fact that the commission on that sale was credited to three persons identified with the sales department. The plaintiff testified positively that a Mr. Doddridge, a duly accredited representative of the defendants, stated to her in their store, \u201c I remember of Mrs. Jacobs coming to see us about that \u2018 prospect \u2019 and giving us the prospectthat a Mr. Lamon, in the presence of the manager, stated that they had gone for six months to the school and failed to make a sale, and then had to get Mr. Street on the case; that \u201c he went out to see Mr. Widener and he sold the pianos to Mr. Widener.\u201d True, this was denied by Mr. Doddridge, and the Mr. Lamon mentioned by the plaintiff was not identified in court by her ; yet, if her statement was to be believed she was clearly entitled to the commission. It was for the jury and the jury alone to pass on this disputed fact. Their finding is amply supported by the testimony and it would have been an invasion of the rights of the jury for the court to have directed, a nonsuit. The rule in such cases has been recently announced by President Judge Pice in Kelton v. Fifer, 26 Pa. Superior Ct. 603, that a reference to it is a vindication of the course followed by the trial judge. \u201c It is true that the old scintilla doctrine has been long since exploded; the more reasonable is now as stated by Justice Sharswood in Howard Express Co. v. Wile, 64 Pa. 201, that, \u201c Where there is any evidence which alone justifies an inference of a disputed fact, it must go to the jury; and this is generally. true, whether the sufficiency of the evidence is raised upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>motion for a nonsuit, or at the conclusion of the trial in which the defendant has introduced countervailing evidence of a positive character.\u201d The case being for the jury, it was submitted to them with clear, adequate and impartial instructions, of which the defendants have no just cause to complain. It was the exclusive province of the jury to pass upon the credibility of evidence and ascertain the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
