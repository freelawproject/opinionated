Nevertheless the said defendant did pay the said $75.00 to the said widow, and the said widow has refused, and does refuse, to devote the same or any part thereof towards defraying the said funeral expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">The plaintiff therefore claims that the defendant association having disregarded its own rules and regulations, and in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>fiance of the said notice of the plaintiff, having refused to pay the money to the plaintiff, the said defendant is liable to pay the sum of <em>$75.00 </em>to the plaintiff, being the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s bill, and therefore brings this suit to recover the sum of 175.00 with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\">Defendant filed an affidavit of defense averring that the plaintiff was a mere volunteer.

But, apart from this defect in the statement, the plaintiff was not entitled to summary judgment. So far as the statement shows, he was a mere volunteer. There was no express contract between him and the defendant association, and no facts are alleged from which a contract on the part of the association to compensate him for the services and reimburse him for the expenditures rendered and laid out by him can be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The doctrine of those cases which hold that one for whose particular benefit a contract is made may maintain an action to enforce it, does not control the case as it is now presented. As the decedent had not designated any person to receive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>funeral benefit, it became the duty of the association, under the by-laws, to pay it to his widow, unless the chiefs of the tribe were satisfied that it would be diverted from its legitimate purpose, in which latter case they had full power to see that the funeral expenses were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">Assuming that the by-laws give them discretionary power to withhold payment of the stipulated sum to the widow or nearest relative, it does not necessarily follow that they are guilty of an abuse of discretion in not doing so simply because a third party \u2014 in this case the undertaker \u2014 notifies them that she had declared that she would not use the money for the purpose for which it was intended. In other words, they are not bound to take such a statement to them as absolute verity and to act accordingly. The fact that such notice was given may be relevant because it puts them upon inquiry, but it does not of itself conclusively, establish a legal or equitable obligation on the part of the association to pay the fund to the undertaker who, as a mere volunteer, has conducted the burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Appealylismissed without prejudice, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
