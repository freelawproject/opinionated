Before Ehrgood, P.

J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-17\">The court at the trial reserved the question \u201c whether, under all the evidence in this case, the plaintiff, under the averments in the statement, is entitled to recover for use and occupation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-18\">The first count, in the statement, is in trespass, founded on fraud and deceit. The evidence offered by the plaintiff did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>not support the allegations contained in said count and was not submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-3\">The plaintiff therefore rescinded the contract with the defendant without cause and unless the defendant also rescinded the contract or agreed to a rescission of the same there could be no recovery in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-4\">The plaintiff, after he had rescinded the contract, removed from the defendant\u2019s farm, whereupon the defendant immediately took possession of the same and afterwards sold the same to another party. He also retained possession of the plaintiff\u2019s house and lot for a period of one year and received the rent for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The question whether the defendant also rescinded the corn-tract was submitted to the jury and by them evidently determined against him. If the defendant also rescinded the contract it was his duty to relinquish possession of the plaintiff\u2019s house and lot and his retaining the same made him a trespasser and liable in damages as such. The statement in this case is very loosely drawn, but the defendant pleaded to the same instead of demurring and went to trial on the merits. The statement sets forth that the defendant also rescinded the contract and refused to give up the possession of the plaintiff\u2019s house and lot for a period of one year and collected the rent during that time to plaintiff\u2019s damage. After a trial upon the merits we do not believe the verdict of the jury should be set aside on account of defects such as are complained of in the statement and of which advantage should have been taken by demurrer, and especially where the verdict does substantial justice between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">And now, April 29, 1904, judgment is directed to be entered on the verdict upon payment of the jury fee. Exception to the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-7\"><em>P.

Superior Ct. 243.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Au9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>November 20,1905:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b375-3\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Anv\">Smith, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The question submitted for decision in the present case relates to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s statement to recover for the use and occupation of his land. This appears by the course of the trial and by the question reserved: \u201c Whether under all the evidence in this case the plaintiff, under the averments in the statement, is entitled to recover for use and occupation.\u201d While this reservation is not explicit or definite, and if viewed as referring to the sufficiency of the whole evidence, is bad (Wilson v. Steamboat Tuscarora, 25 Pa. 317; Wilde v. Trainor, 59 Pa. 439), yet as the sole purpose ascribed to it by its author, is that it deals only with the question of the sufficiency of the statement to warrant a recovery for use and occupation; and as there is no exception or objection to this interpretation, we accept this view of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Discarding the averments upon which recovery was forbidden and the surplusage, the remainder of the plaintiff\u2019s statement avers, in substance, \u201c that the defendant took possession and refused to give up the plaintiff\u2019s house and lot of ground for one year, and collected the rent from the tenant.\u201d The verdict was for the rent due and interest thereon, It is contended that the statement is defective in uniting two incongruous causes of action, sounding in tort and in contract. But this misjoinder is waived by a voluntary trial on the merits, and judgment. The alleged faults in pleading could have been amended under the act of 1806. To be effective these objections should have been presented on demurrer to the statement, \u201c after a trial on the merits, verdict, and judgment, no defect would be fatal unless it is shown to have injuriously affected the trial; on appeal the proper amendment will be considered to have been made: \u201d Chapin v. Cambria Iron Co., 145 Pa. 478; Allegheny v. Nelson, 25 Pa. 332. No such injurious showing appears in the record. Under the act of May 25, 1887, the remedy for the wrongful occupancy or use of the plaintiff\u2019s land is an action of trespass : Silliman v. Whitmer &amp; Son, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 243. The claims objected to were withdrawn from the jury and the case was submitted on the claim for use and occupation only. This was sufficiently averred and the recovery therefor was fully warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
