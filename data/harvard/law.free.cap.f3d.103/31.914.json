For the reasons assigned, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-23\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-24\">Manuel was an employee of Harrington Enterprises, Inc., a sandblasting and painting firm. In September 1990 Harrington was under contract to Texas Eastern Gas Pipeline Company to perform work on a fixed platform on the outer continental shelf.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-25\">On September 18 Manuel and several other employees were working aboard the M/V <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>DAVIS McCALL III, a vessel owned and operated by Cameron Offshore Boats. Manuel was responsible for operating and monitoring Harrington\u2019s sandblasting equipment on the vessel, which at that time was moored adjacent to Texas Eastern\u2019s platform. Manuel and his supervisor were on the back deck of the boat in the \u201cdog house\u201d when Manuel heard a hissing sound. Manuel left the dog house and moved quickly toward the stern of the vessel where the sandblasting hoses, which extended from the vessel up to the platform, were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Upon reaching the stem Manuel saw a bubble developing on one of the sandblasting hoses. Fearing that the hose would explode, Manuel ran toward the compressor to turn it off. As he ran his feet became entangled in an unused mooring line on the deck, causing him to fall, injuring both his left knee and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Manuel filed suit against, <em>inter alia, </em>Cameron,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming damages for its negligence under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York, Harrington\u2019s insurer, intervened seeking recovery of compensation payments made to Manuel. After a bench trial the district court rendered judgment in favor of Cameron, concluding that Cameron had not breached any legal duty owed to Manuel under section 905(b). Manuel and Fidelity &amp; Casualty appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and consider all questions of law <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The rulings on negligence and causation are findings of fact;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the determination of the existence <em>vel non </em>of a legal duty is a question of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">Under section 905(b) a vessel owner owes three specific legal duties to independent contractors working on the vessel: (1) the turnover duty, (2) the duty to protect against hazards arising in areas or equipment under the vessel\u2019s active control, and (3) the duty to intervene when the vessel owner knows of a serious hazard and the stevedore improvidently decides to ignore that risk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither the parties nor the record suggest that the third duty is an issue in this case. We proceed, therefore, to a discussion of the first two.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">The Supreme Court has described the contours of the turnover duty as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-17\">A vessel must exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to turn over the ship and its equipment and appliances in such condition that an expert and experienced [independent] contractor, mindful of the dangers he should expect to encounter, arising from the hazards of the ship\u2019s service or otherwise, will be able by the exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>cise of ordinary care to carry on ... operations with reasonable safety to persons and property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The record reveals that Manuel and his supervisor knew that the shorn mooring line was lying on the deck and that they repeatedly worked-around it without incident during the course of their sandblasting operations. Further, the Harrington crew could have remedied the hazard very easily by exercising ordinary care, i.e., by simply moving the rope out of their way. The district court did not err in concluding that the vessel owner was entitled to rely upon Harrington to exercise such care within the confines of its workplace, and that no turnover duty owed by the vessel was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Manuel observes, correctly, that an open and obvious danger is not a complete bar to liability for a breach of the turnover duty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the apparent nature of the hazard is not an automatic bar to Manuel\u2019s recovery, he is nevertheless unable to reconcile the facts of this case with our jurisprudence delineating the legal duties owed, respectively, by the vessel owner and the independent contractor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have long held that when an independent contractor has actual knowledge of a remediable hazardous condition the vessel owner\u2019s turnover duty is not implicated unless the contractor\u2019s \u201conly alternatives would be to leave his job or face trouble for delaying work.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the absence of any such showing Manuel\u2019s contention must be considered an invitation to expand the turnover duty of the vessel owner under section 905(b) well beyond the bounds articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Scindia, </em>an invitation which we must decline.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Manuel, also invokes the second duty owed by the vessel owner, namely that \u201ca shipowner must exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries to [independent contractors] in areas that remain under the active control of the vessel.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This duty recognizes that although a vessel owner no longer retains the primary responsibility for safety in a work area turned- over to an independent contractor, no such cession results as relates to areas or equipment over which the vessel\u2019s crew retains operational control.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The record reflects that the back deck where Manuel\u2019s accident occurred was being used by Harrington employees to house and operate their sandblasting equipment. There is no evidence that the vessel\u2019s crew was active in that area while the Harrington crew was at work. In the absence of any proof that this area was within the active control of the vessel, we must agree with the district court that the vessel owner had no general duty to remedy hazards arising there. The district court did not err in finding and concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>that Cameron breached no duty owed to Manuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"><em>. </em>Defendants Marathon Oil Company and Texas Eastern were both dismissed prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">.
