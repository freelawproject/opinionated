A claim against an estate for the amount paid to the deceased for an assignment of a judgment is barred by section 70 of the Administration act, except as to uninventoried assets, if not presented for allowance within two years' after the granting of the letters testamentary, notwithstanding the assignment was not set aside until after the two years had expired, and notwithstanding there are sufficient inventoried assets in the hands of the executors to -satisfy such claim.

Pearson, deceased, against the appellees, as executors of Duncan S. McBean, deceased, in the superior court of Cook county, on the sixth day of Oc~tober, 1902, to recover the sum of $5000, and interest, which had been paid by Pearson to McBean on the 18th day of May, 1897, in consideration of the assignment by McBean to Pearson of a judgment in favor of Ida E. Schmidt against the city of Chicago, rendered December 11, 1894, which assignment had been set aside by the superior court of Cook county on June 13, 1902, in accordance with the mandate of this court. (Schmidt v. Shaver, 196 Ill. 108.) The superior court rendered judgment in favor of the executors of McBean, which judgment has been affirmed by the Branch Appellate Court for the First District, and a further appeal has been prosecuted to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-9\" pgmap=\"536(21) 537(213)\">It appears that Duncan S. McBean died on June 1, 1898, and letters testamentary were issued on his estate to appellees on June io, 1898; that the'appellees proceeded with the administration of his estate by giving notice to creditors and filing an inventory and appraisement in accordance with the statute; that on the 13th day of May, 1899, Ida E. Schmidt filed a bill in the superior court of Cook county to set aside the assignment of said judgment from McBean to Pearson; that on June 13, 1902, a decree was entered by the superior court of Cook county setting aside said assignment of said judgment, and that at the time this suit was commenced the appellees had a sufficient amount of the estate of McBean in their hands, as his executors, to pay the amount claimed to be due the estate of Pearson by the estate of McBean. It was admitted, upon the hearing, by the appellants, in open court, that there were no assets belonging to the estate of McBean which had not been inventoried or accounted for by his executors during the two years subsequent to the granting of letters testamentary to the appellees, and the appellants having stated in open court that they did not desire a judgment payable out of subsequently inventoried assets, a judgment was rendered in favor of the appellees.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-3\" pgmap=\"537\">Charles R.

Stat.\u20142d ed.\u2014p. 301,) which provides that all seventh-class claims shall be exhibited to the court for allowance within two years from the granting of letters testamentary or of administration, and that all demands not exhibited within that time shall be forever barred except as to the estate of the deceased not inventoried or accounted for, applies to the claim of appellants. We think that question must be answered in the affirmative, and it must be held that the claim of appellants was barred by the two years\u2019 Statute of Limitations at the time this suit was commenced.</p> <p id=\"b539-7\" pgmap=\"539(200) 540(115)\">The appellants seek to avoid the bar of the statute on the ground that their claim was contingent up to the 13th day of June, 1902, that being the date upon which the superior court entered the decree to set aside the assignment from McBean to Pearson. In Stone v. Clarke, 40 Ill. 411, letters of administration were granted on the 18th day of January, 1860, and the administrator was summoned to defend a claim which was based upon an indemnifying bond, on the fourth day of March, 1862. The same contention was made in that case which is made here, but the claim, although conceded to have been contingent, was held to have been barred. The court said (p. 414) : \u201cStone certainly had no claim until he was damnified, and as he was not liable on the notes, and thereby suffered damage, until after the lapse of two years, his claim had not accrued within two years, and no suit could have been, or was, instituted within the two years, consequently Stone\u2019s claim was barred, except as to future discovered property.\u201d The Stone case has been approved in Snydacker v. Swan Land and Cattle Co. 154 Ill. 220, Rassieur v. Jenkins, 170 id. 503, and Morse v. Pacific Railway Co. 191 id. 356, and must be held to be the settled law of this State; and the fact that the entire estate of McBean had not been distributed but a sufficient amount thereof remained in the hands of his executors to satisfy appellants\u2019 claim at the time the suit was commenced does not affect the result, as the assignee in the Rassieur case and the executors in the Morse case, where the doctrine of the Stone case was applied, each had ample funds in their hands with which to have satisfied the claims which were held to be barred.</p> <p id=\"b540-5\" pgmap=\"540\">It is thought that the doctrine of the Stone case has been repudiated in Dugger v. Oglesby, 99 Ill. 405, and Suppiger v. Gruas, 137 id. 216. Those cases were reviewed in the Snydocker case, also in the Rassieur case, and to the extent that they were in conflict with the Stone case they were overruled.</p> <p id=\"b540-6\" pgmap=\"540\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b540-7\" pgmap=\"540\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
