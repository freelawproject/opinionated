Practice \u2014 At Common Laio \u2014 Taking Judgment Against a Part of the Defendants Only. \u2014 At common law, in a suit where it is permitted to take judgment against a part only, of the defendants, the taking of such judgment operates to discontinue the suit as to all other defendants.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b440-11\" pgmap=\"440\">3.

Same \u2014 Illustration of the Rule as to Several Judgments in Mandamus Proceedings. \u2014 A party filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against a number of defendants as directors of a corporation. The defendants served with process demurred to the petition and upon their demurrer being qverruled, all the defendants answered but two of them, who elected to abide by their demurrer, and judgment was rendered against them awarding the writ and for costs.

Bonney, Clark and Paine, after having demurred and their demurrers having been overruled, answered the petition. Mackenzie and Rollins demurred, and upon their demurrer being overruled by the court, they elected to stand by their demurrer. Thereupon the court entered judgment against them, which judgment is in form as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\" pgmap=\"441(90) 442(68)\">\u201c This cause coming duly on to be heard, on the motion of petitioner to dispose of the demurrers of defendants filed herein, and all parties demurring being represented before the court, and after arguments of counsel, and the court being fully advised in the premises, doth overrule each and every of said demurrers, and on motion of petitioner rules the said defendants to plead or answer said petition within fifteen days of this date. Said defendants Mackenzie and Rollins, in open court, refuse to plead or answer same, and except to said ruling of said court, and elect to stand by their said demurrers. Whereupon the court hereby enters judgment on said petition in favor of said petitioner, and against said defendants Mackenzie and Eollins, for his damages and costs of suit, and orders that the said peremptory writ of mandamus, as prayed for in said petition, forthwith issue- against said defendants Eollins and Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\" pgmap=\"442\">Appellants, after their demurrer to the petition had been overruled, filed a plea to the petition, which, in effect, set forth that petitioner ought not to be allowed to further prosecute or maintain his said suit against these defendants because they say that since the beginning of this suit and on, to wit, Saturday, the 17th day of February, 1900, of the J anuary term, petitioner recovered a judgment in this cause against two of the defendants herein, to wit, George S. Mackenzie and Charles E. Eollins, for the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus against said Mackenzie and Eollins, as prayed for in said petition, without any disposal of this cause against these defendants McDonald and Durborow, as appeared by the record herein, wherefore these defendants say that said petitioner ought not to be allowed to further prosecute or maintain his said action against these defendants, etc., and concluding with verification.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\" pgmap=\"442\">Appellee demurred to this plea, and the court sustained the demurrer. Thereupon appellants elected to stand by their plea, and the court rendered judgment against them, awarding the peremptory writ, and for damages and costs.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\" pgmap=\"442\">The judgment against Mackenzie and Eollins was entered on February 17, 1900.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\" pgmap=\"442\">The judgment against appellants was entered on June 23, 1900.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-9\" pgmap=\"442\">Lyman M. Paine, attorney for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-10\" pgmap=\"442\">C. Van Alen Smith, attorney for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b442-11\" pgmap=\"442\">Mr. Justice Sears</author> <p id=\"A9D\" pgmap=\"442\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b442-12\" pgmap=\"442(9) 443(35)\">The only question presented which it is necessary to determine in disposing of this appeal, is as to the sufficiency of appellant\u2019s plea, i. e., as to the effect of the judgment rendered on February 17, 1900, upon the suit as pending against appellants.</p> <p id=\"b443-4\" pgmap=\"443\">Counsel for appellants contend that the effect of this judgment against two of the defendants was to work a discontinuance as to the other defendants. We regard this contention as sound.</p> <p id=\"b443-5\" pgmap=\"443\">The proceeding for a writ of mandamus is a common law action, and except as may be otherwise provided by statute, it is governed by the rules of common law procedure. Bolton v. The People, 95 Ill. App. 285, and cases therein cited.</p> <p id=\"b443-7\" pgmap=\"443\">At common law, in a suit where it is permitted to take judgment against a part only, of the defendants, the taking of such judgment operates to discontinue the suit as to all other defendants. Davis v. Taylor, 41 Ill. 405; Callaghan v. Myers, 89 Ill. 566; Vieths v. Skinner, 47 Ill. App. 325.</p> <p id=\"b443-8\" pgmap=\"443\">Without considering the propriety of the judgment which was rendered against the defendants Mackenzie and Eollins alone, a question which is not presented by this record, it is enough for the decision of this case that the judgment against them, while it stood of record, operated to preclude the appellee from a further maintenance of this suit against the other defendants. Two several judgments in the one action could not be had at the common law, and we find no provision of our statute regulating proceedings for mandamus which in any manner modifies this rule. On the contrary the statute in terms provides that the procedure after pleading shall be as in other cases at common law. Sec. 4, Chap. 87, R. S.</p> <p id=\"b443-12\" pgmap=\"443(71) 444(12)\">It is urged by counsel for appellee that the judgment of February 17, 1900, against Mackenzie and Eollins, is not a final judgment, but interlocutory only. To this we can not assent. The judgment is that the peremptory writ of mandamus issue against the defendants named, which is precisely the judgment in this proceeding, to which a petitioner is entitled when he prevails in his suit. The record discloses that the writ did afterward issue in conformity with the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444\">It is difficult to perceive in what respect this judgment lacks the essentials of a final judgment.</p> <p id=\"b444-6\" pgmap=\"444\">We are of opinion that it was error to enter the judgment against appellants. Therefore the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
