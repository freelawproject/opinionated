that the premium charged the complainant is based upon the assumptions of the actuaries\u2019 table of mortality, and four per cent interest, and is a level premium, by which practice the defendant charges the complainant, in advance, a certain definite sum, called \u201c Eeserve,\u201d which is set aside annually as afund to meet future costs of insurance at a time of life when the net level premium charged might not be sufficient to pay complainant\u2019s contribution to annual death losses, and which fund, compounded at four per cent, subserves the purpose of annually reducing the defendant\u2019s risk upon complainant\u2019s life, and to the extent of which the insured is actually made the insurer; that to this net level or mathematical premium the defendant has added an arbitrary amount, called \u201cloading,\u201d on the assumption that it may be needed to meet expenses and contingencies not provided for by the mortality table; that the defendant\u2019s surplus arises annually from payments made by the complainant and defendant\u2019s other insured, for assumed costs of insurance on the amount at risk, and for expenses and contingencies, and from interest earnings of their contributions to \u201c Eeserve,\u201d above the assumed rate of four per cent, whenever and as often as a less number has died during the year than was assumed by the table would die, and whenever and as often as the assumed expenses have exceeded the actual expenses during the year, and because the contingencies which defendant assumed would occur, have not occurred, and whenever and as often as the actual interest earned by defendant exceeds the rate assumed by the defendant.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\" pgmap=\"576(9) 577(302)\">The bill then alleges, upon information and belief, that from, the 4th day of April, 1895, up to and inclusive of the 3d day of April, 1900, the defendant has annually made large savings from the sum charged the complainant and its other insured for costs of insurance and expenses and contingencies; and has annually earned, as interest, large sums in excess of four per cent, all of which savings and earnings are now in its hands and possession, and that the defendant\u2019s ascertained surplus on the first day of January, 1895, was $20,249,308, and on January 3, 1900, $41,435,484. a clear gain in five years of \u00a721,186,170; that when defendant issued the said policies to the complainant, the defendant knew from its past experience that the premiums charged the complainant were excessive, etc.; that complainant\u2019s proportion of defendant\u2019s savings and earnings amounted to, to wit, the sum of $1,000 April 4, 1900; that knowledge of the facts hereinbefore stated has but recently, to wit, July 2, 1900, come to complainant, and complainant charges that said policies are cunningly devised gaining contracts, etc.; that in certain books published by defendant, it has estimated that, according to its past experience, the surplus fund belonging to complainant\u2019s policies, or to similar policies, would amount to, to wit, \u00a76,318, at the end of the accumulation period; that should complainant die during the present year, defendant would take from complainant\u2019s surplus account, and transfer to others insured, the said sum of, to wit, \u00a71,000, now in its hands, etc.; that July 10,1900, complainant demanded of defendant his equitable proportion of the- surplus funds of defendant for the first five years of the policies, which demand defendant refused; that the \u201c reserve \u201d contributed by complainant on said policies amounted to, to wit, $2,554.56; that defendant is a mutual company, etc.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\" pgmap=\"577(63) 578(13)\">The prayer is that the policies may be set aside and vacated and the notes and all other writings in possession of the defendant be canceled and surrendered to complainant, and that defendant be ordered to pay to complainant all moneys paid by him on said policies and notes, or, if the court shall find the policies valid, that defendant be decreed to apportion and pay to complainant his equitable share of the surplus fund.</p><attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-5\" pgmap=\"578\">Nicholas Michels, attorney for appellant;

That a foreign insurance corporation, doing business in this State, is subject to the laws of the State in relation to insurance companies, equally with domestic insurance companies.</p> <p id=\"b578-10\" pgmap=\"578\">2. That section 14 of \u201cAn act to organize and regulate the business of life insurance.\u201d Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1899, p. 1014, is so far mandatory that a mutual insurance company must make distribution of its surplus at least every five years.</p> <p id=\"b578-11\" pgmap=\"578\">3. That the policies in question, in providing that no dividend shall be apportioned or paid on them before the end of the accumulation period, viz., April 4, 1915, are in contravention of section 14, above referred to.</p> <p id=\"b578-12\" pgmap=\"578\">4. That the policies in question are gaming contracts and in violation of section 131 of chapter 38 of the statutes. Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1899, p. 590.</p> <p id=\"b578-13\" pgmap=\"578\">The first proposition is unquestionably sound. Section 14 is as follows:</p> <p id=\"ALp\" pgmap=\"578\">\u201cLife insurance companies doing business in this State, which do business on the principle of mutual insurance, or the members of which are entitled to share in the surplus funds thereof, may make distribution of such surplus as they have accumulated, annually, or once in two, three, four or five years, as the directors thereof may from time to time determine. In determining the amount of the surplus to be distributed, there shall be reserved an amount not less than the aggregate net value of all outstanding policies, said value being computed by the combined experience or actuary rate of mortality, with interest not exceeding four per cent.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b578-15\" pgmap=\"578(12) 579(56)\">It is contended' that the word \u201c may \u201d in the section should be read \u201c must,\u201d so that the section will read, \u201cmust make distribution of sucli surplus as they have accumulated, annually,\u201d etc. In support of this contention Kane v. Footh, 70 Ill. 587; Fowler v. Pirkins, 77 Ib. 271; James v. Dexter, 112 Ib. 489, and Brokaw v. Commissioners, etc., 130 Ib. 490, are cited.</p> <p id=\"b579-4\" pgmap=\"579\">Kone of these cases are in point. In Kane v. Footh it was contended that the word \u201c may \u201d in a statute providing \u201cAnd the court may, at the request of either party, require the jury to render a special verdict,\u201d etc., should be read shall, but the court held not. In Fowler v. Pirkins, supra, it was contended that in an act providing \u201cAppeals and writs of error may be taken, etc., the word \u201cmay\u201d should be read shall, but the court held not, saying: \u201c The words may or shall, when used in a statute, may be read interchangeably as will hest express the legislative intention.\u201d In Brokaw v. Commissioners, etc., supra, the language of the statute was : \u201c That the commissioners, after having given reasonable notice, etc., may remove any such fence or other obstruction.\u201d The court held that the word \u201c may \u201d should be read \u201c shall,\u201d and said:</p> <p id=\"b579-7\" pgmap=\"579\">\u201c The word \u2018 may\u2019 in a statute will be construed to mean 6 shall \u2019 whenever the rights of the public or of third persons depend upon the exercise of the power, or the performance of the duty to which it refers, and such is its meaning in all cases where the public interests and rights are concerned, or a public duty is imposed upon public officers, and the public or third persons have a claim de jure that the power shall be exercised.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b579-8\" pgmap=\"579\">It is clear that the court in using the words \u201c whenever the rights of the public or of third persons depend upon the exercise of the power, or the performance of the duty,\u201d referred to the power- of the commissioners, who were public officers, and to their duty in the premises. Appellant\u2019s counsel rely mainly on certain language of the court in Kane v. Footh, supra. In that case the court cites Schuyler v. Mercer County, 4 Gilm. 20, where the court say:</p> <p id=\"b579-9\" pgmap=\"579(34) 580(22)\">\u201c The word \u00a3 may,\u2019 when used in statutes should be construed as permissive or imperative, according to the intention of the legislature in each case where it is so used. In its grammatical sense it is permissive, and there is nothing to show that in this case it was intended to be imperative.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b580-5\" pgmap=\"580\">The vital question is, what was the intention of the legislature? Was it, or not, the intention to use the word \u201c may\u201d imperatively, and as if the word shall had been used?</p> <p id=\"b580-6\" pgmap=\"580\">Mutual insurance companies do not derive their power to distribute their surpltis funds from the statute. Section 14 is not a grant of power, but is perhaps a limitation on the power to distribute surplus oftener than once a year. In the absence of such a,, provision as to the distribution of the surplus, the time of distribution would depend on the directors, except so far as limited by the charter of the company or a valid by-law. Considering the entire section it seems to be for the protection of policy holders. A mutual insurance company is permitted to make distribution not oftener than annually. If the surplus will not warrant annual distribution, then distribution may be made in two, three, four or five years. But it is expressly provided that \u201c in determining the amount of the surplus to be distributed, there shall be reserved an amount not less than the aggregate net value of all outstanding policies.\u201d The words \u201c may \u201d and \u201c shall \u201d are both used in the section, the former in the first sentence of the section as to distribution annually, or in two, three, four or five years, as the directors may from time to time determine; the latter in the next and last sentence of the section, requiring an amount to be reserved when distribution is made. The intention of the legislature is to be ascertained from the language used, when such language is plain and unambiguous; and the words of the statute are to be understood in their commonly accepted meaning. City of Beardstown v. City of Virginia, 76 Ill. 34; C., M. &amp; St. P. R. R. Co. T. Dumser, 109 Ib. 402, 410; City of Chicago v. McCoy, 136 Ib. 344, 352; Richmond v. Moore, 107 Ib. 429, 436.</p> <p id=\"b580-7\" pgmap=\"580\">In the first case cited, supra, the court say :</p> <p id=\"b580-8\" pgmap=\"580(37) 581(157)\">\u201c Statutes and contracts should be read and understood according to the natural and most obvious import of the language, without resorting to subtle and forced construction for the purpose of either limiting or extending their operation. McCluskey v. Cromwell, 11 N. Y. 601. The rule is well expressed by Johnson, J\u201e in Newell v. The People, 3 Seld. 97, in these words: \u2018Whether we are considering an agreement between parties, a statute or a constitution, with'a view to its interpretation, the thing we are to seek is, the thought which it expresses. To ascertain this, the first resort in all cases is to the natural signification of the words employed, in the order and grammatical arrangement in which the framers of the instrument have placed them. If, thus regarded, the words embody a definite meaning, which involves no absurdity, and no contradiction between different parts of the same writing, then that meaning, apparent upon the face of the instrument, is the one which alone we are at liberty to say was intended to be conveyed. In such a case there is no room for construction.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p id=\"b581-4\" pgmap=\"581\">Applyingthese rules to the words \u201c may\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d in section 14, the former must be regarded as permissive and the latter as imperative. We can conceive of no good reason, nor are we aware of any rule of interpretation, which would warrant the holding that the words \u201c may \u201d and \u201c shall\u201d are used in the same sense in the section, and that imperative. Therefore we can not sustain the contention that the section requires distribution of surplus at least once in every five years, or that the contracts between the company and appellant, assuming that such contracts contain the charter provision in regard to distribution of surplus, are in violation of section 14.</p> <p id=\"b581-5\" pgmap=\"581\">Counsel for appellant contend that the contracts between apnellant and the company are in violation of section 27 of chapter 73 of Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1899, p. 978, which is as follows :</p> <p id=\"b581-6\" pgmap=\"581(103) 582(102)\">\u201c That no life insurance company or association organized under the laws of this State, or doing business within the limits of the same, shall make or permit any distinction or discrimination between insurants of the same class and equal expectation of life in its established rates; nor in the charging, collecting, demanding or receiving of the amount of premium for insurants of the same class and equal expectation of life; nor in the return ratably of premium, dividends or other benefits accruing or that may accrue to such insurants as aforesaid; nor in the terms and conditions of the contract between such company and the insurants; and such contract of insurance shall be fully and wholly expressed and contained in the policy issued and the application therefor; nor shall any such company or its agents pay, or allow, or offer to pay or allow to any person insured any special rebate or premium, or any special favor or advantage in the dividends or other benefits to accrue on such policy, or promise the same to any person as inducement to insure, or promise to give any advantage or valuable consideration whatever, not expressed or specified in the policy of such company.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b582-5\" pgmap=\"582\">The argument, as we understand it, is that a discrimination as to the distribution of the surplus is made in favor of those who survive April 4,1915, the accumulation period, and against those who may die before that time; that the former are to be regarded as one class and the latter another.</p> <p id=\"b582-6\" pgmap=\"582\">Assuming, for the sake of the argument, that all the policies issued by appellee, including those issued to appellant, contain the charter provisions as to the accumulation period and the distribution of surplus, we can not perceive that any discrimination is made in violation of the section last quoted. Each member or policy holder of the mutual company contracts with the company, which is practically contracting with all the other policy holders, that in the event of his death, whenever that may occur, a sum certain will be paid on his policy by the company, and that if he shall survive April 4,1915, he will receive an equitable proportion of the surplus. There is no discrimination against any member. Each member, in so far as surplus is concerned, makes the same contract. It is the same in principle as if \u2022 each member contracted for a sum certain in the event of his death, plus a certain percentage of such sum, in case he should survive April 4, 1915.</p> <p id=\"b582-7\" pgmap=\"582(64) 583(39)\">Lastly, it is contended that the effect of the provision as to the accumulation period, April 4,1915, and the provision that no dividend shall be apportioned or paid before the end of that period, is that each policy holder bets with all the others that he will survive April 4, 1915, and therefore the provisions are in violation of section 181 of chapter 38, Hurd\u2019s Rev. Stat. 1899, in respect to gaming contracts. We can not concur in the view that the contracts are wagers or bets within the meaning of section 131. Section 131 of the same chapter is as follows :</p> <p id=\"b583-4\" pgmap=\"583\">\u201c Nothing contained in sections 131 and 132 above, shall be (so) construed as to prohibit or in any way affect any insurance made in good faith for the security or indemnity of the party insured, and which is not otherwise prohibited by law, nor to any contract of bottomry or respondantia.\"</p> <p id=\"b583-5\" pgmap=\"583\">The averments of the bill do not sustain the view that appellant\u2019s contracts of insurance were not made in good faith for his security or indemnity; and, as we have already held, they were not prohibited by law. The decree will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
