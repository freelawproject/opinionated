Party of the second part agrees to make sales only to parties of well-known responsibility and good reputation for payment of their debts, and to require that at least one of the makers of each note shall certify, in property statement on said note, to his owning an improved farm, not subject to incumbrance, liens and exemptions exceeding in amount one-third of the actual value of such farm, and worth at least $1,500 over and above all incumbrances, liens and exemptions.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">Tenth. Party of the second part agrees to guarantee the payment of all notes andr enewals of notes taken under this agreement (not having property statement properly filled out as required in clause nine of this agreement), and further agrees to indorse all such notes and renewals of notes in the following form, to wit:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">\u2018For'value received, I (or we) hereby guarantee the payment of the within note.

The notes were signed by F. E. Huerlott and Sam Huerlott. On the back of each note (the blanks of which had been furnished by appellee) there were printed blanks as follows:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\" pgmap=\"197\">\u201c For value received,-hereby guarantee the payment of the within note.

We do not understand counsel for appellee as contending that if appellee had guaranteed the payment of the notes, on the notes themselves, he would not be liable to pay them, nor could he well maintain such a contention, in view of the well settled rule of law of this State on the subject of absolute guaranties of payment of commercial paper. But it is said by counsel for appellee that \u201c agreeing to do an act, and actually doing the act, are distinctly separate matters.\u201d This is true, as is demonstrated by the case under consideration. An agreement to do a thing is an obligation to do it, generally expressed in words, while the doing of it is the ultimate thing sought by the agreement and fulfills the obligation.</p> <p id=\"b198-11\" pgmap=\"198(21) 199(112)\">It is also said by counsel: \u201c The liability of a guarantor is ascertained by strict construction of his undertaking, beyond which he is in no way bound.\u201d This statement is quite correct; but another rule of law must not be lost sight of in construing agreements, even when claimed to be undertakings to answer for defaults of others, and that is, that parties have a right to make agreements in such language as they may choose to use, and it is the duty of courts construing an agreement, to give force and effect, if possible, to every word used in it. Beech on Modern Law of Contracts, Vol. 1, Sec. 711; Bowman v. Long, 89 Ill. 19; C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Bartlett, 120 Ill. 603.</p> <p id=\"b199-4\" pgmap=\"199(291) 200(225)\">Appellee knew when he entered into the agreement to sell appellant\u2019s machines, that appellant\u2019s location and place of business was nearly, or quite, a thousand miles distant from the place where the machines were to be sold, and that its general agents could not be expected to have knowledge of the financial conditions of those who would become purchasers of machines; that it was important for appellant to know from the purchasers themselves that they were able to pay for the machines; hence, the plan adopted to get the information, was to require the agent selling the machines on a commission, to require of the purchasers of machines on credit, to furnish information as to their property qualifications, that appellant might know that its machines were being sold to persons to whom it was safe to extend credit. The requirement was reasonable and appellee agreed to comply with it, and if he did not, to assume the burden of the debt himself. It is not pretended that appellee complied with his agreement, or made any effort to do so so, but chose to take the consequences of non-compliance; and these consequences, according to the plain terms of the agree-' ment, were, that he would pay the notes himself if the makers did not pay them when due, and he took upon himself the responsibility of ascertaining that the makers had not paid them. To say, as appellee\u2019s counsel seems to contend, that by appellee\u2019s failure to guarantee the payment of the notes on the back of them, that he was not bound to pay them, because he had not put his guaranty upon them, is in effect saying that he had reserved the power, or at least the privilege, of nullifying his own agreement by doing nothing at all. A construction of the agreement that leads to such a result can not be tolerated. Besides, appellee said in his agreement, \u201c but failure by said second party to indorse said notes shall not affect the above guaranty of payment.\u201d When once appellee became bound to pay the notes, by his agreement and his failure to secure the property certificates, appellant might safely rely on appellee\u2019s guaranty to pay them, and appellant was not guilty of any laches in failing to proceed against the makers of the notes in an endeavor to collect of them. The authorities in support of this proposition are believed to be uniform, and it would seem a vain display of learning to cite them. When the makers failed to pay the notes as they matured, appellee should have paid them, and looked to the makers to reim- - burse him, at a time when he claims the money could have been realized; and because he did not do so and the makers have since become insolvent, or left the country, as is said by appellee to be the case, appellee is the party guilty of laches, and must suffer the consequences, unless appellant has done some affirmative act that discharges him from performing his contract.</p> <p id=\"b200-4\" pgmap=\"200\">There is some evidence that appellant extended the time of payment of one of the notes, but there is no evidence of any consideration for the agreement to extend it, if any there was.</p> <p id=\"b200-5\" pgmap=\"200\">Whether, if there was a valid extension of the note, it could be said that it was a \u201c renewal \u201d of it, so as to bring it within the tenth clause of the agreement, we express no opinion, as the point has not been raised by counsel.</p> <p id=\"b200-6\" pgmap=\"200\">It follows from what has been said that the court erred in instructing the jury to find for the defendant, and for this error the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
