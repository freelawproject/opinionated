Master and Servant \u2014 Reciprocal Duties. \u2014 A servant is bound to exercise ordinary care for his own safety and must notice dangers which are apparent, but he need not hunt for hidden perils. The master is bound to exercise reasonable care to provide reasonably safe appliances for the use of the servant and a reasonably safe place for the doing of his work.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b650-5\" pgmap=\"650\">3. Same \u2014 Rights of the Servant in Obeying the Commands of the Master \u2014 Reciprocal Duties. \u2014 When a servant is commanded by one having the right to give him orders, to do an act obviously attended with danger, he has a right to assume that his master has exercised reasonable care to make the act reasonably safe, and that it is not attended with hidden perils of which the master had notice.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b650-6\" pgmap=\"650\">3. Same \u2014 Duty of the Master to Watch for that Which is Not Necessarily Obvious and of the Servant Not to Overlook the Apparent. \u2014 The master should, to a reasonable extent, watch for and find that which is not necessarily obvious, while the servant can not overlook that which is apparent, and if ordered to do a particular thing the servant has a right to assume that he will not be unnecessarily exposed to perils, and may rely upon the implied assurance that there was no unnecessary danger.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b650-7\" pgmap=\"650\">4. Same \u2014 Duty of the Master to Use Reasonable Diligence in Making the Place Where His Servant Works Reasonably Safe \u2014 Illustration.\u2014 Where a wrecking crew in the employ of a railroad company and in charge of a foreman, was engaged in placing a derailed locomotive upon the track, one of them called the attention of the foreman to the improper position of a timber used to support the locomotive, but he paid no attention to it, and ordered the man to return to his work, which he did and in consequence was injured, a verdict for the company was reversed.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-8\" pgmap=\"650\">Trespass on the Case, for personal injuries.

On that morning he was called, with other members of the wrecking crew, to help replace an engine of appellee which was off the track. To do this a heavy timber about ten by ten was placed upon a cross-beam of the engine in front of the boiler. The timber and beam were fastened together by a chain, and jacks were placed under the end of the timber which was allowed to project some three or four feet beyond the side of the engine, and in this way the engine was gradually raised up. As soon as the engine was raised far enough- to permit it, planks were placed under the wheels.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-4\" pgmap=\"651\">Appellant, as directed, was engaged in placing a plank under the wheels when the timber split at the end where the jacks were placed, and the engine fell back into its old position, appellant being .struck on the back and head, sustaining injuries for which the suit was brought. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case the court instructed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. Upon the trial appellant testified as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-5\" pgmap=\"651\">\u201c I was working as a car repairer that day. I commenced work that day at seven o\u2019clock at the round-house of the company at Archer avenue and Sixteenth street. At one o\u2019clock we got an order to go to the wreck, given us by a man named Nelson. We went over to the engine which was off the track. It wTas about a block away from where we had been employed. Nelson was the boss or superintendent over the work. When we got to the place where the engine had fallen, he said, \u2018 Now everybody has got to do his own work here..\u2019 We then took this timber and laid it down, and one end we tied with a chain, and after that four jacks were put underneath and one side was raised up. The timber was put across the locomotive under the boiler.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-6\" pgmap=\"651(93) 652(62)\">When we placed this timber upon this engine, on this insul, we left a piece of this timber out far enough so we could put the four jacks under, then we took a chain and fastened this timber, and then we raised it up so the whole-side hung on this timber. He told me that I should block the wheels. I took one plank and put it under one of the wheels, but when I took the second one it had already-slipped. Before the engine fell I spoke to the foreman1 about the wav the work was being done. I told him it was \u2018 humbug; \u2019 that it would slip. He then said to me, 1 Go ahead and do your work.\u2019 Nelson was the boss who Avas directing the Avork all the time up to the time of the accident. The foreman told every one what was to be done.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. Now, what, if anything, Avas said after this timber Avas put under the projection and the jack screws were put under the timber, about the method of the Avork being dangerous? Give the whole conversation that you heard. A. The foreman said, \u2018 Well you raise this up, so after you get it raised up Ave can pull it out.\u2019</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-6\" pgmap=\"652\">\" Q. Did any one say anything to him about danger, if so, Avhat Avas it ? A. I told him myself, the boss, because he put me in the worst place.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-7\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. What did you say to the boss about danger? A. I told him that Avould slip; that Avon\u2019t go.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-8\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. What Avas said to the foreman there by you, or by any one else, that the tvork Avas dangerous the Avay the foreman ordered it ? A. After the engine had hung, the foreman said, \u2018 Now you go, to Avork.\u2019</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-9\" pgmap=\"652\">Q, What do you mean by the engine being hung? A. I mean the side that was down Ave raised it up, and the Avhole \u2022side hung on this timber.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-10\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. Did any one say anything to the foreman about the \u25a0Avork being dangerous ? A. I told him myself.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-11\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. What did the foreman say ? A. He- said I should \u2022go to Avork.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-12\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. What took place ? A. When I went to Avork I took one plank and laid that down, and then I took the \u00a1second one; Avhen I turned around the engine fell. I Avas \u00a1not touching the engine at the time it fell, I Avas getting a \u00a1plank that my partner fetched me. I Avas not touching the jack screAvs. The front of the engine was tOAvard the \u2022east and the north side fell.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-13\" pgmap=\"652\">Q. How did the engine come to fall ? A. Because the timber was not exactly lying upon this insul. It didn\u2019t project very much.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-14\" pgmap=\"652\">I mean that the beam or squared timber didn\u2019t lie squarely on this insul.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-15\" pgmap=\"652(79) 653(45)\">When the engine fell, some of the jacks fell on one side and some to the other. The timber split. This timber Ave got from the Avrecking car. When the timber is placed on the engine it projects three feet outside of the engine so Ave can put the jacks under; the timber is square, ten by ten, and it projects half Avay across the engine boiler \u2014 locomotive boiler. The timber split at that part Avhich rested oni(the insul or projection of the boiler. It is a part which is screwed to the boiler on the engine and projects a little in front of it. The timber was held in place by a chain; it tied or fastened the insul to the timber.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-4\" pgmap=\"653\">The timber that I spoke of is marked in red on the picture. It split because it only laid half-way on the insul and it didn\u2019t have strength.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-5\" pgmap=\"653\">Q. When you told the foreman that the way of' doing things there was all \u2018 humbug,\u2019 what did you mean ? A. Well, I saw that the timber was resting on the insul, only half of it was, and I saw there would be some E humbug.\u2019</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-6\" pgmap=\"653\">Mr. Dawes: I will assume, if you want to, that E humbug \u2019 means some danger.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-8\" pgmap=\"653\">Mr. Maher: Very well.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-9\" pgmap=\"653\">Mr. Maher; Did you say anything else to the foreman %</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-10\" pgmap=\"653\">A. Well, I didn\u2019t\"say anything else except that I said, that will not be' well, and we will have some 1 humbug \u2019 here, and he said, E Oh, well, just go to work.\u2019 When the locomotive fell I got a blow on my back and on the left side of my head and back of my head. I was unconscious for over an hour. I was taken home to Seventeenth street and stayed there over a year.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-11\" pgmap=\"653\">Q. When you told the foreman at the time of the accident that the timber was not .squarely on the insul, that there would be \u2018 humbug,\u2019 did you mean that an accident would happen and somebody would get hurt ? that is what you said, wasn\u2019t it, and what you meant ?</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-12\" pgmap=\"653\">A. Yes, that is what I said to the foreman; I say\u2014</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-13\" pgmap=\"653\">Q. What else were you going to say % I say this, that somebody would get hurt.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-14\" pgmap=\"653\">Q. You could see that the timber might slip off the insul ? A. Yes.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-15\" pgmap=\"653\">I was a member of the wrecking crew and I used to jack up engines and cars when they would be wrecked.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-16\" pgmap=\"653\">The court instructed the jury to find for the defendant.</p><attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-17\" pgmap=\"653\">Edward Maher, attorney for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-18\" pgmap=\"653\">Chester M.

So far as noticing danger is concerned, it is the duty of the master to with reasonable diligence look for it \u2014 that of the servant to see that which is obvious.</p> <p id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654\">The master should, to a reasonable extent, watch for and find that not necessarily obvious, while the servant can not overlook the apparent.</p> <p id=\"b654-6\" pgmap=\"654\">If ordered to do a particular thing the servant has a right to assume that he will not be unnecessarily exposed to perils, and he may rely upon the implied assurance that there is no unnecessary danger.
