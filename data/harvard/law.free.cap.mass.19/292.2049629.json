Bl. 273, note ; <em>Duke of St. Albans </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>1 H. Bl. 278 ; <em>Pordage </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>1 Wms\u2019s Saund. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>320, <em>note </em>4, rules 1 and 3 ; <em>Campbell v. </em>Jones, 6 T. R. 572 ; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Young, </em>11 Mass. R. 304. The defendant was to convey to the plaintiff by the 1st of April. This did not depend on any act to be done by the plaintiff. He was not to convey until the defendant made his selection of land. The defendant never has selected ; the plaintiff was entitled to notice if any selection had been made, but no such notice has been given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyA\">The 9th plea asserts a fact which is entirely out of the case. The plaintiff was to receive land as agent, but the covenants are with him personally. He could not sue in the name of Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. It is immaterial whether he was their agent or not. The 10th and 11th pleas are immaterial, unless it were shown that Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. were guardians of the plaintiff. In the 12th it is said that Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. had no lands in Ridge-ville. We answer that the plaintiff did not covenant that they had any. As to the 13th, the contract was that the 450 acres, and not the whole tract from which they were to be selected, should be of as good quality as Wormer\u2019s land. With respect to the 14th, we say that the defendant\u2019s perfoimance of the contract did not depend on a selection\u2019s being made by Crocker, Foot and Ingersoll of Dover. If it did, he should have given notice that they had neglected to make a selection.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>Mills </em>and <em>Porter, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARP\">The plaintiff\u2019s dec laration is bad, because neither count contains an averment that he had paid the 200 dollars by the 1st of July, according to the indenture, or that he had conveyed the land in pursuance of his covenants, before he commenced this action, nor is any excuse alleged for the non-performance of his covenants. There could be no doubt but that the covenants in the indenture were mutual and dependent, were it not for the clause, \u201c the possession to be given of the said Ingersoll\u2019s land by the 1st of April next.\u201d The natural import of these words is, that the plaintiff should have <em>possession, </em>that is, the use and occupation, of the defendant\u2019s lands by the 1st of April, not that he should have a conveyance of them. But if this were not the natural import of the words, then wo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>should say that they ought to be construed in connection with other parts of the indenture. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>8 Mass. R. 213, 214 ; 1 Phillipps on Evid. 416. It is apparent from the indenture, that the only object of the parties was to exchange land in Massachusetts and New York for land in Ohio ; and this, without either party\u2019s relying on the personal responsibility of the other. They would naturally provide, according to our construction of these covenants, that the defendant should have time to go to Ohio to examine the land, and to return, and upon receiving a deed from the plaintiff, to execute to him a conveyance of the lands aere and in New York. On the other hand, it would be very improbable, that the defendant should covenant to con vey to the plaintiff by the 1st of April for no other consideration than the covenants of the plaintiff contained in this indenture. Had such been the intention of the parties, the defendant would rather have made the conveyance at the time when the indenture was executed. The plaintiff covenants to convey to the defendant the land in Ohio and to pay him 200 dollars by the 1st of July ; the indenture then proceeds, \u201c and the said Couch as agent for Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. is to receive <em>therefor </em>\u201d the defendant\u2019s lands. The plaintiff is to have a conveyance of the defendant\u2019s lands, not for the plaintiff\u2019s covenants, but for the 450 acres and the 200 dollars ; which shows that the plaintiff\u2019s covenants are to be performed before he can call on the defendant to fulfil his covenants. The covenants of these parties would be held to be dependent, even according to the ancient narrow rules of construction. 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 320 <em>a, </em>note 4. But the last provision in the indenture, that \u201c if the said lands should not prove to be as good as the average of lands in that vicinity of towns, then this contract to be void,\u201d shows that the defendant was to have time to go to Ohio and satisfy himself as to the quality of the lands, before he parted with his property. He could not do this between the date of the indenture and the 1st of April. It was not therefore the intention of the parties that the defendant should execute a conveyance by the 1st of April; for how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>could the contract oe conditional, be voidable, after the defendant had completely and absolutely executed his part of it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_y\">The consideration of the defendant\u2019s contract was executory. In such case the plaintiff must aver- performance of his part of the contract. 1 Chit. Pl. 309 ; Metcalf\u2019s Yelv. 76 b, note 1 ; 1 Tidd\u2019s Pr. 379 ; 1 Wms\u2019s Saund, 320, note 4. The time for the performance of the defendant\u2019s part of the contract was subsequent to the day w.ien the 200 dol\u00ab lars, part of the consideration, were to be paid. The payment should have been made by the plaintiff and averred in the declaration. 1 Chit. Pl. 313, 314; 1 Wms. Saund. 320 c, rule 2 ; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>9 Mass. R. 78 <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>Thorpe, </em>1 Salk. 171 ; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Young, </em>11 Mass R. 305. The covenants on both sides, except for the payment of the money, which was to be performed presently, were to be executed at the same time. In such case an averment of performance, or at least of an offer or readiness to perform, is necessary. 1 Chit. Pl. 309, 310, 315 ; 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 320 <em>e, </em>rule 5 ; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>7 T. R. 125, cited in 2 Wms\u2019s Saund. 352 <em>a; Goodisson </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>4 T. R. 761 ; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Corson, </em>15 Mass. R. 500 ; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>2 Johns. R. 207 ; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>12 Johns. R. 212 <em>; Hudson </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>20 Johns. R. 24. The covenants here con-stitute the whole consideration on both sides ; they are consequently mutual conditions, the one precedent to the other, and the plaintiff must aver performance on his part. 1 Chit. Pl. 314 ; 1 Wms\u2019s' Saund. 320 <em>e, </em>rule <em>4 </em>; <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Eyre, </em>1 H. Bl. 273. The covenants are mutual, the one the consideration of the other, and in such case performance must be averred. 1 Chit. Pl. 315 ; <em>Callonel </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>1 Salk. 113 ; <em>Campbell v. Jones, </em>6 T. R. 570. A party who seeks satisfaction for the non-performance of a contract must aver that he has performed, or offered to perform, the agreement on his own part. <em>Glazebrook </em>v. <em>Woodrow, </em>6 T. R. 366, cited in 2 Wms\u2019s Saund. 252 c ; <em>Kingston </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>cited in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Barkley, </em>2 Doug. 689 ; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>2 H. Bl. 123 ; Sugd. Law of Vendors, 162. . The principle of the cases seems to be, that where the plaintiff is to do an act to entitle himself to an action, he must show the act done, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>or that he has done every thing that was in his power to do. 2 Wms\u2019s Saund. 352, note 3 ; <em>Duke of St. Albans </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>1 H. Bl. 278. In <em>West </em>v. Emmons, 5 Johns. R. 181, <em>Van Ness </em>J. says, \u201c In all cases where both parties have the power to perform without any act being previously necessary to be done by the other, it is necessary that the party bringing the action should aver a performance, or a tender and refusal, which is equivalent to a performance.\u201d In the present case both parties had such a power to perform. On the defendant\u2019s refusal to select the land, it was incumbent on the plaintiff, if he would compel a performance on the part of the defendant, to cause a selection to be made by the individuals named, to tender a conveyance of the land thus selected, and the 200 dollars. The nature and necessity of averments in such cases was much considered in <em>Rawson </em>v. Johnson, 1 East, 203; <em>Waterhouse </em>v. Skinner, 2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s declaration is bad likewise, because it does not aver a tender to the defendant of a deed of conveyance of his lands to be by him executed. Sugd. Vend. 163 ; <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>1 Forrest\u2019s Rep. Exch. 61 ; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Bethel, </em>1 Lev. 44 ; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>20 Johns. R. 24.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">The first count is bad, because it does not aver that the land in Ridgeville is as good as the average of lands in that vicinity; and because it does not aver that Wormer, Buel and Chanter made their selection of lands by the 1st of July. 1 Chit. Pl. 309.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">In making the contract contained in the indenture, the plaintiff acted as agent to Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. <em>Dawes </em>v. <em>Jackson. </em>9 Mass. R. 490. The action therefore cannot oe maintained, because it is not brought in the name of the principals ; <em>Gunn </em>v. <em>Cantine, </em>10 Johns. R. 387 ; <em>Pigott </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 147 ; <em>Frontin </em>v. <em>Small, </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1418 ; <em>Bogart </em>v. <em>De Bussy, </em>6 Johns. R. 94; and because the indenture is a nullity, being executed by the plaintiff in his own name, when he acted only as an agent. <em>Combe\u2019s case, </em>9 Co. 77 ; Com. Dig. <em>Attorney, C </em>14 ; <em>Frontin </em>v. <em>Small, </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1418 ; <em>Fowler v. Shearer, </em>7 Mass. R. 19 ; <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>16 Mass. R. 43. The indenture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>is void because the plaintiff, as is confessed by the pleadings, had no authority from Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. to enter into the covenants contained in it. But if he had authority, he did not in form and substance pursue that authority. Com. Dig. <em>Attorney, C </em>13 ; <em>Banorgee </em>v. Hovey, 5 Mass. R 36, 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-8\">If the clauses respecting the agency of the plaintiff and the possession of the defendant\u2019s land are not susceptible of the construction we would give to them, then the indenture is void for uncertainty. At least there is a latent ambiguity, which may be explained by parol evidence. <em>Richards </em>v. Killam, 10 Mass. R. 245 ; Phillipps on Evid. 410 ; <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 Mass. R. 440 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>10 Johns. R. 133 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>12 Johns. R. 77 ; <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Alexandria </em>v. <em>The Bank of Columbia, </em>5 Wheat 326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-9\">If the plaintiff has any right to a conveyance from the de fendant, it is in his capacity of agent ; but by his demurrer to the 9th plea he acknowledges that he was not the agent of Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. The covenants of the defendant then are like a covenant to convey to a fictitious person, and have no binding force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-10\">By the demurrer to the 13th plea the plaintiff has ac knowledged, that the land from which the defendant might make his selection was not as good as Wormer\u2019s land. This misrepresentation vitiates the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-11\"><em>Dwight, </em>in reply. The period between the 11th of March and the 1st of April was given, in order that the defendant might ascertain the quality of the plaintiff\u2019s land in Ohio. This he might do by inquiring of persons acquainted with the land. It was not necessary for him to go there himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-12\">To <em>have possession </em>was used as equivalent to a covenant to convey. It was intended that the plaintiff should have an equivalent for his covenants. The plaintiff would have no power to recover back the 200 dollars after he had paid it, if after six months the defendant could defeat the contract. There is nothing in the instrument to show tnat possession. was used in contradistinction to <em>title </em>; and the clause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that the plaintiff should have one of the crops, shows that it was not so used. It was not a condition precedent, that the plaintiff should tender a conveyance of the 450 acres, since they were not selected ; and the plaintiff could not call on the commissioners to make the selection, without a notice from the defendant that he had not selected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-4\">The opinion of the Court was read at May term 1824, as prepared by</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-5\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-kJ\">This case has been argued with great learning and ability ; and certainly there was ample scope for the ingenuity of counsel in the obscurity and perplexity of some parts of the case. There is little doubt, however, as to the general principles of the law ; the great difficulty lies in 'the construction of the contract, and in ascertaining the true intention of the contracting parties. But unskilfully and carelessly as the contract appears to have been drawn, the intention of the parties in some particulars is sufficiently clear.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the first place, it is clear that the first act was to be done by the defendant. He was to deliver possession of the lands in Lee and in the State of New York, by the 1st day of April next after the date of the contract; and nothing was to be done or performed by the plaintiff until after that time. This, therefore, is an independent covenant, and it is unnecessary for the plaintiff to show or aver performance of the covenants on his part. If a day is appointed for performing a covenant on one part, and it <em>is </em>to happen or <em>may </em>Happen before the covenants on the other part are to be performed, the covenants are independent. 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 320, note 1 ; <em>Campbell </em>v. Jones, 6 T. R. 571 ; <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Wadham, </em>1 East, 629 ; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Duntze, </em>2 H. Bl. 389 ; <em>Seers </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>2 Johns. R. 272 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Woodhouse, </em>2 New Rep. 239.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The breach of this covenant is well assigned, and the plaintiff is enti led to recover, unless some one of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>pleas is a sufficient bar. But none of the pleas now before us\u2019 excepting the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th pleas, are at all applicable to the covenants respecting the delivery of possession. If the 13th plea was intended as an answer to this covenant, it is clearly insufficient. That plea alleges, that \u201c the land in Ridgeville from which the defendant might have made his selection of said 450 acres, is not of as good quality for farming as Richard Wormer\u2019s land.\u201d This averment however is not at all inconsistent with any covenant or condition to be found in the deed. The plaintiff covenants that the 450 <em>acres </em>to be selected by the defendant, were to be of as good quality for farming as Richard Wormer\u2019s land, but not that the <em>whole tract from lohich the selection was to be made </em>was of the like good quality. So, in another part of the deed, the parties agree that if the. said lands (referring, I take it, to the lands from which the selection was to be made) should not prove to be as good as the average of the lands <em>in the </em>vicinity, then the- contract should be void ; but it was riot to be void, because the lands were not of so good a quality as <em>Warmer's. </em>This plea therefore is no bar to the covenants respecting the delivery of possession, as to which we can perceive no objection to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover; for it is manifest that the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th pleas are insufficient. As to the three first of these pleas, it will suffice to remark, that the deed declared on is not the deed of Nor-tori, Stocking &amp; Co., nor did the plaintiff covenant in their name, nor undertake to bind them as their agent. He is only named as their agent by way of recital in the body of the deed ; but they are not parties to any of the covenants. As to the 12th plea, it is immaterial that the said Norton, Stocking &amp; Co. had no title to the land agreed to be conveyed. <em>Non constat </em>but that the plaintiff had a good title. And if he had not, he might procure one, which would be sufficient to enable him to fulfil his covenant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">The other covenant on which the plaintiff relies, is the covenant for conveyance. This and a corresponding covenant on the part of the defendant we consider as mutual de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>pendent covenants. The principal object of the contract was the exchange of lands. No time was appointed for making the conveyances, but as the one conveyance was the consideration of the other, we cannot doubt that it was the intention of the parties that both should be made at the same time. The plaintiff declares that the defendant\u2019s covenant was to have been performed within a reasonable time ; but it cannot be held reasonable that the plaintiff should require the defendant to perform his covenant, before the plaintiff should be ready to perform his. If the parties had intended that any such advantage of priority should be secured to either party, it would have been expressed in the deed. It has been argued, that the defendant was bound to convey at the same time he was to deliver possession ; but it is manifest from the language of the deed, that such was not the intention of the parties. The two conveyances were to be concurrent acts, and the covenants are therefore dependent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this point, which was very much discussed by counsel, does not appear to be material. For if the plaintiff was prevented from performing his covenant by the neglect of the defendant, it is equivalent to performance by the plaintiff. <em>Smith </em>v. Woodhouse, 2 New Rep. 240; <em>Hotham </em>v. <em>E. I. </em>Company, 1 T. R. 638. Now it is clear that no conveyance could be made by the plaintiff, before the selection of the lands was made ; and this selection was to be made by the defendant. If he refused to make it, it was incumbent on him to give notice, that the selection might be made by the three commissioners appointed for that purpose. But it seems that this neglect of the defendant ought to be alleged in assigning the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">This defect in the declaration, however, is not material, because on another ground the declaration is defective. It is stipulated in the deed, that the plaintiff should pay the</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">sum of 200 dollars. If this payment was to be made previous to the time when the conveyances were to be made, or at the same time, it is very clear that the plaintiff cannot re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cover without averring that he paid or tendered payment of the money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This payment was to have been made the first day of July, nearly a month before the time when a deeu was demanded, and before the time contemplated by the parties for the performance of the principal covenants. The defendant was not obliged to make the selection before the first day of July ; and if not then made, a further time was allowed, that it might be made by the men appointed for that purpose. It is true the defendant might have made his selection before the first day of July, and if he had so done, the plaintiff might have tendered a deed, and the defendant would have been obliged to convey the lands according to his covenant, without any tender made of the 200 dollars ; but this was not done, nor was he compellable to make the selection until after the first day of July. It plainly follows, that when the plaintiff demanded a deed of the defendant on the 30th day of July, he was obligated to pay or tender payment of the 200 dollars. Lord <em>Kenyon </em>states the rule correctly on this point, in the case of <em>Campbell v. Jones, </em>6 T. R. 571. \u201cIf one thing is to be done by a plaintiff, before his right of action accrues on the defendant\u2019s covenant, it should be averred in the declaration that that thing was done.\u201d The 200 dollars were part of the consideration the defendant was to receive for the conveyance to be made by him, and unless that conveyance was agreed to be made at all events before the time appointed for the payment of the money, it is very clear that the payment is a condition precedent. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Woodhouse, </em>2 New Rep. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">On the pleadings now before us it is clear that the plaintiff is entitled to recover on the covenant first to he performed, and that he is not entitled to recover on the other covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"AIm\">The opinion of the Court is, that the said several pleas in bar are sufficient in law, and that the plaintiff is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>damages for the breach of the covenant respecting the delivery of possession of the lands which were to have been delivered to him, unless he should be barred by the finding of the jury as to some one of the issues of fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> In determining the question whether covenants are conditional, independent or mutually dependent, the true intention of the parties collected from the language of their contract, is held to be the proper guide for the court. <em>Howland </em>v.
