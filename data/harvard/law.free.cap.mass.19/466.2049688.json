A verdict was taken for the plaintiff at October term 1821, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the facts which were to be reported by the judge who tried the cause. Several of these facts had a tendency to prove an adverse user of the way for more than twenty years by the plaintiff, hut the question whether they would warrant the presumption of a grant, was not referred to the consideration of the jury-</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b502-14\"><em>W. Prescott </em>and Stearns, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHA\">admitted that in England a grant might be presumed from an adverse en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>joy men t for twenty years, unexplained, but they contended that that principle was inapplicable here, in consequence of the statute of 1783, c. 37, which requires a conveyance of any interest in land to be by deed, and to be recorded, and the statute of 1786, c. 67, which provides for laying out private ways and making them matters of record. This last statute negatives the principle that twenty years\u2019 enjoyment shall afford a presumption of a grant, in providing (\u00a7 7) that where the boundaries of a private way &amp;c. cannot be determined, fences or buildings fronting on it, which have been upheld for more than <em>forty </em>years, shall be taken to be the boundaries. If an enjoyment for twenty years will give a right of way, then an occupation of the land for twenty years ought to destroy such right ; but in the section just referred to it is provided, that no length of time under <em>sixty </em>years shall justify the continuance of a fence or building on any private way &amp;c. In <em>Gayetty </em>v. Bethune, 14 Mass. R. 55, the Court say that adverse possession for any period short of twenty years will not give a right ; but there a possession for six years only was proved. In <em>Strout </em>v. Berry, 7 Mass. R. 387, the decision turned on another point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-4\"><em>Hoar </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">The opinion of the Court was read at the sittings after October term 1823, as drawn up by</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b503-6\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">[After remarking that in point of law the facts did not show a title to the way in the plaintiff] The continued use of the way and the bridge by the plaintiff\u2019s father and himself for more than twenty years, the keeping up and repairing of the bridge, and the passing of the river in the same place in a boat when the bridge was down, show a continuity of possession sufficient to warrant a presumption of a grant ; and we have no doubt a right to an easement may be so proved in this country, as well as in England.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>But here, as well as there, the possession, to be attended with this consequence, must be adverse, and whether it were or not, is always a fact to be ascertained by the jury. The difficulty we find in supporting the verdict as it new stands is, that this question does not appear to have been referred to the jury, and it is not competent to the Court to settle it On this ground a new trial was granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> See <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>4 Day, 244 ; <em>Chalker </em>v. <em>Dickenson, </em>1 Connect.
