It is manifest from these statutes, that the justice of this Court sitting in Hampden might have issued a mandamus, and consequently that the Court here have at this stage of the proceeding no jurisdiction over the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">2. This process is void, it not being under the seal of the Court and not having any <em>teste </em>; which forms are required by <em>St. </em>1782, <em>c. </em>9, \u00a7 3, in all writs and processes of this Court, except in the case of a <em>subpoena ad testificandum. [Parker </em>C. J. This is not a writ' or process within the meaning of that statute. It is merely a rule to show cause. The respondent has a right to come into court or not. If he does not, then a writ issues.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Au-\"><em>Bliss </em>senior and <em>E. H. Mills </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADyp\">This Court is the successor to the Supreme Court of Judicature, which by <em>St. </em>11 <em>Will. </em>3, c. 3, \u00a7 1, had jurisdiction of all matters as fully and amply as the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and there is no reason for supposing that this power was limited by <em>St. </em>1782, <em>c. </em>9. We think it will be found that there is nothing limiting the King\u2019s Bench or the Superior Ccurt, in the exercise of their power in regard to mandamus, to any county ; and from the nature of the thing it is important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that this Court should have jurisdiction on this subject, while sitting in any county, in order that there may not be a failure of justice by delay. <em>Rex </em>v. Barker, 3 Burr. 1267.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-4\">But that this Court sitting here have such jurisdiction, even though they may have it in no other county, will appear by an examination of <em>St. </em>1804, c. 105, and the several statutes relating to these counties. It is the policy of the law that three or more justices of this Court should have all the jurisdiction which one has. In some cases they have more. <em>[Wilde </em>J. The counsel on the other side admit that if we were sitting in Hampden we should have jurisdiction.] They said that in <em>St. </em>1804, c. 105, \u00a7 6, which provides that all matters, other than questions of law &amp;c., <em>may </em>be heard at the <em>nisi prius </em>terms, the word <em>may </em>means <em>must. </em>The <em>St. </em>1812, c. 31, \u00a7 1, provides that this Court shall be holden at Northampton, as well for the county of Hampden, as for the counties of Hampshire and Franklin, and shall have the same jurisdiction, power and authority for the trial of all actions &amp;c., and to hear and determine all other matters and things arisen or which shall arise within the body of the county of Hampden, as if the same actions, matters and things had arisen within the body of the county of Hampshire. This statute has never been repealed as to this point. The <em>St. </em>1815, <em>c. </em>107, is the one on which the counsel on the other side rely, as abridging the jurisdiction of this Court while sitting at Northampton. We agree that one judge has jurisdiction in cases of mandamus, otherwise there might be a failure of justice, as the law terms are held so seldom; but generally such cases involve questions of law, and the full bench likewise ought to have original jurisdiction in them. The statute of 1815, \u00a7 3, is the one, if any, which takes away the jurisdiction given by <em>St. </em>1812, c. 31, and we contend that the statute of 1815 makes provision only for the business then pending. It contains no express repealing clause, and the jurisdiction of this Court is not to be taken away by implication. In cases of certiorari, which are analogous to the present, a rule to show cause is often granted .n one county returnable in another.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-5\"><em>Bates </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An2\">This is a case between party and party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>involving questions of fact. The petitioner and respondent both live in the county of Hampden ; the transactions in question took place there, and it is a common law right of parties to have the facts tried there. The judge at <em>nisi prius </em>might have made us answer in Bristol, or any other county, as well as here. The statute of 1815 has reference to subsequent cases, as well as those which were then pending, and is conclusive. All the jurisdiction is referred by it to the <em>nisi prius </em>terms, except in cases which require three judges, and it is conceded that this is not one of those cases. I see not, if this Court sitting here have jurisdiction of this case, why they have not in any case. As to cases of <em>certio</em>rari., they require three judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> Tidd\u2019s Pr 453 <em>et seq</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ayr\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZX\">said, in substance, that the Court were ol opinion, that a preliminary question of this kind might be heard by the Court in any county ; as in cases of applications for writs of <em>certiorari </em>and petitions for new trials We all recollect instances where it has been done in those cases ; some of which are reported in our books. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Union Ins. Co. in </em>Newburyport, 5 Mass. R. 230, a rule was granted in Suffolk returnable in Essex, to show cause, why an information in the nature of a <em>quo warranto </em>should not issue. And it is convenient that the practice should be so, considering the infrequency of the terms of this Court in any one county. Where prompt justice is required, delay may thus be avoided. But we are of opinion that a <em>mandamus </em>in the present case could not be re turned here ; we should have to order the clerk of Hampden to issue the writ returnable at the court to be held in that county, which would not be till after the next election of a town clerk. In a case therefore where prompt justice is required, this should seem to be a failure of justice</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">After this opinion was delivered, the counsel went into an argument upon the question, whether the petitioner would derive any advantage from a mandamus; and if he would, whether he was regularly chosen town clerk, and so entitled to apply for such writ.</p>\n<p id=\"A2lk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>On this last question the following extract from the town lecords was produced. \u201c At a legal meeting &amp;c. on Monday, the first day of March, A. D. 1824 &amp;c., the following persons were elected to office &amp;c., <em>viz. </em>chose William Shepard moderator. At an adjourned meeting, March 2, 1824, chose Otis Taylor town clerk, and sworn. William Shepard, moderator. Attest, Otis Taylor, town clerk.\u201d A witness also was called to prove that Taylor demanded of Henry the documents &amp;c. belonging to the office of the town clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><em>Bates </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>We say that Taylor was not chosen at a meeting held regularly by adjournment, and that it was not competent for a town clerk, chosen on the 2d day, to make any record of what was done before he was chosen. If we are at liberty to go behind this record, we can show that the meeting on the 1st day was not regularly holden.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Parker <em>C. J. </em>There seems to be a defect according to the records, a meeting being stated to have been holden on the 1st of March, and no adjournment of it oeing mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Bliss </em>and <em>Mills. </em>There was a reguiar adjournment, and application was made to Henry to certify it. Taylor was legally chosen on the second day. He thought he had no right to enter on the records the adjournment of the preceding day. But the meeting on both days was only one meeting, and he may now certify the adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Wilde J. He may not have been present before he was chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\"><em>Bliss. </em>The old clerk shall not take advantage of his own wrong in refusing to certify.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Wilde J.' It does not appear that it is his own wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\"><em>Bates. </em>This record is objectionable in another respect, that the choice of a moderator on the first day is certified by Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\"><em>Bliss </em>and <em>Mills. </em>The original minutes were written by Henry, and were merely transcribed by Taylor into the book. The adjournment may be proved by parol evidence. In <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>1 Mass. R. 181, such evidence was admitted, to show that money was raised by a parish for a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>pose not expressed in the parish records. Suppose a representarive should be chosen by a town and the town clerk should refuse to certify it, would not the house of representatives admit parol evidence of the fact ? The whole pro ceedings here are certified by the moderator, as well as by-Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Parker C. J., in giving the opinion of the Court, said in substance, that the petitioner, in order to obtain a <em>manda</em>mus.&gt; must show that he was chosen town clerk. On the day preceding his supposed election there was a town meeting in Chester, and the proceedings <em>of </em>it are recorded by Taylor. But no adjournment of that meeting is recorded. We think that that fact must appear by the records. The record of the meeting on the 2d of March is merely that \u201cat an adjourned meeting \u201d &amp;c., without saying of what meeting it was an adjournment. It might have been of a meeting in February or any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">It is made a question, whether Taylor may not amend the record, so as to show that the meeting on the 2d of March was held by adjournment of the meeting of the day preceding. The objections to this are, that he was not town clerk on the first day, and that he had no control of the records and no official knowledge of what took place before his election. His record was made from the minutes of Henry, which contained no mention of an adjournment, so that <em>they </em>would not help him. It is said to be usual for the new clerk to record the proceedings of the meeting at which he is elected ; but if he may record the doings of a meeting the day before his election, it should seem that he might those of a meeting held six months before and continued by adjournment to the time of his election.</p>\n<p id=\"AZXS\">It is next contended, that parol evidence is admissible, but we do not find any case which authorizes the opinion that an adjournment may be proved by parol evidence. And it would be dangerous to admit such proof. Suppose a town to be very much divided ; it might be hard to decide, without polling, whether a meeting was adjourned or not, and we should have honest and intelligent men swearing to each side of the question. If a fact of this kind can be proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>0y parol evidence, it is difficult to see why the election of officers may not be proved in the same manner. This goes to the foundation of our system of civil society.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We are obliged to come to the conclusion, that there is no proof of a legal meeting on the second day, and that the petitioner is not town clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Mills. </em>We offered to prove by the moderator the legal organization of the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Parker C. J. We considered of that, but he is no more than any other witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\"><em>Petition </em>dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Fifth Parish in Gloucester, </em>6 Pick. 6; <em>Hartwell </em>v. <em>Littleton, </em>13 Pick. 229.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-14\"> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Athearn, </em>3 Mass.
