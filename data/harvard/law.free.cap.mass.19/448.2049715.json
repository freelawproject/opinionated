If the jurisdiction of the court is not impeached, it has the character of a record, and for all purposes should receive full faith and credit.\u201d This seems to be the necessary result of the course of decision on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">But under the issue of <em>nil debet, </em>in an action upon a judgment recovered in another of the United States, the defendant is not allowed to prove that the judgment was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. <em>M\u2018Rae </em>v. <em>Mat</em>toon, 13 Pick. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\"><em>Mil debet </em>was held in Virginia not to be a good plea to an action of debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>on a Kentucky judgment. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Day, </em>2 Leigh, 172.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcV\">The question presented by the pleadings is, whether the judgment declared on is conclusive evidence of a debt, so as to admit of no inquiry into the merits of the demand on which it is founded ; and the decisions of the Supreme <em>Court </em>of the United States in the cases reported in 3 Wheat. 234, and 7 Cranch, 481, which are commented on in <em>Commonwealth v. Green, </em>17 Mass. R. 546, are relied on as settling this point conclusively. In that case of <em>Commonwealth v. Green, </em>the Court rather bowed to the authority than to the reasons of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in the cases above cited, and we are not willing to carry the principle further than those cases of necessity require.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Those decisions profess to rest upon the constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress which have been passed in pursuance thereof. The words of the constitution are, \u201c Full faith and credit shall be given, in each State, to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\u201d <em>Art. </em>4, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">It is perfectly clear that by this article nothing was settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>but that the acts, &amp;c., authenticated as Congress should prescribe, were to be received as conclusive evidence of the doings of the tribunals in which the acts passed. And it is equally clear, that the <em>effect </em>of such acts was to be determined by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The act of Congress passed in 1790, (1 <em>Cong. </em>2 <em>Sess. c. </em>11,) prescribes the mode of authentication, but we should say, except for the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, has not determined the effect, for it only provides, in the words of the constitution, for the \u201c faith and credit\u201d to be given to acts &amp;c. so authenticated, leaving the effect uncertain, as it was by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">But without calling in question these decisions, let us see to what records they apply. Certainly, we think, the judicial proceedings referred to in the constitution were supposed by the Congress, which passed the act providing the manner of authenticating records, to have related to the proceedings of courts of general jurisdiction, and not those which are merely of municipal authority; for it is required that the copy of the record shall be certified by the clerk of the court, and that there shall be also a certificate of the judge^ chief justice, or presiding magistrate, that the attestation of the clerk is in due form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is founded upon the supposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>that the court whose proceedings are to be thus authenticated, is so constituted as to admit of such officers ; and the act has wisely left the records of magistrates who may be vested with limited judicial authority, varying in its objects and extent in every State, to be governed by the laws of the State into which they may be introduced for the purpose of being carried into effect. Being left unprovided for by the constitution or laws of the United States, they stand upon no better footing than foreign judgments, being not more than, prima <em>facie </em>evidence of debt, and liable to be defeated in their operation, under the plea of <em>nil debet, </em>as other foreign judgments are.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Adu9\">The plea is therefore good, and judgment must be for the defendant</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"> In those States where a justice of the peace holds a court of record, (as under our <em>St. </em>1783, c. 42, \u00a7 3; 3 Bl. Comm. 24;) and acts himself as a clerk of his court, he may certify, that he is presiding magistrate and clerk, and that the attestation is in the usual form. <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>5 Day, 363; 1 Stark. Ev. (4th Am. ed.) 154, n. (1). There seems to be nothing in such a case, so far as the <em>authentication </em>of the record is concerned, to take the record of a justice\u2019s court out of the operation of the statute of the United States, providing for the authentication of records, or to place the records of such a court on a foundation different from that of any other court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">As to the effect of the judgments of a justice\u2019s court of record, when hie jurisdiction is final, and the parties to the judgment and the subject matter of it are shown to be within his jurisdiction, there is no reason, why such judgments should not be as conclusive on all the world, as the judgments of superior courts are. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>3 Wendell, 267 ; <em>Ex parte Tobias Watkins, </em>3 Peters, 202 In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Robinson, ubi supra, </em>it was held, that the statute of Pennsylvania creating the justice\u2019s court, should be produced and proved, and it should also be proved, that the court acted within its jurisdiction under (he statute, and then the record would be entitled ta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>full faith and credit. <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>7 Wendell, 435 ; <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>6 id. 438.
