J., one Harris testified that he bought a piece of silk braid of the defendant, but that he did not know whether it was of foreign manufacture or not. On this point it was contended on behalf of the defendant, that the government ought to prove affirmatively that the article was of foreign manufacture ; but the judge instructed the jury, that as such articles were principally, if not entirely, of foreign manufacture, they might presume this to be, unless the contrary were proved. A verdict was found in favor of the Commonwealth, and if the foregoing direction was wrong, the verdict was to be set aside and the defendant was to be discharged from the indictment.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b116-8\">.The <em>Court </em>now being of opinion that there should have been proof that the article in question was of foreign manufacture, the defendant was accordingly discharged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b116-9\"><em>J.
