Pearson resided in Tewksbury for more than ten years after the passing of <em>St. </em>1793, c. 34, and the plaintiffs alleged that he gained a settlement there by reason of his being a person who ought to have been taxed for five of those years. The counsel for the plaintiffs contended at the trial, that if he had taxable property and was omitted to be taxed by reason of accident, mistake, or any other cause whatsoever, the verdict should be for the plaintiffs, and the jury were so directed. A verdict was returned for the plaintiffs, the jury being of opinion that Pearson had taxable property for more than five of the ten years. They however stated, that the assessors of Tewksbury did not omit to tax him to prevent his gaining a settlement there, but for some other cause concerning which the jury could not agree. If the direction was wrong, a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-13\"><em>Stearns </em>and Locke, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"AMb3\">cited <em>St. </em>1821, c. 107, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-14\">Hoar, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As5\">relied on <em>Wrentham </em>v. <em>Attlebor</em>ough, 5 Mass.
