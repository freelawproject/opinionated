Raym. 720 ; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>ibid. 83 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Green, 12 Mass. R, 1 ; <em>Bean </em>v. Parker, 17 Mass. R. 602 ; Com. Dig. (Hammond\u2019s ed.) <em>Bail, R </em>1, note <em>i </em>; and there is no limitation, under twenty years, for bringing the action. The provision in <em>St. </em>1784, c. 10, \u00a7 3, \u201c that no <em>scire facias </em>shall be served upon the bail, unless it be done within one year next after the entering up of final judgment against the principal,\u201d does not apply to the action of debt. The remedy by <em>scire facias </em>is cumulative, and was intended for the benefit of the creditor, not of the bail. If the statute has not done away the action of debt on a bail-bond entirely, there is no pretence for saying that it has limited the time for bringing such action. It is the duty of bail to see that the money is paid, or the principal surrendered, and he has no more ground of complaint than sureties in other sorts of bonds, for being held responsible twenty years. In the. colony law of 1650, Anc. Charters &amp;c. 51, bail are made answerable until the execution is discharged or satisfied, or the principal surrendered, but no mode of proceeding against bail is provided. It is presumed therefore that debt was the only remedy. If debt however will not lie on a bond taken according to <em>St. </em>23 <em>Hen. </em>6, c. 10, since this bond is signed by one surety only, it is not a bail-bond under the statute, but it is a good bond at common law; <em>Clyfton </em>v. <em>Web, </em>Cro. Eliz. 808 ; <em>Blackbourn </em>v. <em>Michelbourn, </em>ibid. 852 ; <em>Cotton </em>v. <em>Wale, </em>ibid. 862 ; <em>Beawfage\u2019s case, </em>10 Co. 101 ; <em>Blakebone </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>Noy, 39 ; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>9 Mass. R. 482; and the remedy must therefore be according to the common law, and a <em>scire facias </em>could not be supported on this bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-9\">S. <em>Dexter, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ar6\">insisted that this was a bond taken pursuant to the statute ; otherwise it would be void, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>being for ease and favor. 1 <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>5 Mass.

Debt does not lie on a bail-bond in this country, and never did. <em>Colony Law of </em>1672, Anc. Charters &amp;c., 193 ; <em>St. </em>5 <em>W. M. c. </em>5 ; <em>St. </em>4 <em>Anne, c. </em>3 ; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Read, 2 </em>New Hamp. R. 359 ; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Hill, 2 </em>Haywood, 223 ; and in England <em>scire facias </em>is the usual and proper remedy. Bac. Abr. <em>Scire Facias, C </em>7. If debt would lie here, the bail would be entitled to the custody of his principal for twenty years. <em>Swett </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>7 Mass. R. 347. It was however manifestly the intention of our legislature, to limit the time for pursuing bail to one year:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b307-3\">Parker C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASp\">in giving the opinion of the Court, said, m substance, that there was abundant authority that in England debt will lie against bail. But if debt may be brought here, (which question we do not decide,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) we think it was evidently the intention of the legislature, and according to the usage of the country, that the action should be brought within one year. It is true, the statute of 1784 says nothing about debt, but it is entitled, \u201c An act regulating Bail in Civil Actions,\u201d and the legislature no doubt thought that the whole subject was before them. Under the colonial system it should seem,, that at one period no way was provided for proceeding against bail. It was provided only, that they should be answerable for one month after judgment against the principal. Anc. Charters &amp;c., 193. Afterwards, in 1672, it was provided that the party and sureties being called and the bond being declared forfeited upon non-appearance, the case should proceed to hearing and judgment, as in case of the defendant\u2019s non-appearance upon attachment of goods ; and if the case should be found for the plaintiff, that execution should issue against the defendant and his sureties, to be in force against the sureties for one month after judgment given. Ibid. So the law continued until the <em>St. </em>5 <em>W. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number><em>M. c. </em>5, which contains provisions resembling those of the statute now in force. The legislature having there given a new remedy by <em>scire </em>facias, which is to be served upon the surety \u201c within twelve months after the first trial, and not afterwards,\u201d it is not reasonable to suppose that they intended to make the surety liable for a longer period in a different form of action. In the case of <em>Rice </em>v. Carnes, 8 Mass. R. 490, the Court say, \u201c if the plaintiffs neglect to sue out their execution, and obtain a return thereof, so as that their <em>scire facias </em>be not served upon the bail within a year from the rendition of the judgment, the bail will be discharged of course.\u201d And there are several cases of <em>scire </em>facias, in which the Court seem to consider that it was the intention of the legislature to limit the suing out of process against bail to one year. If.it were not so, mischievous consequences would follow. The bail are fixed on a return of <em>non est inventus on </em>the execution. If an action may be brought against them fifteen or twenty years afterwards, they will often have to pay the debt on account of the death of the principal. Again, in cases of small amount the debtor often gives security to the officer, and after the expiration of the year the security is returned ; but if this action can be sustained, it will be necessary, for the officer\u2019s protection, to retain the security many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">It is said that this is not a bail-bond under the statute, be cause there is but one surety. It is true that the officer cannot, by taking such a bond, discharge himself from an action by the party for negligence, but it is equally true that the party may make use of it as a bail-bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>Plea adjudged good,</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-4\"> See <em>Baker </em>v <em>Haley, </em>5 Greenl. 240; <em>Winthrop </em>v. <em>Dockendorff, </em>3 Greenl. 161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-5\"> It has since been decided, that debt does not lie on a bail-bond in this State. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>13 Pick. 339.
