Portland, 4 Mass. R. 390 ; <em>Groton </em>v. Shirley, 7 Mass. R. 156.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-8\">\n<em>W. Baylies, contr\u00e0.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR\">As soon as the pauper came within the State of Massachusetts her settlement in Middleborough revived. <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>11 Mass. R. 441. The division of a municipal corporation is not parallel to the separation of a state into two independent sovereignties. The warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>may perhaps have no effect, but it certainly does not make the defendant\u2019s case worse.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered at the following May term, at Plymouth, by</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-10\">Parker C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">This case appears to be like that of <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Bentley. </em>The pauper never lost her settlement in Middleborough, having gained none in Wilton. Had she gained a settlement in that town before the separation, that would have continued notwithstanding the separation, and by that means she would have lost her settlement in Middle-borough, and the leaving her in Middleborough would have been within the provision of the statute ; but her settlement in Middleborough remaining, it was no breach of the statute to leave her there.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-16\"> See <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>2 Greenl. 5; <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>16 Mass.
