It appears from the evidence that when the bond was presented, appellant said: \u201c Mr. Sapp, this is something I never did before in my life, and I dislike the idea of doing it.\u201d Sapp said : \u201cI assure you it is all right; Nelson has friends down there, and can dispose of the quantity of beer I have stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-10\">The appellant then said that he understood that Nelson was newly starting in business, and there being no dissent from that proposition, he inquired, \u201c Is this all right, Sapp ? \u201d To which Sapp replied, \u201c I think so.\u201d Appellant then executed the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-11\">These facts were concealed from the appellant by Sapp and Nelson when appellants signed the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-12\">Defendant submitted the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-13\">[1.

That if the jury find from the evidence that before the time when the defendant, George A. McLean, executed the bond sued on, J. M. Nelson was actually engaged in the business mentioned in said bond, and had become indebted to the plaintiffs several hundred dollars, and had allowed a check for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>$361.90 to go to protest; and that these facts were not made known to said George A. McLean by plaintiffs, and that said McLean had no knowledge of the same; then the said bond was a fraud on the said George A. McLean, and the verdict must be for defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused, and bill sealed for defendant.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">The court charged the jury in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">[Under the evidence in this case, I instruct you that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of its claim, $490.82, with interest from April 1, 1896, being $88.34, making in all $579.16.

Mathews, 10 C. &amp; F. 934, it was decided that mere noncommunication of circumstances affecting the situation of the parties, material for the surety to be acquainted with, and within the knowledge of the party obtaining a surety bond, is undue concealment, though not wilful or intentional, or with a view to any advantage to himself: Smith v. Bank of Scotland, 1 Dow. 272. To the same effect are Sooy v. State, 39 N. J. L. 135, 144, and Wayne v.

S. </em>Richardson, for appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHQ\">This claim of concealment and deception is evidently an after-thought. McLean admittedly learned all the facts, and knew of the so-called deception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>in February, 1897, and although he was in communication with plaintiff in this matter in the meantime, no Avord is said by him of this deception or concealment until suit is brought in January, 1897. He signed the bond for Nelson, his friend, and made absolutely no inquiry about the business from October 16, 1895, till he was notified on February 18, 1896, that Nelson was getting behind. He did not ask Nelson as to his financial standing. Sapp, the agent, was a total stranger to him, yet he trusted him and expected him to give him information without inquiry. Ingenuous McLean! A well-known business man of the city. Defendant cannot avail himself of circumstances which were the consequence of his own laches, a principle too well settled to need citation of authority, but see Shaeffer v. McKinstry, 8 Watts, 258.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACJ\">July 26, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AKu\">Oblady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The defendant executed a bond \u2014 as surety for J. M. Nelson who signed the bond as piincipal \u2014 to the plaintiff in the sum of $2,000, conditioned for the prompt payment by Nelson, as follows: \u201c For all beer which may be shipped or delivered to him by said Brewing Company in excess of the sum of one thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The bond ivas dated October 16, 1895, and signed by the defendant in the presence of a representative of the plaintiff, under the following circumstances. Nelson had been a customer of the plaintiff since September 11, previous. On September 26, he gave to the plaintiff a check for $360.25 to pay for a carload of beer, and then ordered more, the price of which was $325. On October 2, the plaintiffs\u2019 agent (Sapp) presented the check of Nelson to the bank on which it was drawn; at which time it was protested for want of funds to meet it, and it was not paid at the time the bond in suit was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The plaintiff refused to make any further sales to Nelson unless he would give a bond to protect them. On October 4, an agreement in writing was entered into between the plaintiff and Nelson by which the plaintiff was to sell and deliver beer at certain named prices to Nelson, who was to have the exclusive right to sell the plaintiff\u2019s product in certain towns, and if a greater credit than $1,000, should be desired by him it was provided that, viz : \u201c a bond shall be furnished in the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>two thousand dollars penalty for the faithful payment of such excess over one thousand dollars.\u201d W. J. Sapp, the agent of plaintiff in securing the bond, testified as follows: \u201cQ. Did you know at that time that Nelson, the principal, was insolvent ? A. Well, I judged so because of a talk I had with him in East Liverpool there, and my people wrote me that they would not ship any more goods unless I got a bond. His credit was extinguished.\u201d The defendant\u2019s uncontradicted testimony is as follows: \u201c Mr. Sapp, when he came into the office, was introduced to me by Mr. Nelson, and he said that he had been down to East Liverpool for two days, and had thoroughly gone over the ground in that locality and was under the impression that it was a good place ; that Nelson no doubt could make considerable money by disposing of their beer there; that the profit per barrel would be about $2.00 and the quantity of beer per month would probably be a car load or so. Nelson said, \u2018 Yes; the field looked to him as if it was all right.\u2019 That bond was presented, and I said, \u2018 Mr. Sapp this is something I never did before in my life, and I dislike the idea of doing it.\u2019 Mr. Sapp said, \u2018I assure you it is all right; Nelson has friends down there, and can dispose of the quantity of beer I have stated.\u2019 I looked over the bond carefully, and I said: \u2018 If he is newly started into the business there, as you say, I have no hesitation in being of some assistance to Nelson, as I have known him for twenty-five years.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The court held, that in the absence of inquiry the plaintiff was not bound to inform McLean of the state of accounts between them and Nelson, and their failure to do so was not a fraud upon him. A verdict for the plaintiff was directed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It can hardly be supposed that McLean would have signed the bond if he had been informed of the real state of facts. As to the single fact of bei\u00f1g indebted to them, it was not the duty of the plaintiff to volunteer information but Sapp, speaking for the plaintiff, directly led McLean to believe that the enterprise was newly started, and after personally investigating the locality, he was of the opinion that Nelson no doubt could make considerable money in it. The very opposite was the truth. The business had been in existence for some time and was so disastrous as to extinguish Nelson\u2019s credit; he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>known to be insolvent and indebted to the plaintiff in $1,100, part of which was a dishonored check of $360. These facts were personally known by Sapp, who, when he assured McLean that it was \u201c all right,\u201d fraudulently concealed material facts by which Nelson was held out to be a trustworthy person about to embark in a profitable business. When McLean hesitated to sign the bond, the plaintiff, by Sapp, anticipated further or particular inquiry, by representing to him that it was \u201call right.\u201d It cannot be denied that the facts were wilfully suppressed and we hold as matter of law that they were material: Story\u2019s Eq. Juris. see. 215; Bolz v. Stuhl, 4 Pa. Superior Ct. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The first, second and fourth assignments of error are sustained and the judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
