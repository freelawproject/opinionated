Defendant moved to quash the indictment for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">[1. There is no information to support the indictment.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">[2. The return of the constable of Apollo borough, filed at the above number, is not sufficient to support the indictment.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">[3. The indictment does not charge the offense as being committed in Apollo borough, and within the jurisdiction or bailiwick of the constable of Apollo borough.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-10\">[4. There was no arrest, hearing or binding over prior to the finding of the indictment by the grand jury; neither was the bill sent up by the direction of the court, or on a presentment of the grand jury.] [4] -....... - - -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-11\">[5. The first count, charging a nuisance, is defective, because it does not fix the location of the alleged nuisance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">[6. That by inspection of the indictment, it appears that one Frank N. Cuson was called and sworn by the grand jury without his name being first placed upon the indictment by the district attorney.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-13\">[7. The second count is bad because of duplicity and uncertainty, and because it attempts to charge an offense that is not indictable, to wit: The sale of an intoxicating liquor called ambrosia.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-14\">The court made the following order on the motion to quash the indictment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-15\">The Court: It being the practice of the court, upon receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ing returns of the constables, when return of a violation of the law is made, an individual return is always referred by the court to the district attorney. And that being done in this case, we will overrule the motion to quash, and now make an order sanctioning a sending up of a bill to the grand jury by the district attorney. And upon request of defendant, exception allowed and sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">December 20, 1899, exception granted defendant and bill sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">Verdict of guilty and sentence thereon to paya fine of $500, pay the costs of prosecution and undergo imprisonment for three months.

Com., 82 Pa. 405; McCullough v. Com., 67 Pa. 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-9\">An indictment must set forth every fact necessary to constitute the offense; it must be certain to every intent, and without any intendment to the contrary: Brightly\u2019s Digest, p. 483.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-10\">If a witness whose name is not placed upon the indictment is called and sworn by the grand jury, the indictment will be quashed: Com. v.

Swallow, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 539, 617; Com. v. Bredin, 165 Pa. 224.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ako\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>July 26, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-3\">In the case at bar the court ratified and approved this procedure. The return was for keeping a tippling and disorderly-house on one of the main streets of a town and selling liquor without a license.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\">The practice of the lower courts has always been to adhere to the practice so well established by the cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">In Commonwealth v. Swallow, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 539, 617, the same principle is again recognized.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Afs\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The prosecution in this case was founded upon the return of the constable of Apollo. borough, who, under oath, made answer to questions which are regularly propounded to all such officers. He clearly specified the offense of the defendant, and gave the names of the witnesses who could prove the fact. Pursuant to a practice which prevails in many counties of the commonwealth, the constable\u2019s return was delivered to the district attorney and a bench warrant was issued for the arrest of the defendant. An indictment was submitted to the grand jury before leave of court in writing had been obtained; this action of the district attorney was in accord with the local practice in such cases. A more orderly practice would be to have the court indorse on the indictment its approval of the submission to the grand jury. In this case the same judge, who had full knowledge of the fact that the court had under its unwritten rule authorized the action of the. district. attorney, subsequently made an order in writing sanctioning the submission of the indictment to the grand jury on the return of the constable, and in this there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The duty of the constable, the district attorney and the court in such cases is reviewed in McCullough v. Commonwealth, 67 Pa. 30, where it is said, \u201c But when the bill has been regularly sent up by the district attorney, under the sanction of the court, upon the return of a proper officer as in this case, the bill cannot be quashed except for matters appearing on the face of the record.\u201d It was not sent up surreptitiously, but followed a practice approved by the court: Brown v. Commonwealth, 76 Pa. 319; Hartranft\u2019s Appeal, 85 Pa. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">It is a power to be exercised, in the ordinary case, under the supervision of the court, and in all cases its exercise is subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>to revision and approval by the court: Rowand v. Commonwealth, 82 Pa. 405. If the process is misapplied the court will vindicate itself in restraining its exercise, and the action of the officer and the court will be reviewed only when the abuse of discretion is found to be both manifest and flagrant: Commonwealth v. Green, 126 Pa. 531; Commonwealth v. Breden, 165 Pa. 224; Commonwealth v. Montross, 8 Pa. Superior Ct. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The sixth assignment of error is without merit, as the inspection of the indictment, as indorsed by the district attorney, clearly shows that the name believed to be Frank N. Cuson is a clerical error for Frank Mason.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The indictment contains more than is required by the statute, but by the defendant\u2019s second point which was affirmed, the issue was clearly confined to whether the article which he sold without a license was a spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquor, or an admixture thereof. In the body of its charge the court said: \u201cNow the only question for you to determine in this case is whether that \u2018 Ambrosia \u2019 that he sold there was a spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquor or admixture thereof,\u201d and \u201c now gentlemen, if you find from the evidence in this case that this liquid that was sold by this defendant was vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquor or admixture thereof, then it would be your duty to find him guilty of the second count in this indictment; but if you find that this liquor that was sold by him was not such a liquor as is described in this act of assembly as vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquor or admixture thereof, it would be your duty to acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The sales were clearly proved and there was sufficient evidence to show that the article sold was an admixture of spirituous, vinous, malt or brewed liquors, in a disguised form. The experiment to evade the law in this manner was a failure, and after a fair trial the defendant was rightly convicted. It was purely a question for the jury and there was abundant evidence to warrant the verdict: Hatfield v. Commonwealth, 120 Pa. 395; Commonwealth v. Reyburg, 120 Pa. 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
