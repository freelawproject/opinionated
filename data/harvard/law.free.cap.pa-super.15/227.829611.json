This was sufficient to raise the presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tion on the hearing of a motion to quash that the information was duly made and sworn to.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b258-5\">An indictment will not be quashed on the ground that defendant was not compelled to appear for trial until the June sessions, when in fact he did appear at the March sessions, pleaded to the indictment without prejudice, and declined to move for a continuance.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b258-6\">Argued Oct. 2, 1900.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIX\">Appeal, No. 118, Oct.

Before Johnson, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">The facts sufficiently appear from the charge of the court below and its opinion overruling motion to quash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The defendant was tried March 18, 1900, on the above indictment, charging him with the sale of liquor without a license, and convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">The first day of the March sessions was March 5. The defendant had a hearing before the magistrate March 6, and was bound over to appear at the \u201cnext court of quarter sessions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">The indictment was found on March 9, 1900, and when the case was called for trial on March 13, counsel for defendant moved to quash the indictment on the ground that the transcript did not show any information subscribed to, and because the defendant was not bound to appear for trial until the June sessions, which it was claimed was the \u201c next court of quarter sessions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-12\">The court overruled the motion to quash, but informed the defendant that if he desired it, the case would be continued to the June sessions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-13\">The defendant declined to ask for a continuance, pleaded \u201c not guilty without prejudice,\u201d and went to trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-14\">After conviction a motion in arrest of judgment was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-15\">Should this indictment have been quashed? The objection that the transcript did not show that the information was subscribed to is settled by the case of Commonwealth v. Brenan, 193 Pa. 567, the court saying, per curiam, November 6, 1899:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-16\">\u201cThe defendant was tried upon an indictment found regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>larly by the grand jury upon examination of witnesses after information made before a magistrate. A trial was had upon the merits, and the defendant was duly convicted of murder of the first degree. On the trial a motion was made to quash the indictment because it was not found after an information sworn to and subscribed before the committing magistrate. While the defendant might have been heard on that subject upon a proceeding to be discharged from custody on the ground of an illegal commitment, it is certainly too late after indictment found upon the trial of the cause. The finding of the indictment cannot be invalidated for any such reason.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The transcript in the case, however, says the \u201c defendant was arrested on a warrant and brought before the mayor for a hearing, charged upon the oath of Edward Vandegrift,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">The magistrate did not return the affidavit upon which the warrant issued at the time of returning his transcript, but it was afterward brought into court. It was in writing and subscribed to, so that in point of fact there was an information sworn and subscribed to as the constitution provides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">We are not disposed to look at the other objection with favor. Whether he was bound to appear at the March term we do not decide. The fact is that he voluntarily appeared, and when the case was called for trial declined to accept a continuance to the June sessions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">He elected to go to trial and is bound by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\">Motion to quash overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-10\">Verdict of guilty and sentence thereon. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-11\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in attempting to take jurisdiction of the case at March term. (2) In refusing to quash the indictment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-12\"><em>John E. McDonough, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asz\">For the purpose of simplifying the argument, all of the assignments of error in the case are abandoned, except such as go to this proposition, viz: that the court of quarter sessions of Delaware county was without jurisdiction to try the defendant on March 13, 1900, or grant him a continuance: Act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 678; Com. v. Somers, 14 Pa. C. C. R. 159.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-13\">W. <em>I. Schaffer </em>and <em>Josiah Smith, </em>district attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEpq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>October 22, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b260-4\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendant moved to quash the indictment for two reasons, first, because the transcript did not show that the warrant was based on an information subscribed to; second, because he \u201c was not bound to appear for trial until the June session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The first objection cannot be sustained. The transcript shows that the defendant \u201c was arrested and brought before the mayor for a hearing charged upon the oath of Edward Vandegrift,\u201d etc., and that after hearing the defendant entered bail for his appearance at court. This was sufficient to raise the presumption on the hearing of a motion to quash that the information was duly made and sworn to. Moreover the information was brought into court and was in due form.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The second reason goes to the question of the duty of the defendant \u201c to appear for trial \u201d at March sessions. Grant that he could not have been compelled to appear and that his recognizance could not have been forfeited if he had not appeared, he nevertheless did appear and was offered a postponement of the trial until the term at which, according to his own contention, it was his duty to appear and plead. He declined this offer and pleaded to the indictment, \u201c without prejudice \u201d it is true, but nevertheless he pleaded the general issue. If he had refused both to plead and to move for a continuance, a different question would be presented. Under the circumstances his complaint that he ought not to have been tried until June sessions is without merit of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The judgment is affirmed and the record is remitted to the court below to the end that the sentence be fully carried into effect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
