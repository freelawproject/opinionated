Before Arnold, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\">It appears from the record that the plaintiff, the Lengert Company, brought an action in trespass against the appellees, the Bellevue Building and Loan Association and James H. McFarland, to recover the sum of $1,000 averring that it, the appellant, was the owner of a certain moving van of the value of $500 which' the appellees unlawfully seized and sold as the property of one Jacob H. Rohrbacher, although notified of the plaintiff\u2019s ownership, to the damage of the appellant of $1,000. The appellees filed a plea of \u201c not guilty \u201d with notice of special matter, averring that said Rohrbacher was in arrears for rent as tenant of 905 and 907 Fairmount avenue, which he held under a lease from appellee, in the sum of $1,603.28, for which a distress was made upon all goods upon the premises, including a furniture van, and sold in conformity with law as the property of Rohrbacher, and upon issue joined a nonsuit was entered by the learned trial judge \u201c for the reason that the plaintiff should have issued a writ of replevin for the wagon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and has no right to sue in trespass.\u201d The plaintiff filed a motion for a rule to show cause why the judgment of nonsuit should not be stricken off, which was refused, and exception noted, and this appeal taken by said plaintiff.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AH6o\">November 19, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in refusing on behalf of plaintiff to strike off judgment of nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-4\"><em>W.

Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">The plaintiffs claim to be the owners of a certain moving van which they leased to one, Rohrbacher, The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>seized, inter alia, the van under a distress for rent due them as landlords of the premises occupied by Rohrbacher. The distress was known to the plaintiffs before the sale of the van. They had time and opportunity to protect themselves. This is shown by the fact that a notice was sent, by their attorney, to the defendants, claiming ownership as against the distraint. It thus was the duty of the plaintiffs to bring replevin before the sale and in that proceeding prove their title: Bogert v. Batterton, 6 Pa. Superior Ct. 468; Esterly Machine Co. v. Spencer, 147 Pa. 466. They claim, however, that there was a failure to make a proper distraint upon the van taken and sold, and that this justifies them in resorting to this action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The facts upon which the contention is based are, that the van included in the distress notice was not upon the premises at the particular time that the constable left the notice, but was returned to the premises a few hours later. The demised premises were the place where the van was kept and from which it was taken for use upon the streets on the morning of the day of the service of the notice by the constable. The watchman, put in charge of the premises by the constable, took the van into custody pursuant to, and on the day of the service of, the notice. Thus was completed the seizure of the property for the payment of the rent. In Furbush v. Chappell, 105 Pa. 187, it is said: \u201cAs a general rule, to render the distress complete, there must be a seizure of the property distrained upon; but a very slight act is sufficient to constitute a seizure in contemplation of law. It need not be an actual seizure of the particular goods. If the landlord gives notice of his claim for rent and declares the goods which he names shall not be removed from the premises until the rent is paid, it is a sufficient seizure.\u201d It was held by this court in Snyder v. Boring, 4 Pa. Superior Ct. 196, that the notice should be in writing, and be sufficient to inform the tenant or the owner \u201cwhat are the goods taken and the amount of the rent in arrear.\u201d In the case before us notice in writing was served, and among the goods specified was the van in dispute. Thus there was a written notice followed by a talcing. After the seizure by the constable and the watchman, the van was taken from the premises and used by the tenant. When found upon the street, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>seized by the constable, deposited with an auctioneer and subsequently sold. This taking, however, was by virtue of the notice previously given and the seizure previously made, pursuant to the landlord\u2019s warrant. The plaintiffs having failed to exercise their right to sue out a writ of replevin before the sale of the van, have now no standing to hold the defendants liable in damages for a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
