His interest in his father\u2019s estate was sold by the sheriff as land, and a deed was delivered to the vendee. Tillie Yerkes acquired title to the interest by deed from the sheriff\u2019s vendee. The interest of Robert H. Yerkes was conveyed by him to his mother by deed, and passed by her will to Tillie Yerkes. The plaintiff, Seymour Yerkes, contends that his interest was not realty but personalty, and that, therefore, no interest passed by the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">The court entered a decree to the effect that defendant is a trustee of all the rents and income of the several pieces of real estate described in the bill of complaint collected by her, one third of which said rents as paid, the plaintiff is entitled to receive as a beneficiary under the will of Charles Yerkes, deceased; and the decree also further ordered an accounting.

The lands were devised to the devisees named, in fee simple, with a direction to sell and to distribute the proceeds amongst themselves, which direction to sell was inefficacious and did not alter the character of the \u201crem.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-11\">2. In case of an exercise of the power of sale, if the same could be exercised, the proceeds of sale would go to the owners of the land whose title was subject to the power and was divested by its exercise.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"An-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>December 10, 1900</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-4\"><em>William H. </em>Peace, for appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArVh\">Does this will work a conversion of the real estate into personalty ? If it does, then the judgment of Gilham was not a lien and the sheriff\u2019s sale gave no title, and Seymour\u2019s interest remains.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-5\">What remedy has such a creditor ? This is answered in the case of Selfridge\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. &amp; S. 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-6\">Nor is it of controlling importance, as contended by the appellant, that the trustees and beneficiaries here are the same persons, for it is a maxim (as quoted in the leading case in Pennsylvania on this question, viz: of Allison v. Wilson, 13 S. &amp; It. 330), \u201cthat where two rights meet in the same person, they are to be viewed as if. they existed in different persons.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-7\">Until the act of election the heirs have no estate or title which would be the proper subject of a lien either by judgment or by mortgage. See Henderson v. Henderson, 133 Pa. 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-8\">A trustee cannot set up a title adverse to his cestui que trust: 1 Lewin on Trusts, 285; Webb v. Dietrich, 7 W. &amp; S. 401; Chorpenning\u2019s App., 32 Pa. 315; Beeson v. Beeson, 9 Pa. 279; Campbell v. McLain, 51 Pa. 200.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A59v\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Opinion by (after stating the facts as set out in the statement of facts) :</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The clauses of the will above quoted in the statement of facts devise an absolute estate in lands with a direction to the devisees to sell. Were the devise to one person, little embarrassment in construing the effect of the clauses would be experienced. The devise of the land in fee would supersede the direction to sell, since the former includes the right to retain or alien at pleasure. But the devise is to three persons. This introduces an element of difficulty. If one of the three were an executor, or third person taking no interest in the land or the proceeds, such person would stand in the position of a trustee with direction to sell and distribute. This would, under the will, work a conversion of the land devised. The association with such a trustee of one or more persons taking an interest, would not alter the character of the trust, nor prevent the conversion. But here three parties take the land among them. Each in respect to the portions of the other two is a trustee to sell and distribute. The fact that he is himself a devisee and distributee does not change his relation to the other shares or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>to the fund produced by a sale. Furthermore, the title of the devisees is impressed with a trust in that if the actual conversion were consummated during the life of the testator\u2019s widow, the proceeds would be retained in trust during her life or so long as she should remain unmarried. Again, should any of the three devisees die, living the widow, the proceeds of the sale would continue in trust with the survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">It is true that when there is a conversion by direction to sell, the parties interested may agree to take the land itself without a sale. Such an agreement works a reconversion, and thereafter the interests of the devisees are in the land: McGarry v. McGarry, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 71; Howell v. Mellon, 189 Pa. <em>169; </em>Henderson v. Henderson, 133 Pa. 399. This right of reconversion has been carried to the extent of making valid a mortgage given by a distributee where a subsequent agreement was executed between the remaining distributees to treat the testamentary provision as a devise of land, the execution of the mortgage being construed to be an equitable assignment and a lien on the interest of the mortgagor in the land, which lien, after partition, attached to the purpart allotted to the mortgagor in severalty: Bailey v. The Bank, 104 Pa. 425. Here a creditor secured a judgment (adverse so far as this record shows) and sold Seymour Yerkes\u2019s interest. The creditor thereby elected to treat the interest as in the land. But the act of the creditor was not an election by Seymour Yerkes (Allison v. Wilson, 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 333), to deal with his interest as land, nor evidence of acquiescence or concurrence in the acts of his sister and brother, who may have elected to treat the interests created by the will as in land and not in the proceeds of its sale. Were we able to-strike out of the will the order to sell, a different result from that reached by the court below would be possible. The clause is not, however, so glaringly inconsistent with the devise of the land in fee as to make it void for repugnancy. The whole question is one of intent. Gleaning this from the provisions of the will, and having regard to the rule of law, which gives to a direction to sell the effect of working a conversion, we are led to affirm the decr\u00e9e entered in this case, since no title to the share of Seymour Yerkes. passed by the sheriff\u2019s sale, and none was, therefore, acquired by his sister in the purchase from the sheriff\u2019s vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
