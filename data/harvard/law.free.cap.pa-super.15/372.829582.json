Defendant gave a counter property bond, pleaded non cepit and retained the goods. At the trial the title of the property was admitted by defendant to be in the plaintiffs, and the only question for the jury was the amount of damages that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-12\">At the trial the court admitted under objection of plaintiffs the following testimony:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-13\">[\u201c Q. Did you ever meet Mr. Woods, counsel for the plaintiffs, or Mr. Benham, with reference to the settlement of this case, with reference to the payment of the amount of money due on this soda water apparatus? A. Mr. Bauer came to see me in regard to this case, in regard to fighting it, and I told him\u2014 Q. Not what you told him. Just state what you said to Mr. Woods, with reference to this matter. A. So we went down to see Mr. Woods; they claimed $5.00 and I advised him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to pay it. So we went down there, and we had a talk with Mr. Woods. Mr. Woods said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t see what more we can ask, if you are willing to pay $5.00,\u2019 and he says, \u2018 How about the costs?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018 we will pay the costs too; it does not pay to go into court with a $5.00 case, no difference whether we are right or wrong; we can\u2019t afford to fight over $5.00; \u2019 so Mr. Woods says, \u2018 I don\u2019t see what more we can ask after that; \u2019 so after a little hesitation, Mr. Woods and I came up to the courthouse here, and we were just going up the steps, Mr. Bauer, Mr. Woods and I, when Mr. Woods says, \u2018 Well now, hold on, Mr. Donehoo, perhaps I had better wait, and communicate with my people, because they might want to keep the machine, the soda water fountain.\u2019 So I says, \u2018Very well, then, if that is the view you take of it, just let it go and we will fight it, no difference what it costs.\u2019 \u201d] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">Defendant submitted among others the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">[3.

Wands, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 269; Cobb &amp; Chase v. Deiches &amp; Co., 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 252; Potter v. Stetson &amp; Co., 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 627; Brown Bros. <em>&amp; </em>Co. v.

Goodman, 129 Pa. 206, this principle of law was affirmed, the court there holding that in an action of replevin, where the defendant has given bond and retained the property, it is competent to instruct the jury, that if they find for the plaintiff, he may recover not only the value of the goods, but damages sustained by their detention. See also Miller v. Foutz, 2 Yeates, 418, Balsley v. Hoffman, 13 Pa. 603, and Schofield v. Ferrers, 46 Pa. 438.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-6\"><em>J. S. Stent a, </em>with him <em>T. T.

The defendant gave a counter property bond, pleaded non cepit and property, and retained the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The defendant had the soda water apparatus in his possession under a lease, which contained a right to purchase it under certain conditions. On the trial the learned court instructed the jury that there was a forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s right to purchase, and, on an enforcement of that forfeiture, the title to the fountain would be in the plaintiffs. This was admitted by the defendant, and the only question for the jury was the amount of damages that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. The title to the property was, at the time of the trial, in the defendant under the counter property bond;</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The charge of the court was not clear nor consistent on this phase of the case. The defendant\u2019s third point, which squarely raised the question, \u201c If the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict it must be in damages, and only such damages as he has suffered by reason of the defendant\u2019s detention of the goods,\u201d was affirmed. In the body of the charge the jury was instructed: \u201c The only question for you to determine is the amount of damages, and that is the value of the soda water fountain at the time of the replevin. That is the only question for you to decide, whatever damages for the detention of the soda water fountain that you find the plaintiff ought to receive, will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>your verdict for the plaintiffs.\u201d The fair interpretation of the charge of the court taken with the answers to the points would limit the amount of damages to which the plaintiff was entitled solely for the detention of the property. On the trial of such a case the plaintiff is entitled to recover the value of the property at the time of the replevin, and in addition thereto, damages for its detention and costs: Etter v. Edwards, 4 W. 63; Chaffee v. Sangston, 10 W. 265; Warner v. Aughenbaugh, 15 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 9; Harrisburg Electric Co. v. Goodman, 129 Pa. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The evidence embraced in the first assignment of error should have been rejected. It showed an unauthorized and ineffectual effort by counsel to compromise a pending suit, and it did not admit any substantive fact. The offer of compromise was rejected, and it was not evidence as an admission of liability: Slocum v. Perkins, 3 S. &amp;. R. 295; Arthur v. James, 28 Pa. 236; Bascom v. Danville Stove Co., 182 Pa. 427. The first and fifth assignments are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
