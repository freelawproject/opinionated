H. Jacobs was on the stand the following offer was made:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-9\">Mr. Deysher: It is proposed to show by the witness on the stand that he received from Charles H. Tyson papers from the office of A. Harvey Tyson, among which was a sheet or slip of paper in the handwriting of A. Harvey Tyson on which he had been practicing alteration of the word \u201c one \u201d to the word \u201cfour\u201d and the figure \u201c1\u201d to the figure \u201c4\u201d by the insertion of the letter \u201c F \u201d before the word \u201c one \u201d and by the addition of the cross on the figure \u201c 1.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-10\">Mr. Snyder: \u201c Q. Did you receive this as attorney for Harvey Tyson? A. T did not. Q. You didn\u2019t represent Harvey Tyson? A. If I did I wouldn\u2019t answer the question. This was after my connection with this case here had closed, \u2014 there was no litigation at the time that I knew of when these papers were shown me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-11\">Mr. Snyder: The objection is, that, in the first place, if there is any such paper, the paper should speak for itself; the offer proposes to give what is evidently the opinion of the witness or the counsel\u2019s opinion as to the character of the paper; in the next place, it is irrelevant and immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-12\">The Court: The papers themselves will have to be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-13\">Mr. Deysher: We further propose to prove that the paper is not now in possession of the witness, that he doesn\u2019t have it and has not seen it and has not been able to obtain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-14\">It is proposed to prove that there was the word \u201c one \u201d written on the paper; immediately under it, in exactly the same \u201c one,\u201d there was a letter \u201c F \u201d before, making the \u201c F-o-n-e \u201d or \u201c F-o-u-r,\u201d just as he did in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-15\">It is proposed to show that there was such a paper as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>in existence, that it was in Harvey Tyson\u2019s handwriting, and to show what there was on the paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">Mr. Snyder: The objection is good as made ; it is the question of th\u00e9 appearance of the paper that we are entitled to, and not the opinion of the witness or the recollection of the witness as to something at that time on a paper now lost or destroyed, how many years ago nobody knows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">The Court: If the defendant,' by the testimony of this witness, can reproduce to the jury the appearance of the paper in such a way as to enable the jury to base its own inferences upon that testified portion of the paper, the offer may be admitted, and to that extent it is admitted, beyond that it is rejected ; exception for plaintiff. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-7\">The court under objection and exception refused the following offer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-8\">We propose to prove by the witness on the stand that the indorsed notes for A. Harvey Tyson aggregated $8,100 when they were finally presented for payment; that in reality the notes were supposed to be renewals of notes aggregating about $800, and which had been altered in the time of payment and in the amount.

It being the uncontradicted evidence that the plaintiff received the notes in suit before they became due, for a valuable consideration, it is immaterial whether the defendant was indebted to A. Harvey Tyson or not when she issued the notes. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-11\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-12\">1. If the jury find that when Elizabeth Posey signed the notes in suit she used the ordinary care generally taken by ordinarily prudent people when they sign negotiable paper, and further find that the notes in suit were written in the sum of $100 when they were signed by the said Elizabeth Posey, then the verdict must be in favor of the defendant. <em>Answer : </em>Refused. [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-13\">2. It was not necessary when Elizabeth Posey signed the notes in suit that she should see that the notes were so written as to prevent the possibility of alteration in any event; all that is necessary is the use of ordinary care, and if the jury find that the defendant used ordinary care, the verdict must be in favor of the defendant. <em>Answer : </em>Refused.

L. 69, permitted experts to testify to their opinions as to the simulation or alteration of documents, but that act plainly contemplates that these opinions shall be given concerning documents produced and shown to the jury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AKVB\">William W. Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">The defendant offered in effect to prove by a witness that the latter had seen a paper in the hand writing of the payee of the notes sued upon, upon which were written words and letters similar to those alleged, to be changed in the notes in suit, for the purpose of showing that the payee was practicing to carry on the forgery alleged to have been perpetrated in the notes in suit. It is to be observed that the paper upon which these writings were said to have been made, was not produced or offered in evidence. In Wheeler v. Ahlers, 189 Pa. 138, a card was admitted in evidence, which was found in the office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>of an alleged forger, having upon it memoranda in his handwriting showing practice in changing figures in the manner charged by the defendant as having been done upon the note in suit. Its admission, after proper identification, raised palpably a different proposition from that presented in this case. With the card actually before the jury, they were able to pass upon its authenticity, upon the character of the marks upon it, whether the alterations experimented with on the card were similar to those alleged to be upon the note, and to what extent the card itself was proof of the alteration on the note submitted to the jury. Here, the offer was to substitute the opinion of a witness as to the similarity and authenticity. He was asked to speak of these important matters after a number of years. In the absence of the paper itself no method, known to the trial of causes, could be found to test the correctness of the witness\u2019s statements. The testimony did not purport to come from one who saw the marks made, and the result of the testimony could be no more than the expression of an opinion without adequate data by which the jury might measure its value. To have admitted the testimony, therefore, would have transferred to the witness functions which could alone be performed by the jury. To put the apt expressions used by Judge Thayeb, in Pennsylvania Co. v. Phila., etc., R. R. Co., 153 Pa. 160, in negative form: it was not \u201c putting in evidence the workshop and the material in and by which the nefarious business had been carried on and by means of which the forgeries in this case had been accomplished.\u201d It did not show the alleged forger \u201c in the very act, as it were, of practicing for the forgeries which he made.\u201d It may be conceded that where the defense is based upon a scheme to defraud, the rules relating to the admissibility of evidence must be relaxed. But we are not prepared to approve the admission of testimony having the defects above indicated, and, therefore, confirm the action of the court below in the ruling made.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The second assignment is to the rejection of an offer to prove forgery by the payee, of other notes in transactions with which neither the plaintiff nor the defendant had any connection and without the production of the notes alleged to be forged. The court below permitted the introduction of such testimony when the notes alleged to have been forged were produced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>but drew the line at the introduction of general oral testimony respecting alleged forgeries of notes of which the jury were not intended to have inspection, and in this there was no error. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh assignments are to rulings made by the court below restricting or rejecting testimony attempted to be introduced through cross-examination. We find no abuse to have been committed of the broad discretion lodged in a trial judge in ruling upon matters relating to cross-examination. The eighth assignment complains that the trial judge affirmed the following point: \u201c It being the uncontradicted evidence that the plaintiff received the notes in suit before they came due for a valuable consideration, it is immaterial whether the defendant was indebted to A. Harvey Tyson, or not, when she issued the notes.\u201d No attempt is made to contradict the testimony of the plaintiff that he took the notes' before they were due. The cash used in part payment for them is traced by the testimony by means of the check given. The balance of the consideration was the surrender of certain other promissory notes. True, the plaintiff was unable to remember the names of the parties upon these surrendered notes, but no testimony challenges the genuineness or the value of the notes. Under such circumstances, there was no necessity of submitting to the jury the question whether the plaintiff had taken them for value before maturity. The refusal of the point requesting instruction that the jury should find for the defendant, if she was not guilty of negligence in signing the notes, was not error. The point ignored the condition that the jury should find that a forgery had been committed. The other assignments are without merit, since under the law, correctly stated in the charge of the court, and the submission of the case to the jury, their finding of fact is that no forgery was committed. The lack of observance of our rules in the presentation of the assignments of error would have justified us in ignoring the latter, but we have preferred to dispose of the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
