There was a denial of this by Wells and there was some conflict of testimony as to the point.

E. Carrington came to our office and said he had a contract with M. P. Wells &amp; Company to do the stone and brickwork on the Pascoe Apartment House. He asked me if I would furnish materials there, and I asked him what arrangements he had made, and he said he was not to get any money until the roof was on. I told him if M. P. Wells &amp; Company would guarantee the bill I would put the materials there. I saw Mr. Wells and stated the circumstances to him, and told him what Carrington had told me, and he agreed that they should retain the amount from his contract and pay it, and Wells said, \u2018 All right, you go ahead and furnish the materials to W. E. Carrington &amp; Sons and let us know the amount of the bill as soon as it is finished, and we will retain the money from his contract and pay you,\u2019 and I went ahead under those conditions and furnished the materials as Wells directed me to do.\u201d The charge in the plaintiff\u2019s books was to W. E. Carrington &amp; Sons. No part of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony can, under the most liberal construction, be regarded as establishing a contract between it and M. P. Wells &amp; Company, the contractor, nor is it anywhere alleged in the evidence that the materials were furnished on the faith of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Here then was an agreement to sell to Carrington, the subcontractor, upon certain conditions as to the guaranty of the account by the contractor, a subsequent agreement on the part of the contractor to retain out of the money due to Carrington, when the work was completed, the amount of plaintiff\u2019s bill, a sale to Carrington on these conditions and a charge to him in the plaintiff\u2019s books. There can be no doubt, therefore, of the entire correctness of the action of the court below in directing a verdict in favor of the defendants. The binding instruction of the court is the only error complained of and the judgment must be, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
