D. Meloy, who purported to be their agent, for the purchase of relief maps; that after the contract for the purchase of said maps had been signed in duplicate and one copy given to Mr. Meloy and the other retained by the board, Mr. Meloy stated to them that it was necessary for him to have an order for the goods sold to induce the house to ship the goods ; that he then presented a paper, upon which the present action is alleged to be founded, marked R. B. \u201c A,\u201d and stated that this was an order for the goods, and upon that assurance the officers of the board signed the paper; that the paper so signed did not have the words \u201c per A. D. Meloy \u201d in the body of the paper; that this paper was not asked for, nor given as any evidence of payment, or of contract, or of liability, but simply as stated, as an order for the goods; that a draft could not have been given as an evidence of debt or payment, because nothing had been done under the contract and would not be until the maps were delivered and approved; that on August 7, 1896, following, the goods were received by the board with a bill for 1760, the contract having called for the payment of only $456; that one of the officials of the board saw Mr. Meloy and asked him how it came that the cases were charged $804, telling Mr. Meloy that they had received the goods and were about to send a warrant for their payment, to wit: for the amount agreed upon, $456; that Mr. Meloy then wrote across the back of the bill then rendered, a statement that the cases were not to be charged, and also stated that he had sent his check to.the Central School Supply House in payment of the cases, and showed him the stub of his check; that the bill rendered, as all the pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>pers in the negotiation show, stated that no payment was to be made to any one but the Central School Supply House, and the official of the board who saw Mr. Meloy about this bill stated to him that they were now about to send their warrant for $456 to the Central School Supply House; that Mr. Meloy made no protest nor objection; that on July 24,1896, Mr. Meloy wrote to the Central School Supply House stating that he would send them the order for $456 of the South Middleton township school board for the maps which had been ordered, and enclosed his check for $300 for the cases which were included; that subsequently, on August 7, 1896, the school board sent their school warrant to the Central School Supply House for $456 in payment of these relief maps; that this warrant was subsequently sued upon by the Central School Supply House, and the action on it against the school board of South Middleton township is now pending; that some time later in the fall the school board were informed that Mr. Livingston had their warrant for $456 ; that the Central School Supply House never received from Mr. Meloy, nor from any one else, the amount due them on this contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">This for the purpose of showing that the alleged warrant in suit was not issued by the school board as warrant, but was surreptitiously obtained by Mr. Meloy, and was transferred without authority, and by the perpetration of forgery; that the money was not appropriated to the payment of the relief maps, but in payment of his own debt with the Central School Supply House for cases, and that Mr. Livingston, the use plaintiff, has no right to recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">It is also proposed to show that the warrant was materially altered by the interlineation of the words \u201c per A. D. Meloy \u201d after it had been written, in order to allow Mr. Meloy to perpetrate the fraud by the negotiation of the warrant, which he did negotiate, and which fraud he did in fact perpetrate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">Mr. Hays : Objected to (1) that the evidence offered has all been passed upon by the Superior Court in its opinion, and has been decided by that court to the effect that it will not amount to a defense. (2) It is not competent for the defendant in this case to try any matters that may be in dispute between Mr. Meloy and the Central School Supply House. (3) The evidence proposed to be given by the witnesses cannot be given to alter, vary or modify the terms of the written paper in evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>(4) No such defense is raised by the affidavit of defense and pleadings, and under the rule of court where the facts in the declaration are not denied by the affidavit of defense, the facts as stated in the declaration may be taken as admitted.

Beltzhoover, </em>with them <em>W. F. Sadler, </em>for appellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOxf\">The fatal weakness of appellant\u2019s argument is his contention that there could be, and has been no change in the pleadings, issues and evidence since the first trial of the case. This contention is in direct contradiction of the authorities and the facts. The judgment entered on the first verdict was reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial, without instructions from the court. The effect of this was to reopen the entire case, enabling defendant to avail itself of any defense it might have, irrespective of its having been used in the former trial or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-11\">An order granting a new trial leaves the case as though no trial had been had: 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (1st ed.), 674.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-12\">In the absence of any showing to the contrary, a new trial will be presumed to have been awarded on the merits, reopening the whole case: 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (1st ed.), 675; Morris v. State, 1 Blackford, 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-13\">The same rule applies to a case sent back from a new trial upon a reversal on appeal: Ex parte Bradford, 48 Ind. 548.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-14\">The judgment of this court (Supreme) did not divert any right the parties might otherwise possess after the case was remanded. Nor could the defendants alter their pleadings here. Such is not the practice. This court adjudicates on what is before it, and sometimes remands with instructions, but does not undertake to mould the pleadings preparatory to a trial below: Kemmerer v. Young, 5 Rawle, 175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-15\">If Meloy had any right to transfer the contract to Livingston it was an equitable right and was dependent on the school supply house\u2019s having received payment of its interest in the contract. So long as any part thereof remained unpaid no sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>stitution could take place against the protest of the supply-house.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AL8\">November 19, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">The rule governing this question is fully set out in the opinion of Justice Mitchell in Graff, Bennett &amp; Co.\u2019s Estate, 139 Pa. 69.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">The defendant, too, is entitled to demand that a claim against it shall be sued upon for the whole amount only, and not for fractions thereof, thus exposing it to additional costs and expense : Dietrich\u2019s App., 107 Pa. 174; Hopkins v. Stockdale, 117 Pa. 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">Appellant apparently recognized said rule, for at both trials he presented his third point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">The appellant now insists that the question should have been decided by the court as question of law and not of fact, in spite of, or rather, because of the adverse finding of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">The reasons given in support of this change of front will not stand investigation, being based on misstatements of fact and law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AsH\">Oklady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">When this case was before this court in a former appeal the essential facts were set out at length: 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 110. The judgment of the court below was then reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded, and it is not necessary to repeat the reasons for so deciding, but the record submitted on this appeal presents questions not raised on the former one. When a judgment is reversed by our appellate courts and a venire facias de novo is refused, the judgment of reversal does not constitute a bar to another suit for the same cause of action : Fries v. Penna. R. Co., 98 Pa. 142; Wrasse v. Traction Co., 146 Pa. 417; Ellis v. Ins. Co., 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 392. The award of a venire de novo is in no instance anything more than an order for a new trial in a cause in which the verdict or judgment is erroneous in matters of law: United States v. Hawkins, 35 U. S. 125; Co-op. ed. 369. A trial de novo does not mean a trial on appeal with nothing but the record to correct errors, but is a trial on the entire case anew: Shultz v. Lempert, 55 Tex. 273. In Kemmerer v. Young, 5 R. 175, our Supreme Court says: \u201c The judgment of this court did not divest any right the parties might otherwise possess after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cause was remanded. No decision took place here on the right of the defendants to add a new plea. Under the circumstances the defendants retained the right given them by the act of assembly to add a new plea before the trial of that issue.\u201d This court adjudicates on what is before it, and sometimes remands with instructions, but it does not undertake to mould the pleadings preparatory to a trial below. After a venire facias de novo the case stands in the court below subject to the provisions of the act of assembly (March 21, 1806, 4 Sm. L. 326, sec. 6), and as in other cases the defendant may alter his defense or plea on or before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">After the return of the record to the court below the defendant filed a supplemental affidavit of defense in which it was alleged, first, that the order sued on was fraudulently obtained, second, that it had been altered in a material part to the prejudice of the defendant, and third, that the maps and cases delivered had not the value claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The defense as presented at the last trial eliminates from the case the right or duty of the defendant to pay the money into court, as its denial of liability affected the whole claim, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover any part of it. The theory of the use plaintiff was that the Central School Supply House had been paid in full, in support of which he adduced evidence, and, the court affirming his third point, the solution of that fact was distinctly transferred to the jury, which tribunal determined it against him. The point was as follows: \u201c If the jury believe that the Central School Supply House and A. I). Meloy have received from the use plaintiff payment in full of all their interest in the contract, then their verdict must be for the use plaintiff for the full amount claimed, and no formal assignment of the claim on the contract is necessary, because equity presumes that to have been done which ought to have been done.\u201d The converse of this proposition was presented by the defendant\u2019s first point viz,: \u201c If the jury are not satisfied under all the evidence in the case that the Central School Supply House has received all the money due it on the sale of he maps and cases to the South Middleton school district, but that there is money still due said Central School Supply House, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover; \u201d which was also affirmed. From the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of the case, the state of the account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>A. D. Meloy with the supply house, as to this particular transaction, was necessarily a material fact. On no other condition could the use plaintiff claim that he was entitled to use the name of legal plaintiff \u00f3n the indorsement of Meloy. In the plaintiff\u2019s examination of Meloy is the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201c Q. Mr. Meloy, the contract is in evidence between you and the Central School Supply House. How many sets of maps did you buy from them?\u2019 A. Two hundred sets. Q. What was in a set ? A. Seven maps to a set. Q. Cases furnished with them? _A. Cases furnished with each set of maps. Q. You paid how much ? A. I was to pay, I had already paid for them by issuing my notes. I was, however, required upon each sale to remit to them one half of the sum received as a credit on my notes, and if they got the money I drew my half, and the other one half should go as a credit on my notes. The goods had already been purchased, and they h\u00e9ld my notes as collateral. ... I made the check straight $800 in order that they might get the benefit of that much either way, and that $300 which I sent to them paid every equity they had in the cases, and the maps which were shipped to the South Middleton School Board, it being credited on my notes, and entirely wiped out the transaction so far as the Central School Supply House was concerned.\u201d On the part of the defendant, in reference to the maps and cases that were shipped on Meloy\u2019s order to the school district, the president of the supply house testified as follows: \u201cQ. Have you been paid for them? A. No, sir, not one cent*; we have never received a cent yet.\u201d In regard to the second warrant issued by the school district, as follows: \u201cQ. Has ever a dollar been paid on it ? A. We have never received a cent. Q. From anybody? A. No, sir.\u201d Asan admission of facts on the part of the defendant, and in order to relieve the use plaintiff of the necessity of proving them, 'he adopted, in making out his case in chief, the unusual method of using a statement from the opinion of this court in the former appeal, which was without precedent or authority to justify it, and should have been rejected as irrelevant to the issue then before the court. The case was tried throughout on the lines suggestedby the plaintiff\u2019s third and the defendant\u2019s first point, and while there are some irregularities \u25a0 in the record, they are not of sufficient importance to warrant a third trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"ADj\">The judgment is affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
