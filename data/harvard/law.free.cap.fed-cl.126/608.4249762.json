In a previous Opinion, the Court remanded this case to the United States Forest Service (FS) with instructions that it clarify the basis for its decision to award a contract to provide fire cache freight services to a competing offeror, Connie\u2019s, Inc. (Connie\u2019s), rather than to Braseth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Opinion and Order, ECF No. 21 <em>(Braseth </em>I).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that, in light of the Contracting Officer\u2019s clarification of the basis for his decision on remand, Braseth lacks standing to pursue this action. Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED and Braseth\u2019s complaint is DISMISSED without prejudice based on lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">I. The Solicitation and Contract Award</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Braseth, a trucking company located in northeast Oregon, submitted a quotation in response to an FS solicitation for \u201cFire Cache Freight Services,\u201d which were to include \u201cthe delivery of emergency supplies and equipment by tractor-trailer for wild land fire suppression and all-hazard emergencies to various locations in the western United States.\u201d <em>See </em>Admin. R. (AR) Tab 3 at 3-5, ECF No. 11; <em>see also id. </em>Tab 4 (solicitation); <em>id. </em>Tab 6 (Braseth\u2019s quotation). The contracts at issue in this case involve providing freight services for a fire cache located near La Grande, Oregon. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, ECF No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">According to the solicitation, quotations would be evaluated based on three factors: price, past performance, and the availability of tractor/trailers within a 50-mile radius of the .cache (i.e., proximity). <em>See </em>AR Tab 4 at 45. Past performance was considered more important than proximity; and the non-price factors together would be considered \u201capproximately equal to price.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">The FS considered quotations from five companies: Braseth, Corwin, Connie\u2019s, A-Secured Properties, LLC (A-Secured), and Smith Bros. Moving Services (Smith Bros.). AR Tab 12. at 68. A-Secured and Smith Bros, submitted \u201cPast Performance Data Sheets\u201d describing them performance on previous FS contracts as part of their submissions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>AR Tab 5 at 48; <em>id. </em>Tab 9 at 57. The quotations provided by Braseth, Corwin, and Connie\u2019s, however, did not include any information about their past performance. <em>See </em>AR Tabs 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">The FS convened a Technical Proposal Evaluation Committee (TPEC) to evaluate the quotations. AR Tab 12 at 68. The TPEC gave each quotation an adjectival rating of \u201cExcellent\u201d for proximity. <em>Id. </em>at 69. The TPEC also rated A-Secured and Smith Bros. \u201cExcellent\u201d on past performance. Bra-seth, Corwin, and Connie\u2019s, however, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ceived \u201cSatisfactory\u201d ratings on past performance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In a Memorandum of Negotiation explaining the award decisions, the Contracting Officer (CO) reviewed the TPEC\u2019s ratings. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. He noted that \u201calthough [Braseth, Corwin, and Connie\u2019s] are separate companies, all three are owned by the same person, utilize the same personnel, and use each other\u2019s[] trucks interchangeably.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. He observed that the TPEC assigned Bra-seth, Corwin, and Connie\u2019s \u201cSatisfactory\u201d ratings because of \u201cissues [in] the past two years [involving Connie\u2019s performance] dealing with untimely invoicing, late deliveries, and having to reject a truck since it arrived at the cache full of junk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CO agreed with the TPEC that \u201cConnie\u2019s satisfactory rating was appropriate due to the recent performance concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the CO, however, Braseth and Corwin \u201clacked recent past performance with the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CO noted that, under FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), \u201can offeror without a record of relevant past performance ... may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CO ultimately left Braseth\u2019s and Corwin\u2019s satisfactory past performance ratings in place, though, because \u201cit was considered a neutral rating.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Turning to price, the CO noted that Connie\u2019s offered the lowest prices, followed by Braseth and Corwin. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. A-Secured and Smith Bros, offered the highest prices. The variance between the high bid and the low bid, however, was \u201cvery tight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Next, to determine the contract awards, the CO conducted a trade-off analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. \u201cKeeping in mind the combination of past performance and proximity were considered of equal importance to price,\u201d the CO recommended awarding contracts to A-Secured, Smith Bros., and Connie\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>A-Secured and Smith Bros., though higher priced, were considered \u201creliable providers\u201d who had \u201cconsistently met their delivery schedules,\u201d and their prices were considered \u201ccompetitive and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. The CO also determined that Connie\u2019s would be \u201csuitable for award\u201d because it was \u201clowest in price.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Braseth and Corwin were not recommended for an award. <em>Id. </em>at 75. In explaining this decision, the CO again noted that the TPEC had expressed \u201cthe same concerns with Corwin as it did with Connie[\u2019]s\u201d and had \u201cidentical concerns\u201d for Braseth. <em>Id. </em>At the same time, however, the CO stated that Braseth and Corwin were each \u201cconsidered a new company without a recent record of past performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CO made no attempt to reconcile these seemingly contradictory statements. <em>See id. </em>He then noted that Braseth\u2019s and Corwin\u2019s prices were higher than Connie\u2019s, and not substantially lower than Smith Bros.\u2019 or A-Secured\u2019s. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">After the FS awarded the contracts, Bra-seth requested debriefing. <em>See </em>AR Tab 16. In a response letter, the CO explained that, \u201c[y]our past performance was considered satisfactory overall, but several issues were noted during the evaluation.\u201d AR Tab 18 at 180. As examples of these issues, the CO listed several incidents that allegedly occurred during Connie\u2019s performance of its recent FS contract. <em>Id. </em>He did not restate the conclusion in the Memorandum of Negotiation that Braseth was considered a new company without a recent record of past performance. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">II. The Proceedings in This Court and On Remand to the Agency</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">A. <em>Braseth\u2019s Complaint and Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">Braseth filed its complaint in this Court on August 6, 2015.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ECF No. 1. It alleged numerous errors in the procurement. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-54. Among other things, it alleged that the CO\u2019s decision appeared to both impute Connie\u2019s past performance to Braseth and, at the same time, state that Braseth was entitled to a neutral past performance evaluation as an offeror without recent relevant past performance. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-29. Braseth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>also alleged that, to the- extent that the CO imputed Connie\u2019s past performance to Bra-seth, he should not have done so, <em>See id. </em>Finally, it alleged that neither Connie's nor Braseth had ever been made aware of any performance problems on previous FS contracts and it disputed the existence of any such issues. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-22, 80-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">After the government compiled the administrative recprd, Braseth filed its motion for judgment on the administrative record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ECF No. 14. In response, the government filed a combined motion to dismiss and cross-motion for judgment on the administrative record. ECF No. 15. Braseth then filed a response to the government\u2019s combined motion. ECF No. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Braseth advanced three primary arguments in its motion and its response. First, it argued that the CO\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to provide a consistent rationale for Braseth\u2019s \u201cSatisfactory\u201d past performance rating. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mot. for J. on the Admin. R. (Pis.\u2019 Mot.) at 20-21; Pis.\u2019 Resp. to Def.\u2019s Cross Mot. for J. on the Admin. R, (Pis.\u2019 Resp.) at 6-8. Bra-seth articulated this argument most clearly in its response, contending that \u201c[w]hile both of these lines of evaluations [sic] (negative past performance issues versus new company [with] no past performance) come up with the same resulting \u2018satisfactory<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rating by the Forest Service, it shows that they did not follow the proper evaluation requirements.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Second, it argued that, to the extent the CO imputed Connie\u2019s past performance to Braseth, his decision to do so was legally erroneous. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mot. at 10-11, 18-19; Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 8-9. According to Braseth, imputing Connie\u2019s past performance to it placed a \u201cnegative connotation or stigma against [it];\u201d but, under FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Braseth \u201cshould not have been penalized for [its] \u2018neutral\u2019 rating due to no past performance as a \u2018new company.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 10 (\u201cThe awarding CO was unreasonable in reviewing the past performance when there was not 3 year prior relevant information.... [w]hen FAR and the solicitation states that an offeror with no relevant past performance within 3 years would be considered neither favorable nor unfavorable.\u201d); Pis.\u2019 Mot. at 11 (\u201cThe issues that were stated are stated as those of Con-nies [sic] and not of Braseth_\u201d). Braseth also took this position at oral argument. <em>See </em>Oral Argument at 7:04-15 (Nov. 19, 2015) (arguing that that Braseth \u201cdidn\u2019t have a contract ... in the last/prior three years, so it could have been a neutral [on] past performance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Finally, Braseth argued that the CO acted in a manner contrary to law when he accepted the \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating that the TPEC assigned to Connie\u2019s (and, by extension, imputed to Braseth). <em>See </em>Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 4-18; Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 8-15. In this regard, it argued (among other things) that the CO should not have relied on the TPEC members\u2019 recollections of their past experiences with Connie\u2019s, Pis.\u2019 Mot. at 4-6; Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 10; that the TPEC members\u2019 recollections of incidents involving Connie\u2019s were incorrect, Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 14-18; Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 12; and that the CO had an obligation to inquire into other possible sources of past performance information, Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 6-8; Pls.\u2019 Resp. at 10-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">B. <em>The Court\u2019s Previous Opinion and Order Remanding the Case to the Forest Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">On December 4, 2015, the Court issued an Opinion dismissing Corwin\u2019s complaint for lack of standing and remanding the ease to the Forest Service to allow it to clarify the basis for its decision as to Braseth. <em>See Braseth I </em>at 15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, the Court observed that, assuming the merits of Braseth and Corwin\u2019s legal argument that the CO should not have attributed Connie\u2019s past performance to them, the two companies would have been entitled to neutral ratings as offerors without relevant past performance. <em>Id. </em>at 12. It further explained that \u201cnothing in the record [led] the Court to believe, given the tight variance [in price], that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>substantial chance that the CO might have chosen a company with no relevant past performance over a company with an excellent past performance rating.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12 n.8. Thus, the Court concluded that \u201cboth Bra-seth and Corwin could only compete for the award that eventually went to Connie\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. And because \u201cCorwin\u2019s quote was equivalent to Braseth\u2019s in terms of past performance, and its quoted prices were higher,\u201d Corwin had no substantial chance of securing an award. <em>See id. </em>at 12-13. Accordingly, the Court dismissed Corwin\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Turning to Braseth\u2019s claims on their merits, the Cpurt found that it was not possible to determine from the record whether the CO\u2019s decision to award a contract to Connie\u2019s rather than Braseth \u201crepresented a reasonable exercise of his discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court observed that the record contained \u201ccontradictory statements\u201d about why Bra-seth received a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d past performance rating. <em>Id. </em>(noting that the CO \u201cstated both that Braseth was \u2018considered a new company without a recent record of past performance\u2019 and that there were \u2018[ijdentical concerns as Connie\u2019s \u2014 i.e., concerns about past performance.\u201d (quoting AR Tab 12 at 75)). The Court concluded that the record \u201clack[ed] sufficient clarity\u201d for it to determine the exact basis for the CO\u2019s decision to award the contract to Connie\u2019s rather than Braseth. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Accordingly, the Court remanded the case to the Forest Service to allow the CO to \u201cprovide an explanation for his exercise of discretion that is coherent and not internally inconsistent so that the Court has a basis for reviewing its reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">C. <em>The Forest Service's Decision on Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On December 11, 2015, the FS filed its remand decision. <em>See </em>EOF No. 24-1. In it, the CO clarified that, in his view, there had existed alternative rationales for awarding the contact to Connie\u2019s rather than Braseth. First, the CO described the issues that had been identified with respect to Connie\u2019s recent performance and explained that \u201cConnie\u2019s satisfactory rating was appropriate due to these recent performance concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. He then determined that \u201c[sjince Bra-seth relied on the same personnel, trucks, etc. as Connie\u2019s, it was rated equally as satisfactory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In the alternative, the CO determined that if Connie\u2019s past performance were not imputed to Braseth, then \u201cBraseth had no relevant past performance and thus was entitled only to a \u2018neutral\u2019 performance rating consistent with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv),\u201d and that \u201ca neutral evaluation would have resulted in a satisfactory rating for Braseth, because every other available adjectival rating was either favorable or unfavorable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The CO then clarified the trade-off analysis that would apply under each alternative. <em>See id. </em>Under the first alternative \u2014 in which \u201cBraseth received a satisfactory past performance rating due to its affiliation with Connie\u2019s and thus had the same performance concerns\u201d \u2014 the CO determined that the award should go to Connie\u2019s simply because Connie\u2019s offered a lower price. <em>See id. </em>Under the second alternative, the CO determined that the award should still go to Connie\u2019s because \u201cConnie\u2019s known performance and lower price would be considered more advantageous than Braseth\u2019s unknown performance and higher price.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Following the CO\u2019s remand decision, the parties filed supplemental briefs to address the impact of that decision on their pending cross-motions. <em>See </em>EOF Nos. 33-36. Accordingly, the cross-motions are now ripe for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">I. Standing in Post-Award Bid Protest Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">As described in the Court\u2019s previous Opinion, the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 bid protest jurisdiction is defined by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), which grants the Court jurisdiction to \u201crender judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to ... a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.\u201d Thus, only an \u201cinterested party\u201d has standing to invoke the Court\u2019s bid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>protest jurisdiction. <em>CGI Fed. Inc. v. United States, </em>779 F.3d 1346, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2015); <em>Myers Investigative and Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States, 275 </em>F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201c[Standing is a threshold jurisdictional issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">According to the Federal Circuit, an \u201cinterested party\u2019 under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) is \u201can actual or prospective bidder ... whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract.\u201d <em>CGI Fed., </em>779 F.3d at 1348 (quoting <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1294, 1299 (Fed.Cir.2001)); see <em>also Info. Tech. &amp; Applications Corp. v. United States, </em>316 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed.Cir.2003). In a post-award bid protest, the protester cannot demonstrate a \u201cdirect economic interest\u201d unless it had a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d of winning the award \u201cbut for the alleged error in the procurement process.\u201d <em>Tinton Falls Lodging Realty, LLC v. United States, </em>800 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2015); <em>see also Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Info. Tech., </em>316 F.3d at 1319 (observing that the protestor\u2019s- chance of securing the award \u201cmust not have been insubstantial\u201d). Put differently, the protester must have been \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the alleged error. <em>Tinton Falls, </em>800 F.3d at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">When determining whether the protester has standing, the Court \u201cmust accept the well-pled allegations of agency error to be true.\u201d <em>USfalcon, Inc. v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 436, 450 (2010) (citing <em>Info Tech, </em>316 F.3d at 1319). The protester \u201cis not required to show that but for the alleged error, the protester would have been awarded the contract.\u201d <em>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, </em>78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1996). Rather, standing exists if there was a \u201creasonable likelihood that the protester would have been awarded the contract\u201d but for the alleged error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Finally, because the existence of standing determines whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case, \u201cit is not enough that [standing existed] when [the] suit was filed.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477-78, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990). Rather, the Court must assess whether standing exists throughout the course of the litigation. <em>See id.; see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, </em>523 U.S. 83, 95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">II. Application to This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">As discussed, Braseth has standing only if it can show that \u2014 absent the errors it has alleged \u2014 it had a substantial chance of receiving a contract award. On the record before the Court when it issued its previous Opinion, the Court found that Braseth had sufficiently alleged prejudice. First, it assumed that it would have been erroneous for the CO to impute Connie\u2019s past performance to Braseth. <em>Braseth I </em>at 11-12. Next, the Court reasoned that, had Braseth\u2019s satisfactory rating been the result of a truly neutral evaluation, there was a substantial chance Braseth might have secured the award because the CO could reasonably have decided that \u201cthe risks associated with dealing with an entity with no performance record at all ... outweighed the benefits of choosing one that could be rated \u2018satisfactory5 but still had known weaknesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The CO\u2019s remand decision, however, has changed the landscape regarding Braseth\u2019s standing. It has clarified that \u2014 even if Bra-seth was correct that it would be legal error to impute to it Connie\u2019s past performance\u2014 there would still exist an alternative basis (whose lawfulness Braseth has never challenged) for awarding the contract to Connie\u2019s rather than Braseth: that \u201cConnie\u2019s known performance and lower price [are] considered more advantageous than Braseth\u2019s unknown performance and higher price.\u201d Remand Decision at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Thus, as Braseth itself acknowledged in its briefing on the cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record, if the CO did not impute Connie\u2019s past performance to it, Braseth was entitled, at most, to a neutral past performance evaluation. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 6 (arguing that Braseth \u201cshould have been rated only on \u2018neutral\u2019 past per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>formance\u201d under FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And Braseth has never before \u2014 so far as the Court can discern from its papers \u2014 challenged the lawfulness of the CO\u2019s trade-off decision, so long as it was based on the premise that Braseth\u2019s satisfactory rating reflected its lack of past performance rather than the attribution of Connie\u2019s performance to Braseth. Thus, even if the Court were to determine that the decision made under the rationale in which Connie\u2019s past performance was attributed to Braseth was erroneous, Braseth still would have no substantial chance of securing the award because the alternative rationale based on Braseth\u2019s neutral rating provides an independent basis for awarding the contract to Connie\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The contrary arguments Braseth now raises are based on new contentions that were not made when the cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record were filed, and that are therefore waived. <em>See Novosteel SA v. United States, </em>284 F.3d 1261, 1274 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Brooks Range Contract Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>101 Fed.Cl. 699, 708 (2011) (\u201cA party may waive arguments that might demonstrate that it is an interested party if they are not presented in its opening brief.\u201d). In its supplemental briefs, Braseth argues (for the first time) that, instead of receiving a neutral rating under FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), it should have received an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating; and, conversely, that the record does not support the \u201cexcellent\u201d ratings given to A-Secured and Smith Bros. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Suppl. Brief at 2-3, 7, EOF No. 33. Thus, it now argues that it (along with Connie\u2019s) had a substantial chance of securing one of the awards given to Smith Bros, and A-Secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Braseth, of course, did not advance this argument in its original motion for judgment on the administrative record; nor has it directly challenged the Court\u2019s holding to the contrary in its previous Opinion. <em>See Braseth I </em>at 12 n.8 (concluding that \u201cnothing in the record leads the Court to believe ... that there was a substantial chance that the CO might have chosen [Braseth] over a company with an excellent past performance rating\u201d). Moreover, this argument contradicts Bra-seth\u2019s concession in its original response that it would have been appropriate for Braseth to receive a neutral rating for its past performance. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 6. And it is at odds with the position it took at oral argument that Braseth \u201cdidn\u2019t have a contract ... in the last/prior three years, so it could have been a neutral [on] past performance.\u201d <em>See </em>Oral Argument at 7:04-15. Accordingly, Braseth\u2019s new arguments will not be considered by the Court and provide no basis for establishing Braseth\u2019s continued standing in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In sum, in light of the alternative rationales articulated in the CO\u2019s remand decision, the Court concludes that Braseth lacks standing to bring this protest because \u2014 even if Braseth were to succeed in its challenge to the CO\u2019s conclusion that Connie\u2019s performance should be attributed to Braseth \u2014 the alternative rationale articulated by the CO, which is based on the assignment of a neutral rating to Braseth, would remain. Braseth therefore had no substantial chance of receiving a contract award under the solicitation even if the errors alleged in its complaint and articulated in its initial motion for judgment on the administrative record were corrected. Accordingly, Braseth\u2019s complaint must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">For the reasons discussed above, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Braseth\u2019s complaint. Therefore, Braseth\u2019s complaint is hereby DISMISSED without prejudice. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-13\">. As discussed below, in the same Opinion, the Court also dismissed a companion complaint filed by Plaintiff Corwin Company, Inc. (Corwin) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-14\">. A detailed recitation of the facts relevant to this case is set forth in the Court's prior Opinion and Order remanding the case to the Forest Service. <em>See Braseth I </em>at 2-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-19\">.Although the solicitation did not specify a particular format for the submission of past performance information, it incorporated by reference FAR 52.212-1, which instructs offerors, \"[a]s a minimum,\u201d to show \"[p]ast performance information ... to 'include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information).\u201d <em>See </em>AR Tab 4 at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">. The next day, Corwin filed a nearly identical complaint, <em>see </em>Compl., No. 15-cv-844 (Aug. 7, 2015), ECF No, 1, and the Court consolidated the two cases, <em>see </em>Order, No. 15-cv-844 (Aug. 11, 2015), ECF No. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">.

As the plain language of FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) makes clear, Braseth\u2019s concession on that point was undoubtedly correct. That provision states that \"[i]n the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance ... the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn evaluating an offerror\u2019s past performance,\u201d the FAR \"affords agencies considerable discretion in deciding what data is ... relevant.\u201d <em>Seaborn Health Care, Inc. v. United States, </em>101 Fed.Cl. 42, 51 (2011); <em>see also PlanetSpace, Inc. v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 520, 539 (2010) (\"[I]t is important to note that what does or does not constitute 'relevant' past performance falls within the [CO\u2019s] considered discretion.\"). Agencies routinely select three years as the cut-off point when assessing the relevance .of past contract performance. <em>See CRAssociates, Inc. v. United States, </em>95 Fed.Cl. 357, 364 (2010); <em>Line Gov't Servs., LLC v. United States, </em>96 Fed.Cl. 672, 683 (2010); <em>Precision Images, LLC v. United States, </em>79 Fed.Cl. 598, 600-601 &amp; n. 11 (2007). And Braseth admits that it last held a contract with the FS in 2012. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6 12. Thus, there is no question that a neutral past perforar\u00ed-anee rating was an appropriate rating for Bra-seth in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">. Notably, even if Braseth had standing, its prospects for success on the merits would be dubious. As the Court observed in <em>Braseth I, </em>under the FAR, the government may \" 'evaluate] the offer- or[\u2019s] past performance\u2019 based on information . obtained not only from the offeror, but also from 'any other sources\u2019 at its disposal.\u201d <em>Braseth I </em>at 15 n.10 (quoting FAR 15.305(a)(2)(ii)). And the regulations likewise \" \u2018state that the CO \u2018should take into account\u2019 past performance information regarding 'predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement\u2019 as long as that information 'is relevant to the instant acquisition.\u2019 \" <em>Id. </em>(quoting FAR 13.305 (a)(2)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Braseth does not appear to dispute that Connie\u2019s and Braseth are related in the ways discussed by the CO \u2014 i.e., that they \"are owned by the same person, utilize the same personnel, and use each other\u2019s[] trucks interchangeably.\u201d <em>See </em>AR Tab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>12 at 69-70, And Braseth offers no concrete reason why, given those connections, it would be contrary to FAR 15.305(a)(2) to impute Connie\u2019s past performance to Braseth. <em>See </em>Pls.\u2019 Mot. at 18 (arguing only that the companies \u201care separate companies from each other and not a legal entity of the other\u201d). In fact, courts have suggested that agencies generally may not turn a blind eye to relevant past performance information in their possession. <em>See Vanguard Recovery Assistance v. United States, </em>101 Fed.Cl. 765, 780-81 (2011) (agency was \"obliged to draw upon internal information that concerned any of the [offerors\u2019] prior work, even if the offeror did not cite it\u201d); <em>Int\u2019l Res. Recovery, Inc. v. United States, </em>64 Fed.Cl. 150, 162-63 (2005) (faulting CO for falling to consider past performance information that was \"too close at hand\u2019\u2019 to ignore (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Bus.

To the extent Braseth seeks to allege that the CO\u2019s past performance evaluation has caused a stand-alone injury to its reputation, it cannot pursue such a claim under this Court's bid protest jurisdiction: that jurisdiction is limited to remedying competitive injuries suffered in the course of a procurement. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1); <em>Lion Raisins, Inc. v.
