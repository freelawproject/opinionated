(Tape City) appeals from a District Court judgment af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>firming the decision of the Bankruptcy Court. On the baseball theory of three strikes, you\u2019re out, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Borg-Warner Acceptance Corporation (Borg-Warner) in December 1979 entered into an agreement with Tape City to finance part of Tape City\u2019s inventory in its New Orleans area stores. Suppliers sold merchandise to Borg-Warner, which paid them, but they shipped directly to Tape City. Borg-Warner and the suppliers executed various security devices including an assignment of the suppliers\u2019 Louisiana vendor\u2019s privilege to Borg-Warner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with Tape City\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On June 18,1980, Tape City filed for bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq. </em>No trustee was appointed; Tape City continued in possession of its property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 28, 1980, Borg-Warner filed a complaint seeking modification of the debtor\u2019s stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It alleged that its vendor\u2019s privileges constituted a secured claim against Tape City and demanded adequate protection of its interests in the merchandise. The Bankruptcy Court held the vendor\u2019s privilege valid and ordered Tape City to furnish adequate protection. Tape City appealed, arguing that the bankruptcy proceedings should not recognize the vendor\u2019s privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">Both the Bankruptcy Court and District Court recognized that <em>In re Trahan, </em>283 F.Supp. 620 (W.D.La.1968), <em>aff\u2019d on opinion below, </em>402 F.2d 796 (5th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied </em>sub nom. <em>Bernard v. Beneficial Finance Co., </em>394 U.S. 930, 89 S.Ct. 1189, 22 L.Ed.2d 459 (1969), <em>accord, </em>in re <em>Wallace Lincoln-Mercury Co., </em>469 F.2d 396 (5th Cir. 1972), governs the instant action unless the new Bankruptcy Code, passed in the interim, establishes the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">We begin with \u00a7 545,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the successor to \u00a7 67(c). Under \u00a7 545 a trustee is \u201cclothed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>with various powers to protect the general unsecured creditors from the effect of .. . liens whose enforcement might be unfairly prejudicial to the bankruptcy estate... . None of these powers, however, permit the trustee to displace an otherwise valid statutory lien.\u201d Rubin and Rubin, <em>supra, </em>note - at 61. Section 545 grants secured creditors, those with such valid statutory liens upon the debtor\u2019s property, the right to have their claims recognized first. \u201cWhere the lien created by law is a perfected, as distinguished from an inchoate, lien, such lien remains valid.\u201d 4 <em>Collier\u2019s on Bankruptcy </em>at 545-5 (15th ed. 1981). While Louisiana law determines the nature of a vendor\u2019s privilege, the Code determines whether it constitutes a secured claim in bankruptcy. <em>Trahan, supra. </em>In Louisiana, a vendor of movable property which has not been paid has a vendor\u2019s privilege on the price of his property so long as the article remains in the possession of the original vendee. L.S.A.-C.C.Arts. 3217(7) and 3227.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That privilege is not a spurious one, as the <em>Trahan </em>court and both the Bankruptcy and District Courts here pointed out. Rather, it is a \u201cnon-consensual lien that arises solely by operation of law\u201d, a \u201cright which the nature of a debt gives to a creditor and which entitles him to be preferred over other creditors.\u201d Rubin and Rubin, <em>supra, </em>at 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">A debtor in possession in Chapter 11 Reorganization is treated like a Chapter 7 (straight bankruptcy) trustee for purposes of \u00a7 545.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cFor the purposes of testing statutory liens under this provision [\u00a7 545(2)], the trustee is thus given the status of a hypothetical bona fide purchaser and he acquires that status as of the date of the filing of the petition.\u201d 4 <em>Collier\u2019s on Bankruptcy </em>at 545-19. A bona fide purchaser may avoid the privilege, but only if physical possession of the property has passed. \u201cOnly the concurrence of <em>both </em>transfer of title and physical delivery vitiates the vendor\u2019s privilege; the privilege remains if either has not occurred.\u201d Rubin and Rubin, <em>supra, </em>at 62. Tape City argues that as a debtor in possession, it is transformed into a bona fide purchaser and may therefore avoid the vendor\u2019s privilege. <em>Trahan </em>considered and rejected a similar argument. Even if Tape City is considered a trustee who, under the legal fiction of the Code, takes as a bona fide purchaser, we cannot accept Tape City\u2019s argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the mere filing of bankruptcy somehow transfers physical possession of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\">Since the trustee cannot terminate a vendor\u2019s privilege, <em>see supra, </em>it follows that Tape City may not do so, either. The new Code effected no substantive change in this regard, so <em>Trahan </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">. The vendor\u2019s privilege arises automatically as a matter of law. Recording is not necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">.
