Hastings, son of Jonathan, who was employed by his father to assist in packing the beef, and received wages of him like a hired man, although then under age. The witness, having been released by his father, was objected to by the plaintiff, on the ground, that he was still liable to the defendant and to the plaintiff, in case of negligence on his part in packing the beef; but he was permitted to testify, subject to the opinion of the whole Court on the question of his admissibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-14\">The witness testified, that the whole operation of packing the beef was performed under the eye of his father, and according to his directions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-15\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-16\">The plaintiff moved for a new trial, on the ground that the witness was improperly admitted.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b81-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>March </em>27th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"ATJ\"><em>March </em>23d.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-2\"><em>W.

He was merely employed as an assistant to his father, to do such acts as he was directed to do, the whole, as he testifies, being done under the eye and immediate direction of his father. Without reference to the relation of these parties as father and son, but regarding the witness as an independent hired laborer, we do not perceive how he could be liable for acts thus done by the special direction of his employer. But were it otherwise, he could be responsible to nobody but his father, who employed him ; and from that responsibility, \u2018he father\u2019s release effectually discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
