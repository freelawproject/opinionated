The case of <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>15 Mass. R. 18, is decisive on this part of the case. It has been argued that the assignees ought to have been notified ; and no doubt this would have been necessary, if the rule of law in respect to negotiable securities applied to the assignments of leases ; but these assignments are governed by the well known rule, of <em>caveat emptor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In respect to the other portion of the rent claimed, it is quite clear that the defendant was bound to pay it to French, \u2022who entered under a mortgage made previously to the lease and ordered the rent to be paid to him. It is objected tho. this entry was not a good entry for condition broken, because no notice was given to the' plaintiffs. But it is immaterial whether it was a good entry for the purpose of foreclosure or not; for the entry was lawful, and the mortgagee thereby be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>came possessed of the premises, and might have expelled the defendant if he had not agreed to-pay rent to him. This was equivalent to an actual- and complete ouster or eviction, as was decided in <em>Fitchburg Manuf. Corp. </em>v. Melven, 15 Mass. R. 268, and in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>15 Pick. 147. Such an ouster or eviction by a person having a paramount title is a good de fence to an action for rent by the lessor or those claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
