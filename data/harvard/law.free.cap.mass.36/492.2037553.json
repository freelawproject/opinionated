The usual preliminary question meets us, whether this is a subject of which the Court has jurisdiction in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">As here appears to be no trust arising under any deed or will, or in the settlement of an estate, and as the suit was commenced before the Revised Statutes went into operation, the Court are of opinion, that it is not a case of trust, of which they have jurisdiction in equity, and that therefore the bill must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
