At the trial, before <em>Shaw </em>C. J., the defendants relied upon a settlement made on the 29th of October, 1833, as a defence, and produced in evidence a receipt of that date for the sum of $ 5 00, given to them by the plaintiff, in full of all demands. A similar receipt of the same date was given by the defendants to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">The plaintiff, in order to avoid the effect of this settlement, introduced evidence that the consideration of his receipt was the conveyance to him of a tract of land containing one hundred acres, in Pennsylvania, for which be was to pay the sum of $280; and that in June 1833, the defendants procured of one Holley and his wife, a deed purporting to convey to the plaintiff, in consideration of the sum of $ 250, acknowledged by the grantors to have been received by them, all their right, title and interest, in and to a tract of one hundred acres of land in Pennsylvania, designated as a tract originally entered in the name of James Moore, with covenants of seisin and warranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">It appeared that this deed was accepted by the plaintiff; and that no claim had been made by him on Holley. It was conceded that this deed was the consideration upon which the plaintiff\u2019s receipt was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">The plaintiff offered evidence to show, that there was no such land as that which the deed purported to convey, and that nothing passed thereby ; and contended, that as the terms of the warranty extended only to the grantor\u2019s right, title and interest in the land, the covenants were inoperative and afforded no remedy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-9\">There being no proof that any fraud was practised by the defendants, in the transaction, or that they knew of any defect in the title to the land, this evidence was rejected as having no tendency to prove the plaintiff\u2019s receipt t\u00f3 be void.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b282-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>Sept </em>22d.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AR_Q\">\n<em>Sept. 19th.</em>\n</p>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">The plaintiff thereupon became nonsuit, subject to the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-8\"><em>Sumner </em>and <em>Ensign, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-Jt\">cited <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>10 Mass.

And we are all of opinion, that this decision was correct. The plaintiff\u2019s only remedy, if he has any, is against Holley. And it would seem, that upon the facts reported, he would be liable to repay to the plaintiff the consideration money acknowledged by him to have been received. For although he is not liable on his covenants, he may be liable to repay the money he has received without consideration. But however this may be, it seems quite clear that the defendants are not liable for any defect of Holley\u2019s title. They procured from him, in good faith, a deed of the land, according to their agreement with the plaintiff, and paid therefor, according to the evidence, the sum of $ 250. That sum is acknowledged to have been received by Holley ; and this is good <em>prima facie </em>evidence that it was actually paid. But whether it was paid or not, we are of opinion, that the defendants are in no respect liable. In regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim on them the' maxim, <em>caveat emptor, </em>applies with great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">\n<em>Motion to set aside the nonsuit overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\"><em> Dewey </em>J. did not sit in this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
