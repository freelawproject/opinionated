C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Coffman, 38 Ill. 425.</p> <p id=\"b470-17\" pgmap=\"470(117) 471(240)\">It was held in the earlier cases in this State, that a railroad company was not liable for the want of ordinary care anil diligence in running its trains, whereby animals on its road were killed, but only for wanton, willful or gross negligence: but in the case of the Ill. Central Railroad Co. v. Middlesworth, 46 Ill. 494, this doctrine was reviewed and modified, and it was there said by Chief Justice Breese in the opinion of the court, that \u201c much reflection has satisfied us the doctrine of these cases (C. M. T. R. R. Co. v. Rockefellow, 17 Ill. 541; G. W. R. R. Co. v. Thompson, Ib. 131; Ill. Cent. R. R. Co. v. Reedy, Ib. 580; C. &amp; M. R. R. Co. v. Patchin, 16 Ill. 198) is liable to severe and just criticism, and is not in harmony with the great maxim of the common law, so long reverenced, and so consonant with the instincts of our nature, . and that is, \u2018 so use your own property and exercise your rights as not to inflict injury upon another.\u2019 The idea is not tolerable, that an injury may be inflicted which, by ordinary care and diligence, could have been avoided.\u201d Since this case it has been the settled law of this State, and constantly followed, that a railway company in running its trains is liable for stock killed upon its track, which results from want of ordinary care and diligence, and it is not necessary that such killing should be wanton or willfully done by its servants. R. R. I. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v. Lewis, 58 Ill. 49; R. R. I. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v. Irish, 72 Ill. 404; Same v. Rafferty, 73 Ill. 59. These cases also hold that when animals are standing on the track of the road, and can be seen by its employes by the use of ordinary care, it is their duty, if the same can be done without danger, to slacken the speed or stop the train if necessary, to avoid injuring them.</p> <p id=\"AKb\" pgmap=\"471\">From the facts stated in the demurrer the animals injured were on the track in plain view of the engine driver and fireman, and did not leave .the track when the whistle was repeatedly and sharply sounded, and no good reason appears why the train could not, without danger to it, have been checked \u25a0 or stopped and the accident thereby avoided.</p> <p id=\"AQI\" pgmap=\"471\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p> <p id=\"AYu\" pgmap=\"471\">Beversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
