That it is situated on twenty-five feet of the track of appellant, and was placed there after the road of appellant was constructed and being operated. The evidence shows that the roof was burned on the 3d day of June, A. D. 1881. That there is a considerable grade at that place (Alton, Illinois) on appellant\u2019s road, and it is usual to have the switch engine help freight trains up the grade. The evidence further shows that the sparks esr caped either from the engine drawing a freight train, or from the switch engine, while aiding the train up the grade. The freight train was of the usual size. The evidence shows that the engineers in charge of each of these engines are and were skillful, prudent, and competent engineers, and that they handled their engines carefully, prudently, and skillfully at the time of the accident.

In the court below the jury awarded appellee $150 damages. A remittitur as to the sum of forty dollars was entered by appellee and judgment was entered against appellant for the snm of $110 and costs. We have carefully examined the evidence in this cause and are satisfied that the motion fora new trial should have been allowed. The testimony shows, beyond any doubt, that the engine in question was properly equipped with the best and most approved known inventions to prevent the escape of fire sparks and that it was properly and skillfully handled by a competent, careful and skillful engineer. In such case, when no negligence of any bind is shown on the part of appellant, there can be no recovery. C. &amp; A. R. R. Co. v. Quaintance, 58 Ill. 389; Harmon v. T. P. &amp; W. R. R.
