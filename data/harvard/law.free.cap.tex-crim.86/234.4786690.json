The majority opinion of this court has held this law valid in Ex parte Davis, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 168 and Ex parte Fulton, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 149 recently decided. I gave my reasons for believing otherwise, which are of record. It is unnecessary for me to write further on that subject, and in obedience to the opinion of the majority the judgment herein will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
