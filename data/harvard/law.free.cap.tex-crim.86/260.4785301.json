From the standpoint of the State, the evidence disclosed that the alleged injured party was engaged in working upon a public road, and that the appellants ordered him to desist and threatened to injure him if he failed; and that at the time one of them had in his possession a large rock, and the other had a stick. While only a few steps from the injured party they approached him with the rock and stick drawn in a striking attitude and using threatening language, in consequence of which the alleged injured party did desist from the work he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">The record suggests no question for review save the sufficiency of the evidence, and this, we think, must be determined against the appellants. The statute, article 1008, Penal Code, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-15\">\u201cAny attempt to commit a battery, or any threatening gesture showing in itself or by words accompanying it an immediate intention coupled with ability to commit a battery, is an assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">.The evidence shows an offense under this statute. See Higginbotham v. State, 23 Texas, 574; Johnson v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 306; McKay v. State, 44 Texas, 48; Bodeman v. State, 40 S. W. Rep., 981; Brister v. State, 40 Texas, 505; Yawn v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
