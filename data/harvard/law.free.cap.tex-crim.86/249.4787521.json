He was then asked by appellant\u2019s counsel to state, and affirmatively answered, if he had not been before the grand jury and there interrogated in regard to this same matter, and if he had not there stated, under oath, that he had not bought whiskey from appellant, or that he did not remember having bought the same, and after making such statement, if he was not then sent to jail by the grand jury and there -kept until the afterr noon of the same day; and then, when brought back before said body, if he did not then for the first time state that he had bought said whiskey from the appellant. The county attorney moved the court to strike out said evidence, and to instruct the jury not to consider the same, which was done over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">In this same connection, as appears from the other bill of exception, said witness was asked if he \u2022 did not state to said grand jury, when he was first before them, that he did 0not buy any whiskey from appellant, or that he did not then state that he did not remember having bought any whiskey from appellant, and if lie did not then refuse to admit that he had bought said whiskey until he had been confined in the county jail; all of which questions would have been answered by the witness in the affirmative, but for the objections thereto. It seems that .the objection to this testimony was based on the ground that a witness could not be asked to state what occurred in the- grand jury room; and that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>not be impeached by proof of what did there transpire. This was error, and a timely exception having been reserved thereto, it is such error as necessitates the reversal of this case. The contrary doctrine to that adhered to by the trial court has oftener been held by us.\u2014Wisdom v. State, 61 S. W. Rep., 926; Gibson v. State, 77 S. W. Rep., 812; Galegos v. State, 85 S. W. Rep., 1150; Addison v. State, 85 Texas Crim. Rep., 181, 211 S. W. Rep., 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">For the errors indicated, the judgment of the trial court must b\u00ae reversed and the cause remanded, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
