The trial was before the court, a jury having been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">Appellant made a motion to quash the complaint and information, the overruling of which is assigned as error. We believe, under the decisions heretofore rendered by this Court, the motion was well taken. It was held in the case of King v. State, 74 S. W. Rep., 773, that the indictment should allege (1) a legal petition for the election; (2) an order by the Commissioners\u2019 Court .for the election (3) the order by the county jiidge, declaring the result of the election as provided by law, and (4) a proclamation, by publication or otherwise, for thirty days, of the result of the election. See, also Hill v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 79, 124 S. W. Rep., 940. None of these allegations appear in the pleadings in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">We are further of the opinion that the petition for the election, which is in the record, does not measure up to the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>our statute, and that all proceedings had thereunder were invalid. By the terms of Article 7211, Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes, it is made imperative that a petition for a stock law election in a subdivision of a county \u20181 shall particularly describe such subdivision, and designate the boundaries thereof.\u201d This provision has been held mandatory both by this Court and our Supreme Court. Ex parte Gulledge, 57 Tex. Crim. Rep., 156; Ry. Co. v. Tolbert, 101 S. W. Rep., 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Referring to the petition for the election in the instant case, we note that in describing said alleged subdivision, its beginning call is as follows: \u201cBeginning at a point on the west boundary line of Franklin County; the N. W. corner of <em>General Stock Laiv District; </em>thence east with the N. B. line <em>General Stock Law </em>to where same connects with,\u201d etc. We know of no possible construction which could make of this a legally sufficient call for the beginning of a boundary line for a sub-division so attempted to be set. off and described under the terms' of said statute. We have no recognized or known quantity of land or amount of territory which may be classified or described as \u201cGeneral Stock Law District,\u201d nor is the same, any natural object or political line known to this Court; and hence, it must follow that such beginning call, and any subsequent boundary call referring to a general stock law district, would, in our view, be insufficient. We hold the election without any legal petition which would vitiate each step in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The judgment of the trial court will be reversed, and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
