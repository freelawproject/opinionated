There is abundant proof of enmity between the two men; threats of each against the other were in evidence, and many witnesses testified to strongly abusive language used by deceased concerning appellant, much of which is shown to have been communicated to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The immediate circumstances antecedent to the homicide, make it appear that one Downing and appellant, as claimed by the State, were out on the Sunday night preceding the killing on Wednesday, in a pasture or meadow, with a woman named Lottie Carpenter, who had been staying at the county farm, and with whom, if the State\u2019s testimony is believed, appellant indulged in reprehensible conduct on said occasion. The county farm was supervised by Henry Blackwell, Jr., commonly called \u201cLittle Henry Blackwell.\u201d Deceased went by the name of Happy McWilliams, and it appears that the Carpenter woman was red-headed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Immediately after the occasion of being out with the. woman, testified to by the witness Downing, it began to be talked in the town of Canton that the constable was out at night with a red-headed woman. Several witnesses swore that the deceased made this statement to them. Romey Mathis testified that on the morning of the killing, deceased told him that they had caught old Bob (meaning appellant) out with a woman, \u201cand he wanted me to tell everybody I saw. . . . He said he wanted to do everything except advertise it in the newspaper, and for me to tell everybody I saw in Canton. I believe he called him a \u2018son of a b\u2014! . . . When Bob (deceased) rode through town, Warren said \u201cThere goes a damned son of a h\u2014 or something like that; have heard him whistle at him and curse him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Andrew Haynes testified that on the morning of the killing he met deceased in the meat market, and deceased asked him if he had heard the latest, and witness replied, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Deceased said, \u201cW? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>have got our constable into it. \u2019' Witness asked him what it was, and deceased replied that they had him tangled up with a red-headed woman, and the witness stated to deceased that he had better be careful, but deceased said they had the right man; that Henry Blackwell had just told him, and he further stated that he would advertise it in the newspaper if he could; that he was going to keep on advertising the transaction between Bob and the woman just as far as he could. There is much more of the same sort of testimony in the record, but the above illustrates the attitude of deceased toward appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">It was proven by the State that appellant had said that if deceased ever started at him he was going to shoot him; and that appellant said a short time before the fatal difficulty, that if deceased didn\u2019t quit talking about him he was going to shoot him. The sheriff of the county testified that deceased was about twenty-eight years old and weighed over two hundred pounds; that appellant was fifty years old, and weighed about one hundred and thirty pounds; that on one occasion he heard appellant say that if deceased did not quit fooling with him he was going to shoot part of his anatomy off. Other witnesses testified that he told them that he was going to shoot deceased if he didn\u2019t let him alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Getting down'to the immediate cause of the killing, Cyrus Walker swore that on that day appellant came to him and asked him who it was that had been telling it around that he had been out with that woman. Witness said: \u201cI told him that was all right, and he said, \u201cwho told you?\u201d and I said, \u2018Little Henry Blackwell told the guy that told me;\u2019 and he put his hand in his pocket and said: \u2018By God, tell me!\u2019 I said \u2018Warren McWilliams told me.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">It further appears from the testimony of other witnesses that appellat made search for Henry Blackwell, but failed to find him, and then went in search of deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The killing occurred in a restaurant. The proprietor, who was an eyewitness, stated that deceased had come into his place of business, ordered food, and was eating, when appellant walked in and approached deceased, and said, \u201cHap, who says I was out with a woman Sunday night?\u201d and Warren said, \u201cLittle Henry Blackwell\u201d\u20141 believe that\u2019s what he said\u2014and Bob Parker said, \u201cWhoever says it is a damned liar and a son of a b\u2014\u2019 and Warren said \u2018Little Henry Blackwell told me about it,\u2019 and I think Bob repeated what he had said and Warren said \u2018You don\u2019t want to be coming at me with that, and said \u2018Little Henry Blackwell, told me and I\u2019m just repeating what he said; you tell him that and he will whip you,\u2019 and Bob said, \u2018That\u2019s more than you or any one else will do\u2019 and by that time Warren got up and something was said about \u2019phoning Henry Blackwell ; Warren said something about \u2018well, \u2019phone little Henry Blackwell ; \u2019 \u201d when Warren said that, I believe he had sat down again and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Bob had started out the door and he came back and said, \u2018Who told Henry Blackwell this?\u201d and Warren said \u201cHe saw you, I guess; he said he did\u201d and Bob said, \u201cWell, he is a damned lying son of a b\u2014,\u201d and Warren said, \u201cHe would whip you if you would tell him that,\u201d and Bob says, \u201cThat\u2019s more than you or anybody else in this town can do;\u201d then they spoke of \u2019phoning little Henry Blackwell\u2014I don\u2019t just know what was said\u2014and Warren told him if he would take the gun off he would show him; said he didn\u2019t know but what he could do it anyhow. Bob ivas, at that time, on the east side of the east corner; he was back a little southeast of the north counter; he was right here (indicating with pencil); Bob was sorter southeast of the east end of the north counter\u2014about two feet southeast; in the meantime, Warren was standing up and was walking up toward the front north counter; he was walking north and facing north. Yes, Bob was sorter east of him; he was east of him part of the time. When Warren jumped up on the north counter, it was just like a man would jump over it, this way (Witness jumps upon table and shows the jury the position of Warren McWilliams on the north count\u00e9r); and Bob was standing back this way (indicating) kinder east, maybe southeast. Parker fired two shots and it seems like Warren was in the position as indicated when- the first shot was fired, the shots were fired as fast as a gun can shoot; after the shots were fired, Warren McWilliams \u201cslid\u201d off the counter to the north and went out the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The witness Dubose, who was in the restaurant, and an eyewitness, testified as follows: \u201cBob Parker asked if he had told that he was out with a woman the night before; before Bob Parker asked that, Warren had not said anything to him. Warren replied that he had told it, and Bob asked him who had told him and he told Bob that Little Henry Blackwell had told him, and Bob then said that any one who said that he was out with a woman was a \u2018damned lying son of a b\u2014\u2019; McWilliams got up and said \u2018You don\u2019t mean to call me that, do you?\u2019 In the meantime, I had gone around the west end of the west counter and the north end of the north counter and was standing near Bob; it was \u2018kinder\u2019 agreed that they should go and telephone Henry if there was any doubt about it; McWilliams suggested \u2019phoning\u2014said that if he (Bob) didn\u2019t believe him to go and \u2019phone Henry; McWilliams was standing up there\u2014or perhaps he had sat down; I don\u2019t really know whether he was standing up or sitting on the stool, he was near the stool. When I came around there, it seemed they were going to have some trouble and I told Bob I wouldn\u2019t do that; I caught him by the right hand, he had his right hand about half-way in his pocket and I saw a pistol; Warren was standing on the west side; I don\u2019t know whether Warren could see the pistol or not; it could have been that he could not have seen it on account of Bob not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>having it far enough out of Ms pocket. I just saw it like that (indicating.) Parker told me to go and \u2019tend to my own business and I turned and walked to the door. It seems that they agreed on calling Little Henry Blackwell up and seeing about it; I thought it was all over with and Bob followed me to the east end of the north counter and I walked out almost to the north door; Bob stopped there; I don\u2019t remember who said the first word after Bob stopped; I do remember that something was said about going and \u2019phoning to Henry, and Bob said \u2018Well, if Henry Blackwell said that or anybody else\u2014if anybody said it\u2014they are a damned lying son-of-a-b\u2014\u2019 and Warren told him that he had better not tell Little Henry Blackwell or anybody else could do, and by that time McWilliams had walked to the south side of the north counter and was standing with his hands on the counter while they were talking and when Bob Parker told him \u201cthat\u2019s more than you or anybody else can do,\u201d Warren said if he would lay that gun off he would show him, or if he didn\u2019t have a gun, or something like that; and he said that he didn\u2019t know but what he could do it anyhow, or something to that effect. Bob was at that time about five feet, I suppose, from Warren McWilliams. Warren got up on the south side of the north counter facing north; he was facing north when the shot was fired; both of Warren\u2019s hands were on the counter; his feet were west and his hands east; he did not have anything in his hands; Warren was in that position when both shots were fired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The trial court charged on provoking the difficulty, which charge was excepted to and here complained of. No exception was taken to the manner and form of said charge, the only complaint being that there was no evidence authorizing the same. We cannot sustain this objection. It plainly appears from the evidence just quoted that appellant went armed to where deceased was, and repeatedly applied to the persons who had told of his being out with a woman the most insulting epithets known to the Anglo Saxon\u2014and this after deceased had stated that he was the one who had told it. After appellant had repeated this epithet, and use other language and gestures, deceased started over the counter toward appellant, who thereupon shot him twice. Whether in fact the things said and done \"by appellant on that occasion were for the purpose of provoking such an attack, and using the same as a pretext for the killing\u2014were questions for the jury under appropriate instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We see nothing in the bills of exception to the testimony of Fred Covert that he smelled whisky on appellant\u2019s breath on the day of the homicide. The ground of the objection, as stated, is, that same was immaterial, irrelevant, and highly inflammatory to appellant. This presents nothing by which we may be informed that injury resulted. For aught shown in the bill, the evidence might have been very material, pertinent, and advantageous to the appellant. A bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>of exceptions must not only state the ground of objection, but must go further and contain such matter as will make apparent the injury claimed, from the recitals of the bill itself. What we have just stated applies to appellant\u2019s bill of exceptions No. 4, to the testimony of John Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\">The State was permitted, over objection, to show that the woman with whom appellant was supposed to have been out on the night in question, was not present at the trial, and to place in evidence the application of the State for process for said woman, issued to Van Zandt County, and also to Dallas County, and the return of the officer on said process, showing that said witness could not be found. No effort was made to connect appellant' with the failure of-said witness to appear. The introduction of this evidence was erroneous, as was held by this Court in Funk v. State, 85 Texas Crim. Rep., 527, 208 S. W. Rep., 508, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We think the evidence of the witness Downing, showing in fact that appellant was out with the woman, on the Sunday night preceding the killing, their conduct with each other that night, was admissible, as shedding light on the frame of mind of appellant at the time of the commission of the homicide. Inasmuch as this ease must be reversed for other errors, we observe that appellant should have been allowed to ask the witness Downing as to his friendship toward deceased, and their relations to each other, and any other questions fairly calculated to elicit matter which might throw light' on the motive of the witness for testifying. It was a sharply contested issue as to whether or not appellant was in fact out with the woman on said date, and Downing was the only witness who testified to such fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The conversation of said witness Downing with Joe Lawler, out of the presence and hearing of appellant, should not have been admitted. That appellant asked a question of said witness Downing, which might have elicited said matters, but which question was withdrawn before the same was answered, was no reason for permitting the State to bring out such hearsay testimony over objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The evidence of Henry Blackwell, Jr., was properly admitted, to the effect that he and others went down into Mrs. Smith\u2019s pasture and there saw the tracks of men and women, cigar stubs, etc. This is corroborative of the State\u2019s claim that appellant was at said place with the woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The evidence of the witness Slaughter to the effect that a short time before the homicide he saw and heard deceased point through a door and say \u2018 \u2018 There goes a man I am going to shoot a hole through, I will put his light out,\u201d was admissible, and should have been received. The fact that no name was used by the deceased could only affect the weight of the testimony; the witness said that when deceased made the statement, he looked through the door, and saw no one except the appellant. If the surrounding circumstances reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ably indicated that appellant was the subject of the remark of the deceased, the jury were entitled to have the benefit of the statement for what it was worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The other errors complained of will likely not occur on another trial, and we will not discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">For the errors pointed out, the cause is reversed and remanded for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
