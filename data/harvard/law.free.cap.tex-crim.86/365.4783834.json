State, this day reversed and remanded. The questions presented in the two cases are, in the main, the same, and in regard to those questions, discussed by Judge Lattimore in the Hubert Cotton case, reference is here made.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">There is this difference with reference to the charges. In the Hubert Cotton case the court limited the jury, in his charge on manslaughter, to the consideration of the acts and conduct of the deceased, omitting the acts and conduct of the brother of deceased, and a special charge was asked by the defendant curing that mistake in the charge, which was refused. This has been discussed in the opinion by Judge Lattimore, and the court\u2019s charge there was held erroneous, and the charge requested by appellant should have been given. The charge in this case does submit, as a part of the adequate cause, the acts and conduct of the brother as well as the deceased. It is not the intention here to discuss that phase o\u00a3 the case at any length, or the difference between the charges in the two cases. We are of opinion that the Hubert Cotton ease decides the question correctly and should be followed by the trial court in his charge on manslaughter in this ease upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
