He testified over objection that Felix Girard had sold him whisky at appellant\u2019s place of business. It is not shown that appellant was present when such sale was made, nor that he authorized or knew of the same \u00bf nor is this the sale upon which the prosecution is predicated. The evidence was very damaging to appellant, and in our opinion, the objection to the same should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The motion for rehearing is granted, the judgment of affirmance set aside, and the cause is reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\"><em>Reversed and </em>remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
