The evidence, however, is not before us, nor are there any bills of exception. There were special charges requested, but the record fails to show whether they were given or not. In that attitude of the record the legal presumption is they were given. In the condition of this record we are unable to revise the evidence or say that it was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">The judgment, therefore, will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
