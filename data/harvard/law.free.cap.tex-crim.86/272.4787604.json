These facts, if believed by the jury, would constitute such a striking as to amount to an assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The slightest degree of force, would be such battery. Donaldson v. State, 10 Tex. Crim. App., 307; Ware v. State, 24 Tex Crim. App., 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Taking hold of a woman without her consent, and in such a way as to cause in her a sense of shame, or a disagreeable emotion of the mind is sufficient, under our statute, to constitute an assault.\u2014Art. 1009, Vernon\u2019s Penal Code, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The name of the injured party was alleged to be <em>Matoska. </em>Her husband said he always spelled it <em>Matosky. </em>We think the names <em>idem </em>sonans.\u2014Dickson v.
