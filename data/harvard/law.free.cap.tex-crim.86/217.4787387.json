The evidence is sufficient to prove the appellant\u2019s guilt. There are no bills of exceptions or complaints of the court\u2019s charge or refusal of special charges presented in a manner authorizing consideration. One dissatisfied with the rulings of the court in the receiptj.or rejection of evidence must, to obtain review, bring the matter before this court in a bill of exceptions, certified in the manner provid\u00e9d by law. This is not effected by complaining of the court\u2019s ruling qn such matters in motion for new trial. Sessions v. State, 81 Texas Grim. Rep., 424. To authorize the consideration of objections to the charge or the refusal of special charges, the record must disclose thdt the requirements of the statute, Articles 735, 737, 737a, 743, Code of Criminal Procedure, were fulfilled. Objections to the charge and special charges refused cannot be considered on appeal when there is a failure in the record to show that they were presented to .and acted upon by the court as required by the provisions mentioned. See Vernon\u2019s Texas Grim. Statutes, vol. 2, p. 526, notes 64 and 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">There is a suggestion in the motion for a new trial that there was a failure to prove venue. There is no indication that an issue was made on the subject on the trial of the case, in the absence of which Article 938, C. C. P., provides that on appeal proof of venue shall be presumed. See Vernon\u2019s Texas Crim. Statutes, vol. 2, p. 897. The examination of the statement of facts, however, in the instant case discloses that there was sufficient proof that the offense was committed in Medina County where the prosecution was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In the motion for new trial the complaint is also made that appellant\u2019s name is incorrectly stated or spelled in the indictment. No point appears to have been made upon this subject until the motion \u25a0for a new trial was filed, at which time under our statute, Article 559, Code of Criminal Procedure, the point had been waived. That statute says that at the tim\u00e9 of arraignment \u201cunless the appellant or his counsel suggests that the indictment is not in his true name, it shall be taken that his name is truly set forth, and he shall not thereafter be allowed to deny the same by way of defense.\u201d See other articles upon the same subject, Vernon\u2019s Texas Criminal Statutes, vol. 2, p. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Failing to find any error in the record, the judgment of the lower court is ordered affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
