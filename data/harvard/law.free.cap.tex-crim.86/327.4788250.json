The judgment recites that a jury was waived, and appellant found guilty of being a delinquent child.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">A motion for a new trial was made and overruled, and the case, as brought here, presents but one point, to wit: that the complaint filed against appellant shows him to be guilty of a felony, and that in a felony case a jury cannot be waived. Under our statutes, a charge against one of being a delinquent child, is not a felony, and a jury can be waived. This identical question was before this Court in the companion ease of Allen Lee v. The State, decided at a former day of this term adversely to the contention of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">No error appearing in the record, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">\n<em>Affirmed^</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
