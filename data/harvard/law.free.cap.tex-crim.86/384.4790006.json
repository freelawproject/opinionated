If it be claimed that appellant\u2019s mind is of such character as to render him legally insane, such matter could be inquired into after, as well as before, trial, and upon an adjudication of such question in a lunacy proceeding, appellant could be sent to an institution for the insane and not to the penitentiary. We make this obserAvation, stating, however, that the matter is not presented in the record in such way as to show any error in the action of the trial court in overruling the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">There are other facts stated in the motion for a new trial, AArhich we cannot consider. Said motion was not signed or sworn to, nor the facts therein stated in such a way as would make their truth a question to be considered either by the trial court or this court. No reason or excuse is shown why there is no statement of facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">The indictment and charge of the court are sufficient, and no error appearing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
