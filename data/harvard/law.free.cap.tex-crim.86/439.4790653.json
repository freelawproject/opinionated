C. Lucas, and the prosecutrix, antedating, prior to, and beyond the period of limitation of the act alleged to have been committed on the date set forth in the indictment, indicating their intention by the following questions, directed to Elsie Allen Nelson, the prosecutrix, who was a witness on the stand at the time:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">\u2018On or about the 19th day of November, 1918, or within a year prior thereto, tell the jury what were the relations between you and the defendant, J. C. Lucas. \u2019 To which counsel for the defendant, J. C. Lucas, objected and continued -to renew his objections each time such evidence was sought to be introduced as appears from the statement in the statement of facts, assigning as the grounds for his objections the following reasons: that the matter sought to be introduced was not at a date mentioned in the indictment; that it was an attempt to prove a separate, independent and distinct offense from the one on trial; that it was no part of the <em>res gestae; </em>no part of any system shown to have been used by the defendant; nor was it an attempt to identify him, but that it was an attempt to prejudice him before the jury by showing a course of events which would necessarily have the effect of injuring his reputation before the jury, and the Court overruled said objections, to which the defendant, through his counsel, excepted to said ruling and herewith tenders his Bill of Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ceptions, and asks that the same be signed and made a pari. o\u00a3 the record in said cause, which is accordingly done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">It is manifest that this bill is not sufficient. There is no statement therein of what the witness testified in answer to the quesh:: set forth. The question is not obieetienable on its face, and <em>fa </em>the absence of a showing in the hill itself, that a witness gave an objectionable answer, the bill will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The motion for a new trial complains of the insufficiency of the evidence to corroborate the prosecutrix, the ground of said complaint being that she is an accomplice and \u2022 not corroborated. The prosecutrix testified fully to facts showing the guilt of accused, and under numerous holdings of this Court, is not an accomplice. Hamilton v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 372; Danley v. State, 71 S. W. R., 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">No complaint is made to us of the charge of the court, nor of any matter with regard to the introduction of evidence, except as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">There being no error in the record, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">December 17, 1919.</p>\n<author id=\"b469-12\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aol\">\u2014The appellant has filed a formal motion for rehearing, without citation of authorities, or reasons stated why same should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">We are unable to find error in the original opinion of this Court, and the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">\n<em>Overuled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
