These cannot within the limits of an opinion be followed in detail. All of them are referable to the scope and limits of the police power of the State. This power has been the subject of much comment by text writers and judges, so much that it would be futile to attempt its review. No more satisfactory statement of it has been found than that made by Justice Williams of the Supreme Court of this State in the opinion in H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. v. Dallas, 98 Texas, 396, from which we quote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\">\u201cThe power is not an arbitrary one, but has its limitations. It is commensurate with, but does not exceed the duty to provide for the real needs of the people in their health, safety, comfort and convenience, as consistently as may be with private property rights. As those needs are extensive, various and indefinite, the power to deal with them is likewise broad, indefinite and impracticable of precise definition or limitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Courts have not undertaken to catalogue the subjects upon which the police power may operate, nor to define in precise terms the measures that may be lawfully taken, but are guided by previous decisions and pass upon particular cases as they arise, and determine whether they fall within or without the proper limits. See Hudson v. McCarter, 209 U. S. 349; Chicago v. R. R., 53, Am. St. Rep., 557; State v. Harrington, 34 L. R. A., 100; Ives v. South Buffalo Ry. Co., Ann. Cas., 1912-B, p. 156; Stone v.

From 22 Cyc., 1471, we quote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201cThe taking of interest, or as it was then called, \u2018usury,\u2019 was looked upon in early times with great disfavor; and actually prohibited, not only by the Mosaic law among the Jews, but also under severe penalties by the old English Laws. \u2022 The church uttered its anathema and the State leveled its forfeitures, against the taking of any interest, great or small. But notwithstanding the denunciations and punishments to which it was subjected, it could not be suppressed, and it was finally, in 1545, sanctioned in England by 37 Henry VIII, chapter 9.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The right to lend <em>money </em>at interest is a creature of statute, not an inherent right, and in our Constitution there is a limitation of the right prohibiting contracts for interest exceeding ten per cent per annum. Many restrictions and regulations with reference to lending money and touching the security that may be taken therefor will be found in the banking laws of the United States and' the several States. Laws identical in purpose and similar in detail to that involved in this appeal have been passed by more than thirty of the States of the Union and in the District of Columbia,. So far as we have examined the authorities they have, except in the case of Massie v. Cessna, 239 111., 352, been sustained. People v. Stokes, 118 N. W. Rep., 87; Mutual Loan Co. v.

Puder, Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, decided April, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In the case of People v. Stokes, 118 N. W. Rep., 87, that of Massie v. Cessna, 239 Ill., 352, is distinguished, and in Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Massachusetts and the Supreme Court of the United States, 222 U. S., 231 Law Ed. Vol. 56, p. 178, refused to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The States having similar laws are as follows: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Penn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>sylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The major portion of them require a bond as a condition precedent for the pursuit of the business and other regulations varying in terms, but not different in substance from those in our statute. The law on the subject enacted by Congress for the District of Columbia varies from ours in no essential particular, and contains the criticised requirement that an agent upon whom service of process may be made shall be appointed, requires a bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, and is more restrictive than the Texas statute in that it requires the bond shall be made by a surety company. U. S. Statute at Large, Vol. 37, <em>post </em>1, p. 657. In amount of bond and other provisions this statute is not unlike that in many of the other states. The classification of occupations for the purpose of police regulation, based upon the character of surety company. U. S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 37, <em>post </em>1, p. 657. 218 U. S., 562, 54 L. Ed., 1151, and the principle recognized in the dcisions construing our Constitution, Art. 8, Sec. 2. See Fahey v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 146; Texas v. Stephens, 100 Texas, 628; Craddock v. Express Co., 125 S. W. Rep., 59; Fahey v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The case of Owens v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 105, is relied on by appellant as sustaining his contention throughout. The decision condemned the statute concerning the pursuit of the business of procuring and purchasing assignments of wages. Its terms were a manifest discrimination in excepting from its operation persons of the same class as others who were affected by its restrictions. We think it was also correctly determined therein that the statute was an unauthorized and unreasonable exercise of the police power. By fixing the license tax at five thousand dollars annually, to be collected by the State, and two thousand and five hundred dollars additional by the county, it manifestly prohibited the pursuit of the business at which it was directed. The right to license and regulate an occupation which may under such restrictions be conducted in a manner not harmful to the public, does not include the right to prohibit its pursuit. Tiedeman on Lim. Police Power, Sec. 102; Freund on Police Power, Secs. 492, 494, 498; Hirshfeld v. City of Dallas, 15 S. W. Rep., 124; 8 Cyc., 886; 38 Am. Rep., 689; Millican v. Weatherford, 54 Texas, 388; Commonwealth v. Atlantic Coast Ry., 7 L. R. A. (U. S.), 1086; State v. Phelp, 35 L. R. A. (U. S.), 353. The restrictions upon the wage earner and the purchaser were unreasonable in that they put a prohibitive tax upon the purchaser, and made one subject to the tax who took as many as three assignments of wages. The distinction between that case and this one is obvious. Here the license tax is $150 a year. The obligation in the bond is contingent and not absolute. It creates no liability against one who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pursues the occupation in accordance with the law. It regulates but does not prohibit the business. A bond in substance such as that required by this statute was required by the State of Michigan as a condition precedent to engaging in the business of pawn broker. A pawn broker\u2019s occupation is lending money upon personal property pledged. That of a loan broker, under our statute, is lending money upon personal property mortgaged and upon wages assigned. The principles applicable in the control of pawn brokers by similar' statutes are obviously applicable to those in the instant case. The Supreme' Court of\" Michigan, in a pawn broker\u2019s case, held the bond, which was for five thousand dollars,\u2014 very like that in our statute,\u2014valid, and the law not obnoxious to the various constitutional provisions urged. See Grand Rapids v. Braudy, 32 L. R. A., 116, and note. Our statutes regulate pawn brokers in a manner quite similar to the statutes here in question. See Title 102, Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes. The validity of these regulations has been recognized by this court in Heitzelman v. State, 26 S. W. Rep., 729. Other cases upon the subject will be found in 30 Cyc., 1165; Solomon v. Denver, 55 Pac. Rep., 199; Butt v. Paltrovich, 104 Am. St. Rep., 698; Elsner v. Hawkins, Ann. Cas., 1913-D, p. 1278, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The pawn brokers statute embraces practically the same elements that are the basis of complaint against the loan brokers\u2019 statute and render the right to regulate and furnish an example of an approved method therefor. In street traffic regulations in this and other States the requirement of a bond of indemnity against violations has been held not unreasonable. See Ex parte Cardnell, 150 Pac. Rep., 348, L. R. A., 1915-B, p. 850; Memphis v. State, L. R. A. 1916-B, p. 158; Willis v. State, 182 S. W. Rep., 275; Lablank v. New Orleans, 70 So. Rep., 212; Dickey v. Davis, L. R. A. 1915-F, p. 41; Greene v. City of San Antonio, 178 S. W. Rep., 6; Ex parte Parr, 82 Texas Crim. Rep., 525, and other Texas cases there listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">A provision permitting revocation of licenses has often been held not unreasonable. 53 Am. Rep., 620; 26 L. R. A. (N. S.), 686; Lane v. Chappell, 159 S. W. Rep., 905; Fisher v. State, 194 U. S., 361; 48 L. Ed., 1018; Davis v. Mass., 167 U. S., 43, 42 L. Ed., 31; Kissinger v. Hay, 113 S. W. Rep., 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The United States Supreme Court has held that as a condition precedent for a license to do business, a foreign corporation may be required to designate an agent within the State upon whom process may be served, and that such requirement may be applied to an individual stockholder who is a non-resident. Wilson v. Seligman, 144 U. S.; 339, 36 L. Ed., 42. \u2022 It would seem a fair analogy that the State having authority to prescribe regulations as a condition, precedent to the pursuit of a given avocation, would have the right to include as a part of the regulation the requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>an agent upon whom process might be served, be designated as a condition precedent to the issuance of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Concerning the police power of the State and the relation of the courts to its exercise, we take the following quotation from the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in Mugler v. Kansas City, 123 U. S., 623, 31 L. Ed., 210:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u201cIt does not at all follow that every statute enacted ostensibly for the promotion of these ends is to be accepted as a legitimate exertion of the police power of the State. There are, of necessity, limits beyond which legislation cannot rightfully go. While every possible presumption is to be indulged in favor of the validity of a statute, Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U. S., 718 (25:501), the courts must obey the Constitution rather than the law-making department of government, and must, upon their own responsibility, determine whether, in any particular case, these limits have been passed. \u2018To what purpose/ it was said in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U. S., 1 Cranch, 137, 167 (2:60, 70), \u2018are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom -they are imposed, and if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation. \u2019 The courts are not bound by mere forms, nor are they to be misled by mere pretenses. They are at liberty\u2014indeed, are under a solemn duty\u2014to look at the substance of things, whenever they enter upon the inquiry whether the Legislature has transcended the limits of its authority. If, therefore, a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is a palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law, it is the duty of the courts to so adjudge, and thereby give effect to the Constitution. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cNo one may rightfully do that which the law-making power, upon reasonable grounds, declares to be prejudicial to the general welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">\u201cThis conclusion is unavoidable, unless the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution takes from the states of the Union those powers of police that were reserved at the time the original Constitution was adopted. But this court has declared, upon full consideration, in Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U. S., 31 (28:924) that the Fourteenth Amendment had no such effect. After observing, among other things, that that amendment forbade the arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty, and the arbitrary spoliation of property, and secured equal protection to all under like circumstances, in respect as well to their personal and civil rights as to their acquisition and enjoyment of property, the court saids \u2018But neither the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ment\u2014broad and comprehensive as it is\u2014nor any other amendment was designed to interfere with the power of the State, sometimes termed its police power, to prescribe regulations to promote the health, peace, morals, education, and good order of the' people, and to legislate so as to increase the industries of the State, develope its resources, and add to its wealth and prosperity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">Numerous cases applying the principles herein announced to particular statutes will be found in Ruling Case Law, Vol. 6, p. 240, note 20, p. 241, notes 1, 2 and 3; p. 243, note 13. Having no precise limits defined in advance, the unrestrained exercise of the police power would endanger constitutional government. It being an essential and useful attribute of government, the courts can no more arbitrarily deny its proper exercise than they can tolerate its arbitrary application.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The statutes regulating loan brokers are founded on the idea that there exists a real basis for the classification adopted, and that in the conduct of the business of lending money on mortgages on household effects and assignment of wages there are abuses both on the part of the lender and the borrower, which require restrictions in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Giving scope to the presumption in favor of the validity of laws, having regard for the numerous instances in which the lawmaking power of the State and Nation have found it expedient to enact laws with the same object as that under consideration, observing that the courts in numerous instances have upheld these laws as a legitimate and proper exercise of the police power of the State, we regard ourselves unauthorized to declare that the Legislature of this State was inhibited by the State or Federal Constitution from enbracing the subject within its police regulations, or that the conditions existing did not furnish occasion therefor, or that the provisions of the Act are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The fact that the record discloses that the appellant has not been able to make the bond required cannot, in view of the finding of the trial court against him, nor in view of the general application of similar laws throughout the country as pointed out above, be taken as conclusive that the requirement is unreasonable. Similar bonds have been held reasonable requirements; statutes demanding them have been enforced for years. The object of the demand is primarily to furnish assurance that the individual who seeks the license is of a type that will conduct the business permitted in a legal, manner, and secondarily, to furnish indemnity to those injured by his failure to do so. This court upheld the same statute in the case of Ex parte Hutsell, 78 Texas Crim. Rep., 589. The opinion was not unanimous, though there was no dissenting opinion written. There has been development of the subject since that time, and in view of the dissent of the Presiding Judge, for whose opinion the writer has great respect, the subject has been gone into with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>as great detail as practicable, with the result that our conclusion is that the law is not shown invalid, and that the judgment entered should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b99-6\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AOv\">That the Legislature may regulate \u201cloan brokers\u201d is not questioned. But I cannot concur in sustaining this Act of that body.

We have no doubt that the business of the appellant is one whose regulation is within the police power of the State, and that reasonable restriction thereof may be provided by the Legislature; but under our Constitution such restriction may not be such as to make it impossible to conduct a legitimate business, or to arbitrarily deprive a citizen engaged in such business, of his right to that equal protection under our laws which is guaranteed by our Bill of Rights, nor take from him his right to the due course and process of law, which is also guaranteed him by our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Giving particular attention to the language and requirements of Chapter 28, Acts of the Regular Session of the Thirty-fourth Legislature, which contains the law on this subject, we concede that the requirement of a bond as a prerequisite to engaging in business as a loan broker, is proper, provided the amount and conditions of such bond be not improper. Nor would it be unreasonable for such a law to require an artificial person, such as a coporation, to appoint an agent or attorney-in-fact, upon whom service of legal process may be had, though we are unaware of any law in this State-making such provision in the case of a domestic corporation, in case of any other corporation than that described in this Act. In our opinion, however, to single out the loan broker, and to define him as one who lends money upon personal securities, who takes assignments of wages, and chattel mortgages upon houshold goods, and to then require him to give a bond for $5000, made renewable every year, and conditioned that he will faithfully comply with each and every requirment of the law governing such business, and pay any judgment which may be obtained against him, as is provided in Sections 2 and 3 of the Act under consideration; and then to further write in Section 7 of said Act, as a part of \u201cThe law governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>such business, \u2019 \u2019 that such private. citizen shall file with the county clerk of each county where he does business, a written, irrevocable power of attorney, naming the county judge of such county as his duly authorized agent, and attorney-in-fact, for the purpose of accepting service for him or it, or being served with citation in any suit brought against him or it, in any court of this State, <em>\u201cand consenting that the service of any civil process upon such county judge as his or its attorney for such purpose in any suit or proceeding, shall be taken and held to be valid, waiving all claim and right to object to such service, or to any error by reason of such </em>service,\u201d is to attempt to place such obligation in said bond as to make it unreasonable and discriminatory. No citzen of this State can be compelled to relinquish or waive his right to his day m court as a condition to engaging in any lawful business. Nor will a law requiring a bond seeking to impose such condition, be upheld by us. We are not surprised that the bonding companies and solvent citizens, as is disclosed by this record, refused to make for appellant the bond required by this Act. Under its conditions, and-the terms of this law, the county judge might accept service, or be served with citation, in a suit against appellant in the most-remote county in the State, and in a lawsuit wholly foreign to the loan-brokerage business, and in such ease, even without knowledge on the part of appellant of said suit, or service, or accepted service, a judgment might be rendered against him and his bondsmen for any amount, and even though the service be defective, erroneous, and illegal, appellant and his sureties would be powerless, for by the express provisions of the law, such written appointment of the county judge as his attorney-in-fact, must contain appellant\u2019s consent to such service, and his waiver of any right to object to any error therein. Notwithstanding the fact that as to the ordinary citizen, erroneous and defective service renders the judgment either void or voidable, as the case may appear, for some reason effort is here made to take from the man engaged in the business of loan broker such right, and he is thus penalized and denied the right of equal protection of the law, and deprived of his property and privileges without due course of law. There is no provision in this law requiring the county judge to notify, or in any other way acquaint the loan broker with the fact that he has accepted service or been served with citation in any suit against him, whicn fact may result from the consideration that it would do the loan broker no good, inasmuch as he could not take any steps to release himself by reason of any defect in the citation. It might be very questionable, if necessary to a decision of this case, as to whether the county judge could in any event be compelled to act as such agent or attorney-in-fact, or put himself to any trouble by reason there.-_ of, or take any action with regard thereto. Such function \u00cdA* nowhere prescribed in our Constitution and laws as a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>duty of the county judge. This, however, is aside from the decision of the questions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Not only do the conditions of the law above mentioned appear unreasonable and discriminatory, but it is further provided in Section 9 of said Act, that any judgment obtained against a loan broker under the articles of this Act, <em>or under the laws of Texas, </em>shall be collectible out of the bond provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">It thus appears that the bond and sureties would not only be held for the acts of appellant while actually engaged in the line of his business as a loan broker^ but also for any other sum for which he might be liable under the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">It does not appear to us to be necessary to discuss this act any further. There is grave doubt in our minds as to whether or nor the individual citizen of this State, who is given the right under reasonable and wise provisions of law, to be served with citation, and thereby have knowledge brought home to him of a pending suit in this State, can be compelled, if he engage in a particular line of business, to relinquish that right of personal service. We know of no law or authority in this State holding that he may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">We are not permitted to concern ourselves with the question as to whether the loan broker is necessary and useful in a community, to meet the wants of those who lack ability to measure up to the financial standing required by the bankers, nor as to whether the loan shark is an evil that should be effectively banished from our midst. Evils must be met and abolished or minimized, according to the wisdom of our Legislature, but within the limits fixed by our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Believing that those provisions of this law which fix the conditions of the bond, and require a waiver of the loan broker\u2019s right to object to defective service, and permit the payment of other judgments out of the bond, deny a citizen equal protection, and seek to deprive him of his property and privileges without due course of law, we hold said Act in violation of our Constitution. The case of ex parte Hutsell, 78 Tex. Crim. Rep. 589, holding this law constitutional, is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The motion for rehearing is granted, and the cause is reversed and ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\"><em>Reversed and </em>dismissed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
