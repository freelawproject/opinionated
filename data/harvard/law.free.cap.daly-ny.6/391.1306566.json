Bixbee, 1 wholly unsatisfied,\u2019 and also one against his person, \u2018not found,\u2019the judgment debt being wholly unpaid, they, in January, 1874, commenced an action against Bloss and Mott, the bail, by service of a summons upon Bloss, but before service-on Mott, he died. No further proceedings were had in that action, as Bloss was shortly afterward declared a bankrupt, and has, since the commencement of this action, been discharged in bankruptcy from his debts.

The undertaking of bail is clearly upon a new consideration, and its parties are in law principal debtors. Bail is a unique office or relation, and unlike in its nature that of a party to any other undertaking prescribed by the Code, 1. Certain \u25a0classes of persons capable of entering into other contracts, are incapacitated from serving as bail (15 Johns. 535 ; 4 Bosw. 632 ; attorneys\u2019 partners and clerks, 2 B. &amp; P. 504; turnkeys and jailors, 2 B. &amp; P. 150 ; persons indemnified by defendant\u2019s attorneys, 1 Bing. 64). 2. The powers and authority given bail are exceptional. They keep the person bailed in their custody, \u25a0or can take his body even on Sunday; can break the door to reachhim, and can take him in another State. They can delegate their rights to another <em>(Nicolls </em>v. <em>Ingersoll, </em>7 Johns. 145 ; <em>Boardman </em>v. Fowler, Col. <em>&amp; </em>Cai. Cas. 111; s. c. 1 Johns. 413). The executor or administrator of bail has all the rights of surrender possessed by the bail while living- (Crocker on Sheriffs, \u00a7 137). 3. The death or imprisonment of the person bailed frees them from all liability, while they can at any time rid themselves of responsibility if so inclined. The rules of construction applied by the courts to other undertakings, therefore, do not apply, as of course, to the undertaking of bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-11\">II. The bail of the Code is the special bail of the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>practice <em>(Steward </em>v. Howard, 15 Barb. 26). The courts apply all the rules of limitation, qualification, &amp;c., of the old practice, to the bail under the Code, showing thus that they recognize the identity. Special bail were held severally liable, whether the bail piece contained words of severalty or not. \u201c The creditor may proceed against both, or one \u201d <em>(Steward </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>1 Hall, 40; Petersdorff on Bail, 10 Law Library, *223 ; <em>Kibbe </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>Coleman <em>&amp; </em>Caines\u2019 Cases, 56 ; 1 Tidd\u2019s Practice, 282, 8th ed. 1824; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Bradberry, </em>3 Dowl. 92; 3 Chitty\u2019s Practice, 365; <em>In re </em>Taylor, 7 Howard Pr. 212).</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">III. This is not an undertaking by mere sureties, and should not be so construed. 1. The very name given to the office, implies that it is more than that of a mere surety. <em>\u201c </em>Bail,\u201d says Lord Coke, \u201c-is derived from the French name c Bail,\u2019 a keeper or jailor \u201d (4 Inst. 178). <em>\u201c </em>A man bailed, is where any one arrested or in prison is delivered to others as his bail, who ought to keep him to be ready to appear at the time assigned \u201d (Comyn Dig. tit. \u201c Bail,\u201d A). The releasing of prisoners on mere security was once allowed, the prisoner giving \u201c sureties ; \u201d this was not called bail, but <em>mainprize, </em>and has been long abolished (Wood\u2019s Inst. 610). The verb used in law to denote the act of bail, in fulfilling the terms of their undertaking, is suggestive. They <em>\u201c surrender </em>\u201d the debtor. The prisoner, from the custody of the sheriff, is transferred to that of his bail, who hold him thenceforth, as the law expresses it, \u201c on a, string.\u201d They undertake to keep him safely, and produce him promptly, or pay the penalty (see <em>Appleby </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>44 Barb. 316). 2. The undertaking is an original, not a collateral contract, and its parties must therefore be deemed principals (Chitty on Contracts, 450-452, 9th Am. ed.). The release of the defendant from the custody of the sheriff, and the delivery of him to the bail, is the consideration\u2014a new consideration, arising at the time of making, and out of the contract, and by the bail themselves. \u201c Although the debt of another form the subject-matter of defendant\u2019s undertaking, still if he promised to pay the debt on some new consideration raised by himself,\u201d then the promise is original (Chitty on Cont. 452; <em>Slingerland </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>7 Johns. 463; <em>Skelton </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>8 Johns. 376 ; <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Phil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>lips, </em>10 Johns. 412; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Newland, </em>13 Wend. 114; <em>Farlee v. Oleaveland, </em>4 Cowen, 439). 3. The law recognizes this distinction, in the plenary power given to bail. They are to produce the debtor at the call of the court, and for that reason they have the power given them to do so. Not only can they do this in response to final process, but at any time, in any stage of the action, they can surrender, satisfy the requirements of their contract, and discharge themselves from liability. Had \u201c sureties \u201d possessed such powers\u2014been made the custodians of the security of the creditor, with right to give it up at any moment and free themselves\u2014having their remedy thus in their own hands, they would never have become the \u201cfavorites of the courts of equity.\u201d \u201c Bail \u201d are distinguished from \u201c sureties,\u201d by the legislature of both Great Britain and our own country (49 George III, chap. 121; 1 Tidd\u2019s Pr. 3d Am. ed. 209). See also Code of Procedure, wherein the word \u201c surety\u201d is used in connection with every undertaking prescribed by it, except the undertaking of bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">IV. If the undertaking is not a joint contract of mere sureties, plaintiffs should recover <em>(Ex parte Kendall, </em>17 Vesey, 514, 525 ; Redfield on Law of Wills, Part II, p. 277; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Trustees, </em>2 Denio, 577; <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Genung, </em>5 Paige, 254; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>16 Barb. 33; <em>De Agreda </em>v. <em>Mantel, </em>1 Abb. Pr. 130).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-6\"><em>Henry E.

Halt, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AjM\">There is undoubtedly a difference between an undertaking given to discharge from an arrest and one given upon an appeal from a judgment. One is a substitute for the former bail to the sheriff and special bail <em>(In re Taylor, </em>7 How. Pr. 212; <em>Steward </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>15 Barb. 26), and the other is the substitute for the former bail in error (Graham\u2019s Pr. 948; 2 Dunlap Pr. 1138 ; 2 Rev. Stat. 595, \u00a7\u00a7 25 to 35), and there were many things which were applicable to the former, that did not apply to the latter ; such as the right of special bail to discharge themselves by surrendering their principal, or the right of one alone to do so, although the other was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>fixed, having been separately sued; the suit against whom went on even after the principal was in custody, upon a surrender by the one who had not been sued <em>(Ballard </em>v. Kibbe, Col. &amp; C. Cases, 56), and there were other distinctions. But these distinctions in no way affect the liability of a party upon a <em>joint </em>obligation or undertaking, and what was decided by this court in <em>Tanneribaum </em>v. <em>Cristalar </em>(5 Daly, 141), and by the Court of Appeals in the recent case of <em>Wood </em>v. Fislc, which were undertakings upon appeal, apply equally to an undertaking upon an arrest, where it is joint and not several.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The appellant states in his points, that special bail were held severally liable, whether the bail piece contained words of severalty or not. He refers to no case for such a proposition, and would find none, for special bail were severally and jointly liable from the nature of their undertaking by the common law, which was very different from a bond or from an undertaking under the Code. Special bail, or more properly bail to the action, or bail alone, was put in by a bail piece, signed by the bail, which was entitled in the court and of the term, which simply declared that A. B. was delivered to bail, on the taking of his body to C. D. and E. F., at the suit of G-. H., in a plea of trespass, &amp;c. The bail then went before the judge, who said to them orally, you <em>jointly </em>and <em>severally </em>undertake that if A. B. shall be condemned in this action, he will pay the costs and the amount adjudged against him, or render himself into custody. Are you content ? and upon their expressing their acquiescence, the bail piece was filed and an entry made of the recognizance (Caines\u2019 Pr. 60, 61; 1 Dunlap Pr. 174; 1 Tidd, 250; 2 Id. 1083, 9th Lond. ed.; Petersdorf on Bail, 289, 290). The effect of this procedure in all cases, was that of a joint and several undertaking, without anything appearing to that effect tip on the bail piece, and an action upon this recognizance might always be brought against the bail jointly or separately <em>(Steward </em>v. Patten, 1 Hall, 40; <em>Ballard </em>v. Kibbe, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Code simply provides that the defendant when arrested, may give bail by causing a written undertaking to be executed by <em>two </em>or more sufficient bail. As I said before, this was meant to be a substitute, both for bail to the sheriff and bail to the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>tion, and by analogy to the former practice, the undertaking should have been joint and several. But it was not. It was an undertaking by which the bail only bound themselves jointly, and this being the case I do not see upon what authority, or by what construction, we can hold that they bound themselves severally as well as jointly. In Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone (p. 375), after the remark that the condition of an obligation is always taken most in the advantage of the obligor and against the obligee, it is said, <em>\u201c </em>If two, three or more bind themselves in an obligation thus, <em>\u00f3bligamas </em>nos, and say <em>no more, </em>the obligation is and shall be taken to be joint only and not several.\u201d Such is the case here. The language of the undertaking is <em>We, </em>J. Oscar Bixbee, Benj. G. Bloss and Jordan Mott, hereby undertake, &amp;c., which is a joint and not a several undertaking by any one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">It is conceded that if the obligors were not severally as well as jointly bound, that this action could not be maintained against the executor of Jordan Mott. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the question, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Joseph F. Daly and Yah Hoeseh, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> The judgment here was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, on Feb. 22, 1878.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
