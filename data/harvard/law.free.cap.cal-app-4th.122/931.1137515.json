Their father, plaintiff and appellant Albert Hughes, Sr., sued Albert Jr. and Allen for defamation, claiming the statements were false. A jury found that the Hughes brothers did not make defamatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">On appeal, Albert Sr. raises numerous claims of error, including error in the special verdict, insufficiency of the evidence, errors in the jury instructions, and errors in rulings on discovery motions and motions in limine. In the published portion of this opinion, we discuss Albert Sr.\u2019s contention that the statement, \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp,\u201d connotes a present, rather than a past, fact, and therefore Albert Jr., in order to establish truth as a defense, had to prove his father was acting as a pimp at the time the allegedly defamatory statement was made. Albert Sr. claims that the evidence of alleged pimping activity years earlier was irrelevant and was insufficient to support the defense of truth and that the jury should have been instructed that the defense of truth could only be established by evidence that he was engaging in pimping activity at the time the statements were made. We hold that the evidence of past activity was relevant and sufficient to establish a defense of truth and that the trial court did not err in not giving such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we discuss Albert Sr.\u2019s other contentions on appeal, as to which we hold that there was either no error or that Albert Sr. has forfeited or abandoned the issues. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">\n<em>Albert Sr. \u2019s statements to the Hughes brothers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Albert Sr. married Aida in 1970, and Albert Jr. and Allen were bom in April 1972. Albert Sr. and Aida divorced in approximately 1976, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Hughes brothers lived primarily with their mother, although they did stay with or visit their father at times.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">According to the Hughes brothers, their father told them he was a pimp.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They said Albert Sr. told them in 1985 he was a pimp from about 1978 to 1981. They testified that in a second conversation in 1987 during a trip to Detroit, their father had a \u201cheart to heart,\u201d \u201ccoming clean\u201d conversation with them in which he \u201copened up to us about his life, and ... he explained to us the truth. He told us that he was a pimp at one time.\u201d Albert Sr. told the Hughes brothers that Cherry Morton, Toni, and Sherry, women the Hughes brothers knew during their childhood, were prostitutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Other family members, including the Hughes brothers\u2019 half sister, their uncles, and a cousin told Allen his father was a pimp. Terrance Morton, Albert Sr.\u2019s son with Cherry Morton, also testified his father was a pimp. Albert Sr. denied he was a pimp.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\n<em>The statements in Vanity Fair and USA Today</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The Hughes brothers began directing music videos professionally when they were 19 years old. They eventually became motion picture producers. In connection with an upcoming motion picture, Veronica Webb, a friend of the Hughes brothers, told them she wanted to interview them. During a telephone conversation with her, Albert Jr. said that a producer stole an idea from him and his brother and that when the Hughes brothers tried to contact the producer, the producer threatened to have them investigated. They told their agent to tell the producer \u201cto put the private investigator on us. We have nothing to fear. Our life is an open book. My father was a pimp and my mother is a lesbian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Vanity Fair published Ms. Webb\u2019s article in October 2001. The article contained the following quote: \u201c \u2018We wanted to send a message that we\u2019re not hood filmmakers. We can do other films,\u2019 says Allen. \u2018Our mother is a lesbian. Our dad\u2019s a pimp,\u2019 says Albert. They both agree: \u2018We\u2019re interested in the underclass.\u2019 \u201d In addition to the Vanity Fair article, an article in USA Today quoted Allen as saying his father \u201cdabbled in the pimptorial arts.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Allen admitted making the statement in 1995. He said that although he made it \u201cin jest,\" it was true. The USA Today article was not produced at trial, and a purported computer copy of it was not admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">\n<em>The lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Albert Sr. filed a complaint for defamation against the Hughes brothers and Conde Nast.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By special verdict, the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cDid defendant Albert Hughes make a defamatory statement about the plaintiff?\u201d The jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the identical question as to Allen Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Plaintiff moved for a new trial on the grounds the evidence was undisputed that the Hughes brothers made the defamatory statements to the media, the evidence in support of the verdict was insufficient, the judgment was inconsistent with the special verdict, the trial court incorrectly answered a jury question, and jury confusion resulted from the instructions and special verdict form. The motion was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Albert Sr.\u2019s opening brief consists of 101 separately numbered paragraphs each containing one or more claimed errors. The paragraphs are grouped under five headings: Special Verdict Unsupported By Concession; No Evidence of Pimping; Unfair Trial; Defective Jury Instructions; and Injunctive Relief. We address plaintiff\u2019s various claims of error, which, as discussed below, have largely been forfeited or abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">I.-IV.B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">C. <em>Statement of past fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">The parties agree the statement, \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp,\u201d if false, would be defamatory. Plaintiff, Albert Sr., denies he ever told the Hughes brothers he had engaged in pimping activities, but asserts that even if he had, evidence of his past activities could not be used to support the truth of the statement in question. He says there is no evidence that he <em>is </em>a pimp. He raises this point by arguing that the evidence of his alleged statement to the Hughes brothers about conduct decades earlier (a) was inadmissible as remote and irrelevant, (b) could not support a determination of truth of the statement \u201cOur dad\u2019s a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>pimp,\u201d and (c) required the trial court to instruct the jury that \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp\u201d refers to a present, rather than past, fact. The record does not reflect that plaintiff requested such an instruction or objected to the evidence he now states is irrelevant, and therefore he forfeited his claims of error as to the instruction and admission of evidence. Nevertheless, because each of plaintiff\u2019s arguments referred to in this section relates to the issue of whether the evidence of past pimping activity can establish the truth of the statement \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp,\u201d we discuss that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\u201cDefamation is effected by either of the following: [][] (a) Libel, [f] (b) Slander.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 44.) To constitute libel or slander, the published statement must be false. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 45, 46.) To establish the defense of truth\u2014i.e., that the statement is not false\u2014defendants do not have to prove the \u201cliteral truth\u201d of the statement at issue. <em>(Emde v. San Joaquin County Central Labor Council </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 146, 160 [143 P.2d 20].)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[S]o long as the imputation is substantially true so as to justify the \u2018gist\u2019 or \u2018sting\u2019 of the remark\u201d the truth defense is established. (Ibid.; see also <em>Campanelli v. Regents of University of California </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 572, 582 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 891]; see 1 Sack on Defamation: Libel, Slander and Related Problems (3d ed. 2004) \u00a7 3.7, pp. 3-16-3-21; Smolla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5:14-5:17, pp. 5-19 to 5-24.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The United States Supreme Court said, \u201cThe common law of libel takes but one approach to the question of falsity, regardless of the form of the communication. [Citations.] It overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth. As in other jurisdictions, California law permits the defense of substantial truth and would absolve a defendant even if [he or] she cannot \u2018justify every word of the alleged defamatory matter; it is sufficient if the substance of the charge be proved true, irrespective of slight inaccuracy in the details.\u2019 [Citations.] . . . Minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as \u2018the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified.\u2019 [Citations.] Put another way, the statement is not considered false unless it \u2018would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Masson </em>v. <em>New Yorker Magazine </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 496, 516-517 [115 L.Ed.2d 447, 111 S.Ct. 2419].)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Whether a statement is true or substantially true may depend upon how the statement is understood. So long as the statement \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp\u201d can reasonably be understood to mean that plaintiff had at one time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>engaged in pimping activity, it was for the jury to determine if that is how the statement should be understood. (See <em>Maidman </em>v. <em>Jewish Publications, Inc. </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 643, 651 [7 Cal.Rptr. 617, 355 P.2d 265] [if a statement can reasonably have been understood to make a defamatory charge-\u2014-a legal issue\u2014\u201cit is for the trier of fact to determine if the readers did so understand it\u201d]; <em>Kahn v. Bower </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1599, 1608 [284 Cal.Rptr. 244]; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 614.) Also, the issue of whether a statement is true or substantially true is normally considered to be a factual one. <em>(Shumate </em>v. <em>Johnson Publishing Co. </em>(1956) 139 Cal.App.2d 121, 132 [293 P.2d 531]; <em>D.A.R.E. America </em>v. <em>Rolling Stone Magazine </em>(C.D.Cal. 2000) 101 F.Supp.2d 1270, 1288; <em>Maheu </em>v. <em>Hughes Tool Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 569 F.2d 459, 465; <em>Lundell Manufacturing Company </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Companies </em>(8th Cir. 1996) 98 F.3d 351, 358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Here, the jury, in finding the statement \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp\u201d not to be defamatory, may have understood the statement to mean that plaintiff had engaged in such activities in the past or that the statement is substantially true as a result of the past activities. The communication \u201c[o]ur dad\u2019s a pimp\u201d could reasonably be understood as meaning that he had at one time engaged in that activity. And a fact finder could reasonably conclude that the \u201cgist or sting\u201d of the remark does not necessarily depend on when the plaintiff was a pimp. For example, if one had engaged in criminal acts in the past, that might support the assertion that the person is a criminal. There is support for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">For example, the Restatement Second of Torts states in section 581 A, comment c, as follows: \u201cIf the defamatory statement is a specific allegation of the commission of a particular crime, the statement is true if the plaintiff did commit that crime. If the accusation is general and implies the commission of unspecified misconduct of a particular type, the statement is true if the plaintiff committed any misconduct of that type. Thus a charge that another is an embezzler is true if he committed a single act of embezzlement. However, if the charge is one of persistent misconduct, the committing of a single instance of that conduct is not enough unless the instance is such as to imply its repetition. Thus, a charge that a woman is a prostitute is not made true by the committing of a single act of unchastity.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] A statement may be a characterization of the person about whom it is made that expresses the maker\u2019s unfavorable judgment upon undisclosed conduct of the other. If this unfavorable comment implies the existence of facts that justify the terms in which he has described the person of whom he spoke, it is the truth of these facts that is to be determined. (See \u00a7 566.)\u201d (See Smolla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5:22, pp. 5-33 to 534; see also Murnaghan, <em>Ave Defamation, Atque Vale Libel and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number><em>Slander </em>(1976) 6 Balt. L.Rev. 28, 40 [\u201cconsider the case of a plaintiff objecting to the defendant\u2019s accusation that the plaintiff is a thief. It is well established that, although the charge is general, proof of a single instance of larceny will establish the truth thereof\u2019].)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><em>Guccione v. Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 1986) 800 F.2d 298 (Guccione) dealt with the issue of whether, in a defamation action, past conduct of a plaintiff can establish the truth of a statement about the plaintiff that is expressed in the present tense. Although the facts in <em>Guccione </em>are different than those here, the discussion in that case is not incompatible with our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In <em>Guccione, supra, </em>800 F.2d 298, a publisher published an article that included the language, \u201c \u2018Considering he is married and also has a live-in girlfriend ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 299.) In fact, Guccione had divorced his wife four years before the article was published. The plaintiff, a rival publisher, contended that \u201cbecause the statement was phrased in the present tense it accused him of committing adultery at the very time the statement was printed\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 301), and therefore it was false because he was divorced at the time the statement was made. The court said there was no evidence from which the statement \u201cmay fairly be read to mean that the marriage and the cohabitation existed simultaneously <em>only </em>at a moment or brief interval just prior to the article\u2019s publication. The statement can be read to mean only that the marriage and the cohabitation existed simultaneously throughout an undefined span of time that included the period immediately prior to publication.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 302.) The court concluded, \u201cOn this reading, the undisputed facts established the defense of substantial truth as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The court in <em>Guccione, supra, </em>800 F.2d at pages 303-304, stated, \u201cThis is not to suggest that every person guilty of even a single episode of marital infidelity has no recourse if, years after the fact, he is accused in print of currently committing adultery. However, the undisputed facts of this case\u2014 the extremely long duration of Guccione\u2019s adulterous conduct, which he made no attempt to conceal from the general public, and the relatively short period of time since his divorce\u2014make it fair to say that calling Guccione an \u2018adulterer\u2019 in 1983 was substantially true. Of course, \u2018former long-time adulterer\u2019 would have been more precise. But on the facts of this case, to require such a level of accuracy is unreasonable. The article labels Guccione an adulterer. The average reader would understand that term to include a man who unabashedly committed adultery for thirteen of the last seventeen years and whose adulterous behavior ended only because his wife ultimately divorced him. Where, as here, \u2018the truth is so near to the facts as published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>that fine and shaded distinctions must be drawn and words pressed out of their ordinary usage to sustain a charge of libel, no legal harm has been done.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In the instant case, the proximity of the conduct to the publication is farther than in <em>Guccione, supra, </em>800 F.2d 298. Nevertheless, the discussion in <em>Guccione </em>suggests the court recognized that a statement that one is an adulterer does not have to be read as referring to the person\u2019s conduct at the time of publication and that the past adulterous conduct can make the statement substantially true. Also, the court suggested that how to read the statement was a question of fact, although in that case, the court said that the evidence was such that the only fair reading of the statement could be determined as a matter of law. In the instant case, how distant and how pervasive the pimping activities were are factors for the fact finder to consider on the question of whether the imputation was substantially true as to justify the \u201cgist or sting\u201d of the remark.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Because the past activities can support a conclusion that the statement in question is substantially true, evidence of those activities was relevant and admissible, and the trial court did not err by not instructing the jury that the statement, \u201cOur dad\u2019s a pimp,\u201d refers to a present fact. Although disputed, there was substantial evidence that plaintiff had engaged in pimping. There being substantial evidence of that disputed fact, the jury verdict must be affirmed. (See <em>Khawar v. Globe Internat., Inc. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 254, 264 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 178, 965 P.2d 696].)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">V.-VII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The judgment is affirmed.
