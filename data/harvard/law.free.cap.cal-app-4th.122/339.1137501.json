The writers, who are over the age of 40 and members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), assert that each of the networks and studios has for many years maintained a systemwide policy or practice of age discrimination. The talent agencies, which represent writers seeking television writing opportunities, are alleged to be well aware of the pattern or practice of age discrimination by the employers, and to engage in a pattern or practice of discrimination of their own by refusing to represent and refer older writers to the networks and studios for writing opportunities, instead referring their younger clients. Some of the writers allege they applied and were rejected for television writing employment by the employers, or for representation by the talent agencies. Many more writers allege they were deterred from seeking television writing employment, or representation by the talent agencies for the purpose of obtaining television writing opportunities, as a result of each employer\u2019s and talent agency\u2019s discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">These lawsuits come to us with a significant history. Many of the same writers (51 of them, or about one-third) first sought relief in federal court, filing a single class action lawsuit against all of the networks, studios and talent agencies. The federal suit resulted in an order dismissing several of the writers\u2019 claims with prejudice, and dismissing other claims without prejudice and with leave to amend. <em>(Wynn v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2002) 234 F.Supp.2d 1067 <em>(Wynn).) </em>After the federal court\u2019s ruling, the writers voluntarily dismissed all remaining causes of action without prejudice. They, along with more than 100 other writers, then filed the 23 lawsuits that are now, after demurrer rulings by the trial court, the subject of two sets of appeals and two successive writ petitions, all of which we are considering concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>We summarize our principal conclusions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">1. Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), provides that a Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) action may not be filed or maintained as a class action where the persons claiming to be aggrieved \u201chave filed a civil class action in the federal courts alleging a comparable claim of employment discrimination\u201d against the same defendants. We construe this provision to proscribe concurrent, not successive, class actions, and conclude it does not bar the writers who filed and dismissed claims in <em>Wynn </em>from filing a FEHA class action in state court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">2. The claims of \u201cdeterred applicants\u201d\u2014writers who did not apply for television writing opportunities or agency representation during the limitations period, allegedly because of a long-standing and long-known policy of discrimination against older writers\u2014are not barred by FEHA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">3. The writers have properly alleged classwide claims of a pattern or practice of age discrimination in violation of FEHA, and are not required to plead facts supporting individual prima facie cases of discriminatory refusal to hire as a predicate for their classwide claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">4. Claims asserted by \u201cdeterred applicants\u201d of a classwide pattern or practice of discrimination may not be dismissed at the pleading stage on the ground that statistics alleged in the federal complaint in Wynn\u2014e.g., that writers over 40 comprised one-third or more of the writing staffs of most employers in 1997/1998\u2014were inconsistent with viable deterred applicant claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">5. The writers did not waive appellate review of their FEHA or Unruh Civil Rights Act class claims by declining to assert individual FEHA claims or refusing to amend their Unruh Civil Rights Act class claims in their second amended complaints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">6. The writers\u2019 first amended complaints sufficiently pled a classwide claim against the talent agencies for aiding and abetting violations of FEHA by the employers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">7. Allegations that the talent agencies systematically refuse to represent older writers seeking television writing opportunities are cognizable under the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">8. Amendments to FEHA effective on January 1, 2003, adding age to the bases of discrimination constituting unlawful employment practices by employment agencies, do not apply retroactively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>9. The trial court erred in ruling that the writers must allege potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception in order to state a claim under the unfair competition law. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">10. The trial court correctly concluded it has no authority under the unfair competition law to effectuate an injunctive decree through an award of classwide backpay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">These 23 class action lawsuits were filed after the dismissal of a class action age discrimination lawsuit filed by some of the same plaintiffs against all of the same defendants in federal court. <em>(Wynn, supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067.) We begin by providing background information on the hiring process for television writers and the writers\u2019 claims in this litigation. Since the details of the <em>Wynn </em>case are pertinent to some of the issues in the appeals and writ petitions before us, we summarize that lawsuit and its results. We then turn to a description of the 23 lawsuits filed in the superior court; the trial court\u2019s January 16, 2003 rulings in those actions; the ensuing \u201cdeath knell\u201d appeals, writ petitions and motion to dismiss the appeals; the trial court\u2019s August 14, 2003 rulings; and the subsequent writ petition and death knell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">1. <em>Background information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The hiring process for television writers is similar throughout the television industry, but quite different from the ordinary job application process. Television writing opportunities are not publicly advertised, and resum\u00e9s or scripts are not accepted from the general public. Instead, networks or studios communicate the availability of television writing opportunities in WGA publications, through talent agents and by word of mouth. A writer generally seeks a television writing opportunity by submitting a script through a talent agency, or by obtaining an interview or \u201cpitch meeting\u201d with a television hiring official through personal connections. In the usual case, the writer procures an agent, who submits a script or information about the writer\u2019s background and writing history to a studio or network hiring official. The hiring official, alone or with others, rejects or hires the applicant for a particular show or project. In some cases, licensing agreements for the show or project also require the approval of the writer by the other party to the licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">In this litigation, the writers allege that the networks and studios have a youth-oriented corporate culture that indiscriminately favors youth over age and experience. Desiring to attract younger viewing audiences in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>generate higher advertising revenues, the networks and studios seek out and hire younger writers to the exclusion of older writers. The networks and studios invidiously stereotype older writers as unable to write television programming that will attract the desired demographic audience, or as lacking the vitality necessary to meet the demands of modem television writing. The writers allege the networks and studios have engaged in a pattern and practice of intentional age discrimination for many years, and they cite several public statements by employees and agents of various studios and networks as evidence of the employers\u2019 desire to hire younger writers to the exclusion of older writers. The talent agencies, the writers assert, are well aware of the employers\u2019 pattern and practice of age discrimination, and have a financial incentive to discriminate themselves by refusing to represent and refer older writers to the employers, since the success of the talent agencies depends on referring writers who are most acceptable to the employers. The writers cite various comments by agents to writers as evidence of each agency\u2019s pattern or practice of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">2. <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co., Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In October 2000, 51 writers filed a single class action lawsuit in federal court against all of the networks, studios and talent agencies which are parties to this appeal and writ petition. The action was brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq. (ADEA)), FEHA, and New York State\u2019s Human Rights Law, and alleged an industry-wide pattern or practice of age discrimination. The complaint cited conclusions and statistics from a WGA study of the 1997/1998 television season. The 40 network and studio defendants and the 11 talent agency defendants filed motions to dismiss and, in the alternative, to sever both plaintiffs and defendants as improperly joined. In a lengthy opinion, on January 24, 2002, Judge Stephen V. Wilson granted the motions to dismiss in part, and granted the motions to sever. <em>(Wynn, supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067.) As pertinent here, the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">1. Dismissed with prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">i. the writers\u2019 claims against the talent agencies under the ADEA and the FEHA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">ii. all claims alleging joint and several liability for industrywide discrimination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">iii. claims of aiding and abetting under the ADEA; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">iv. conspiracy claims against the employers under FEHA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>2. Dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">i. ADEA and FEHA claims against the employers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">ii. all deterred applicant claims, to the extent the writers could plead how a particular writer was deterred from applying to a particular employer by that employer\u2019s actions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">iii. aiding and abetting claims under FEHA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">3. Found that plaintiffs should not be certified as a class under the ADEA, and also granted defendants\u2019 motions to sever, ruling that all claims of discrimination under the ADEA and FEHA alleging companywide discrimination must be brought against each employer or related group of employers separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">3. <em>These lawsuits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The federal court\u2019s order was filed January 24, 2002. On February 25, 2002, the writers filed the 23 class action suits now before this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As in the federal case, the 23 complaints allege a pattern and practice of discrimination; none pleads the elements necessary to state a prima facie case of discrimination against an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The allegations in each of the 23 lawsuits are generally described in part 1, <em>ante. </em>The complaints further allege that the employers have for many years employed, and the talent agencies have contracted to represent, \u201cstatistically significant lower numbers of older writers than would be expected absent age discrimination given the relevant qualified applicant pool.\u201d These disparities increase with age. The writers assert, for example, that two out of every three nighttime television series did not employ a single writer over the age of 50, and that writers over 50 held 5 percent of the writing positions on episodic comedy series while approximately 33 percent of the WGA membership during the same period was over 50. The complaints allege that top management at the talent agencies have explicitly and implicitly instructed individual agents to seek out, represent and refer younger writers to the exclusion of older writers, and agents have refused to submit older writer clients for television writing opportunities with the networks and studios. The employers, the writers claim, have adopted several employment practices that are facially neutral, but have a disparate impact on older writers: the refusal to accept script submissions except through agents; the use of word of mouth and nepotistic hiring practices including the preselection of younger writers; and the failure to use defined criteria in order to uniformly evaluate the ability of each applicant to write for a particular show or project.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The writers allege that the anecdotal stories and personal experiences described in the complaints have been widely communicated to and among older writers, so that talent agencies and employers alike have developed a well-deserved reputation among older writers for engaging in a pattern or practice of age discrimination. Older writers have been deterred from seeking television writing opportunities from the employers, and representation from the talent agencies for the purpose of obtaining those opportunities, as a result of each employer\u2019s and each agency\u2019s discriminatory business policies or practices. A few of the writers also generally allege they applied for television writing opportunities and were rejected by the employers, or sought and were refused representation by the talent agencies, but no information is given identifying the position sought, the employer or any other particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The class action allegations of each complaint against the employers define the class as all members of the WGA who were at least 40 years of age and either applied and were rejected, or were deterred from applying, for television writing opportunities with that employer. The complaints state that one or more separate classes, including age-specific subclasses, may be appropriate. The class action allegations of the writers\u2019 complaints against the talent agencies are similar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Based on these allegations, the writers assert causes of action against the employers for violations of FEHA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act. In addition, they allege each employer has aided and abetted the unlawful practices of the talent agencies in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, and the network employers have aided and abetted the unlawful practices of each of the studio employers in violation of FEHA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act. As to the talent agencies, the writers assert causes of action for (a) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, and (b) aiding and abetting the employers\u2019 age discrimination in violation of FEHA and the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">4. <em>Demurrers and trial court\u2019s January 16, 2003 order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Each of the employers and talent agencies demurred to the complaints. After a lengthy hearing, the trial court issued a statement of decision and order, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>1. The writers could not state a FEHA class action, because Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b) prohibits a state class action under FEHA if the persons claiming to be aggrieved \u201chave filed\u201d a comparable class action in the federal courts. The demurrers to the class claims were sustained without leave to amend, but without prejudice to the writers\u2019 right to plead individual FEHA claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">2. The FEHA one-year statute of limitations barred the claims of \u201cdeterred applicants,\u201d that is, claims by writers who did not apply for positions because they were allegedly deterred from applying by the employers\u2019 long-standing and continuing discriminatory practices. The court applied principles stated in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>CH2M Hill, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 798, 823 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 87, 29 P.3d 175], and concluded the statute of limitations began to run when applying for employment first became \u201ca futile, vain gesture.\u201d That point appeared, on the face of the complaints, to have occurred more than one year before the complaints were filed. The demurrers to the deterred applicant FEHA claims were sustained, but \u201cwith leave specifically to plead individual claims not barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">3. In their federal complaint, the writers alleged statistics \u201csubstantially inconsistent with viable deterred applicant claims.\u201d As an example, the federal complaint alleged that in the 1997/1998 broadcast season, writers over 40 comprised one-third or more of the writing staffs of most employers. This allegation contradicts the claims of deterred applicants, who generally allege that application would have been a futile gesture. As a result, the demurrers to the deterred applicant FEHA claims were sustained, but \u201cwith leave to plead individual claims with facts showing a legal basis for overcoming the federal pleading contradictions sufficient to satisfy\u201d the deterred applicant futility requirements stated in <em>Teamsters v. United States </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 324, 366-367 [52 L.Ed.2d 396, 97 S.Ct. 1843] and <em>Cucuzza v. City of Santa Clara </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1031 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 660],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">4. To state a prima facie age discrimination claim under FEHA, writers who allege they were actual applicants must specifically aver the identity of the employer, position applied for, and age classification involved in order to provide employers with sufficient notice to permit adequate responsive pleadings. Because the actual applicants did not do so, the employers\u2019 demurrers to actual applicant FEHA claims were sustained, with leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">5. The Unruh Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination by business establishments, does not reach employment discrimination claims, and the complaints \u201cdo not allege sales transactions of the sort that qualify for Unruh [Civil Rights] Act treatment.\u201d Demurrers to Unruh Civil Rights Act claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>were sustained, with leave to amend to allege business transactions of the kind governed by the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">6. Rulings on the aiding and abetting claims followed those on the underlying substantive violations: demurrers were sustained without leave to amend as to class claims relying on predicate FEHA claims, and with leave to amend for claims relying on predicate Unruh Civil Rights Act violations and individual claims relying on predicate FEHA claims. For the last category, the writers must plead the basic elements of viable aiding and abetting claims, alleging at a minimum the identity of the aider and abettor, knowledge that the primary violator\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of duty, and the manner in which the named employer or agency assisted in or encouraged the predicate violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">7. Writers cannot sue the talent agencies directly for FEHA violations because FEHA did not create direct liability for employment agencies until the passage of amendments effective January 1, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those amendments constituted a change in the law and do not have retroactive effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">8. Demurrers on class certification grounds were overruled, and requests for severance were denied, in each case without prejudice; the court indicated its preference to address those issues in the context of amended pleadings. The 23 lawsuits were deemed related, without prejudice to the formulation of a different view in future, and questions relating to consolidation, coordination and joinder were ruled premature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">9. The writers were granted leave to amend their complaints to plead violations of the unfair competition law. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">5. <em>Proceedings after the January 16, 2003 rulings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">The trial court\u2019s order, filed January 16, 2003, precipitated several actions by the writers. First, they filed second amended complaints, both in the 11 lawsuits against the talent agencies and in the 12 suits against the networks and studios. In the talent agency cases, the writers did not attempt to amend their class claims under the Unruh Civil Rights Act or to assert individual FEHA claims, instead alleging only representative claims (not class claims) under the unfair competition law (UCL). In the employer cases, the writers alleged only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>claims under the UCL, including a class action claim. Second, they filed notices of appeal from the trial court\u2019s order in the 11 talent agency lawsuits under the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine, which permits direct appeal of an order that is tantamount to the death knell of a class action. Third, the writers in the 12 lawsuits against the employers filed a petition for writ of mandate, citing three errors of law they assert require immediate correction: the dismissal of the class claims under FEHA based on the earlier filing of the federal class action; the ruling that deterred applicants\u2019 claims were time-barred; and the ruling that individual claims of both actual and deterred applicants must be pled with particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The talent agencies then filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cdeath knell\u201d appeals, along with a request for judicial notice of several documents, including the second amended complaints filed by the writers on February 28, 2003, and the writers\u2019 writ petition in the lawsuits against the employers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We deferred consideration of the talent agencies\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal. With respect to the writ petition, we issued an order to show cause, and advised the parties the writ petition would be heard in conjunction with the appeals in the lawsuits against the talent agencies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">6. <em>Trial court\u2019s August 14, 2003 order and subsequent proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Meanwhile, in the trial court, the employers and agencies demurred to the second amended complaints. The employers also filed a motion to stay all proceedings in the trial court pending a decision in the Court of Appeal. On August 14, 2003, the trial court issued a statement of decision with the following principal rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">1. Employers\u2019 demurrers to the writers\u2019 UCL class claims were sustained without leave to amend. The court ruled the writers were not entitled to restitution or disgorgement, or to ancillary monetary relief in conjunction with their request for injunctive relief, under the UCL. Only injunctive relief was available, and that could be obtained through representative actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>2. Employers\u2019 demurrers to the writers\u2019 UCL representative claims were sustained, but the writers were given leave to amend \u201cto include general allegations showing potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">3. Talent agencies\u2019 demurrers to the writers\u2019 UCL representative actions were sustained, but the writers were given leave to amend \u201cto include allegations generally explaining how Agency Defendant\u2019s aided and abetted Employer Defendants\u2019 potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The court also granted the employers\u2019 motion to stay all matters in their entirety, pending a decision by the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">After the trial court\u2019s August 14, 2003 order, the writers undertook two actions. First, in the 12 lawsuits against the employers, the writers appealed the August 14 order insofar as it finally disposed of all class claims under the UCL (another set of death knell appeals). Second, the writers in one of the 11 lawsuits against the talent agencies (the suit against William Morris Agency) filed a petition for writ of mandate. The petition asks the court to consider whether the trial court erred in holding that a plaintiff is required to allege \u201cpotential competitive harm or likely consumer deception\u201d in order to state a claim for relief under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">This court granted the writers\u2019 motion to consolidate the death knell appeals in the 12 employer lawsuits with the earlier writ petitions in those lawsuits, for purposes of briefing, argument and decision. With respect to the writ petition, we issued an order to show cause, and advised the parties that the petition would be considered with the pending appeals and writs.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">I. <em>The order sustaining the talent agencies\u2019 demurrers to the writers\u2019 class claims under FEHA (without leave to amend) and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (with leave to amend) is appealable under the death knell doctrine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">An order sustaining a demurrer with or without leave to amend is ordinarily not appealable, since the order is not a final judgment. <em>(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 699 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732], An exception to this rule applies in a class action if the legal effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>order is \u201ctantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff,\u201d and if the order \u201chas virtually demolished the action as a class action.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>California allows direct appeal of such a \u201cdeath-knell\u201d order as a matter of state law policy. Indeed, some cases state that a plaintiff who fails to appeal a death knell order \u201closes forever the right to attack it.\u201d <em>(Stephen </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 806, 811 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The talent agencies urge dismissal of these appeals, pointing out that the trial court\u2019s January 16, 2003 order itself did not entirely dispose of all class-based claims; rather, the order allowed the writers to replead their Unruh Civil Rights Act claims, and to amend their complaints to plead UCL violations. The writers chose not to replead the Unruh Civil Rights Act claims,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and likewise chose not to try to plead class claims under the UCL, instead amending their complaints to state only representative claims under the UCL. Because the writers elected not to assert any class claims in their amended complaints, the talent agencies contend it was not the trial court\u2019s order that extinguished their class claims; instead it was the writers\u2019 own choice that \u201crang the \u2018death knell\u2019 for their class claims.\u201d They argue the writers cannot \u201ckill\u201d their own class claims in order to give this court jurisdiction to hear a death knell appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We are persuaded these are proper death knell appeals. The cases illustrate two aspects of a single point. An appeal may be taken if the order in question \u201chas virtually demolished\u201d the action as a class action. <em>(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 699.) On the other hand, no appeal lies if, after the trial court\u2019s order, a viable class claim remains pending in the trial court. That was the case in <em>Vasquez v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964] <em>(Vasquez), </em>upon which the talent agencies rely. <em>Vasquez </em>concluded that an order sustaining demurrers to the class action allegations of one cause of action, but overruling demurrers to a second class-based cause of action, was not appealable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 807 &amp; fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Vasquez, </em>however, does not settle the point. In <em>Vasquez, </em>the second cause of action in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint remained fully viable after the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>court\u2019s order; the demurrers to the plaintiffs\u2019 class claim in that cause of action were overruled, not sustained. In this case, by contrast, the trial court\u2019s order sustained the demurrers, albeit with leave to amend in one case, and left no class claim pending as originally pled. As <em>Daar </em>stated, the order \u201cdetermine[d] the legal insufficiency of the complaint as a class suit. . . .\u201d <em>(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 699), at least as originally pled. Thus, the legal effect of the trial court\u2019s order was that no class claims remained, absent some further action by the writers, who chose not to attempt to plead sales transactions under the Unruh Civil Rights Act or class claims under the UCL. In short, the trial court\u2019s order disposed of all the class claims plaintiffs wanted to bring, allowing them only to try to plead different class claims which, as it happens, they did not want to bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It is plaintiffs, not defendants, who determine the claims to pursue; no principle of law requires plaintiffs to attempt to replead claims or to assert additional class claims that might or might not be available. We see no legitimate basis for depriving the writers of a death knell appeal in circumstances where all the class claims they choose to assert have been eliminated by the trial court\u2019s order. Nothing in <em>Vasquez </em>or the other cases requires us to consider the trial court\u2019s order in a vacuum; the writers\u2019 repleading \u201celection\u201d is a direct result of the trial court\u2019s order. In this case, the trial court\u2019s order was plainly \u201ctantamount to a dismissal\u201d of and \u201cvirtually demolished\u201d every class claim that the writers sought to bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The talent agencies insist that a death knell appeal may not be \u201cmanufacture[d],\u201d and must be struck by the trial court\u2019s order, not by plaintiffs\u2019 election. The agencies warn that if a death knell appeal is allowed in these circumstances, \u201clitigants could easily circumvent the \u2018one final judgment\u2019 rule and the \u2018death knell\u2019 doctrine by simply re-pleading at any time during the litigation.\u201d The agencies do not explain what they mean by this, and we can discern no substance to the argument. Under any circumstances, a plaintiff will have one, and only one, opportunity to appeal an order that has the legal effect of disposing of all class claims. (See <em>Stephen </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 811.) We fail to see any possibility of circumventing the death knell rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The motion to dismiss the appeals is denied. We turn next to the issues common to both the appeals in the talent agency cases and the writ petitions in the lawsuits against the employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>II. <em>Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), does not bar the writers who were plaintiffs in Wynn from filing a FEHA class action in state court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b) (hereafter section 12965(b)) prohibits a state class action under FEHA if the persons claiming to be aggrieved \u201chave filed\u201d a comparable class action in the federal courts. The writers contend, in their appeals in the talent agency suits and in their writ petition in the employer lawsuits, that this provision does not bar their FEHA class action. The only reading of section 12965(b) that is consistent with the remedial purposes of FEHA, they assert, and that does not produce absurd results, is that the provision bars a state class action only when a comparable federal claim is pending. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Section 12965(b) governs FEHA actions, and states in pertinent part: \u201cThose actions [civil actions under FEHA] may not be filed as class actions or may not be maintained as class actions by the person or persons claiming to be aggrieved where those persons have filed a civil class action in the federal courts alleging a comparable claim of employment discrimination against the same defendant or defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Section 12965(b) has not been previously construed, and the parties point to no assistance in its legislative history to guide us. To the extent there is ambiguity, we must follow the statutory mandate to interpret the provision liberally for the accomplishment of FEHA\u2019s purposes (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12993, subd. (a)), and adhere to established principles of statutory construction, including the avoidance of absurd results. In summary, our conclusion is that the provision is ambiguous, and the Legislature intended to forbid the filing or maintaining of a FEHA class action in state court if a comparable action has been filed and is pending in federal court\u2014that is, duplicative parallel litigation. Obviously, to the extent federal class claims have been adjudicated, principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel will preclude further litigation in state courts. However, we perceive no reason the Legislature would wish to forbid a FEHA class action on issues never adjudicated in federal court. We turn to a point-by-point analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">A. <em>The statutory language is ambiguous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Both the employers and the talent agencies contend the statute is clear: it bars a state FEHA class action where the persons claiming to be aggrieved \u201chave filed\u201d a class action in the federal courts alleging a comparable claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of employment discrimination against the same defendants. The trial court found this \u201cplain language\u201d contrary to the writers\u2019 claim that the statute forbids only concurrent class actions; the court indicated that \u201chave filed\u201d is the \u201cpast tense\u201d and that the statute plainly intends to impose a bar on successive class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We do not agree that \u201chave filed\u201d is the past tense or that the language is unambiguous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In fact, \u201chave filed\u201d is the present perfect tense, a tense which indicates either that an action was completed at some point in the past (arguably supporting the trial court\u2019s construction) or that the action began in the past and continues up to and including the present.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The latter alternative comports with the view that class claims in state court are prohibited only where a federal class action is ongoing. Accordingly, we are unwilling to conclude, without more, that the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201chave filed\u201d necessarily means that any past filing of a federal class action, regardless of its procedural or substantive status or consequences, bars any subsequent FEHA class action in state court. We therefore turn to the question of legislative purpose and intent to find the proper construction of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">B. <em>Policies underlying FEHA, as well as the principle that statutes should be interpreted to avoid absurd consequences, support the conclusion that section 12965(b) bars only concurrent federal and state class actions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The employers<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> state that the statute prohibits successive class suits, because class actions are expensive to litigate and consume substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>judicial resources, and the statute was designed to prevent forum shopping. They cite, however, no legislative history supporting these statements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Certainly class actions consume substantial judicial resources, and the prevention of forum shopping is a worthy objective. The fact of the matter is, however, that there is no indication of the Legislature\u2019s intention when it forbade the filing of FEHA class claims in circumstances where plaintiffs \u201chave filed\u201d comparable class claims in federal courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>to suppose the Legislature intended anything more than to conserve judicial resources by prohibiting FEHA class claims where, for example, plaintiffs are already pursuing comparable Title VII class claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) in federal court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Since we do not know, from any documentary evidence, the legislative intent in enacting the class action provision of section 12965(b), we turn to what we do know. We know that the Legislature mandated that every provision of FEHA be constmed liberally for the accomplishment of FEHA\u2019s purposes. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12993, subd. (a).) We know that the elimination of age and other invidious bases for discrimination in employment is the public policy of this state. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 12920.) We know that it is the purpose of FEHA \u201cto provide effective remedies that will eliminate . . .\u201d discriminatory practices. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In light of these clear legislative mandates, we will not adopt a more restrictive reading of section 12965(b) than its words require. The employers have offered no persuasive reason to conclude the Legislature meant to forbid successive, rather than concurrent, class actions. <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, reading the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>statute as the employers suggest, to mean that a class action filing in federal court by any member of the plaintiff class bars any subsequent class claim in state court, under any circumstances, would have consequences that cannot have been intended. (See <em>In re J.W. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 200, 210 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 897, 57 P.3d 363] [courts will not give statutory language a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the Legislature could not have intended].) As amici curiae point out, any number of procedural errors in a federal court filing could prompt the dismissal of the federal action, long before class certification questions or the merits of the litigation are ever reached. If such a filing bars a subsequent class suit in state court, meritorious class claims could go unheard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We cannot conclude that the Legislature, whose stated objective was to provide effective remedies for the elimination of discriminatory practices (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12920), could have intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We are cognizant of the fact that our interpretation of section 12965(b) effectively requires some duplication of judicial effort where successive class suits are filed. However, it does not, as the employers argue, give the writers, or anyone else, \u201ca second bite at the class action apple in state court . . . .\u201d The writers have not yet had their first bite at the class action apple so far as FEHA is concerned. Indeed, in the course of its adverse ruling on class action status under the ADEA,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the <em>Wynn </em>court indicated that had the writers brought a class action against any one employer, under a pattern or practice claim against that particular employer, \u201cthe class would most likely be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>conditionally certified at this point, or at some point later in the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Wynn, supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d at p. 1084.) In short, much remained to be done, whether in federal or state court, and the employers\u2019 claim that our interpretation of the statute allowing it to be done in state court \u201cruns counter to sound judicial administration\u201d is considerably overblown.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In sum, we conclude that the statutory proscription on filing or maintaining a FEHA class action in state court, when the same persons \u201chave filed\u201d a class action in federal court alleging a comparable claim, was intended to proscribe concurrent, not successive, class actions. Our conclusion on this point eliminates any need to address the writers\u2019 contentions that class relief in state court is available because the alleged FEHA violations are ongoing, or that construing section 12965(b) to prohibit a class action in state court on claims that were voluntarily dismissed under rale 41(a) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.) would violate the supremacy clause.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We turn next to the matter of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">III. <em>FEHA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations does not bar the claims of \u201cdeterred applicants, \u201d that is, writers who allege they did not apply for positions because of an entrenched policy of discrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The writers contend the trial court erred in concluding that the one-year FEHA statute of limitations barred the claims of nonapplicants or \u201cdeterred applicants,\u201d those who did not apply for positions during the statutory period because of an allegedly long-entrenched policy of discrimination against older writers. We agree with the writers.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The fundamental issue to be decided is whether FEHA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations prevents nonapplicant writers (deterred applicants) from prosecuting a claim that, within the statutory period, employers and agencies enforced a systemic policy of age discrimination that deterred the writers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>from applying for positions as television screenwriters.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The answer depends upon whether a principle announced in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>CH2M Hill, Inc., supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 798 (Richards) applies. <em>Richards </em>involved an application of the continuing violation doctrine. <em>Richards </em>decided that the statute of limitations in disability harassment cases involving an employer\u2019s series of unlawful actions against an employee begins to run when the employee is on notice that further efforts to end his employer\u2019s unlawful conduct will be futile. If the <em>Richards </em>futility formulation also applies to cases of an ongoing corporate policy of discrimination against a protected class, the writers\u2019 complaints themselves tend to show that the statute of limitations ran long ago on most claims by deterred applicants, because the complaints generally allege that the discriminatory policies in question have been entrenched for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We conclude the <em>Richards </em>formulation does not apply. We first describe the continuing violation doctrine, then discuss its application as mandated by <em>Richards, </em>and finally explain the reason the doctrine does not apply in the cases under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">A. <em>Continuing violation doctrine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We begin by agreeing, as did <em>Richards, </em>with the observation that the continuing violation doctrine is \u201c \u2018arguably the most muddled area in all of employment discrimination law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 813, quoting 2 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law (3d ed. 1996) p. 1351.) The continuing violation doctrine is muddled because, as <em>Richards </em>points out, it \u201crefers not to a single theory, but to a number of different approaches, in different contexts and using a variety of formulations, to extending the statute of limitations in employment discrimination cases.\u201d <em>(Richards, supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th at p. 813.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Both federal and earlier California cases have distinguished two different types of continuing violations, both of which also are identified in <em>Richards. </em>One is a systematic corporate policy of discrimination, and the other is a series of discriminatory acts directed at an individual. (See, e.g., <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>The Regents of the University of California </em>(2000) 88 Cal.App.4th 52, 64 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 652] [a continuing violation may be established by demonstrating either a companywide policy or practice or a series of related acts against a single individual]; <em>Bullington v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>(10th Cir. 1999) 186 F.3d 1301, 1311 [\u201ca continuing violation may be based on either a series of related acts taken against a single individual or the maintenance of a company-wide policy or practice of discrimination\u201d]; <em>Sabree v. United Broth. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>of Carpenters and Joiners </em>(1st Cir. 1990) 921 F.2d 396, 400 &amp; fn. 7 [distinguishing serial and systemic continuing violations; a \u201csystemic violation has its roots in a discriminatory policy or practice; so long as the policy or practice itself continues into the limitation period, a challenger may be deemed to have filed a timely complaint\u201d].) Commentators have drawn a similar distinction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><em>Richards </em>examined federal case law on continuing violations and identified \u201cessentially four approaches\u201d used in federal cases. The first involves a systematic corporate policy of discrimination which was initiated before the limitations period, but continues in effect within that period to the detriment of the employee. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 813.) For example, a discriminatory promotions policy, implemented long before suit is brought, is actionable if it continues into the limitations period to wrongfully deny an employee a promotion. <em>Richards </em>cited California cases similarly concluding that a policy of systematic discrimination in promotions constitutes a continuing violation. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 813, citing <em>Valdez v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1052-1054 [282 Cal.Rptr. 726] <em>(Valdez), </em>and <em>City and County of San Francisco v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 976, 983 [236 Cal.Rptr. 716] <em>(City and County of San Francisco).) </em>It is this type of \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d\u2014a systematic, companywide corporate policy of discrimination against a protected class\u2014that is alleged in the cases under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"><em>Richards </em>identified three other approaches, all of them used in cases involving an entirely different context: a series of discriminatory acts directed at an individual, rather than a systematic corporate policy of discrimination. In one approach, a series of discriminatory acts may delay the deadline for suing with respect to earlier acts in the series, only if the character of the earlier acts was not apparent when they were committed, but became apparent in light of later acts committed during the limitations period.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 813-814.) Another approach is the multi-factored approach first described in <em>Berry v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of L.S.U. </em>(5th Cir. 1983) 715 F.2d 971 <em>(Berry), </em>to determine when a number of discriminatory acts are related closely enough to constitute a continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>violation, and when they are merely discrete acts which must be regarded as individual violations. The three nonexclusive factors identified in <em>Berry </em>were whether the acts involve the same type of discrimination, whether the acts are frequent, and whether the acts have a degree of permanence that would trigger an employee\u2019s awareness that his or her rights have been violated. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 814, discussing <em>Berry, supra, </em>715 F.2d at p. 981.) The final approach is a broader \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d approach. That approach dispenses with the <em>Berry </em>permanence factor and examines whether the separate acts of discrimination are so closely related as to form a continuing violation. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 816.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> After reviewing these approaches to the continuing violation doctrine, <em>Richards </em>adopted a modified version of the <em>Berry </em>approach for application to a case involving an employer\u2019s series of unlawful actions in failing to reasonably accommodate an employee\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The <em>Richards </em>review of the continuing violation doctrine crystallizes one critical point. The cases under review by this court are analogous only to the first category of continuing violations identified in <em>Richards </em>and other authorities; the writers allege a systematic corporate policy of discrimination against a protected class that was enforced during the limitations period, to the detriment of members of the class during that period. No relief is sought for employer conduct predating the limitations period. By contrast, the other three approaches involve an entirely different category of continuing violation. Those three approaches were used by the courts to determine whether a series of discriminatory acts against an individual constitute a continuing violation, such that acts outside the statute of limitations may be used to establish the employer\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The two categories of so-called continuing violations are thus fundamentally different. The first seeks relief for discrimination during the limitations period, and the second seeks to impose liability for acts outside the limitations period. The first seeks relief for pervasive companywide discrimination against a protected class, and the second involves a series of discriminatory acts, in most cases targeting a single individual.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The <em>Richards </em>case, upon which the trial court relied to find the claims of deterred applicants time-barred, is clearly addressed to the second category of continuing violations: a series of discriminatory acts targeting an individual victim, specifically, refusing reasonable accommodation to a disabled individual. Our examination of <em>Richards </em>compels the conclusion that the principles announced there have no application to the cases before us. We turn to the holdings of the <em>Richards </em>case to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">B. <em>Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">As <em>Richards </em>explains, \u201cthe continuing violation doctrine comes into play when an employee raises a claim based on conduct that occurred in part outside the limitations period.\u201d <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 812.) Specifically, the question posed by <em>Richards </em>was this: \u201cIs an employer liable for actions that take place outside the limitations period if these actions are sufficiently linked to unlawful conduct within the limitations period?\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>Richards, </em>\u201c[m]any of the incidents of disability discrimination introduced at trial occurred outside the one-year limitations period\u201d for filing FEHA actions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 801-802.) Adopting a modified version of the <em>Berry </em>test, the Supreme Court held: \u201cWe conclude, consistent with the language and purposes of the FEHA, as well as federal and California case law, that an employer\u2019s series of unlawful actions in a case of failure to reasonably accommodate an employee\u2019s disability, or disability harassment, should be viewed as a single, actionable course of conduct if (1) the actions are sufficiently similar in kind; (2) they occur with sufficient frequency; and (3) they have not acquired a degree of \u2018permanence\u2019 so that employees are on notice that further efforts at informal conciliation with the employer to obtain accommodation or end harassment would be futile.\u201d <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 802.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The court expressly addressed the statute of limitations: \u201cThus, when an employer engages in a continuing course of unlawful conduct under the FEHA by refusing reasonable accommodation of a disabled employee or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>engaging in disability harassment, and this course of conduct does not constitute a constructive discharge, the statute of limitations begins to run, not necessarily when the employee first believes that his or her rights may have been violated, but rather, <em>either </em>when the course of conduct is brought to an end, as by the employer\u2019s cessation of such conduct or by the employee\u2019s resignation, <em>or </em>when the employee is on notice that further efforts to end the unlawful conduct will be in vain.\u201d <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 823.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The employers seize upon the final factor in the court\u2019s test\u2014whether the victim is on notice that further efforts to end unlawful conduct will be futile\u2014and assert that it applies to start the statute of limitations in every case of ongoing discrimination, including a companywide policy of discrimination against a class. We conclude, to the contrary, that it is manifest from <em>Richards </em>that the principles announced there have no application to the cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">C. <em>The Richards doctrine has no application to a claim of ongoing, companywide, systematic discrimination against a protected class.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">We begin by noting the contrasts between <em>Richards </em>and the cases under review. In these cases, the question is not, as it was in <em>Richards, </em>the employer\u2019s liability \u201cfor actions that take place outside the limitations period . . . .\u201d <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 812.) The question is the employer\u2019s liability for enforcing a discriminatory policy during the limitations period. The employers and the agencies are not liable\u2014and the writers do not claim they are\u2014for discrimination in hiring that occurred more than one year before the complaints in these cases were filed with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As already mentioned, another difference is equally apparent: these cases allege systematic, companywide discrimination against a class of persons, and <em>Richards </em>involved a series of discriminatory acts directed at an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Nonetheless, the employers insist that <em>Richards </em>established, for all cases in which discrimination could be described as a continuing course of conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>that the statute of limitations begins to run \u201cwhen a plaintiff first learns that it would be \u2018futile\u2019 to change the situation . . . .\u201d The agencies similarly argue that <em>Richards </em>applies \u201c [b]y its own terms, . . .regardless whether a plaintiff alleges a \u2018pattem-or-practice\u2019 of discrimination against a class or merely an ongoing course of discrimination against an individual.\u201d We are compelled to disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">First, <em>Richards </em>certainly does not apply \u201c[b]y its own terms.\u201d <em>Richards </em>nowhere addresses the application of the continuing violation doctrine to allegations of ongoing systematic discrimination against a class. To the contrary, <em>Richards </em>repeatedly confines its holding to the circumstances under review, expressly addressing only \u201cthe applicability of the continuing violation doctrine to the FEHA when an employer fails to reasonably accommodate a disability or to prevent disability discrimination.\u201d (Richards, <em>supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 818, 823 [defining \u201c \u2018permanence\u2019 in the context of an ongoing process of accommodation of disability, or ongoing disability harassment\u201d].) Indeed, <em>Richards </em>is explicitly premised on the rationale that the limitations period should not begin to run, in such a case, at the first notice that an employee\u2019s rights have been violated, because that would \u201cshort-circuit the reasonable accommodation process . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 822.) Its holding was expressly based on the existence and importance of the informal conciliation and accommodation process.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 821-822.) The concept of informal conciliation is, of course, completely inapplicable when no employment relationship, and hence no opportunity for informal conciliation, exists. In short, nothing in <em>Richards </em>suggests that its formulation applies, or was intended to apply, to classwide claims of an ongoing, companywide, systematic policy of age discrimination in hiring. And, it is hornbook law that \u201c \u2018an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Richmond v. Shasta Community Services Dist. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 409, 422 [9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 121, 83 P.3d 518], quoting <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Second, some of the employers urge that the issue in <em>Richards </em>was when the unlawful practice \u201coccurred,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and that <em>Richards </em>\u201ctied its analysis to FEHA\u2019s language indicating that the limitation period is triggered when an \u2018unlawful practice\u2019 has \u2018occurred.\u2019 \u201d The employers\u2019 statement is true, but the analysis underlying it is incomplete. <em>Richards </em>did not purport to opine when an unlawful practice has \u201coccurred\u201d for any and every kind of unlawful practice. <em>Richards' </em>s holding and analysis is very plainly addressed only to the question when an employer\u2019s persistent failure to reasonably accommodate an individual employee\u2019s disability, \u201cor to eliminate a hostile work environment targeting a disabled employee,\u201d is a continuing violation. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 823.) <em>Richards </em>neither discussed nor decided when an employer\u2019s ongoing pattern or practice of systematic discrimination against a protected class has \u201coccurred\u201d for purposes of the statute of limitations. Moreover, federal precedent confirms that the question of timely filing with respect to pattern and practice claims by private litigants is entirely distinct from limitations questions in contexts such as that in <em>Richards. </em>Thus, in <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 101, 105 [153 L.Ed.2d 106, 122 S.Ct. 2061] <em>(Amtrak), </em>the Supreme Court resolved, under federal law, the question whether, and under what circumstances, a Title VII plaintiff may file suit on events that fall outside the limitations period.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In doing so, the court expressly noted it had \u201cno occasion here to consider the timely filing question with respect to \u2018pattem- or-practice\u2019 claims brought by private litigants . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 115, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Third, the <em>Richards </em>test itself shows its inapplicability to claims of a companywide pattern or practice of unlawful discrimination. The very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>purpose of the <em>Richards </em>test is to determine whether \u201can employer\u2019s series of unlawful actions . . . should be viewed as a single, actionable course of conduct . . . ,\u201d subjecting the employer to liability for acts outside the limitations period.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 802.) However, in pattern and practice cases, no test is necessary to determine whether unlawful actions outside the limitations period should be viewed as part of a single, actionable course of conduct, because no relief is sought for actions outside the limitations period. Relief is sought only for enforcement of the discriminatory policy during the limitations period. Moreover, the three prongs of the <em>Richards </em>test\u2014whether the employer\u2019s actions are sufficiently similar in kind, occur with sufficient frequency, and have not acquired a degree of permanence such that further efforts at informal conciliation would be futile\u2014likewise show the test\u2019s irrelevance to claims of ongoing systematic discrimination in hiring. In a pattern and practice case, the employer\u2019s unlawful actions are, by definition, identical in kind and pervasive in frequency. The question of \u201cpermanence\u201d similarly does not arise, because no relief is sought for actions outside the limitations period, and the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for the permanence requirement is to allow an ongoing process of reasonable accommodation between employer and employee to occur. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 820-823.) In short, the <em>Richards </em>test does not address, and plainly was not intended to address, the question when the statute of limitations begins to run on a pattern and practice claim of systematic discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In sum, the <em>Richards </em>test is entirely inapposite to a case of continuing systemic discrimination against a class. The rationale stated in <em>Valdez </em>and <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>on the other hand, remains fully viable. <em>Valdez </em>and <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>as well as many federal cases, have concluded that a continuing violation may be found when a corporate policy is initiated before the limitations period, but continues in effect within that period to the detriment of the employee. <em>(Valdez, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1052, 1054 [critical question is whether any present violation exists; a present violation existed \u201cbecause the employer, during the limitations period, [was] making promotions from a list tainted by discrimination\u201d]; <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at p. 983 [because promotions continued to be made from an allegedly discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>eligibility list (adopted outside the statutory period) during the year preceding the filing of the complaint, the complaint was timely filed]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 665 F.2d 918, 924 [\u201cthe relevant strain of continuing violation doctrine is that a systematic policy of discrimination is actionable even if some or all of the events evidencing its inception occurred prior to the limitations period\u201d]; see <em>Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 813.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The employers assert that <em>Richards </em>implicitly overruled <em>Valdez </em>and <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>and \u201cexpressly rejected\u201d the approach used in those cases. The employers do not specify where in <em>Richards </em>this express rejection may be found, and with good reason: it is not there. <em>Richards </em>nowhere suggests or implies that <em>Valdez </em>and <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>were wrongly decided. Further, for the reasons we have discussed, it is improbable that the Supreme Court would apply the <em>Richards </em>formulation to the entirely different circumstances that existed in <em>Valdez </em>and <em>City and County of San Francisco, </em>where policies of systematic discrimination in promotions existed and were applied during the limitations period to the detriment of the employee. Nothing in <em>Richards </em>suggests that is or should be the law.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Finally, the employers cite <em>Richards </em>and <em>Cucuzza </em>for the proposition that it would be unfair to the employer to allow the employee to extend the limitations period indefinitely. The argument merely demonstrates the inappo-siteness of <em>Richards </em>to a case of companywide systematic discrimination against a class. The court\u2019s concern in <em>Richards </em>about permitting an employee to indefinitely delay the filing of a lawsuit was expressly connected to cases of harassment of or failure to accommodate a disabled employee. <em>(Richards, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 822-823.) The court explained that when an employee\u2019s hope that conditions will improve is unreasonable, justification for delay in taking formal legal action no longer exists. \u201cIf the employer has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>made clear in word and deed that the employee\u2019s attempted further reasonable accommodation is futile, then the employee is on notice that litigation, not informal conciliation, is the only alternative for the vindication of his or her rights.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The circumstances in the cases under review could scarcely be more dissimilar. It is not the employee\u2014the deterred applicant\u2014who is extending the limitations period indefinitely. It is the employer who allegedly continues to refuse to hire older screenwriters for television writing opportunities that occur during the limitations period. Certainly, the employers and the agencies would not be liable for any discriminatory refusal to refer or refusal to hire that occurred more than one year before the complaints in these cases were filed with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. However, there is no reason an employer should be at liberty to continue to discriminate in new hires during the limitations period, simply because it has done so, allegedly, for the past 20 years. As one court has said, an employer who continuously and systematically violates the law \u201c \u2018neither deserves nor obtains repose.\u2019 \u201d <em>(EEOC v. Mitsubishi Motor Mfg. of America, Inc. </em>(C.D.Ill. 1998) 990 F.Supp. 1059, 1087, quoting <em>EEOC v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1982) 553 F.Supp. 704, 713.) Accordingly, if the employers and agencies enforced a discriminatory policy during the limitations period, claims are timely filed both by writers who applied for jobs during that period and were rejected, and by writers who were deterred from applying for jobs during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We next consider several points related to the pleading of FEHA classwide claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">IV. <em>The writers have properly pled classwide claims alleging a pattern and practice of discrimination under FEHA, and have not waived their class claims by declining to assert individual FEHA claims in their second amended complaints.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The parties raise several issues flowing from the trial court\u2019s rejection of the writers\u2019 class claims under Government Code section 12965(b), and the court\u2019s related rulings allowing the writers to amend their complaints to state individual claims. After rejecting the writers\u2019 FEHA class claims, the court ruled that the deterred applicant writers could amend specifically to state individual FEHA claims which were not barred by the statute of limitations, and which pled deterrence with greater specificity, sufficient to overcome certain contradictions with the writers\u2019 earlier federal complaint. In addition, actual applicants could amend to plead FEHA claims under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>model, specifically averring the employer and the position applied for, as well as the age classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>When the writers amended their complaints, however, they alleged no individual FEHA claims, choosing to stand on their classwide claims of a pattern and practice of discrimination. The writers ask us to consider the trial court\u2019s directions as to the amendment of their FEHA claims, to the extent those rulings could be constmed as requiring them to allege detailed eviden-tiary facts supporting individual claims as a necessary predicate for their classwide pattern and practice claims. The employers, on the other hand, argue that a pattern and practice claim is not available under FEHA, particularly with respect to deterred applicants, and that the writers have waived their class claims by refusing to amend their complaints to allege individual FEHA claims. Moreover, the employers and agencies contend that the writers who are deterred applicants\u2014that is, those who did not apply for writing positions\u2014have \u201cpled themselves out of court,\u201d because their federal complaint alleged statistics inconsistent with the claim that it would have been futile to apply. We conclude the writers, including deterred applicants, properly stated classwide claims of a pattern and practice of discrimination under FEHA in their first amended complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A. <em>The writers may allege a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of FEHA, and need not plead the particulars of each plaintiff\u2019s claim as a predicate for their pattern and practice claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The employers contend nonapplicants cannot state a cause of action under FEHA, because no provision of FEHA authorizes a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d claim. The employers characterize the writers\u2019 pattern or practice claim as \u201cbogus\u201d and contend the conduct alleged consists of \u201cmultiple, discrete acts alleged by both actual applicants and deterred applicants of \u2018refusal to hire or employ\u2019 on the ground of age,\u201d and \u201c[e]ach alleged refusal-to-hire is an adverse act that constitutes a single \u2018unlawful practice.\u2019 \u201d At the pleading stage, they contend, each writer must allege \u201cfacts to support that each was over 40, each sought an available writing job with each Employer Defendant for which he or she was qualified, and each was refused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The employers are mistaken on both counts. Under their view of the law, every plaintiff in a class action would be required to plead facts supporting an individual prima facie case of discriminatory refusal to hire in order to survive a demurrer. No such rule of law exists. On the contrary, nothing in FEHA prohibits classwide claims of systemic discrimination, which is the functional equivalent of a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d claim. Moreover, the writers have properly pled such a claim, and are not required to plead individual prima facie cases of discrimination under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>model.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>We begin first with the contention that FEHA does not authorize a pattern or practice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">1. <em>The writers may allege a pattern or practice of discrimination under FEHA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The employers assert that, unlike Title VII, there is no \u201cpattern or practice\u201d language in FEHA, \u201cand, thus, no such cause of action.\u201d They argue that \u201c[i]f the Legislature had wanted such a cause of action in FEHA, it could have expressly said so by copying Title VII\u2019s language in \u00a7 707.\u201d This argument is, at best, disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">First, a class action is, by definition, a pattern or practice claim. \u201cPattem-or-practice suits, by their very nature, involve claims of classwide discrimination. Such claims involve an allegation that the defendant\u2019s actions constitute a pattern of conduct in which the defendant intentionally has discriminated against the plaintiff\u2019s protected class.\u201d (1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law (3d ed. 1996) p. 44, fn. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Second, the fact that section 707 of Title VH uses the term \u201cpattern or practice,\u201d while FEHA does not, is irrelevant. Section 707 does not define unlawful practices; it is merely the provision of Title VII which authorizes the government to bring civil actions when an employer \u201cis engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights secured by\u201d Title VH. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-6.) Section 707 is the only provision of Title VH which uses the term \u201cpattern or practice.\u201d Nonetheless, it plainly does not prevent private litigants from bringing classwide claims alleging a general pattern or practice of discrimination; such cases have been brought for decades. (E.g., <em>Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 867, 876 [81 L.Ed.2d 718, 104 S.Ct. 2794] [\u201c[t]he crucial difference between an individual\u2019s claim of discrimination and a class action alleging a general pattern or practice of discrimination is manifest\u201d]; <em>Lopez v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1991) 930 F.2d 157, 160 [\u201cto make out a pattern or practice case, a plaintiff must show systematic disparate treatment\u2014that is, that intentional racial discrimination is the standard operating procedure of the defendant\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Nothing in FEHA suggests that its provisions should be construed differently. (See, e.g., <em>Levy v. Regents of University of California </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1334, 1343 [245 Cal.Rptr. 576] [\u201c[t]o guide us in our analysis of . . . claims under ... the FEHA . . . , we look at federal law and how claims under title VII ... are broached\u201d].) Moreover, Government Code, section 12961 of the statute explicitly authorizes either an aggrieved person or the Director of Fair Employment and Housing to file a complaint on behalf of a group or class where an unlawful practice adversely affects a group or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>class in a similar manner. In short, the \u201ccause of action\u201d brought by the writers\u2014a classwide claim of discriminatory refusal to hire on the basis of age\u2014is precisely the same as a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d claim, and is plainly available under FEHA, just as such claims are available under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">2. <em>The employers\u2019 contention that each individual plaintiff must plead an individual refusal to hire is equally erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The employers make several related arguments. They contend that \u201cdeterred nonapplicants cannot state a FEHA claim,\u201d and point out that \u201cno provision of FEHA includes a word like \u2018deterred\u2019 or \u2018discouraged\u2019 a deterred nonapplicant therefore cannot state a claim for age discrimination, because he or she did not apply for employment. They also make the novel contention that, while the writers may at trial prove disparate treatment by establishing the employer\u2019s pattern or practice of discriminatory hiring practices based on age <em>(Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>431 U.S. at pp. 334\u2014335 <em>(Teamsters)), </em>they are nonetheless required to plead the same facts as an individual plaintiff bringing a discrimination claim in order to survive a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Both arguments are without merit, and disregard principles long ago established under Title VII, and equally applicable to class actions under FEHA. The relevant principles, all of which are well-settled, are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">1. A claim of discrimination against a class requires the plaintiffs to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201cdiscrimination was the company\u2019s standard operating procedure\u2014the regular rather than the unusual practice.\u201d <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 336; 1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, <em>supra, </em>p. 44.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">2. The class plaintiff \u201cis not required to offer evidence that each person for whom it will ultimately seek relief was a victim of the employer\u2019s discriminatory policy.\u201d <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 360.) The plaintiff\u2019s burden \u201cis to establish a prima facie case that such a policy existed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">3. Plaintiffs \u201cnormally seek to establish a pattern or practice of discriminatory intent by combining statistical and nonstatistical evidence, the latter most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>commonly consisting of anecdotal evidence of individual instances of discriminatory treatment.\u201d (1 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, <em>supra, </em>p. 45.)<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">4. \u201c[A] finding of a pattern or practice of discrimination itself justifies an award of prospective relief to the class . . . .\u201d Further proceedings usually are required to determine the scope of individual relief for class members. <em>(Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 876.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">5. Once a pattern of discrimination has been proved, no per se prohibition precludes relief for nonapplicants. <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 367 [\u201c[t]he denial of Title VII relief on the ground that the claimant had not formally applied for the job could exclude from the Act\u2019s coverage the victims of the most entrenched forms of discrimination\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">These well-established principles require the rejection of the employers\u2019 contention that the writers\u2014whether actual applicants or deterred applicants\u2014have not properly pled their claims under FEHA. In the first place, it defies common sense to suggest that the writers must plead facts they are not required to prove in order to establish a right to classwide relief. Plaintiffs in a class action need not prove each class plaintiff was a victim of discrimination; they must prove the existence of a discriminatory policy and, if they do so, they are entitled to classwide relief. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Federal Reserve Bank, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 876.) The contention the writers are required to plead facts showing individual refusals to hire, a la <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>or \u201cface dismissal at the pleading stage,\u201d is unsupported by either California or federal law.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The cases the employers cite neither state nor imply that class plaintiffs must plead facts showing individual instances of discrimination in order to state a classwide claim.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Indeed, under federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>law, even an individual plaintiff is not required to plead facts establishing a prima facie case; the complaint is only required to give the defendant \u201cfan-notice of the basis for [plaintiff\u2019s] claims.\u201d <em>(Swierkiewicz </em>v. <em>Sorema N.A. </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 506, 511, 512, 514 [152 L.Ed.2d 1, 122 S.Ct. 992] [prima facie case evidentiary standard \u201cshould not be transposed into a rigid pleading standard for discrimination cases\u201d]; <em>Bennett v.

Co. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 277] [describing these requirements as a \u201cfair-notice test\u201d], quoting <em>Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245 [74 Cal.Rptr. 398, 449 P.2d 462].) These are classwide claims of systemic discrimination, where the writers\u2019 ultimate evidentiary burden is to prove that age discrimination was the employer\u2019s standard operating procedure. <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 336.) Contrary to the employers\u2019 contention, we think it is clear the writers have pled \u201cthe statutory elements\u201d necessary to state a FEHA cause of action as described in Government Code section 12940.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Government Code section 12940 provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice ... [][].. . [f]or an employer, because of the . . . age ... of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a).) The writers\u2019 complaints allege each employer has adopted or maintained a companywide policy or practice of age discrimination in employment by refusing to hire plaintiffs on the basis of age, and by adopting ageist hiring policies that have deterred plaintiffs from seeking employment opportunities. They also allege they have applied for and have been rejected and/or have been deterred from seeking television writing employment as a result of the employers\u2019 practices. They further allege the employers have hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>statistically significant lower numbers of older writers than would be expected given the relevant qualified applicant pool, and these disparities increase in direct relationship to age. They also describe anecdotal evidence of intentional discrimination. We discern no missing statutory element in these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">3. <em>The same conclusion applies to deterred applicants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Our conclusion that the writers have properly stated classwide claims of discrimination in hiring does not differ for those writers who allege they were deterred from applying for television writing opportunities by the employers\u2019 policies of discrimination. The putative class is no different from those upheld in other classwide suits. <em>(Domingo v. New England Fish Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 727 F.2d 1429, 1442 [upholding the certification of a class of \u201call nonwhites who either were employed by [the defendant], applied for employment with [the defendant], or were deterred from applying for employment with [the defendant]\u201d at any time beginning 300 days prior to the date the plaintiff filed his charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].) Moreover, there is no merit in the argument that FEHA does not refer to \u201cdeterred\u201d or \u201cdiscouraged\u201d applicants. Title VII likewise does not refer to such applicants, but relief is nonetheless available to them; otherwise \u201cvictims of the most entrenched forms of discrimination\u201d might be excluded from coverage. <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 367.) So it is under FEHA. Indeed, California regulations interpreting FEHA define \u201capplicant\u201d as including \u201can individual who can prove that he or she has been deterred from applying for a job by an employer\u2019s . . . alleged discriminatory practice.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 7286.5, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Of course, the question whether a deterred applicant will be able to obtain individual relief is a different question, and one that will not arise until and unless the writers prove the employers have enforced a companywide policy of discrimination. If the writers are able to do so, they will be entitled to injunctive and perhaps other classwide relief. It is only at this point that individual claims of class members become germane. To obtain individual relief, after a pattern or practice of discrimination is proved, a writer who did not apply for television writing opportunities would have \u201cthe not always easy burden of proving that he would have applied\u201d for a position, during the limitations period, had it not been for the employer\u2019s discriminatory practices, and would have been discriminatorily rejected had he applied. <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at pp. 368-369 &amp; fn. 52.) That, however, is not the question before us. The question is merely whether a proper classwide claim of discrimination has been stated under FEHA, and the answer is that it has, as to both deterred and actual applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>B. <em>Claims by deterred applicants may not be dismissed on the basis of allegedly inconsistent statistics pled in the writers\u2019 federal complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Before leaving the subject of deterred applicants, we address one other point raised by the parties in connection with the trial court\u2019s ruling. The trial court observed that, in the earlier federal complaint in <em>Wynn, supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067, the writers alleged statistics \u201csubstantially inconsistent with viable deterred applicant claims.\u201d The writers in <em>Wynn </em>alleged, for example, that during the 1997/1998 broadcast season, writers over age 40 comprised one-third or more of the writing staffs of most employer defendants. The court concluded that the \u201cdeterred applicant futility requirements\u201d described in Teamsters\u2014which referred to a formal job application as a \u201cfutile gesture\u201d\u2014must be pled with greater specificity. While the complaints alleged that writers were deterred from applying for television writing opportunities and \u201creasonably believe[d] that it would be a futile gesture\u201d to do so for a number of reasons, the court viewed these allegations as conclusory.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The writers were given \u201cleave to plead individual claims with facts showing a legal basis for overcoming the federal pleading contradictions sufficient to satisfy, for pleading purposes, the <em>Teamsters </em>and <em>Cucuzza </em>requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the trial court had already rejected the writers\u2019 FEHA class action claims, and was instructing the writers how to amend their complaints to state individual claims. This may account for its statement that \u201cmore than pattern and practice allegations\u201d were needed to plead an individual deterred applicant claim. While we do not necessarily quarrel with that point, it does not apply where the writers are bringing only classwide claims of a pattern and practice of intentional discrimination. However, because the trial court\u2019s ruling might be read to require more specific pleading of futility in connection with the writers\u2019 classwide pattern and practice claim, we address the point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">At the pleading stage of a classwide pattern and practice claim, the <em>\u201cTeamsters </em>and <em>Cucuzza </em>requirements\u201d are completely irrelevant.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>employers correctly observe, <em>Teamsters </em>\u201cwas not a pleading case, and no subsequent case sets out the pleading requirements for the futile gesture theory . . . .\u201d It is unsurprising that no cases describe pleading requirements for a theory that has no relevance at this stage of a classwide pattern or practice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>Teamsters </em>involved an appeal after the trial of a case in which the government alleged the employer had engaged in a pattern or practice of racial discrimination in hiring. The Supreme Court upheld findings that the government had proved that racial discrimination \u201cwas the company\u2019s standard operating procedure\u2014the regular rather than the unusual practice.\u201d <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 336.) The finding of a pattern and practice, without more, justified an award of prospective relief <em>(id. </em>at p. 361), and <em>Teamsters </em>then discussed the question of individual relief for the employer\u2019s past discriminatory acts, a question which does not arise until after a policy of unlawful discrimination has been proved. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The discussion of relief included whether seniority relief could be awarded to nonapplicants. The court decided that an incumbent employee\u2019s failure to apply for a job \u201cis not an inexorable bar to an award of retroactive seniority,\u201d and that individual nonapplicants \u201cmust be given an opportunity to undertake their difficult task of proving that they should be treated as applicants and therefore are presumptively entitled to relief accordingly.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 364.) As the court described it, \u201chis [the nonapplicant\u2019s] is the not always easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those practices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 367-368.) In explaining its conclusion that failure to apply should not be a per se bar to relief, the court made several observations, including these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">1. \u201cA consistently enforced discriminatory policy can surely deter job applications from those who are aware of it and are unwilling to subject themselves to the humiliation of explicit and certain rejection.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 365.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">2. \u201cWhen a person\u2019s desire for a job is not translated into a formal application solely because of his unwillingness to engage in a futile gesture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>he is as much a victim of discrimination as is he who goes through the motions of submitting an application.\u201d <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at pp. 365-366.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The employers seize upon the terms \u201ccertain rejection\u201d and \u201cfutile gesture\u201d to conclude that nonapplicants in these cases cannot state a claim for discrimination, because the writers\u2019 own complaints show that some writers over 40 have been hired; therefore, rejection is not \u201ccertain\u201d and nonappli-cants cannot sue. This is not correct. <em>Teamsters </em>makes two points very clear: deterred applicants are not precluded from seeking relief from discrimination, although the burden of obtaining individual relief will not be an easy one. But a third point is also clear: issues of the futility of application or the certainty of rejection have nothing to do with whether the writers have properly pled a classwide claim of systematic discrimination on the basis of age. In short, nothing in <em>Teamsters </em>supports the view that writers claiming classwide discrimination must \u201cplead deterrence with greater specificity\u201d than they have done in their first amended complaints. Nor does any other case cited to us, none of which involve dismissal of a class action complaint at the pleading stage. Indeed, the only cases the employers cite for the proposition that allegations of a pattern and practice of discrimination are an insufficient basis for inclusion of deterred applicants in the class of potential claimants are the trial court decision under review and the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Wynn.</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, even <em>Wynn </em>did not go so far as to preclude the writers, on the basis of the statistics they pled, from relying on a deterred applicant theory.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In sum, it would be premature to conclude\u2014on the basis of 1997/1998 statistics alleged in the federal complaint, before any discovery has been conducted, and in the absence of any record whatsoever\u2014that no class member, at the relief stage of class action proceedings, will be able to prove he or she would have applied for a position had it not been for a particular employer\u2019s discriminatory practices. <em>(Teamsters, supra, </em>431 U.S. at p. 368.) That determination is plainly a matter for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">C. <em>The writers have not waived appellate review of their FEHA classwide claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Before turning to other aspects of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we address an argument raised by some of the employers in a demurrer to the writers\u2019 writ petition, and by others in their return. They contend the writers have waived appellate review of the trial court\u2019s order sustaining demurrers to their FEHA claims, since the court\u2019s ruling barring a class action was \u201cwithout prejudice to the Writers\u2019 right to plead individual FEHA claims.\u201d Since the writers filed a second amended complaint without pleading individual FEHA claims, the employers contend they have waived review of the trial court\u2019s demurrer rulings on those claims. Moreover, and more significantly, because the writers did not assert individual FEHA claims, they cannot obtain class certification, and their claim the trial court erred in dismissing their class claims under section 12965(b) is moot. Neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">First, because the writers have not sought review of the trial court\u2019s demurrer rulings that relate to individual FEHA claims, the contention they have waived the issue is irrelevant. The writers expressly state they were and are \u201cnot asserting individual claims, but class claims predicated upon systemic practices of discrimination in violation of \u00a7 12940 of FEHA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Second, the refusal to assert individual FEHA claims does not render class claims moot. The mootness argument is founded in the contention that the writers cannot meet the requirements for class certification without asserting individual claims, since a class representative \u201ccannot have a cause of action that is sufficiently typical of the class if he or she does not have a personal claim at all.\u201d The argument is dependent on two incorrect assumptions. The first is that no pattern or practice claim is available under FEHA. We have already rejected that contention. A second, related assumption is that a writer does \u201cnot have a personal claim at all\u201d simply because he or she asserts no individual claim for relief.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> That notion is also seriously flawed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Regardless of whether any writer asserts an individual claim, all writers seek classwide injunctive relief, to which they will be entitled if they are able to prove that any employer has engaged in systematic disparate treatment.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> (See <em>Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 2001) 267 F.3d 147, 171 [class representatives who settled and were therefore not entitled to any further monetary relief nonetheless \u201cstand to benefit from any class-wide injunctive relief that may be ordered\u201d and \u201cplainly have an interest in . . . pursuing the liability stage of the pattem-or-practice claim . . . because . . . successful prosecution ... is a prerequisite for the issuance of class-wide injunctive relief\u2019]; see also <em>Anthony v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 699, 702 [109 Cal.Rptr. 254] [reversing order of dismissal after trial court ruled action could not be maintained as class action and the plaintiffs refused to amend their complaint to state individual causes of action]; <em>Bunker v. County of Orange </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 542, 546 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 825] [trial court granted motion to strike class allegations and gave the plaintiff leave to amend to file as an individual; the plaintiff stipulated to abandoning his individual claim except insofar as it supported a right to proceed with a class action, allowing entry of judgment pursuant to the stipulation; the Court of Appeal proceeded to the merits and reversed the judgment of dismissal].) Accordingly, the fact that the writers refused to amend their complaints to assert individual claims does not negate their ability to represent the class, and does not render their class claims moot.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>We turn now to the additional issues raised by the appeals in the suits against the talent agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">V. <em>The first amended complaints sufficiently pled the talent agencies\u2019 liability for aiding and abetting violations of FEHA by the employers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The trial court, after eliminating the writers\u2019 class claims under FEHA, ruled that if the writers sought to plead individual FEHA aiding and abetting claims, \u201cthey must, as a minimum, allege the identity of the aider and abettor, knowledge that the primary violator\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of duty, and how the named defendant assisted in or encouraged the predicate violation.\u201d The propriety of that ruling is not at issue in these appeals, which relate only to the writers\u2019 classwide claims. The writers again argue, however, that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the individual claims should not be construed to require the same specificity\u2014each writer pleading how each agency assisted or encouraged particular discriminatory acts against him or her individually\u2014in order to bring a classwide claim for aiding and abetting under FEHA, and the agencies argue the contrary.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The writers are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">As the writers point out, their aiding and abetting claims are based upon allegations that each agency assisted each employer in carrying out a systemic policy of age discrimination in hiring against older writers as a class. FEHA makes it an unlawful practice for \u201cany person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this part, or to attempt to do so.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (i).) A talent agency would be liable for aiding and abetting an employer\u2019s violation of FEHA if the agency knew the employer\u2019s conduct violated FEHA and gave \u201csubstantial assistance or encouragement to the [employer] to so act. . . .\u201d <em>(Fiol v. Doellstedt </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1325 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 308].)<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The writers, as we have already held, have properly stated classwide claims of systemic discrimination by the employers. In their complaints against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>talent agencies, the writers first explain the unique hiring process in the industry, under which the availability of writing opportunities is communicated primarily through the talent agencies. The writers then allege the agency is \u201cwell aware of the pattern or practice of age discrimination by each Named Employer in connection with its employment and business dealings with older writers.\u201d In the following paragraph, each complaint asserts the basis for the agency\u2019s awareness of the employers\u2019 ageist practices, including public statements by network executives and allegations that the employers have communicated to the agency their desire to hire younger writers or to exclude older writers. Subsequent paragraphs allege the agency\u2019s financial incentive to discriminate, the agency\u2019s own pattern and practice of discrimination with respect to its representation and referral of older writers, and evidence of the agency\u2019s pattern or practice of intentional discrimination, including ageist comments, statistical disparities, and instances of refusal to submit older writers for television writing opportunities with networks and studios. The complaints specifically allege that the agency \u201chas given substantial assistance and encouragement to each Named Employer in carrying out its unlawful employment and business policies and practices in at least five ways . . . ,\u201d including the agency\u2019s refusal to represent older writers, failure to refer the older writers it represents to the employers as zealously as younger writers, communicating ageist stereotypes and motivations and thus discouraging older writers from seeking employment with the employers, and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In our view, the complaints clearly allege the agencies knew the employers were engaged in systemic discrimination on the basis of age, and gave \u201csubstantial assistance or encouragement\u201d to the employers by virtue of their own referral practices, screening out older writers in favor of younger ones.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> If the writers are able to prove these allegations, they will have established an agency\u2019s liability for aiding and abetting the employers.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The allegations meet California\u2019s fair-notice test, as they describe the writers\u2019 case \u201c \u2018with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the agency] with the nature, source and extent of [the writers\u2019] cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 608, quoting <em>Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist., supra, </em>70 Cal.2d at p. 245.)

The court concluded that the gravamen of the complaints rested in employment discrimination, and the Act does not reach employment discrimination claims. Both of the court\u2019s statements are literally correct. The writers are suing because they cannot obtain television-writing opportunities\u2014that is, employment\u2014with the networks and studios, and the Supreme Court has held that the Legislature intended \u201cto exclude the subject of discrimination in employment\u201d from the Act. <em>(Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 500 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216] <em>(Alcorn).) </em>However, the court\u2019s holding in <em>Alcorn </em>was made in the context of a claim by an employee against an employer, and subsequent precedents have explained that the Act does not cover \u201cthe <em>employer-employee </em>relationship.\u201d <em>(Isbister </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 72, 83, fn. 12 [219 Cal.Rptr. 150, 707 P.2d 212].) No such relationship exists between the talent agencies and the writers.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Instead, the agencies are business establishments that provide a service to their clients, and the Act on its face forbids them from discriminating in the provision of that service.

It concluded that the concurrent enactment in 1959 of the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEHA\u2019s predecessor) and the Act \u201cindicated a legislative intent to exclude the subject of discrimination in employment from the latter act.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>(Alcorn, supra, </em>at p. 500.) The court observed there was \u201c no indication that the Legislature intended to broaden the scope of [Civil Code] section 51to include discriminations other than those made by a \u2018business establishment\u2019 in the course of furnishing goods, services or facilities to its clients, patrons or customers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Its conclusion was substantiated, the court stated, by the concurrent enactment of extensive provisions governing discrimination in employment, which \u201cprovided] for administrative procedures for relief from such discrimination,\u201d including hiring, reinstatement, backpay and so on. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Twenty years later, the court again stated, in a discussion of the derivation of a FEHA provision, that \u201cthe Unruh Civil Rights Act has no application to employment discrimination.\u201d <em>(Rojo, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 77.)<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Nothing in <em>Rojo </em>or <em>Alcorn </em>suggests that a business establishment which provides \u201cemployment related\u201d services, or services \u201cin the employment context,\u201d is exempt from the Act. It is reasonably plain from <em>Rojo, Alcorn </em>and other cases on the subject that \u201cemployment discrimination\u201d claims not covered by the Act are confined to claims by an employee against his employer, or against an entity in the position of the employer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Indeed, in <em>Isbister v.

The agencies derive their revenues from the writers and others they represent; an agency \u201cgenerally receives a percentage of the writer\u2019s income.\u201d That is not comparable to an \u201cemployer-employee relationship,\u201d which is the only relationship the Supreme Court has stated is not covered by the Act.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The agencies contend other courts applying <em>Alcorn </em>and <em>Rojo </em>consider, as the trial court did, \u201cthe gravamen of [the complaints] in determining whether a putative Unruh Act claim is, in substance, one for employment discrimination . . . .\u201d While we do not quarrel with that general statement, a further principle can be derived from the cases cited by the talent agencies. The cases uniformly involve claims by an employee, or person in the position of an employee, against an employer or an entity in the position of employer. (E.g., <em>Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 266 F.3d 979, 989 [Latrell Sprewell\u2019s claim against the Warriors and the National Basketball Association (NBA), challenging his suspension by the NBA and contract termination by the Warriors, \u201cstemmed from his employment relationships with the NBA and the Warriors\u201d and therefore failed to state a claim under the Act]; <em>Strother </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Permanente Medical Group </em>(9th Cir. 1996) 79 F.3d 859, 873-874 [doctor\u2019s discrimination claim against her medical group, whether she was characterized as an employee or a bona fide partner in the group, was not covered by the Act; \u201cher relationship to the Medical Group is more like that of an employee than that of a \u2018client, patron or customer\u2019 \u201d; \u201cCalifornia courts continue to exclude employees from Unruh [Civil Rights] Act coverage\u201d]; <em>Robinson v. Ladd Furniture, Inc. </em>(M.D.N.C. 1994) 872 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>F.Supp. 248, 250 [reference to earlier court ruling dismissing claim under the Act because the Act \u201cdoes not apply to claims of discrimination in employment either as an independent contractor or as an employee\u201d]); <em>Gauvin v. Trombatore </em>(N.D.Cal. 1988) 682 F.Supp. 1067, 1073 [rejecting Act employment discrimination claims under the Act by owner of trucking company against the California Department of Transportation, the prime contractors and trucking subcontractors on a state freeway project; Act does not apply to the employment relationship, \u201cregardless of whether the relationship between the parties is characterized as employer-employee or contractor-subcontractor\u201d; Act applies only \u201cin the context of the supply of services or facilities to clients, patrons, or customers\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In short, the agencies are correct that the claims made in the cited cases are, in substance, claims for employment discrimination; they are all premised on an \u201cemployer-employee relationship\u201d between the plaintiffs and the defendants. <em>(Isbister, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 83, fn. 12.) The writers\u2019 claims against the agencies, however, are not. We acknowledge the obvious fact that the writers are suing because they cannot obtain television writing opportunities\u2014that is, employment\u2014with the networks and studios; the complaints are rife with references to the loss of or lack of access to \u201ctelevision writing opportunities.\u201d And, the writers describe their damages as \u201closs of employment and business and opportunities for employment and business and lost income.\u201d However, those facts do not convert the writers\u2019 claims against the talent agencies into the kind of \u201cdiscrimination in employment\u201d that is outside the coverage of the Act. The writers are suing the agencies for illegally refusing to provide services that are essential to the writers\u2019 ultimate objective of obtaining employment with the networks and studios. The writers allege they cannot obtain opportunities with the networks and studios because they cannot secure the representation services of the talent agencies, without which it is \u201cvirtually impossible for an individual to apply for a television writing opportunity\u2014much less actually obtain such an opportunity . . . .\u201d Specifically, the writers complain that the talent agencies have \u201cfail[ed] and refus[ed] to contract for representation with (or to otherwise transact business with) [the writers] on the basis of age.\u201d The writers\u2019 claim is for discriminatory refusal to provide services to the writers; it is not a claim of discrimination in \u201cthe employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>(Isbister, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 83, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In sum, while the writers\u2019 claims against the agencies unquestionably relate to their objective of obtaining television writing opportunities with the networks and studios, they are patently not the sort of claims that are excluded from coverage under the Act. Excluded claims are confined to those involving an employer-employee or equivalent relationship between a plaintiff and defendant. The statute on its face applies to the talent agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>as business establishments providing services to their writer clients. Excepting talent agencies from the purview of the Act would be fundamentally at odds both with the Act\u2019s plain language and with the Supreme Court\u2019s direction \u201cto interpret the Act\u2019s coverage \u2018in the broadest sense reasonably possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Isbister, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 76, quoting <em>Burks v. Poppy Construction Co. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 468 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313].) Consequently, we conclude talent agencies are subject to the Act, and the trial court erred in sustaining their demurrers to the writers\u2019 claims under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Before leaving this subject, one anomaly must be noted. The parties confine their discussion to the Act, but the complaints specifically allege violations of Civil Code section 51.5, which the writers identify as the Act. In fact, the Act consists only of Civil Code section 51, which is quoted at the beginning of this discussion. Civil Code section 51.5 was added to the code in 1976, and, like the Act, applies to \u201cbusiness establishments] of any kind whatsoever . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.5, subd. (a).) Section 51.5 specifies that business establishments may not \u201cdiscriminate against, boycott or blacklist, or refuse to buy from, contract with, sell to, or trade with any person in this state\u201d on the same bases listed in the Act.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Few cases have construed section 51.5.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The legislative intent to exclude employment discrimination from the Act, which <em>Alcorn </em>drew from the concurrent enactment of the Act and FEHA\u2019s predecessor, would not necessarily apply to section 51.5, which was enacted more than 16 years later. In any event, our conclusion that the Act applies, since there is no employer-employee relationship between the agencies and the writers, necessarily means that the writers\u2019 claims are appropriately brought under either or both the Act and Civil Code section 51.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We proceed to the question whether amendments to FEHA, which now permits claims against employment agencies for age discrimination, are retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>VII. <em>Amendments to FEHA effective January 1, 2003, adding age to the bases of discrimination constituting unlawful employment practices by employment agencies, do not apply retroactively.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The trial court concluded the writers cannot sue the talent agencies for direct violations of FEHA, because FEHA did not create direct liability for age discrimination by employment agencies until the passage of amendments effective January 1, 2003.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The trial court found those amendments constituted a change in the law and do not have retroactive effect. We agree that the amendments, as they apply to employment agencies in Government Code, section 12940, subdivision (d), do not apply retroactively. We describe first the circumstances which gave rise to the FEHA amendments, and then turn to the question of their retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">A. <em>Background of the FEHA amendments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">From its passage in 1980 and until 2003, FEHA contained two separate provisions. One of them, Government Code, former section 12940, governed employers and, in various subdivisions, employment agencies and others. That section prohibited various discriminatory practices based on race, religious creed, color and other classifications. A separate provision, former section 12941, subdivision (a), governed discrimination on the basis of age, and applied only to employers. Specifically, former section 12941, subdivision (a), made it an unlawful employment practice \u201cfor an employer to refuse to hire or employ, or to discharge, dismiss, reduce, suspend, or demote, any individual over the age of 40 on the ground of age . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In June 2002, the California Supreme Court, affirming a Court of Appeal decision, held that neither Government Code, section 12940 nor section 12941 prohibited discrimination in the terms, conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of age. <em>(Esberg v. Union Oil Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 262, 267 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 47 P.3d 1069] <em>(Esberg) </em>[employer\u2019s refusal to fund advanced degree for 53-year-old worker, while doing so for younger employees, did not violate FEHA].) <em>Esberg </em>found the statute was unambiguous: \u201cSection 12940 prohibit[ed] employment discrimination in the furnishing of benefits, but not employment discrimination based on age, while section 12941 prohibit[ed] employment discrimination based on age, but not employment discrimination in the furnishing of benefits.\u201d <em>(Esberg, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The Legislature then passed Assembly Bill No. 1599, which amended Government Code, section 12940 and repealed section 12941. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>its legislative history, Assembly Bill No. 1599 addressed the <em>Esberg </em>decision \u201cby deleting the California code section which address [ed] age discrimination [section 12941] and transferring that prohibition to its companion code section [section 12940] which addresses the other prohibited bases of discrimination. This results in age discrimination being expressly prohibited in training programs and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.\u201d (Assem. Floor Analysis, Cone, in Sen. Amends, to Assem. Bill No. 1599 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 22, 2002, p. 3.) The act as passed expressly provided, in an uncodified statement of legislative intent, that: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to constme and clarify the meaning and effect of existing law and to reject the interpretation given to the law in Esberg v. Union Oil Company of California, 87 Cal.App.4th 378 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 477] (2001).\u201d (Stats. 2002, ch. 525, \u00a7 4.)<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The 2002 amendments became effective on January 1, 2003. In addition to adding age as a protected classification in section 12940, subdivision (a), which defines unlawful employment practices by employers, the amendments, among other things, added age as a prohibited basis of discrimination under subdivision (d), which applies to employment agencies as well as employers.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">B. <em>Principles governing retroactivity and their application to the 2002 FEHA amendments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The principles applicable to a determination of retroactivity are described in <em>Western Security Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 232, 243-244 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 933 P.2d 507] <em>(Western Security). </em>Statutes do not operate retrospectively\u2014that is, operate to change the legal consequences of past events\u2014unless the Legislature plainly intended them to do so. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 243.) When the Legislature plainly intends retrospective operation, the court is obliged to carry out that intent unless due process considerations require otherwise. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>A corollary to these principles is that a statute which merely clarifies existing law, rather than changing it, does not operate retrospectively, \u201cbecause the true meaning of the statute remains the same.\u201d <em>(Western Security, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 243.) A legislative declaration of a statute\u2019s meaning is given due consideration, but is not conclusive. \u201cUltimately, the interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power the Constitution assigns to the courts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 244.) While a court need not accept a legislative assurance that an unmistakable change in the law is merely a clarification, the Legislature\u2019s declaration of intent \u201cmay still effectively reflect the Legislature\u2019s purpose to achieve a retrospective change.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In that case, the court must give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent unless there is a constitutional impediment to doing so. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Applying the <em>Western Security </em>principles, we first conclude that, despite the Legislature\u2019s declaration of its intention \u201cto construe and clarify the meaning and effect of existing law,\u201d the FEHA amendments in fact changed then-existing law in several ways, including its application to employment agencies. Government Code, former section 12940, subdivision (d), which applied to employment agencies,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> did not include age among the prohibited bases of discrimination. Former section 12941, which covered age discrimination, did not impose any liability on employment agencies. Moreover, the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest of Assembly Bill No. 1599, after describing existing provisions on unlawful employment practices by employment agencies, specifically stated that the amended provision \u201cwould add age to the bases of discrimination constituting these unlawful employment practices.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 1599 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) Stats. 2002, ch. 525.) Consequently, so far as employment agencies are concerned, we are compelled to conclude that the FEHA amendments effected an unmistakable change in the law, rather than merely a clarification of existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">As <em>Western Security </em>instructs, however, we must give due consideration to the Legislature\u2019s declaration of intent, since it may reflect the Legislature\u2019s purpose to achieve a retrospective change in the law.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> <em>(Western Security, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 244.) As will appear, we can discern no clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>expression of the Legislature\u2019s intent to subject employment agencies to liability for conduct that predated the amendments. We therefore conclude that, as applied to employment agencies, those amendments may not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We do not decide whether the 2002 FEHA amendments are retroactive in their application to employers, or whether, as stated in Assembly Bill No. 1599, those amendments merely clarified existing law in that respect. That question is not before us. It is clear, however, that the expression of legislative intent in Assembly Bill No. 1599 is directed at existing law as it was interpreted in Esberg, and that <em>Esberg </em>had nothing to do with employment agency liability.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s intent to clarify the law and reject the <em>Esberg </em>holding does not necessarily mean the Legislature intended every provision of the 2002 amendments to apply retroactively. Indeed, while the Legislature stated its intent to clarify the law as applied in <em>Esberg, </em>the legislative analyses also clearly indicate that, in other respects, the Legislature intended to make substantive changes to existing law. The clearest example involves the application of the amendments to labor organizations. The final Assembly analysis states that, in addition to expressly prohibiting age discrimination in training and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment, the bill \u201cadds age to the existing bases of discrimination outlawed by labor organizations.\u201d (Assem. Floor Analysis, Conc, in Sen. Amends, to Assem. Bill No. 1599, <em>supra, </em>p. 3.) The report proceeds to expressly state that labor organizations \u201cdo not fall under the existing age discrimination statute when they act as unions with respect to their members or with respect to employers. This bill closes this statutory loophole . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Accordingly, while the Legislature clearly intended to \u201cclarify . . . existing law\u201d in some respects\u2014to reject Esberg\u2014it just as clearly intended to change the law in other respects. Assembly Bill No. 1599 does not expressly declare that any of its provisions are retroactive. In short, we cannot see any clear expression of legislative intent with respect to the retroactivity of the 2002 FEHA amendments as a whole. The most we can say is that the Legislature intended to clarify existing law by rejecting the court\u2019s decision in <em>Esberg, </em>which was unrelated to the liability of an employment agency. Absent a clear indication of legislative intent to subject employment agencies to liability for conduct that predated the amendments, we cannot construe the amendments to do so. (See <em>Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 828, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>840 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 40, 50 P.3d 751] [subjecting companies to liability for past conduct that was lawful when it occurred is impermissible unless there is an express intent of the Legislature to do so].) Therefore, since there is no clear legislative intent to impose retroactive liability on employment agencies, we apply the general presumption that statutes operate prospectively, and conclude the talent agencies have no direct liability under FEHA for conduct predating January 1, 2003. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 843 [ambiguity on the question of retroactivity requires court to construe statute as \u201c \u2018unambiguously prospective\u2019 \u201d], quoting <em>INS v. St. Cyr </em>(2001) 533 U.S. 289, 320, fn. 45 [150 L.Ed.2d 347, 121 S.Ct. 2271].)<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We proceed next to the questions raised by the appeals and the writ petition filed in the wake of the trial court\u2019s August 14, 2003 order relating to the writers\u2019 second amended complaints seeking relief under the UCL.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">VIII. <em>The writers are not required to allege potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception in order to state a claim under the UCL.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The writers\u2019 second amended complaints allege that the discriminatory policies or practices of the employers and the talent agencies constitute unfair business practices within the meaning of the UCL because they deny equal employment opportunities to the writers on account of their age. The trial court sustained demurrers to the writers\u2019 UCL representative claims, with leave to amend. With respect to the employers, the trial court ruled the complaints must include \u201cgeneral allegations showing potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception.\u201d Similarly, the complaints against the talent agencies were to include allegations \u201cgenerally explaining how Agency Defendants] aided and abetted Employer Defendants\u2019 potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception.\u201d We conclude the trial court\u2019s rulings were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The UCL defines \u201cunfair competition\u201d to include \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent\u201d business act or practice. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) It has long been settled that the UCL\u2019s \u201csweeping language\u201d permits a court to enjoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ongoing wrongful business conduct \u201cin whatever context such activity might occur.\u201d <em>(Barquis v.

The UCL is not confined to \u201canti-competitive\u201d business practices. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Additionally, its coverage is not limited to \u201cdeceptive\u201d practices. <em>(Ibid.) A </em>practice is enjoin-able as unlawful \u201ctotally apart from its inherent \u2018fairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 112.) <em>Barquis </em>quoted with approval a commentator\u2019s note that it was difficult to discern any legislative purpose other than \u201c \u2018to extend the meaning of unfair competition to anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 113.)<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court of Appeal has expressly held that age discrimination in violation of FEHA is an unlawful employment practice that may be enjoined under the UCL, whose remedies are cumulative. <em>(Herr v.

Neither is meritorious. First, William Morris contends that the trial court sustained the agencies\u2019 demurrers for lack of specificity, not because potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception was required to state such a claim. We are unmoved by this contention, which requires us to ignore the plain words of the court\u2019s ruling, which were: \u201c[T]he Court and litigants will benefit from additional pleadings tying Agency Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding Employer Defendants\u2019 purported burdens on competition and consumers.

The court required \u201cthat any finding of unfairness to competitors under section 17200 be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 186-187.)<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The court explicitly noted that \u201c[nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging . . . \u2018fraudulent\u2019 or \u2018unlawful\u2019 business practices . . . .\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 187, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>William Morris points to <em>post-Cel-Tech </em>cases suggesting that all claims of unfairness under the UCL \u201cshould be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy . . . .\u201d <em>(Schnall v.

Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 845, 854 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 389].) Even if that is so, it does not assist the agencies, because the writers are claiming that agency practices are \u201cunlawful\u201d as well as \u201cunfair,\u201d and the claim of unfairness would in any event be \u201ctethered to some legislatively declared policy\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 186), as there is plainly a legislatively declared policy against age discrimination. In short, even if the <em>Cel-Tech </em>formulation defining unfair conduct applies, nothing in that formulation suggests that unfairness, in the context of an age discrimination claim, requires a showing of potential competitive harm or consumer deception. The <em>Barquis </em>principle\u2014that unfair competition includes anything that is both a business practice and forbidden by law\u2014remains, in our view, fully viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">IX. <em>The trial court correctly ruled that it has no authority to award classwide backpay to the writers under the UCL.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The writers seek an injunctive decree under the UCL preventing the employers from continuing to engage in the ageist hiring practices that have excluded them from the market for writing positions. They contend that an order compelling the employers to reimburse the class for wages lost as a result of these practices\u2014classwide backpay\u2014would be an indispensable part of the effectiveness of such injunctive relief, and that the UCL authorizes the trial court to effectuate an injunction through an award of backpay. The trial court ruled to the contrary, concluding the writers cannot obtain any form of monetary relief under the UCL. We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Business &amp; Professions Code section 17203 describes the remedies available under the UCL. It authorizes the court to make orders: \u201cas may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,... or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The writers concede they cannot obtain restitution under the second clause of the quoted language (the \u201crestore\u201d prong), because it is settled that restitution is available only if a defendant has wrongfully acquired funds or property in which a plaintiff has an ownership or vested interest. <em>(Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1149 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937] <em>(Korea Supply).) </em>However, the writers contend the trial court may order classwide backpay under the first clause of the quoted language (the \u201cprevent\u201d prong), which authorizes \u201csuch orders ... as may be necessary to prevent\u201d a practice that is unlawful under the UCL. The writers argue the UCL does not restrict the court\u2019s general equity jurisdiction, and the court may exercise the full range of its inherent equitable powers under the \u201cprevent\u201d prong. Therefore, in a class action, if the court were to determine that an order of classwide backpay into a fluid recovery fund were necessary to prevent the employers from maintaining their ageist hiring practices, and to deter others from similar practices, the court would have the authority to make such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We cannot agree that the trial court has the authority to award backpay in a UCL class action. The writers\u2019 premise\u2014that the court\u2019s inherent equitable powers are unrestricted in a UCL action\u2014is fundamentally erroneous, and at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions construing the statute. We begin with some well-established principles, and then turn to the precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">First, while the scope of conduct covered by the UCL is broad, its remedies are limited. A UCL action is equitable in nature, and damages cannot be recovered. <em>(Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1144.) Prevailing plaintiffs \u201care generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 179.) There is a \u201cbalance struck in this state\u2019s unfair competition law between broad liability and limited relief.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1152.) Consequently, any consumer may seek an injunction against unfair business practices, and \u201c[ajctual direct victims of unfair competition may obtain restitution as well.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The courts have not, however, expressly permitted any form of monetary relief that is not restitutionary in nature. The Supreme Court\u2019s most expansive description of the restitutionary relief potentially available is a statement that court orders under the \u201cprevent\u201d prong of Business and Professions Code, section 17203 \u201cmay encompass broader restitutionary relief, including disgorgement of all money so obtained [from the use of unfair business practices] even when it may not be possible to restore all of that money to direct victims of the practice.\u201d <em>(Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 129 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 999 P.2d <em>718](Kraus).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Second, the Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend [Business and Professions Code] section 17203 to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>courts with <em>unlimited </em>equitable powers.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1147.) More particularly, \u201c[a] court cannot, under the equitable powers of section 17203, award whatever form of monetary relief it believes might deter unfair practices.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1148.) Accordingly, the writers\u2019 claim that a trial court may award whatever \u201cancillary monetary relief\u2019 it deems necessary to effectuate an injunction is incorrect. Moreover, the relevant precedents counsel against expanding the monetary relief available under the UCL to include classwide backpay in the absence of any indication the Legislature intended to provide such a remedy. We briefly review the two most pertinent decisions, both of which declined an expansive construction of the court\u2019s general equitable power under section 17203.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In <em>Kraus, </em>the Supreme Court held that disgorgement of unfairly obtained profits into a fluid recovery fund is not an available remedy in a representative action brought under the UCL. <em>(Kraus, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 121.)<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> In <em>Kraus, </em>the court reviewed the legislative history of the UCL, and concluded nothing in that history suggested fluid recovery was contemplated by the UCL itself. <em>(Kraus, supra, </em>at p. 129.) <em>Kraus </em>further observed that \u201cthe court\u2019s inherent equitable power may not be exercised in a manner inconsistent with the legislative intent underlying . . . .\u201d the UCL. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 131, fn. 14.)<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Because the Legislature expressly authorized fluid recovery in class actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 384), and did not sanction fluid recovery orders as an equitable power available to the court in other proceedings, the court \u201cdecline[d] to read the grant of equitable power in Business and Professions Code, section 17203 as encompassing the authority to fashion a fluid recovery remedy when the action has not been certified as [a] class action.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> <em>(Kraus, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>A few years later, in <em>Korea Supply, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that a court\u2019s general equitable powers under Business and Professions Code, section 17203 were broad enough to encompass nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits to an individual.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> <em>(Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1147.) The court again explained that restitution is the only monetary remedy expressly authorized by section 17203 . Since nonres-titutionary disgorgement was not expressly authorized by the statute, \u201cwe determine whether the Legislature intended to authorize such a remedy under section 17203.\u201d (29 Cal.4th at p. 1146.) The court stated: \u201cWe have previously found that the Legislature did not intend section 17203 to provide courts with <em>unlimited </em>equitable powers. In <em>Kraus, </em>we rejected the argument . . . that the general grant of equitable authority in section 17203 implicitly permitted a disgorgement remedy\u2014in that case, into a fluid recovery fund in a representative action. We found that since there was nothing in the express language of the statute or its legislative history indicating that the Legislature intended to provide such a remedy, the remedy was not available. [Citation.] Here, again, we find nothing to indicate that the Legislature intended to authorize a court to order a defendant to disgorge all profits to a plaintiff who does not have an ownership interest in those profits.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The court expressly considered the two separate prongs of Business and Professions Code, section 17203, and concluded that: \u201cA court cannot, under the equitable powers of section 17203, award whatever form of monetary relief it believes might deter unfair practices. The fact that the \u2018restore\u2019 prong of section 17203 is the only reference to monetary penalties in this section indicates that the Legislature intended to limit the available monetary remedies under the act.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1148, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">From <em>Kraus </em>and <em>Korea Supply, </em>it is clear that the Legislature intended to limit the available monetary remedies under the UCL and, because classwide backpay is not expressly authorized, we must look to \u201cwhether the Legislature intended to authorize such a remedy under section 17203.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1146.) The answer is clearly no. No intimation in the extensive description of the statute\u2019s legislative history in <em>Kraus </em>indicates that the Legislature intended to provide a backpay remedy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>connection with the general equitable powers granted in Business and Professions Code section 17203.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Additionally, the writers do not point to anything in the legislative history to suggest a legislative intention to provide a backpay remedy under the UCL.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> They merely cite general precedents predating <em>Kraus </em>and <em>Korea Supply </em>for the general proposition that the jurisdiction to enjoin includes all the inherent equitable powers necessary to provide complete relief.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> But <em>Kraus </em>and <em>Korea Supply </em>clearly instruct that the court\u2019s equitable powers under the \u201cprevent\u201d prong of section 17203 are limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The writers point out that, while <em>Kraus </em>held that disgorgement of unfairly obtained profits into a fluid recovery fund is not an available remedy in a representative action under the UCL, the Legislature has expressly authorized disgorgement into a fluid recovery fund in class actions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 384), and this is a class action. While that is so, it is irrelevant. The writers do not seek disgorgement of unlawfully obtained profits into a fluid recovery fund; they seek an award of classwide backpay into a fluid recovery fund.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> It may well be that in a proper case a court may order disgorgement of profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>into a fluid recovery fund in a UCL class action; at least one case has so held. (See <em>Corbett v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 649, 655 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 46] [where a class has properly been certified, a plaintiff in a UCL action may seek disgorgement of unlawful profits into a fluid recovery fund].) Fluid recovery in class actions, however, is merely a method of paying out damages after they have been awarded. <em>(Bruno </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>127 Cal.App.3d at p. 131, fn. 6.) The question is not whether the trial court could order fluid class recovery of a damages award; it is whether the trial court has the authority to award nonrestitutionary backpay under the UCL in the first instance. It does not. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Korea Supply, </em>the \u201cnonrestitutionary disgorgement remedy sought by plaintiff closely resembles a claim for damages, something that is not permitted under the UCL.\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 1150-1151.) So it is with the backpay remedy sought by the writers.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In sum, the rationale stated in <em>Kraus </em>and <em>Korea Supply </em>is controlling. The general grant of equitable authority in Business and Professions Code, section 17203 does not implicitly permit a nonrestitutionary backpay award, just as in <em>Kraus </em>and <em>Korea Supply </em>it did not implicitly permit a disgorgement remedy. Because there is \u201cnothing in the express language of the statute or its legislative history indicating that the Legislature intended to provide . . . .\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1147) a classwide backpay remedy, that remedy is not available. Accordingly, the trial court correctly sustained the employers\u2019 demurrers to the writers\u2019 UCL class claims, since the only remedy available to the writers is injunctive relief, which is obtainable to the same extent through the writers\u2019 representative actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The writ petitions in No. B165638 are granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of January 16, 2003, sustaining the demurrers of the networks and studios and to enter a new and different order overruling the demurrers. Costs are awarded to the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The motion to dismiss the appeals in the lawsuits against the talent agencies (No. B166009) is denied. The trial court\u2019s order of January 16, 2003 is affirmed to the extent it holds the appellants may not sue the talent agencies directly under the Fair Employment and Housing Act for conduct occurring prior to January 1, 2003, and is otherwise reversed. The causes are remanded with instructions to overrule the demurrers of the talent agencies to the first amended complaints. The appellants are to recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The writ petition in No. B170564 is granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of August 14, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>to the extent the order requires the petitioners to amend their claims under the unfair competition law to allege potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception, and to enter a new and different order overruling the demurrer of William Morris Agency to the petitioners\u2019 second amended complaint on that ground. Costs are awarded to the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The trial court\u2019s order of August 14, 2003, is affirmed (No. B170629) to the extent it sustains, without leave to amend, the respondents\u2019 demurrers to the appellants\u2019 class claims under the unfair competition law.

(Vasquez, <em>supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 807.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> The writers have a different \u201cplain language\u201d argument, which we also reject. They contend that, even if section 12965(b) bars the <em>Wynn </em>plaintiffs from filing a successive class action in state court, writers who did not participate in Wynn\u2014by far the majority of the writers bringing these suits\u2014may bring their class claims in state court. The writers base this notion on the statutory language: FEHA class claims may not be brought \u201cby the person or persons claiming to be aggrieved\u201d where \u201cthose persons\u201d have filed a comparable class action in the federal courts. The writers assert this means that only the named plaintiffs in <em>Wynn </em>would be barred from bringing class claims in state court. That cons traction, however, would render section 12965(b) meaningless. It would allow identical class claims to be filed concurrently in federal and state courts\u2014a circumstance the Legislature clearly intended to prevent\u2014by the simple device of having different named plaintiffs in each suit. This is an absurd consequence that the Legislature could not have intended. We conclude that, where the prospective class is the same, the identity of the named plaintiffs does not affect the question whether a FEHA class action in state court is, or is not, barred by section 12965(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> See, for example, Wilson, The Columbia Guide to Standard American English (1993) &lt;http://www.bartleby.com/68/50/4750.html&gt; (as of Aug. 4, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\"> On this point, the talent agencies confine themselves to the argument that the statutory language is unambiguous and that any other arguments are irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\"> The employers offer a single page from the legislative history. This is a Senate Democratic Caucus report that refers to an increase in the number of complaints to the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC); it nowhere refers to judicial resources, and refers to the class action provision of the bill only in its description of the legislation. Our own review found only one tangential reference to judicial resources, and that appeared in the Department of Finance\u2019s report on the enrolled bill. The analysis of the fiscal effect of the bill included the following: \u201cFEPC believes that few complainants would use the option of bringing civil action in a superior court. Such action would be time-consuming and costly if the complainant loses. The vast majority of complainants would probably wait for FEPC investigation of their complaint and then accept the FEPC decision. The bill would, however, create some additional caseload for the court system to absorb and would relieve FEPC of a small portion of caseload backlogged over 150 days.\u2019\u2019 (Cal. Dept. of Finance, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 738 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 25, 1977, p. 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> Our review of the legislative history reveals the following information. The class action provision was included in Senate amendments to a 1977 bill (Assem. Bill No. 738 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) as introduced by Assembly Member Lockyer Mar. 3, 1977) which restructured the FEPC to provide a different distribution of functions between the FEPC and the Division of Fair Employment Practices of the Department of Industrial Relations (Division). The legislative history shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">1. Assembly Bill No. 738 was an attempt to remedy a situation in which the organization of the FEPC was \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d for the timely processing of the hundreds of discrimination complaints received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">2. As passed by the Assembly, the bill empowered the Division to investigate, conciliate and prosecute all complaints alleging discriminatory practices; provided for an administrative hearing officer system within the FEPC to hear accusations filed by the Division; provided that the hearing officer\u2019s decision be confirmed or set aside by the FEPC; and allowed the Division to initiate class action suits against discriminatory practices and seek temporary restraining orders to protect aggrieved parties in certain instances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">3. The Senate amendments eliminated the provisions for an administrative hearing officer system and for action by the FEPC on the decisions of hearing officers. According to the Digest of the Assembly Office of Research, those amendments also provided that \u201cthe division cannot initiate class action suits if the aggrieved persons have filed a similar suit in a federal court.\u201d (Assem. Office of Research, Unfinished Business, Assem. Conc, in Sen. Amends. Digest, Assem. Bill No. 738, as amended Sept. 12, 1977, p. 1.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">4. The provision specifying that civil actions may not be filed as class actions by persons claiming to be aggrieved, where those persons have filed a civil class action in the federal courts, was added in the Senate on August 17, 1977. After additional Senate amendments on September 2 and 12, 1977, the measure was passed on September 15, 1977. The available documents offer no rationale for the amendment. The bill was enrolled on September 19, 1977.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">5. The analysis in the Enrolled Bill Report of the Department of Industrial Relations states that: \u201cThe Chief [of the Division] or her authorized representative may file a complaint on her or his own initiative. Class action authority is specified. However, a class action in the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>may not be filed if the complainant has already filed a class action in federal court alleging a comparable claim against the same defendant.\u201d (Cal. Dept. of Industrial Relations, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 738 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 21, 1977, p. 1.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">6. The findings in the Enrolled Bill Report of the Department of Finance state that: \u201cThe bill further provides that if a party has brought suit (civil class-action) in the Federal courts alleging a comparable claim of employment discrimination against the same defendant(s), they may not also sue in the superior courts.\u201d (Cal. Dept. of Finance, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 738, <em>supra, </em>p. 2.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">7. Assembly Member Lockyer\u2019s letter urging the Governor to approve the legislation describes the bill as follows: \u201cSpecifically, the measure would empower the Division to receive, investigate, and attempt to conciliate complaints. Failing conciliation, the Division would prosecute cases before the Commission [FEPC], Strict time limits are imposed on the disposition of complaints; should the Division fail to resolve a complaint within the specified time, the complainant would have the right of private civil action. The bill also permits the filing of class action complaints for the purpose of eliminating industry-wide discriminatory practices.\u201d (Assembly Member Lockyer letter to Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. re Assem. Bill No. 738 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 23, 1977.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">8. The bill was signed by the Governor on September 30, 1977.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b329-13\"> Only one other case has interpreted the class action provision of section 12965(b). <em>(Stender </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1991) 766 F.Supp. 830. <em>Stender </em>held that section 12965(b) does not preclude the filing of pendant FEHA claims in a federal class action alleging race and sex discrimination. We agree with the employers that <em>Stender </em>did not address the question before this court, and is not of particular assistance to our analysis. <em>Stender, </em>however, does assume the same reading of section 12965(b) that we adopt; the court notes the general principle that Government Code section 12965 \u201cpreclude[s] parallel state and federal court class actions\u201d (766 F.Supp. at p. 832), and refers to the provision as \u201cprohibiting the filing of a FEHA class action where comparable non-FEHA class claims are pending in federal court. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b329-17\"> The employers claim section 12965(b) would be \u201cpractically useless\u201d if it prevents only concurrent class actions.

Suffice it to say that a prohibition on concurrent class actions is not \u201cpractically useless.\u201d A final decision on the merits in a federal class claim will bar a plaintiff from pursuing a comparable claim in state courts under res judicata doctrine. (See <em>Johnson v. American Airlines, Inc. </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 427 [203 Cal.Rptr. 638].) Indeed, in this case all claims the federal court dismissed with prejudice are, as the writers concede, decisions on the merits that cannot be further pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> The employers point out that construing section 12965(b) to prohibit successive class claims would not affect individual FEHA claims, and that is true.

(Gov. Code, \u00a7 12652, subd. (c)(10).)

Therefore, <em>Richards </em>included the third prong, which sets an outside limit on the length of time a course of conduct may continue before it will be barred, [f] <em>Richards </em>determined that a lack of permanence should be one of the factors necessary to apply the continuing violation doctrine in order to fairly balance the employee\u2019s interest in resolving the dispute with the employer\u2019s interest in preventing indefinite delays.

In <em>Herr, </em>the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that age discrimination was an \u201cintra company\u201d matter which was not injurious to competitors or consumers, stating that actual injury to competition is not a required element of a UCL violation. <em>Herr </em>went on to state that it was \u201cself-evident\u201d that older workers are frequently more highly compensated than younger workers, and therefore an employer who practices age discrimination may have an unfair competitive edge over employers who comply with FEHA. <em>(Herr, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.4th at p. 790.) The trial court contrasted <em>Herr's </em>\u201cself-evident\u201d principle with the circumstances in this case, where the employers have represented that hiring younger writers does not reduce their costs and the writers have not alleged otherwise. Since there is no \u201cself-evident\u201d harm to competition or consumers, the court concluded the writers must amend to include allegations showing potential competitive harm or likely consumer deception. While <em>Herr </em>said employers practicing age discrimination \u201cmay have an unfair competitive edge\u201d over those who do not, the point appears to be unnecessary to its decision.
