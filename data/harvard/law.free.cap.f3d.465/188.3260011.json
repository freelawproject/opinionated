Alvarado-Hernandez now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence because his prior sexual assault conviction did not constitute a crime of violence. Because his prior conviction meets a common-sense definition of crime of violence, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Alvarado-Hernandez pleaded guilty to reentering the United States illegally after deportation. At his sentencing, the district court rejected Alvarado-Hernandez\u2019s argument that a prior Texas conviction for consensual sex with a person less than seventeen-years-old under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) was not a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Consequently, the district court increased Alvarado-Hernandez\u2019s base-offense level by sixteen levels and sentenced him to forty-six to fifty-seven months imprisonment. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a sixteen-level upward adjustment for an illegal-entry defendant with a prior conviction for a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). An offense qualifies as a crime of violence if it includes an element of force or constitutes an enumerated offense. <em>Id. </em>cmt. (n.l(B)(iii)). Included among the enumerated offenses are the crimes of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d and \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">This court uses a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to determine if the defendant\u2019s offense qualifies as an enumerated offense in the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201ccommon-sense approach\u201d requires a determination of the generic and contemporary meaning); <em>see also United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 274-75 (5th Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-18\">The Texas statute at issue meets a common sense definition of \u201cstatutory rape.\u201d This statute punishes consensual sexual intercourse with a child, defined as a person younger than the age of seventeen. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.011(a)(2), (c)(1). Alvarado-Hernandez\u2019s prior conviction was based on an indictment that charged him with having consensual sexual intercourse with a fourteen-year-old victim, sufficient to meet a common-sense as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>a generic, contemporary definition of statutory rape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>163 Fed.Appx. 306, 307-08 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Luciano-Rodriguez, </em>442 F.3d 320 (5th Cir.2006), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied</em>, \u2014 F.3d -, 2006 WL 2235104 (5th Cir. Aug.3, 2006), in which we held that because Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(1) defines sexual assault to include those offenses where \u201cassent is rendered a legal nullity by the statute,\u201d a conviction under subsection (a)(1) is not a forcible sex offense and thus not a crime of violence. <em>Luciano-Rodriguez </em>involved a prior conviction under subsection (a)(1) of the statute, which prohibits intentional or knowing sexual penetration \u201cwithout the consent\u201d of the other person. By contrast, this case involves a prior conviction under subsection (a)(2), which prohibits intentional or knowing sexual penetration regardless of consent. <em>Luciano-Rodriguez </em>controls only those cases in which the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was under subsection (a)(1) because the victim\u2019s consent is relevant only under that subsection. Moreover, the holding in <em>Luciano-Rodriguez </em>went only to the issue whether an offense under subsection (a)(1) fit within the enumerated offense of \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d The issue here, however, is whether Alvarado-Hernandez\u2019s prior offense under subsection (a)(2) constitutes the enumerated offense of \u201cstatutory rape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Alvarado-Hernandez\u2019s prior conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.011(a)(2) was for a crime of violence. The defendant\u2019s attempt to draw distinctions between the Texas statute and the Model Penal Code is without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. Albeit under a different guideline provision, we have previously characterized an offense under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2) as statutory rape. <em>See United States v. Houston, </em>364 F.3d 243, 246-48 (5th Cir.2004) (declining crime of violence enhancement because guideline provision did not have the use of force as an element and did not include statutory rape as an enumerated offense). Unlike the guideline provision in <em>Houston, </em>the provision at issue in this case, \u00a7 2L1.2, specifically enumerates statutory rape as a crime of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">. We also reject Alvarado-Hernandez\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Alvarado-Hernandez's constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1226, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Alvarado-Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Alvarado-Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Totres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
