Petitioner manufactured and distributed in interstate commerce products known as Comeo 2, Iron Waterproofing; Comeo 4, Waterproofing Paste; and Comeo 6, Transparent Waterproofing. For the purpose of inducing the purchase of its products petitioner circulated advertising folders, pamphlets and circular letters through the mail. Typical of the statements contained therein are the .following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-22\">\u201cYou can now permanently stop all leaks and seepage in concrete, brick, stone and tile; also waterproof below water-level basements and pits under pressure. Comeo No. 2, our own waterproofing will do the job. This is a special chemical mixture of iron and other chemicals that, when mixed with water only, and brushed into the cracks of walls and floors needing repair will permanently waterproof and stop leaks under all conditions no matter how severe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-23\">\u201cFor after-construction waterproofing problems in foundations. Permanently waterproofs concrete, brick, stone and tile walls and floors from either inside or outside. For all classes of construction where a positive waterproof condition is necessary. Successful under all conditions no matter how severe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-24\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-25\">\u201cComeo 6, Comeo Transparent Waterproofing. A transparent water repellant liquid that effectively seals and waterproofs concrete, brick, stone, stucco, plaster or masonry surfaces. Makes surface permanently nonabsorbent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-26\">And:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-27\">\u201cComeo 4, Comeo waterproofing paste for new construction work. Produces a close-meshed concrete that increases strength and permanently waterproofs. Makes concrete flow easily around reinforcing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-28\">After due notice the first hearing was had in Chicago, Illinois. The two principal officers of petitioner appeared without counsel, and one of them testified. The Commission\u2019s attorney there notified petitioner\u2019s officers that a subsequent hearing would be held in Washington, D. C. for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the purpose of receiving the testimony of three technicians of the National Bureau of Standards as to certain tests which had been made on samples of petitioner\u2019s products. Prior to the hearing in Washington the Commission\u2019s trial attorney on two occasions suggested to petitioner\u2019s officers that an attorney be engaged to represent petitioner. Although timely notified of the time and place, no-one appeared for petitioner at the Washington hearing. During the course of that hearing a letter was received from petitioner requesting a postponement, but the hearing proceeded. However, a subsequent hearing was scheduled for Chicago. Petitioner appeared at the second Chicago hearing with counsel, who moved to strike certain testimony received at the Washington hearing, but did not request an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who testified at the Washington hearing. Petitioner then submitted the testimony of its secretary-treasurer, and also that of a chemist of a testing laboratory. The latter testified as to the qualitative and quantitative analyses of petitioner\u2019s products, but did not testify as to the lasting qualities of the products when applied as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The trial examiner submitted a Recommended Decision. Thereafter the Commission filed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were in accord with the recommendations of the trial examiner, and entered the cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Petitioner claims that the Commission\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence. Its principal contention here is that the tests conducted by the Bureau of Standards were made out of the presence of and without notice to the petitioner, and that the testimony of the Bureau of Standards technicians was largely hearsay testimony. Petitioner argues that such testimony should not have been received by the trial examiner or considered by the Commission. Petitioner also contends that because the order as entered is broad in its sweep, it offers no guide for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The finding as to Comeo 2, Iron Waterproofing is Supported by substantial evidence. Cyrus Fishburn, a well qualified expert who has been with the Bureau of Standards since 1928, testified as to the results of experiments he conducted with Comeo 2. Although he applied three applications to a specimen brick wall, each in accordance with directions, nevertheless water seeped through at several points. The permeability tests given by him simulated an exposure of the wall to wind-driven rain. Fishburn testified, \u201cThe Com-eo 2 cannot be considered to be a satisfactory waterproofing for permeable brick masonry walls when applied as directed to the inside, unexposed face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The finding as to Comeo 6, Transparent Waterproofing is not supported by evidence quite so unequivocal, as Comeo 6 was not tested. But, relying upon a previous report prepared by him, based upon tests in 1943 of another product \u201ccontaining essentially the same ingredients as Comeo 6,\u201d Fishburn testified, \u201cThe material will not waterproof highly permeable masonry surfaces,\u201d but admitted that it would tend to seal the pores in those surfaces. He questioned the permanency of the effectiveness of the pore-sealing, stating, \u201cIt may last five or six years and be effective for that time as a pore sealer.\u201d He laid considerable emphasis on the fact that it would not seal openings larger than the pore space.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The Commission found that through the advertising statements heretofore stated as to Comeo 6, petitioner represented that its product \u201ceffectively seals and waterproofs concrete, brick, stone, stucco, plaster and masonry surfaces, and makes said surfaces upon which it is applied permanently non-absorbent to water,\u201d and that such representations were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Although Fishburn did not test Comeo 6, he possessed the education and practical experience which qualified him to judge the waterproofing qualities of Comeo 6 by tests which he had previously made of products of essentially the same ingredients compounded in the same proportion. Furthermore, the Commission itself has had wide experience in the masonry waterproofing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>industry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings as to Comeo 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The testimony as to Comeo 4, Waterproofing Paste was given by Leonard Bean and Thomas Kelly, employees of the Bureau of Standards. Bean, a chemist, personally had not made a test of Comeo 4 but testified from the notes of a subordinate who was no longer with the Bureau and who made such a test under his direction. He limited his testimony to the \u00abchemical analysis of the product, stating that it was a fatty acid type water repellent agent. He disclaimed qualifications to testify as to its waterproofing qualities. Kelly, a well qualified materials engineer, testified that he was familiar with the report of the Bureau of Standards prepared by his predecessor, Hornibrook, who was no longer with the Bureau. Kelly referred to Comeo 4 as a \u201ctype of waterproofing which we have tested at the Bureau of Standards.\u201d He testified further that from his general scientific knowledge, Comeo 4 does not make concrete waterproof in the sense of a permanent condition, and that under pressure it does not have any appreciable waterproofing effect. The Horni-brook report (Exhibit 16) contained several comments which were favorable to petitioner, as follows: \u201cThese materials are generally capable of effecting small reductions in absorption by capillarity, and because of the increased workability imparted to the concrete, may indirectly contribute to the uniformity of the concrete in place (that is, result in a greater freedom from honeycomb and similar defects), and accordingly improve the, impermeability. Such improvements in impermeability and absorption as effected by the use of this material may be expected to be of reasonable permanence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Petitioner advertised Comeo 4 for new construction work and claimed it \u201cproduces a close-meshed concrete that increases strength and permanently waterproofs. Makes concrete flow easily around reinforcing.\u201d It is apparent that the only words subject to criticism are, \u201cpermanently waterproofs.\u201d Petitioner objects because the Commission\u2019s order prohibits it from advertising Comeo 4 as suitable for waterproofing without disclosing that its use will not render surfaces below grade impermeable to water under pressure. Petitioner states that it never advertised that Comeo 4 would render surfaces below grade impermeable to water under pressure. However, it did represent for new construction that Comeo 4 would permanently waterproof, and we think the Commission was justified in insisting petitioner make clear that it would not be satisfactory for that purpose for surfaces below grade subject to water under pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the Commission should not have considered any of the testimony of the technicians of the Bureau of Standards cannot be sustained. True, it is incumbent on the Commission to prove its charges by competent, relevant and substantial evidence. Carlay Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 7 Cir., 153 F.2d 493. But administrative agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, have never been restricted by the rigid rules of evidence. Federal Trade Comm. v. Cement Institute et al., 333 U.S. 683, 705, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1009. Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s objections go largely to the weight of the evidence, and it is well established that the weight to be given is a matter for the determination of the Commission. Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 324 U.S. 726, 65 S.Ct. 961, 89 L.Ed. 1320. Perhaps it would have been better for petitioner to have been represented by an attorney at the Washington hearing so that the witnesses from the Bureau of Standards might have been cross-examined, but it was no fault of the Commission that this was not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">As to the scope of the cease and desist order, our consideration must be whether the Commission has made \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>allowable <em>judgment in its </em>choice of the remedy.\u201d Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm., 327 U.S. 608, 612, 66 S.Ct. 758, 760, 90 L.Ed. 888. We think the Commission was clearly supported by substantial and adequate findings to conclude that the practices of petitioner were to the prejudice of the public and constituted unfair and deceptive acts in commerce, and that the form of the Commission\u2019s order meets the test of an allowable judgment in the choice of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Enforcement of the cease and desist order of the Commission is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-6\">.
