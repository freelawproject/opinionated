Landy, the defendant-appellant, to take such action as might lie within his power to accomplish the transfer of the All Alcoholic and Inn Holders\u2019 licenses to the trustee which were formerly held by the bankrupt but are now held by Landy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The complaint also prayed that the court decree that the- transfer of said licenses to Landy was fraudulent and void within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Landy filed an answer September 27, 1950, in which he admitted certain allegations of the complaint and denied others. In his answer he alleged that The Cheshire Inn Corporation was indebted to him for wages covering a substantial period of time approximating two years and that any action taken by The Cheshire Inn Corporation in surrendering said licenses was taken in. consideration of the corporation\u2019s indebtedness to him. He denied that at the first meeting of the creditors of the bankrupt he admitted the transfer of said licenses to him was without consideration and that he agreed to transfer said licenses to the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The district court entered judgment on September 29, 1950, wherein it stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">\u201cIt appearing that the pleadings clearly disclose a situation where action should be taken summarily, it is thereupon, on the Court\u2019s own motion,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">\u201cOrdered, that summary judgment be entered for the plaintiff, and that the defendant transfer or surrender, through whatever means- are lawful, all his right, title and interest in the innholder\u2019s license and the alcoholic beverage license, to the trustee of the bankrupt estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">On October 2, 1950, the district court filed \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d in which it stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-14\">\u201c1. The transfer of the All Alcoholic license and Inn Holders\u2019 license made by the bankrupt to- the defendant on January 30, 1950 was a preferential transfer within the meaning of Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\">\u201c2. This Court has jurisdiction under Section 23 of said Bankruptcy Act to order the defendant to transfer or surrender, through whatever means are lawful, all his right, title and interest in said licenses, to the trustee of the bankrupt estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">The district court has jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act. Schumacher v. Beeler, 293 U.S. 367, 55 S.Ct. 230, 79 L.Ed. 433; Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), Vol. 2, \u00a7 23.15, p. 571 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">The district court heard no testimony and the pleadings do not support its conclusion that the transfer of said licenses by the bankrupt to Landy on Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>uary 30, 1950, was a preferential transfer within the meaning of Sec. 60 of the Bankruptcy Act. In re Mason, D.C., 49 F.Supp. 781; Haas v. Sachs, 8 Cir., 68 F.2d 623; Mansfield Lumber Co. v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 38 F.2d 614; Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.) Vol. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 60.34-60.35, pp. 865-874.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Among other things, the pleadings raise a genuine issue as to whether or not Landy received a greater percentage of his debt than some other creditor of the same class. The presence of such an issue precludes summary judgment. Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. See Sprague v. Vogt, 8 Cir., 150 F.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is our opinion that Landy is entitled to a hearing on the issues raised in the pleadings. The court in the Sprague case, supra, said, 150 F.2d at page 801: \u201c * * * That one reasonably may surmise that the plaintiff is unlikely to prevail upon a trial, is not a sufficient basis for refusing him his day in court with respect to issues which are not shown to be sham, frivolous, or so unsubstantial that it would obviously be futile to try them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Paragraph 10 of the complaint is concerned with the fraudulent transfer of the assets of the bankrupt for the sole benefit of Landy in derogation of the rights of the creditors of the bankrupt. Landy denies this allegation. This matter may be inquired into at the hearing on the merits, especially with reference to \u00a7 70, sub. e of the Bankruptcy Act. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Landy\u2019s contention that the licenses here are not property is unrealistic. It was held in Fisher v. Cushman, 1 Cir., 103 F. 860, 51 L.R.A. 292, that a liquor license is \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. See note to Fisher v. Cushman, 43 C.C.A. 381, 390. See Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.), Vol. 4, \u00a7 70.22, p. 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">If, upon the hearing of this case on the merits, the district court should find that the transfer of the licenses was fraudulent or preferential, the substance of the order contained in the judgment entered September 29, 1950, would appear to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion; the appellant recovers costs on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
