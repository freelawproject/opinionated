HAND, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Asb\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-17\">As <em>res integra, </em>I should go-along with my brothers in affirming the judgment on Judge Brennan\u2019s opinion; but I am unable to see any distinction of substance between the facts at bar, and those before the Supreme Court in Continental Tie and Lumber Co. v. United States, 286 U.S. 290, 52 S.Ct. 529, 76 L.Ed. 1111, and especially in our own opinion which followed it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Frankly, I have never felt sure that I understood the reasoning of the Supreme Court; but we are bound to treat the decision as authoritative, and in any event our own decision appears to me indistinguishable from the case at bar. We had there to deal with a \u201cdealer\u201d who had paid the \u201cfloor stocks tax,\u201d and we held that the refund \u201caccrued\u201d in the year when the statute was passed granting it. Section 602 of the Act of 1936 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> controlled the recovery of the refund, and subdivision (b) of that section provided that the refund should be of so much of the \u201cprocessing tax\u201d as was shifted to the taxpayer, less any part which he in turn may have passed on to his buyers. Thus a \u201cdealer\u201d had to ascertain what part the \u201cprocessor\u201d had \u201cshifted\u201d to him, and what part he had shifted to his buyers, both being issues of much uncertainty. Section 902(a) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> controlled the \u201cprocessor\u2019s\u201d refund, and it required him to deduct from the tax which he paid, whatever part of it he had \u201cshifted * * * directly or indirectly\u201d. It seems to me therefore that a \u201cdealer\u201d who sought refund had to prove, not only what the \u201cprocessor\u201d had passed on to him, but what he had not passed on to his buyers, while the \u201cprocessor\u201d had to prove only what he had <em>not </em>passed on to his buyers, among whom might be a \u201cdealer.\u201d Of the two \u2014 \u201cdealer\u201d or \u201cprocessor\u201d \u2014 I should think that the \u201cdealer\u2019s\u201d recovery was subject to more contingencies-than the \u201cprocessor\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-18\">.
