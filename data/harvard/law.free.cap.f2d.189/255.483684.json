United States, 146 F.2d 26, plaintiff was an officer of the United States, and the court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">The district judge, on evidence sufficient to support his conclusion, found: that the plaintiff was appointed by the Secretary of War, pursuant to Art. II, Sec. 2, Clause 2, of the Constitution; that he was an officer of the United States; and that the court was without jurisdiction of his claim. So determining, he dismissed the suit on that ground, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-19\">We agree that the case is ruled by Kennedy v. United States, supra, and that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
