The employer is not held to an absolute responsibility for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>reasonably safe condition of the place, tools and appliances, but only to the duty of exercising reasonable care to that end, the degree of care being commensurate with the danger reasonably to be anticipated. Baltimore &amp; O. S. W. <em>R. </em>Co. v. Carroll, 280 U.S. 491, 51 S.Ct. 182, 74 L.Ed. 566. The basis of the employer\u2019s liability is its negligence, not the mere fact that the injury occurred. Except as otherwise provided in the Act, liability is determined by common law principles which define negligence as lack of due care in the circumstances, that is, the doing of acts which a reasonably prudent person would not have done, or the failure to do what a reasonably prudent person would have done in the circumstances, or both. Ellis v. Union Pac. R. Co, 329 U.S. 649, 67 S.Ct. 598, 91 L.Ed. 572; Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co, 318 U.S. 54, 63 S.Ct. 444; 87 L.Ed. 610; Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Aeby, 275 U.S. 426, 48 S.Ct. 177, 72 L.Ed. 351; McGivern v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co, 8 Cir, 132 F.2d 213, 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The employer\u2019s duty to its employees is to use reasonable care and prudence to the end that the place in which they are required to work, and the appliances with which they work, are reasonably suitable and safe for the purpose, and in the circumstances, in which they are to be used. The test is not whether the tools to be used and the place in which the work is to be performed are absolutely safe, nor whether the employer knew the same to be unsafe, but whether or not the employer has exercised reasonable care and diligence to make them safe. Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Aeby, 275 U.S. 426, 48 S.Ct. 177, 72 L.Ed. 351; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, 233 U.S. 492, 34 S.Ct. 635, 58 L.Ed. 1062; Hough v. Texas &amp; P. R. Co., 100 U.S. 213, 25 L.Ed. 612; Washington &amp; G. R. Co. v. McDade, 135 U.S. 554, 10 S.Ct. 1044, 34 L.Ed. 235; Baltimore &amp; O. S. W. R. Co. v. Carroll, 280 U.S. 491, 50 S.Ct. 182, 74 L.Ed. 566; Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. Co. v. Mullins, 249 U.S. 531, 39 S.Ct. 368, 63 L.Ed. 754; Mc-Givern v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co, 8 Cir., 132 F.2d 213; Aqua System v. Kodakoski, 5 Cir., 88 F.2d 395, 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">It is of course the duty of an employee to exercise reasonable and ordinary care for his own safety. If the employee\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of his injury, he can not recover. If both employer and employee are guilty of negligence, the employee may recover, but his damages will be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the employee. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Davis, 6 Cir., 75 F.2d 849; Chesapeake <em>&amp; O. </em>Ry. Co. v. Richardson, 6 Cir., 116 F.2d 860; Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318 U.S. 54, 63 S.Ct. 444, 87 L.Ed. 610, 143 A.L.R. 967. Temporary conditions produced by the employee negligently using, or negligently failing to use, appliances provided by the employer, are not defects for which the employer is liable. Wood v. Davis, 5 Cir., 290 F. 1. Nor is it actionable negligence that an employer fails to anticipate lack of care on the part of an employee. McGivern v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 132 F.2d 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The employer is not required to furnish the employee the latest, best, or most perfect appliances with which to work, nor to discard standard appliances already in use upon the discovery of later improvements, provided those in use are reasonably safe and suitable. Chicago &amp; N. W. R. Co. v. Bower, 241 U.S. 470, 36 S.Ct. 624, 60 L.Ed. 1107, 1109; Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Groeger, 266 U.S. 521, 45 S.Ct. 169, 69 L.Ed. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The defendant requested, but was refused, specific charges based upon the foregoing principles. The only charge given by the trial court bearing upon the employer\u2019s duty is \u2014 -\u201cI charge you, Gentlemen of the jury, as a matter of law, if you find that the defendant company required its servant, C. C. Dixon, to work in a place which the railroad or its foreman knew to be unsafe, or which the foreman in the exercise of reasonable prudence ought to have known was unsafe, then the defendant is liable for the injuries to its servant if those injuries resulted from an unsafe and dangerous place to work, as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>would be your duty to return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">This charge is faulty in that it presents, as the sole criterion of liability, knowledge of the employer or its representative that the place or tools provided for the employee\u2019s use were unsafe, rather than the failure on the part of the employer to exercise reasonable care and prudence to that end, which is the recognized test. It should be modified to correctly state the duty of the employer as hereinabove defined. McGivern v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 132 F.2d 213. The charge is also inadequate in that it omits other relevant and coordinate principles essential to a complete and accurate grasp by the jury of the considerations which underlie an employer\u2019s liability for negligent injuries to his employee. The charge should have been supplemented by appropriate charges upon the principles hereinabove set out, as requested by the defendant. The failure to do so can not be regarded as harmless error, as the principles above referred to are implicit in every action of this nature, and the parties are entitled to have the jury plainly and correctly instructed, so that there will be no misapprehension as to the law of the case. Cummings v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 45 F.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">For these reasons the judgment appealed from must be, and is</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
