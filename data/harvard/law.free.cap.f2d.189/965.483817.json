The plaintiff also sought an accounting, and prayed that, if there were insufficient funds to pay the bonds in full, the District be required to extend its levy and collection of taxes so as to enable it to pay off such bonds, or that the District be required to refund the bonded indebtedness. T. Jeff Feibleman intervened, seeking similar relief to that sought by the plaintiff. In 92 F.Supp. 126, the district court held that the evidence established that all funds received by the District were accounted for, and that there had been no irregularities or misapplication of funds; that it was without authority to require the District to extend its levy and collection of taxes; and \u25a0that it had no authority to require the District to refund the bonded indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The plaintiff-appellant, in this court, has abandoned its contention that the Drainage District should be ordered to extend the original acreage tax for a period in addition to that authorized by the voting taxpayers in the original election for the bond issue. We have carefully examined the other specifications of error, and find no ground for reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment. It is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
