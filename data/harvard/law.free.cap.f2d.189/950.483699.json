HAND, Circuit Judge..</author>\n<p id=\"b998-21\">The petitioner, a professional playwright, is the co-author of the plays: \u201cMy Sister Eileen\u201d and \u201cThe Dough Girls\u201d which were copyrighted in his name. After the plays had appeared on Broadway, he and his co-authors sold the exclusive motion picture rights in them to certain motion picture corporations, the price to be paid, over a period of several years. The petitioner treated the income received from this-source in the year 1943 as a gain from the-sale of a capital asset. The Commissioner-assessed the income so received as current income rather than as a capital gain andi the Tax Court sustained his assessment.. Petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-22\">Both parties are now agreed that the-transaction giving rise to this income was-a sale, that the asset sold was depreciable and had been held for more than six months. and that the rights sold did not constitute a capital asset within the meaning of \u00a7.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>117(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117(a)(1). However, \u00a7 117(j) of the Code treats certain sales defined in \u00a7 117(j)(l) as if they were sales of capital assets though not within the terms of \u00a7 117(a)(1), and the petitioner contends that this transaction qualifies for such treatment by meeting the requirements of \u00a7 117(j)(l) which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">\n<em>\u201cGains and losses from involuntary conversion and from the sale or exchange of certain property used in the trade or business.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\"><em>\u201c(1) Definition of property used in the trade or business. </em>For the purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018property used in the trade or business\u2019 means property used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section <em>23(1), </em>held for more than 6 months, and real property used in the trade or business, held for more than 6 months, which is not (A) property of a kind which would properly be includible in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or (B) property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business. Such term also includes timber with respect to which subsection (k) (1) or (2) is applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Petitioner argues that except as to sub-clause (B) he has concededly met all the requirements of \u00a7 117(j) (1) of use in the business, depreciability, and holding period for treating this transaction as one giving rise to a capital gain under \u00a7 117(j). As to that subclause, he argues first that the rights sold were not \u201cproperty held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business\u201d and, second, that if they were, sub-clause (B) only applied to real property because the statute reads \u201cproperty * * * <em>and </em>real property * * * which <em>is * </em>* \u2019 and not \u201cproperty * * * <em>or </em>real property which <em>is,\u201d </em>or \u201cproperty * ' * * and real property which <em>are * </em>* * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">The contention that the motion picture rights were not held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of trade or business is without merit. The petitioner is a playwright, not a theatrical or motion picture producer or a publisher. The only way in which he could realize income from his copyrighted works was to license or sell to others the right to publish, stage or produce them. On similar facts, a majority of this court held contrary to petitioner\u2019s position in the concurring opinion of L. Hand, J., in Goldsmith v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 143 F.2d 466, 467, certiorari denied 323 U.S. 774, 65 S.Ct. 135, 89 L.Ed. 619: \u201cI do think that both [copyright and literary property] were \u2018property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.\u2019 That Clifford Goldsmith was in \u2018business\u2019 as a playwright, we have his own word for; and, although he had written only one play, he spent his time in exploiting it in various ways, in which he was very successful. This he did by licenses to producers of a stage play, by licenses to broadcasters and by the licenses to moving picture producers, whose proceeds are here in suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">Property held for use as distinguished from property held for sale would comprehend such items as writing tools, novels or ideas acquired by the writer for dramatization, etc., rather than the finished, copyrighted product involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">There may appear to be some merit in petitioner\u2019s second point that subclause (B) only applied to real property but, though the question has never been authoritatively decided, the Congress,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Treasury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the Courts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have assumed that subclause (B) applied to depreciable personal property as well as to real property. Petitioner goes extensively into the legislative history of \u00a7 117(j) in an attempt to show such an assumption to be mistaken. We do not agree. Indeed, the Report of the Senate Finance Committee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in our opinion, supports the assumption. Where the intent of Congress seems clear but is frustrated by the use of the singular in the statutory wording, we are permitted to read the statute in the plural.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, 310 U.S. 534, 542, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">In view of the foregoing considerations we hold that subclause (B) of \u00a7 117(j) (1) modifies \u201cproperty\u201d as well as \u201creal property\u201d and that petitioner is not entitled to treat the income in question as if it resulted from the sale of a capital asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">. In 1950, Congress amended \u00a7 117(j) (1) by adding: \u201cor (C) a copyright, * * * or similar property, held by a taxpayer described in subsection (a) (1) (C). * * * \u201d \u00a7 210, Revenue Act of 1950, 1 U.S.Code Cong.Serv. p. 510, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 117(j) (1) (C) which amendment would have been futile unless Congress had assumed that subclauses (A), (B) and (C) modified \u201cproperty\u201d as well as \u201creal property,\u201d for a copyright is not real property.
