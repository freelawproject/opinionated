Leavenworth State Bank, 9 Cir., 156 F.2d 220, 221, where we stated: \u201cWe order that the district court exercise its jurisdiction over appellee to require it to restore the situation of the parties to that which existed prior to the making of the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">From the record now before us it appears that the Leavenworth State Bank has failed to file with the proper state officials the documents necessary to comply with our language quoted above. Such steps should be taken by the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">The order appealed from is reversed. Beecher has also appealed from an order of the district court of August 3, 1948, entitled \u201cOrder Denying Petition of Farm Debtor that Checks be Endorsed and Money in Court be Released to the Farm Debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">There is no merit in the appeal from this order. The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
