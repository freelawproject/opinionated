The following there appears: The defendant\u2019s net income each year, from 1937 to 1947, inclusive, exceeded the annual dividend on the non-cumulative preferred stock, but no such dividends for those years were ever declared. Similarly, in each of the years 1948, 1949 and 1950, the net income exceeded the annual dividend on the preferred, but the directors declared a dividend on the preferred for each such year. In 1950, the directors also declared a dividend of $1.50 per share on the common stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b975-21\">In his formal findings, the trial judge, after finding many basic facts, found as follows: \u201cThe decision of the directors of the defendant not to declare and pay dividends in any of the years 1937 to 1947, inclusive, was made in the exercise of sound business discretion and judgment by the directors, and in the interests of all the creditors, including the bondholders, and of all the preferred and common stockholders of the defendant, and of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b975-22\">Plaintiff contends (1) that the directors abused their discretion in not declaring dividends on the preferred in the years 1942 to 1947, inclusive; (2) that, even if that is not true, the directors had power to declare those dividends subsequently, and abused their discretion when, without doing so, in 1950 they declared a dividend on the common stock.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b975-23\">Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison and Nemerov &amp; Schapiro, all of New York City (Lloyd K.

HAND, CHASE and FRANK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b976-6\">FRANK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The trial court\u2019s findings of facts \u2014 which are amply supported by the evidence and unquestionably are not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d \u2014establish that the directors acted well within their discretion in withholding declarations of dividends on the non-cumulative preferred stock up to the year 1948. In so holding, we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that, as plaintiff insists,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>the standard of discretion in weighing the propriety of the non-declaration of dividends on such preferred stock is far stricter than in the case of non-declaration of dividends on common stock. For, on the facts as found and on the evidence, we think the directors, in not declaring dividends on the preferred in the years 1937-1947, adopted a reasonable attitude of reluctant but contingent pessimism about the future, an attitude proper, in the circumstances, for persons charged, on behalf of all interests, with the management of this enterprise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">The issue, then, is whether the directors could validly declare a dividend on the common stock in 1950 without directing that there should be paid (in addition to preferred dividends on the preferred for that year) alleged arrears of preferred dividends, the amount of which had been earned in 1942-1947 but remained undeclared and unpaid. To put it differently, we must decide whether (a) the directors' had the power to declare such alleged arrears of dividends on the preferred and (b) whether they \u201cabused\u201d their discretion in declaring any dividend on the common without ordering the payment of those alleged arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">Our lode-star is Wabash Railway Co. v. Barclay, 280 U.S. 197, 50 S.Ct. 106, 74 L.Ed. 368, which dealt with the noncumulative preferred stock of an Indiana railroad corporation. There were no controlling Indiana decisions or - statutes on that subject.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court was therefore obliged to interpret the contract according to its own notions of what the contract meant. We have a similar problem here, since there are no Illinois decisions or statutory provisions which control or guide us. Absent such decisions and statutes, we must take the Wabash opinion as expressing the correct interpretation of the rights of non-cumulative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>preferred stockholders of this Illinois company. For the difference between the language of the preferred stock here and that in Wabash seems to us to be of no moment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">In the Wabash case, plaintiffs, holders of non-cumulative preferred stock, sought an injunction preventing the defendant railroad company from paying dividends on the common stock <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> unless it first paid dividends on the non-cumulative preferred to the extent that the company, in previous years, had had net earnings available for that payment and that such dividends remained unpaid. The Court decided against the plaintiffs. It spoke of the fact that, in earlier years, \u201cnet earnings that could have been used for the payment were expended upon improvements and additions to the property and equipment of the road\u201d; it held that the contract with the preferred meant that \u201cif those profits are justifiably applied by the directors to capital improvements and no dividend is declared within the year, the claim for that year is gone and cannot be asserted at a later date.\u201d We take that as a ruling that the directors were left with no discretion ever to pay any such dividend. For if they had had that discretion, it would surely have been an \"abuse\u201d to pay dividends on the common while disregarding the asserted claim of the non-cumulative preferred to back dividends. Indeed, the plaintiff in the instant case contends that a payment of common dividends, whenever there is such a discretion, constitutes an unlawful \u201cdiversion\u201d ; and such a \u201cdiversion\u201d would be an \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Plaintiff, however, seeks to limit the effect of the Wabash ruling to instances where the net earnings, for a given year, which could have been paid to the noncumulative preferred, have once been expended justifiably for \u201ccapital improvements\u201d or \u201cadditions to the property or equipment.\u201d He would have us treat the words \u201cnon-cumulative\u201d as if they read \u201ccumulative if earned except only when the earnings are paid out for capital additions.\u201d He argues that the Wabash ruling has no application when net earnings for a given year are legitimately retained for any one of a variety of other corporate purposes, and when in a subsequent year it develops that such retention was not necessary. We think the attempted distinction untenable. It ascribes to the Supreme Court a naive over-estimation of the importance of tangibles (because they can be touched and seen) as contrasted with intangibles. Suppose the directors of a corporation justifiably invested the retained earnings for the year 1945 in land which, at the time, seemed essential or highly desirable for the company\u2019s future welfare. Suppose that, in 1948, it turned out that the land so purchased was not necessary or useful, and that the directors thereupon caused it to be sold. Plaintiff\u2019s position compels the implied concession that the proceeds of such a sale would never be available for payment of so-called arrears of unpaid noncumulative preferred dividends, and that the directors would forever lack all discretion to pay them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We fail to see any intelligible difference between (1) such a situation <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) one where annual earnings are properly retained for any appropriate corporate purpose, and where in a later year the retention proves wholly unnecessary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no sensible ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>for singling out legitimate capital outlays, once made, as the sole cause of the irrevocable destruction of the claims of the preferred. We do not believe that the Supreme Court gave the contract with the preferred such an irrational interpretation. It simply happened that in the Wabash case the earnings had been used for capital additions, and that, accordingly, the court happened to mention that particular purpose. Consequently, we think that the Court, in referring to that fact, did not intend it to have any significance. We disregard the decisions of the New Jersey courts,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the decision of the Ninth Circuit,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> since we think they are at odds with the rationale of the Wabash decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Here we are interpreting a contract into which uncoerced men entered. Nothing in the wording of that contract would suggest to an ordinary wayfaring person the existence of a contingent or inchoate right to arrears of dividends.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The notion that such a right was promised is, rather, the invention of lawyers or other experts, a notion stemming from considerations of fairness, from a policy of protecting investors in those securities. But the preferred stockholders are not- \u2014 like sailors or idiots or infants \u2014 wards of the judiciary. As courts on occasions have quoted or paraphrased ancient poets, it may not be inappropriate to paraphrase a modern poet, and to say that \u201ca contract is a contract is a contract.\u201d To be sure, it is an overstatement that the courts never do more than carry out the intentions of the parties: In the interest of fairness and justice, many a judge-made legal rule does impose, on one of the parties to a contract, obligations which neither party actually contemplated and as to which the language of the contract is silent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But there are limits to the extent to which a court may go in so interpolating rights and obligations which were never in the parties\u2019 contemplation. In this case we consider those limits clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>In sum, we hold that, since the directors did not \u201cabuse\u201d their discretion in withholding dividends on the non-cumulative preferred for any past years, (a) no right survived to have those dividends declared, and (b) the directors had no discretion whatever to declare those dividends subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">From the point of view of the preferred stockholders, the bargain they made may well be of a most undesirable kind. Perhaps the making of such bargains should be prevented. But, if so, the way to prevent them is by legislation, or by prophylactic administrative action authorized by legislation, as in the case of the S. E. C. in respect of securities, including preferred stocks, whether cumulative or non-cumulative, issued by public utility holding companies or their subsidiaries.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The courts are not empowered to practice such preventive legal medicine, and must not try to revise, extensively, contracts already outstanding and freely made by adults who are not incompetents.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-8\">. Plaintiff cites Oratty v. Peoria Law Library Ass\u2019n, 219 Ill. 516, 76 N.E. 707. It related to a claim under tlie bylaws of a library association providing (a) that the association \u201cguaranties\u201d an 8% dividend each year on all shares, \u201cdue and payable\u201d on January 1, and which was to be a \u201ccharge against the association,\u201d and (b) that \u201cproduction\u201d of the certificate by a holder \u201cshall entitle\u201d the holder to the dividend. In Tennant v. Epstein, 356 Ill. 26, 189 N.E. 864, 870, 98 A.L.R. 1515, the court interpreted the Oratty case as merely stating the usual rule as to the use and \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion in withholding payment of common dividends. See also Hofeller v. General Candy Corp., 275 Ill.App. 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">. That the directors were not acting in the interest of the common stockholders in disregard of the interest of the preferred appears from the following: The Union Pacific Railroad holds about 25% of the outstanding common stock (i.e., 348,700 shares out of a total of 1,357,994) and was therefore pretty obviously in control of the Board of Directors. Yet, that same Railroad holds about 52% of the outstanding preferred shares (i.e., 98,270 out of a total of 186,457). Union Pacific would plainly be better off if the plaintiff wore successful in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">The interest of the public was involved in the reduction of funded debt. Eor railroads with excessive fixed charges, in periods of stress tend to skimp maintenance and not to improve service..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b976-18\">. The case of Starr Publishing Co. v. Ball, 192 Ind. 158, 134 N.E. 285, assuming it might otherwise have been pertinent, was of no help since it had to do with an industrial corporation as to which there was an Indiana statute inapplicable to the Wabash railroad company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b977-7\">. Cf. Joslin v. Boston &amp; M. R. Co., 274 Mass. 551, 175 N.E. 156, 159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\">. And on a class of preferred stock having rights junior to those of the preferred stock held by the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b977-9\"> This becomes the more evident when it is noted that the plaintiff asserts that \u201cnon-cumulative\u201d means in effect, \u201ccumulative if earned.\u201d For directors have no discretion to pay common dividends without paying arrears of cumulative preferred dividends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b977-14\">. Were plaintiff to contend that the proceeds of such a sale are available for preferred dividends he would logically be required to contend that reserves for depreciation of capital assets are similarly available. For such reserves constitute, in effect, a repayment of investment in capital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b977-15\">. Or one where, in our supposititious case, the corporation, no longer needing the land, could easily sell it at a handsome figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AA0\">. The attempted distinction would also come to this: (a) The noneumulative pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>ferred irrevocably loses all rights to a dividend as of a given year, if the earnings for that year are invested in fixed capital, but (b) has an inchoate right in the form of a sort of contingent credit if those earnings are reasonably retained for future investments which are never made and which thereafter show up as wholly unnecessary. This is to say that the preferred take the risk of loss of a dividend as of a year in which it is earned when there is a reasonable need for a present capital investment, but no such risk if there is a present reasonable likelihood of a need for such an investment in the future, which later appears undesirable. We see no rational basis for such a distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b978-6\">. Bassett v.
