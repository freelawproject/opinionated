A decree will accordingly be here entered modifying the final decree of the district court so as further to provide that appellant receiver of the Old Bank recover of the appellee New Bank such tax savings as accrued from the inclusion of Class B assets in the capital stock tax returns of the New Bank, with interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annum from the dates the New Bank paid the state taxes and the deductions were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">As thus modified, the decree appealed from will be affirmed, the costs of this appeal to be taxed against the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-19\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-13\">.
