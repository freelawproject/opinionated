The Deputy Commissioner answered this question in the negative, and accordingly found the employee to be within the coverage of the Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Whether an employee is to be classified as crew member or harbor worker is a question which has given rise to much litigation. Each case turns on its own facts and the administrative decision is not to be reversed if there was evidence to support it. The appellants do not challenge the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact but contend that the undisputed facts and the inferences fairly to be drawn therefrom establish as a matter of law that Nilsen was a member of the derrick\u2019s crew; They assert that Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U.S. 565, 64 S.Ct. 747, 88 L.Ed. 430, rather than South Chicago Coal &amp; Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U.S. 251, 60 S.Ct. 544, 84 L.Ed. 732, is the controlling authority to be applied in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The \u201cCommander\u201d was a non-self-propelled rigging barge with a derrick for loading and discharging heavy cargo, and at times she salvaged cargo from vessels which had foundered or lost cargo overboard. The crew consisted of captain, mate, engineer, guy-tender, and two \u201cdeck hands\u201d of whom Nilsen was one. He had been attached to the vessel in this capacity for about ten months. He did not have and was not required to have seaman\u2019s papers; he was on a monthly payroll, paid semi-monthly, and worked from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. five days a week, with time and one-half for overtime; he went home at night, except every third night when he stayed aboard and acted as watchman, for which he received extra pay. His duties were to place slings around cargo and at times to clean, paint, grease the fall wires, hang out lights and handle lines on the vessel; but his principal duty was to assist in the loading and discharging of heavy cargo from vessels and barges, and his other duties were incidental to his employment. At the time of his accident he was in a bosun\u2019s chair greasing the fall wires. The record does not show what else, if anything, he did on the day of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Nilsen\u2019s primary duties had to do with cargo and were such as are ordinarily performed by harbor workers. The Bassett case, 309 U.S. 251, 260, 60 S.Ct. 544, 84 L.Ed. 732, apparently makes primary duties the test. See also Wm. Spencer &amp; Son Corp. v. Lowe, 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 847, 848. We agree with the district judge that Bassett is the controlling authority. Accordingly the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
