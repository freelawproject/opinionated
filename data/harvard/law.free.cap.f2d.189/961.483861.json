While we are of the clear opinion that the burden was upon the appellant to plead and prove that the property in question was within the claimed exemption, we are of the further opinion that the issue having been raised by the pleadings and fully developed in the proof, the only question for our determination is whether the findings and judgment must be affirmed as supported by the evidence, or reversed as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-23\">We find no rational basis for disturbing the findings.
