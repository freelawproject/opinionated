The Court imposed a sentence of three and one-half years on each count. Arzaga, after he had almost completed serving sentence of the first count, filed a petition for correction and modification of the sentence. This the District Judge denied. Appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-27\">The conviction did not constitute double jeopardy. Shafer v. United States, 9 Cir., 179 F.2d 929. The crimes charged by the two counts are separate and distinct, since each count required proof of different elements than those required by the other. Palmero v. United States, 1 Cir., 112 F.2d 922. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
