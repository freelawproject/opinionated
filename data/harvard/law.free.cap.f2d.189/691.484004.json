Damages and an injunction were requested \"to prevent unfair competition and unfair use of trade name.\u201d A temporary injunction restraining the appellees from the use of the name \u201cTelevision Center\u201d was issued. Appellees answered and counterclaimed for damages for having been prevented from opening their place of business as a result of the temporary injunction, and for appropriation of the trade name \"Television Center\u201d by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">A preliminary restraining order was then issued, and the case was heard on the merits by Judge Goldsborough who dissolved the injunction, dismissed the complaint, and awarded the appellees nominal damages. From that judgment this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The appellant\u2019s complaint seeks an injunction to prevent unfair competition by the appropriation of the trade name \u201cTelevision Center.\u201d This Court- has held, McGraw-Hill Pub. Co. v. American Aviation Associates, 1940, 73 App.D.C. 131, 117 F.2d 293, 296. \u201cTo constitute unfair competition in respect to a trade name, two elements must be present. The name must have acquired a secondary meaning or significance that identifies the plaintiff; the defendant must have unfairly used the n\u00e1me or a simulation of it against the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We quite agree with the lower court that the appellant \u201cdid not use said words [Television Center] in such a manner as to acquire a secondary meaning, but used same only in a subordinate manner, and such use was not consistent, continuous nor exclusive over a sufficient period of time to create a secondary meaning to the general public.\u201d The main reliance upon which appellant bases his claim is the use of the term \u201cElectrical Center is Television Center.\u201d To this Court that term connotates that the store, Electrical Center, is the center for television needs. To pretend that it is other than a purely descriptive term is beyond the realm of reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The general rule is that descriptive words are not capable of exclusive appropriation as trade names. 52 Am.Jur. 546, Trademarks, Trade names, etc., \u00a7 63. As the appellant contends, the rule of law applicable to trade names has recognized that some words or phrases although descriptive are capable of appropriation by the first user. This exception has never been applied however, when the forms of the advertisements varied so as not to present a lasting impression in the minds of the public; the use of the trade name was not exclusive by the first user but on the contrary was openly employed by others; and had only been used for about a year and a half intermittently by the first user, the appellant. The appellant simply has not shown the degree of correlation between the alleged trade name and his business that has formed the basis for relief in other cases. McGraw-Hill Pub. Co. v. American Aviation Associates, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">As H. D. Nims says in his volume on unfair competition, \u201cSecondary meaning is association, nothing more. It exists only in the minds of those of the public who have seen or known or have heard of a brand of goods by some name or sign and have associated the two in their minds.\u201d Nims, Unfair Competition, \u00a7 37 (3 ed. 1936). Consequently, we feel that appellant has failed to sustain the burden of proof that a secondary meaning had attached to the trade name so as to identify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
