The respondent resists the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order on the ground that the findings are not supported by the proof. It contends that its demand for proof of the union\u2019s majority status by means of an election was made in good faith, and that its employees were not coerced by Mr. Van Kleeck\u2019s statements to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The facts are stated in the Board\u2019s opinion, 88 N.L.R.B. 785, and need not be here repeated. The decision of the Board was not unanimous. Mr. Murdock dissented from the majority\u2019s view that the respondent\u2019s request for an election was not made in good faith but was motivated by a desire to gain time within which to undermine the union and avoid the statutory duty to bargain; therefore Mr. Murdock voted to dismiss that portion of the complaint which charges an illegal refusal to bargain. We cannot say that the Board\u2019s finding as to the respondent\u2019s motive in requesting an election is so unreasonable an inference from the proven facts that it is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. See National Labor Rel. Bd. v. Consolidated Mach. Tool Corp., 2 Cir., 163 F.2d 376, 378, 379, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 824, 68 S.Ct. 164, 92 L.Ed. 399; Joy Silk Mills v. National Labor Rel. Bd., D.C.Cir., 185 F.2d 732, 741. Consequently we must accept it. The petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
