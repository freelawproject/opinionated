In 1946 and 1947 she voted in six Japanese elections. Thereafter, prior to May 25, 1950, she applied to a United States consul in Japan for registration as a national of the United States. The application was denied on the ground that, in view of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she was not a national of the United States, having lost such nationality by voting in Japanese elections. Thereafter, on May 25, 1950, she instituted an action under 8 U.S.C.A. .\u00a7 903<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against appellant, Dean Acheson, Secretary of State, in the District Court for the Western District of Washington\u2014 the district in which she claimed her permanent residence \u2014 for a judgment declarmg her to be a national of the United States. Appellant defended on the ground that appellee had lost her United States nationality by voting in Japanese elections \u2014a defense based on \u00a7 801. A trial was had, an opinion was filed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> findings of fact and conclusions of law were stated and a judgment was entered which, in effect, declared appellee to be a national of the United States. From that judgment this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-21\">The court below held that the Japanese elections of 1946 and 1947 \u2014 the elections in which appellee voted \u2014 were not political elections in a foreign state, within the meaning of \u00a7 801. In so holding, the court below followed Arikawa v. Acheson and Tsunashima v. Acheson, D.C.S.D.Cal., 83 F.Supp. 473, and Yamamoto v. Acheson, D.C.Ariz., 93 F.Supp. 346. See, also, Furuno v. Acheson, D.C.S.D.Cal., 94 F.Supp. 381; Kai v. Acheson, D.C.S.D. Cal., 94 F.Supp. 383; Seki v. Acheson and Yada v. Acheson, D.C.S.D.Cal., 94 F.Supp. 438; Rokui v. Acheson, D.C.S.D.Cal., 94 F.Supp. 439; Furusho v. Acheson, D.C. Hawaii, 94 F.Supp. 1021. However, we do not agree with that holding. Instead, we agree with the holding in Kuwahara v. Acheson, D.C.S.D.Cal., 96 F.Supp. 38, that the Japanese elections of 1946 and 1947 were political elections in a foreign state, within the meaning of \u00a7 801, and with a similar holding in Uyeno v. Acheson, D.C.W.D.Wash., 96 F.Supp. 510.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reasons for holding that the Japanese elections of 1946 and 1947 were political elections in a foreign state, within the meaning of \u00a7 801\u2014 reasons which we deem valid and sufficient \u2014are stated in the opinions in the Kuwa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>hara and Uyeno cases and need not be restated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The court below found that appellee, in voting in the Japanese elections of 1946 and 1947, \u201cdid not act freely and voluntarily,\u201d thus, in effect, finding that she voted involuntarily. Appellee was a witness at the trial and was the only witness. Her testimony was, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">\u201cQ. Why did you vote in the 1946 and \u201947 elections? What were the reasons for your voting and the circumstances surrounding your vote? A. After the war ended, General MacArthur and the occupational forces granted the women in Japan for voting,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to vote I thought it would help the cause of democracy in Japan. It was repeated and emphasized again and again by the occupation forces, and therefore I thought it was my duty to vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">\u201cQ. Were you at any time told by the occupation forces or anyone connected with the army of occupation that, if you voted, you might lose your American citizenship? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201cQ. Did you discuss it with anybody? A. No. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact, there was no force used to compel you to vote, was there? Physical force? A. No, there wasn\u2019t any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-10\">\u201cQ. Only the force of the spirit? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-11\">\u201cQ. Was there any physical threat made, if [you] did not vote? A. There wasn\u2019t any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-12\">\u201cQ. Was there any threat of bodily harm to [you] or loss of job or loss of food or loss of pay or loss of home? A. No, there wasn\u2019t any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">Appellee put in evidence at the trial an affidavit made by her on July 11, 1950, before a United States vice consul in Japan. The affidavit was, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-19\">\u201cAfter the termination of war here in Japan, there came into effect the women\u2019s suffrage through which the women were given the chance to participate in the democratic future of Japan, and, at the time of the elections, I constantly read much in the newspapers and other publications, in addition to election guidance programs over the radio that were sponsored by the central government of Japan and occupational authorities from the offices of the Supreme Commander,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Eighth Army, and military governments, that it was absolutely essential that every woman of voting age in Japan should turn out at the polls, thereby positively asserting themselves as voters and exponents of democracy. So I, in total ignorance of the Nationality Act [8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 501-1006], but with a view toward exercising my ideas with respect to democratic practices, voted in the same way as the Japanese women citizens, not realizing for a moment that, by so doing, I was, in effect, relinquishing my American citizenship. It was only through the so convincing approach of occupation force voting drives, and no talk of we few \u2018orphan American\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or instructions to us, that prompted me to participate in the great democratic spirit which engulfed everyone at the time. I did not vote under duress. It was only after the deed had been done that public notice was given to we \u2018orphans'\u2019 that, if we had voted, we had violated the Nationality Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-20\">Thus, from her testimony and affidavit, it appeared that appellee voted in the Japanese elections of 1946 and 1947 because the \u201coccupation forces\u201d in Japan were urging Japanese women to vote<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thus assert themselves \u201cas voters and exponents of democracy,\u201d and because she thought it her \u201cduty to vote\u201d and \u201cthought it would help the cause of democracy in Japan;\u201d that she voted \u201cwith a view toward exercising [her] ideas with respect to democratic practices;\u201d that, in so vot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ing, she participated \u201cin the great democratic spirit which engulfed everyone at the time;\u201d that she voted in ignorance of the law (\u00a7 801) and of the legal consequences of such voting; that she \u201cdid not vote under duress;\u201d that no \u201cphysical force\u201d was used to compel her to vote; and that no \u201cphysical threat\u201d was made, nor \u201cany threat of bodily harm * * * or loss of job or loss of food or loss of pay or loss of home.\u201d It did not appear that appellee voted involuntarily. The finding that she voted involuntarily was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In an attempt to justify that finding, appellee cites eleven district court cases\u2014 the Arikawa, Tsunashima, Yamamoto, Fur-uno, Kai, Seki, Yada, Rokui, Furusho and Kuwahara cases, supra, and Ouye v. Acheson, D.C.Hawaii, 91 F.Supp. 129 \u2014 in each of which a national of the United States who had voted in one or more Japanese elections was found to have done so involuntarily. These cases avail appellee nothing, for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The opinions in the Arikawa, Kai and Furusho cases do not state the evidence on which Arikawa, Kai and Furusho were found to have voted involuntarily. We cannot assume that the evidence in those cases was similar to the evidence in the case at bar. If it was, the finding that Arikawa, Kai and Furusho voted involuntarily was clearly erroneous. It appears from the opinions in the Tsunashima, Ya-mamoto, Seki, Yada, Rokui, Kuwahara and Ouye. cases that Tsunashima, Yamamoto, Seki, Yada, Rokui, Kuwahara and Ouye were coerced into voting by being told or made to fear that, unless they voted, their food rations would be discontinued.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It appears from- the opinion in the Furuno case that Furuno, too, was coerced into voting, although the nature of the coercion is not indicated. In the case at bar, no coercion was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> It is clear that appellee, by voting in the Japanese elections of 1946 a&lt;nd 1947, lost her United States nationality. The fact, if it be a fact, that she did not intend to lose her nationality and did not know that she would lose it if she voted in these elections is immaterial. See Sa-vorgnan v. United States, 338 U.S. 491, 70 S.Ct. 292, 94 L.Ed. 287. Section 801 was not involved in Moser v. United States, 341 U.S. 41, 71 S.Ct. 553, cited by appellee. The Moser case, therefore, is not in point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\">.
