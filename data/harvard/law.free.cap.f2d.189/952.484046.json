Libellant filed its libel on March 12, 1945, in the court below. After claimant filed its answer, the issues relating to fault were settled by an agreement dated April 6, 1948, whereby claimant, owner of the Fredericksburg, agreed to bear her damages and pay seventy-five percent of the Tamaroa\u2019s provable damages with interest. On March 7, 1949, claimant, in order to stop further accrual of interest, made a partial payment to libellant, on account, of $100,000. On September 18, 1949, Sir Stafford Cripps, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that the English pound would be devalued by approximately thirty percent in relation to the American dollar. Thereafter the rate at which Sterling could lawfully be exchanged for dollars fell by that amount. On May 12, 1950, the Tamaroa\u2019s damages were stipulated by an agreement leaving for determination by the Court the rate of exchange to apply in calculating the sum to be made payable by final decree. Parts of the stipulation are set forth in the Appendix hereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1001-13\">The principal item in dispute on this appeal relates to Item 36 of that stipulation, a payment of $118,840.03 to Todd Shipyards Corporation for repairs at New York to libellant\u2019s vessel. The United States War Shipping Administration paid this sum to Todd. This amount was debited on July 19, 1945, by the Shipping Administration against the British Ministry of War Transport. Libellant reimbursed the British Ministry of War Transport by paying it \u00a329,525.9.6 on July 19, 1945.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1001-14\">The district court used as the conversion figure, applicable to this \u00a329,525.9.6, the exchange rate at the date of the decree, September 15, 1950, and computed it at $82,671.33. On this basis, the computations in the decree were as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Total Principal and Interest to</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-4\">March 7, 1949............. $135,667.90</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-5\">75% of Principal with Interest</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-6\">to March 7, 1949........... 101,750.92</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-7\">Less Payment on Account of</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-8\">March 7, 1949............. 100,000.00</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-9\">Balance ................ $ 1,750.92</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-10\">Interest on Balance from March 7, 1949, to September 15, 1950 .................. 160.32</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-11\">$1,911.24</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1002-12\">Burlingham, Veeder, Clark &amp; Hupper, New York City (Chauncey I.

The British vessel is owned by libellant, a British corporation which has its office and place of business in London, England. The parties have stipulated that the claimant-appellee, owner of the American vessel, is liable for 75% of the damages of libellant, owner of the English vessel. The dispute centers around one item consisting of the amount paid for the repairs, to libellant\u2019s ship, made in this country by Todd Shipyards. The other items in issue here represent expenses and losses incurred in pounds by libellant before devaluation. If the view we take of the rule applicable to Item 36 is correct, our reasoning applies <em>a fortiori </em>to those items, and we shall therefore center our discussion on Item 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-23\">The bill .for those repairs, $118,840.03, was not paid to Todd by libellant but was-paid to Todd in dollars by the United States War Shipping Administration. This amount was debited by the United States against the credit of the British Government (a credit apparently established under the Lend-Lease agreement). Libel-lant reimbursed the British Government by paying it \u00a329,525.9.6. At the time of each of those payments, those pounds had an exchange value of $118,840.03. At the date of the decree, due to the intervening devaluation of the pound, \u00a329,525.9.6 had an' exchange value of $82,671.33. The district court awarded libellant that sum for that item. Libellant argues that the award should have been $118,840.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-24\">The type of problem here, because of the time element, has been said to involve a consideration of a \u201cfourth dimension\u2014 namely that of time.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>Since it also apparently involves an attempt to coordinate the currencies of two different national systems, a mathematical-minded legal phi-lospher might suggest the application of the general theory of relativity,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which seeks to formulate \u201claws\u201d for all coordinate physical systems and thus to attain uniformity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Happily, this court is spared any such Ein-steinian effort,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the Supreme Court has worked out a solution which we must accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-25\">It is well settled that a money judgment by an American court must be in American currency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>fore arises, in a case like this, as to the proper date for conversion of the foreign currency into our own. The controlling authorities in the federal courts are Hicks v. Guiness, 269 U.S. 71, 46 S.Ct. 46, 70 L.Ed. 168, and Die Deutsche Bank Fialiale Nurnberg v. Humphrey, 272 U.S. 517,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 47 5. Ct. 166, 71 L.Ed. 383. They have been summarized by Williston as follows.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court \u201chas held that the exchange value of damages for breach of an obligation performable in foreign currency in the United States is taken at the time of the breach, * * *; but where the obligation is performable in a foreign country in the money of that country, the judgment day rule has been held applicable, on the ground that \u2018an obligation in terms of the currency of that country takes the risk of currency fluctuation * * * If the debt had been due here and the value of dollars had dropped before suit was brought, the plaintiff could recover no more dollars on that account.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court has held that the so-called judgment-day rule applies to unliquidated damages where the cause of action was of foreign origin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">The same rules are applicable to tort obligations. See Restatement of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 424. In 40 Harvard L. Rev. (1927) 619', 625 it is said: \u201cUpon the commission of a tort a right arises to damages, expressed in units of the money of the country in which the tort occurred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These damages, primarily expressed in the money of the foreign country, should be translated into money of the forum as of the date when the right is merged in a forum judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Conversely, where a tort occurs in the forum, but where damages must be reckoned in terms of foreign money, the right to reparation is expressed in the money of the forum at the date the cause of action arises, and hence the rate of exchange existing on such date should prevail.\u201d With that statement we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Here we have a foreign tort, a collision in British territorial waters.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, cases relating to collisions in our waters<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or on the high seas<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> are inapposite. The English courts seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>have adopted the breach-day rule.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But we may not consider those English decisions, since the conversion date of foreign currency is to be determined by the law of the forum.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The New York courts have perhaps adopted the breach-day rule in most circumstances,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> although a dictum in a recent decision is contra.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether, in some circumstances, we should, in obedience to Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, apply the state rule, we need not here consider, since we have here a question of general maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">The judgment-day rule yields a just result in this case :<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As libellant has its place of business in England, to award it pounds translated into dollars at the rate of exchange existing in 1944 or 1945, merely because of the happenstance that it libelled claimant\u2019s vessel in the United States, would be to give it a windfall of some $36,000. or over \u00a310,000.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For, if this suit had been brought in England, the judgment would have been for \u00a329,525.9.6, and not for \u00a329,525.9.6 translated \u2014 as of 1944 or 1945 \u2014 into dollars and then retranslated into pounds, so as. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>to become approximately \u00a342,442.17.6.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In each of the English cases in which the breach-day rule has been used, there were facts which compelled consideration of a foreign currency;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> here, had the suit been in England, there would have been none: The tort occurred in British waters, and the libellant, a British corporation doing business in England, paid the American repair bill in pounds.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Libellant should not gain some $36,000 or over \u00a310,000 merely by bringing suit in this country. The \u201cobligation is not enlarged by the fact that the creditor happens to be able to catch -his debtor here.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Insofar as libellant may suffer because of the shrinkage in the internal purchasing power of the pound,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> libellant would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>had no redress in England,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and therefore should have none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">If libellant had paid the repair bill in dollars, or were still obligated to do so, it might perhaps be arguable that libellant would be entitled to be reimbursed in that precise amount of dollars, <em>i. e., </em>$118,-840.03; but we need not consider that problem, since it is not before us here. Because of libellant\u2019s payment of the bill in pounds, the payment to Todd in dollars drops out of the equation, so to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The United States, in a 'brief filed as <em>amicus, </em>suggests that the result here is peculiarly fair because the devaluation of the pound was part of a \u201cmanaged currency\u201d plan, so that the decreased foreign exchange rate bore no relation to, and did not affect, the domestic purchasing power of the pound.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But although that fact conceivably may be relevant in some other kinds of cases where conversion of foreign currency is necessary, we have not considered it in deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Libellant argues that both parties intended conversion into American currency to be at the exchange rate existing at the date of the payment to Todd because, had that not been the intention, the claimant would not have been willing to make payment on account, on March 7, 1949, in so large a sum as $100,000. The argument, at best not too persuasive, \u25a0omits an important fact: The amount</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">fixed in the decree, before crediting claim\u25a0ant with the $100,000 payment on account, was in excess of that amount, <em>i. e., 4101,750.02 </em>for principal and interest to the date of that payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The decree was therefore properly for the difference, <em>i. e., </em>$1,750.02, plus interest from March 7, 1949, or a total of $1,-\u2022911.24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">The stipulation reads in part as follows : \u201cLibel having been filed herein on March 12, 1945, by Shaw, Savill, Albion &amp; Co., Ltd., to recover the amount of the damages sustained by reason of a collision which occurred between its steamship Tamaroa and tank vessel Fredericks-burg while the Tamaroa lay at anchor in Bangor Anchorage, Belfast Lough, Ireland, on the morning of January 27, 1944, and cross-libel having been filed herein on October 26, 1945, by Paco Tankers, Inc., as owner of tank vessel Fredericksburg, to recover the damages sustained by said vessel, as a result- of the aforesaid collision; and the respective parties hereto having agreed on April 6, 1948, to a settlement of the above-entitled suits on the basis of Paco Tankers, Inc., bearing the damage sustained by it and the Fred-ericksburg and withdrawing any claim therefor against steamship Tamaroa and her claimant, and in addition thereto paying 75% of the provable damages sustained by steamship Tamaroa with interest thereon to be computed at the rate of 6% per annum from one year after the date of the Tamaroa\u2019s various expenditures and losses until paid; and Paco Tankers, Inc., on March 7, 1949, having made a partial payment in the sum of $100,000 on account of the damages sustained by the Tamaroa, in order to avoid the further accrual of interest on said amount pending final agreement on the total of the individual items of damage sustained by the Tamaroa; and the respective parties hereto having thereafter reached an agreement on the nature and amounts of the damages sustained by libellant, Shaw, Savill, Albion &amp; Co., Ltd., as hereinafter set forth,</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">\u201cIt is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between proctors for the respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>parties hereto that the damages of libel-lant, Shaw, Savill, Albion &amp; Co., Ltd., by reason of the matters set forth in its libel herein together with the date of expenditure or loss applicable to each item are as follows:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Here follow 36 items, the last reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"az5-dedup-0\">\u201c36.

There the court said: \u201cThe question, in such cases, ordinarily resolves itself into whether, in arriving at the amount to be awarded measured by the currency of another country, the foreign exchange is to be translated into American currency as of the date of the breach of contract or the day of the judgment. Where the suit in this country is based upon an obligation existing under foreign law, to be performed abroad, and the jurisdiction of our courts arises merely from \u2018the fact that the creditor happens to be able to catch his debtor here,\u2019 (Die Deutsche Bank Fialiale Nurnberg v. Humphrey, 272 U.S. 517, 519, 47 S.Ct. 166, 71 L.Ed. 383), the amount of the judgment (or award) is adjusted according to the exchange rate which prevails on the day of judgment (Richard v. American Union Bank, 241 N. Y. 163, 149 N.E. 338, 43 A.L.R. 512; Metcalf Co. v. Mayer, supra; Sirie v. Godfrey, 196 App.Div. 529, 188 N.Y.S. 52; Deutsche Bank v. Humphrey, supra). On the other hand, if the contract is to be performed here, then the exchange rate to be applied is that which obtained at the time of default, when the contract was broken (Hicks v. Guinness, 269 U.S. 71, 46 S.Ct. 46, 70 L.Ed. 168; Hoppe v. Russo-Asiatic Bank, 235 N.Y. 37, 138 N.E. 497, explained on the basis of this distinction in Richard v.

Which apparently is far less than the shrinkage in its exchange value. The United States, appearing as <em>amicus curiae, </em>has submitted a brief in which it points out that since devaluation, the internal, domestic purchasing power of the dollar has decreased more, on the whole, than has that of the pound. In support of its point, the United States cites tables from the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, Statistical Office of the United Nations for March, 1951, showing comparative figures for the cost of living and for wholesale prices in the United Kingdom and the United States from September, 1949 when the devaluation took effect.

Humphrey, 272 U.S. 517, 47 S.Ct. 166, 167, 71 L.Ed. 383, which my brothers think controlling, was an action to recover damages for breach of a contract by a German bank to pay marks in Germany on demand. The lower courts held that the debt should be translated into dollars at the rate of exchange existing when the demand was made. Writing for the court Mr. Justice Holmes said that the liability was to pay marks \u201cand was open to satisfaction by the payment of that number of marks, at any time, with whatever interest might have accrued, however much the mark might have .fallen in value as compared with other things.\u201d His opinion concluded: \u201cHere we are lending our Courts to enforce an obligation (as we should put it, to pay damages,) arising from German law alone and ought to enforce no greater obligation than exists by that law at the moment when the suit is brought.\u201d Commentators and lower court decisions are agreed that the reference to \u201cthe moment when the suit was brought\u201d was an inadvertence and what was meant was the moment of judgment. This is the source of the judgment-day rule applied by my brothers. The theory of the rule, as I understand it, is that our judgment should be for an amount neither greater nor less but just equal to that which would be rendered under the foreign law. Under the English law, in case of a collision on the high seas, it is held that damages stated in foreign currency (Italian lire) should be converted into sterling at the rate of exchange existing at the date of the loss, <em>i. e. </em>the date of the tort. Celia v. Volturno, 1921, 2 A.C. 554. Had that collision occurred in British territorial waters rather than on the high seas, I cannot conceive that the rule as to the date for converting foreign currency into sterling would have been different. In the case at bar, due to the war, the repairs had to be made in the United States. Todd\u2019s bill was paid in dollars, which the British Ministry of War Transport converted into pounds at the rate of $4.025, the rate at the date of the tort as well as at the date of conversion, and pounds were then collected from the libellant. The rate of exchange at which the dollars to pay Todd\u2019s bill were purchased, was one of the elements of the libellant\u2019s damages. In my opinion the same rate should be used when the pounds paid by the libellant are converted back into dollars in the court\u2019s decree. No authority has been cited to support converting at one rate and reconverting at another. If a change in the rate of exchange must result in a windfall for one of the parties, it seems to me fairer to let the injured party benefit rather than the tort-feasor. An additional reason why this seems fair in the case at bar is that the $4.025 rate was still in effect when the parties agreed to settle the suit and when the partial payment of $100,000 was made. I would reverse the decree and direct recomputation of the amount.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
