Proc.), and entitles the vendee to specific performance of the contract itself, unless there are circumstances in the case which would render it inequitable for a court of equity to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">There is nothing in the circumstances of the case which shows laches on the part of the plaintiff in the performance of the agreement. Ho definite time was named for the payment of the price to be paid. By the terms of the agreement the money was to be paid from time to time \u201cas the plaintiff earned the same.\u201d Time, therefore, was not of the essence of the agreement, nor was it made so by notice or demand for the payment of the money at any particular time. The vendor was content to let it remain bearing interest, and he always accepted any payments which were made by the plaintiff in performance of the agreement. The last of such payments was made in 1881, two years before the. commencement of the action in hand. There was, therefore, no repudiation or abandonment of the contract by the plaintiff; and as he was all the time, until the conveyance to the defendant, in the actual possession of the lot under the contract, his equitable right to compel performance of it was not barred by the Statute of Limitations. <em>(Love </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>40 Cal. 547; <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Wozencraft, </em>22 Cal. 608; <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>27 Cal. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">When the defendant obtained the title to the lot by the deed from his grantor, he took it with notice of the agreement on the part of his grantor to convey the title to the plaintiff. He therefore held the same in trust for the plaintiff, and was bound to convey it to him upon payment of the balance of the purchase money due upon the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">There was no prejudicial error in the refusal to admit testimony to prove that the plaintiff had several times \u201c earned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>money,\u201d and was able to pay, but unreasonably delayed payment. The vendor acquiesced in the delay, and waived any default caused by it. He never claimed to make non-payment the basis of a forfeiture of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the agreement. On the contrary, he recognized them when he conveyed to the defendant the legal title to the lot; for, needing the money, he conveyed the lot for the unpaid balance due by the plaintiff under the agreement, upon the promise made by the defendant that he would convey it to the plaintiff upon payment by the latter of what was due and owing upon the agreement. To permit the defendant, under these circumstances, to withhold the legal title from the plaintiff would be to aid him in perpetrating a fraud. <em>(Farly </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>11 Cal. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Ross, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
