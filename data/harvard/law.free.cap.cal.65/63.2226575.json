The motion was denied; and from the judgment and order denying the motion the defendant appealed. On appeal, the judgment and order were reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to the court below to sustain the demurrer to the complaint in the action, with leave to the plaintiff to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In obedience to the direction of the appellate court the demurrer to the complaint was sustained; the plaintiff amended her complaint, and the cause was again tried and decided in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment was entered in her favor against the defendant on March 14, 1881. A year elapsed and no appeal from the judgment was taken. Then the attorneys for the plaintiff in this action, in which the stipulation was filed, moved the court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff, pursuant to the stipulation; and the court on the 17th of March, 1882, rendered and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The present appeal is from this judgment, and also from an order denying a motion to vacate it. There is also an appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">It is contended that the judgment in the action of <em>Lucy Gillmore </em>v. <em>The Lycoming Insurance Company of Muncy, Pa., </em>became final, within the meaning of the stipulation, after a year had elapsed from its entry without taking an appeal from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">But although no appeal had been taken from the judgment within the statutory time, proceedings were pending, upon a motion made by the defendant in the case, to vacate the judgment and grant a new trial. That motion subjected the judgment to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>reviewed, and made it liable to be set aside. The judgment was therefore not final, in the sense of the stipulation as to the right of the parties affected by it, and could not become so until the motion for a new trial had been disposed of. <em>(Hill v. </em>Sherwood, 33 Cal. 474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">While proceedings are pending for the review of a judgment, either on appeal or motion for a new trial, the litigation on the merits of the case between the parties is not ended; and until litigation on the merits is ended, there is no finality to the judgment, in the sense of a final determination of the rights of the parties, although it may have become final for the purpose of an appeal from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">As, therefore, the motion for a new trial in the Lycoming Insurance Company case was not heard and determined until more than nine months after the entry of the judgment appealed from, the judgment was prematurely entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">If <em>now </em>no appeal has been taken from the order denying the motion for a new trial, in consequence of which the order has become absolute and the judgment final, the reversal of the judgment prematurely entered on the stipulation will not prejudice the right to move for judgment pursuant to the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">A motion for judgment pursuant to stipulation cannot be considered a trial on the merits. If a party to such stipulation is entitled to judgment, it is upon the' stipulation which has been entered as an order of the court, and not upon a trial of the case. The motion for a new trial was therefore irregular, and should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Myrick, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
