The defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint should have been sustained. The allegation that the deed, if executed, will be a cloud upon plaintiff\u2019s title, is merely a legal conclusion. There is an allegation <em>\u201c </em>that the defendant levied upon said real property under and by virtue of a writ of execution, issued out of the Superior Court of the county of Santa Clara, in an action of Henry Miller, plaintiff, and W. H. Schuyler, defendant,\u201d etc. There is no averment that any judgment was ever rendered or entered in the action <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Schuyler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">A plaintiff asking a decree to enjoin the execution of a deed must allege facts showing that, in an action of ejectment founded on the deed, he would be required to offer evidence to overcome the effect of the deed. <em>(Pixley </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>15 Cal. 128; <em>England </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>25 Cal. 337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">A sheriff has no general authority, as such, to sell any person\u2019s property. And although an execution, issued out of a court of competent jurisdiction, may protect him in an action of trespass brought by the judgment debtor against whom the execution runs, for taking personal property, it will not protect him in an action brought by a third person, nor will it suffice to deraign title to real estate to the purchaser at the execution sale. A party in ejectment relying on a sheriff\u2019s deed must introduce not only the deed, but the judgment and execution by virtue of which the property was sold. <em>(Quirk </em>v. <em>Falk, </em>47 Cal. 455.) The sheriff\u2019s deed is not admissible in evidence without first introducing the judgment which is the authority for the sheriff to sell. ( <em>Vassault </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>32 Cal. 597.) An execution, without a judgment, gives the sheriff no authority to sell. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Hasbrouck, </em>12 Johns. 213; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Moreman, </em>1 Mon. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>If the defendant here should execute the deed, the execution of which plaintiff seeks to enjoin, and an ejectment should be brought upon it, the deed and execution would not, in the absence of a judgment, compel the plaintiff to introduce any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">It follows, therefore, that the omission to aver in the complaint the existence of a judgment is a fatal defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded, with directions to the court below to sustain the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
