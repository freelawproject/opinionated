(1 Chit. Plead. 552.) If to such a plea there was a replication, the burden of proving the affirmative of the issue devolved on the defendant. Under the Code the statement of any new matter in the answer, in avoidance, must be deemed controverted by the opposite party. [Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Here the averment in the answer that the shooting was done in self-defense was controverted\u2014put in issue\u2014by the plaintiff, and it devolved on the defendant to prove the affirmative of that issue. But the court nonsuited the plaintiff because she did not prove that it was not done in self-defense. This was shifting the burden from the side on which the law cast it to the opposite side.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Judgment and order reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Thornton, J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
