The work was done to his satisfaction, and it was so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">It does not appear that there was any fraud or mistake on the part of Perrott. His judgment is therefore conclusive, and the defendants are not allowed to go behind it. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>17 N. Y. 177; <em>Wyckoff </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>44 N. Y. 145; <em>Stewart </em>v. Keteltas, 36 N. Y. <em>388; Hudson </em>v. <em>McCartney, </em>33 Wis. 340.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The balance due under the contract (three thousand dollars having been paid) was to be paid upon the completion of the work and delivery of the bridge to San Joaquin County. This was done on the 27th of November, 1880, and is substantially so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">The other facts found, in our view, are immaterial, as the defendants are concluded by the judgment of Perrott.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">The plaintiffs have a right to recover the balance under the contract, viz., fifteen hundred dollars, with interest from the 27th day of November, 1880, the day of the delivery of the work, since which time it has been a free county bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">There was no error in not finding as to the extra work. This was not assigned to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs for the balance due as above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">Myrick, J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
