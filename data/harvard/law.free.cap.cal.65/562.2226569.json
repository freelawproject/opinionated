Under that section all the moneys paid into the State treasury were paid to be applied to the support of lazarettos or lepers\u2019 quarters, and were subject to no claim of the commissioner for salary or office expenses. By the Act of March 15, 1883, a new system was adopted. (Stats. and Amdts. to Codes 1883, p. 368.) By that act the commissioner is required to pay into the State treasury \u201call <em>per capita </em>fees collected by him, and moneys derived from fines, penalties, and forfeitures.\u201d And the controller is directed to audit the salary and office expenses of the commissioner, and to draw his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>warrants for the same on the fund composed of the <em>per capita </em>fees, fines, penalties, and forfeitures so paid in by the commissioner, \u201cprovided, however, that no such account for salary and office expenses shall be audited in excess of the amount of \u2018leprosy funds\u2019 on hand,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">It is apparent from the reading of the act that it was not the intention of the legislature that the salary and office expenses of the commissioner should be paid out of any money in the treasury, being the excess of moneys collected beyond salary and office expenses prior to the passage of the Act of March 15,1883, but that the salary and office expenses of the commissioner, after that act went into effect, should be paid only out of the fund made up from fees collected, fines, etc., which were required by its terms to be paid into the treasury, without any deduction for salary and office expenses. The petitioner took office, April 1, 1883, after the amendatory law went into operation, and, as we construe the laws, can, at most, only claim to be paid his salary, etc., out of the moneys paid into the treasury after March 15, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Writ denied and proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Ross, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
