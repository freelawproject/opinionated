As said by the court below, this was one mode \"of ascertaining the value at the time of the injury</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">2. There were averments in the complaint to the effect, and some evidence tending to prove, that defendant permitted more water to flow in the canal than it could safely carry. The charge in that regard was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">3. As part of its general charge, the court instructed the jury;\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">\u201cYou are instructed that the measure of damages in this case, if you find the plaintiff has been damaged by the negligence of the defendant, will be the difference between the value of the crop of wheat as it then stood, as part of the realty, at the time of the injury, and immediately succeeding its injury, with legal interest up to the rendition of the verdict. <em>In other words, </em>if you find a verdict for the plaintiff you will ascertain from the evidence what the crop of wheat was worth at the time it was <em>injwred or </em>destroyed, if you find it was <em>injured or </em>destroyed, and give legal interest <em>on that amount </em>up to the time of rendering your verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Defendant excepted to all of the last paragraph, commencing \u201c in other words,\u201d and down to (and including) the word \u201c verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The portion of the instruction excepted to was stated by the court to be an equivalent of the first sentence. But an instruction that the verdict should be for the value of the crop at the time it was injured, with interest, is not substantially the same thing as an instruction that the verdict should be for the difference between the values immediately before and after the injury, with interest on that difference. The distinction between the first and last sentence of the instruction is radical\u2014they are contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>It is urged the charge is to be read as a whole, and it is not necessary that a distinct instruction, much less a separated sentence, shall include all the qualifications or limitations upon the general rule laid down in it which the law requires, provided it appears the jury were given such qualifications or limitations elsewhere. But the cases cited in support of this proposition do not apply to the present case. Here two separate and irreconcilable rules for the conduct of the jury in fixing an amount of damages were given by the court. The contradictory rules were not harmonized by the declaration of the court that the one meant the same thing as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for a new trial. *</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
