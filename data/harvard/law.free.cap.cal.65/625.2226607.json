Smith?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the question upon several grounds, and among others, on the ground that it calls for secondary evidence. The objections were overruled and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">By section 2051 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is allowable to impeach a witness by asking him if he has been convicted of a felony, or the fact may be proved by producing the record of conviction. Proof of such a fact by oral testimony of the witness is, however, an exception to the general rule as it existed before the Code. Under that rule, the only admissible evidence of the former conviction of a witness of felony was the record of conviction. And the rule is yet applicable to the proof of conviction of an offense other than felony, for the Code which has made an exception to the rule in convictions of felony, declares that a witness cannot be impeached by evidence of par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ticular wrongful acts; these do not fall within the exception; therefore the fact of a former conviction of misdemeanor cannot be proved by the examination of the witness. The record of conviction of misdemeanor is the best evidence of the fact, and it is indispensable. .
