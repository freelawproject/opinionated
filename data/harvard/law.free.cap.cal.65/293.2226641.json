Instead of paying the money, the plaintiff elected to give a bond, under section 1251 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which required that the bond should be executed with sureties approved by the court in double the amount assessed. The bond was signed by four sureties in the sum of six thousand dollars each. <em>Held, </em>that the bond was insufficient.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b323-5\">Id.\u2014Amended Bond\u2014Power of Court.\u2014The court allowed an amended bond to be filed after the expiration of thirty days from the rendition of the judgment^ <em>Held, </em>that the court exceeded its power, and that the bond was ineffectual.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">Appeal from an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County releasing a levy, recalling an execution, and granting leave to file an amended bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">The facts appear in the opinion of the court and in the head-notes.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>A. </em>B. <em>Hotchkiss, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-9\">There is only one surety to the bond.

In so providing, the court below proceeded under section 1251 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads: \u201cThe plaintiff must, within thirty days after final judgment, pay the sum of money assessed; but may, at the time of or before payment, elect to build the fences and cattle-guards, and if he so elect, shall execute to the defendant a bond, with sureties to be approved by the court, in double the assessed cost of the same, to build such fences and cattle-guards within eighteen months from the time the railroad is built on the land taken, and if such bond be-given, need not pay the cost of such fences and cattle-guards.\u201d .... It is contended by appellant\u2019s counsel that this provision of the Code of Procedure has been abrogated by section 14 of article i. of the present Constitution. But in this case it is not necessary to decide that point, for the reason that the bond executed by the plaintiff within the time mentioned in the statute, as well as in the judgment, was insufficient. Without reference to any other objection made to that bond, it was insufficient in that there was, in the aggregate, but one surety in double the assessed cost of the fences and cattle-guards. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The bond authorized by the statute and judgment not having been given within the time required, the defendant was entitled to an execution to enforce the payment of the amount adjudged it. What is called in the record the \u201camended bond,\u201d was unauthorized either by the judgment or statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Order reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">McKinstry, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
