The complaint, in addition to the demand for possession, averred that the rents and profits of the premises during the time of the withholding were worth $1,500, and \u201cthat by reason of said withholding plaintiff has been damaged in the sum of $1,500.\u201d The prayer was for restoration of possession and $1,500 damages. The answer contained general denials, and also special averments of defendant\u2019s right to possession under a lease from plaintiff\u2019s grantor. The plaintiff demurred \u201c to all of defendant\u2019s answer which occurs after line four, page two, on the ground that the same does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense.\u201d The demurrer was sustained. The case was tried by a jury. The verdict and judgment are recited in the opinion, which states all other necessary facts.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-13\"><em>D.

But the demurrer is to \u201call of defendant\u2019s amended answer, which occurs after line four, page two.\u201d The amended answer in the transcript is not numbered , as to lines or pages. A demurrer must be directed to the whole of a pleading, or to a particular and separate count, or statement of a cause of action or defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u2022The verdict was; \u201c We, the jury in the above-entitled cause, find for plaintiff in the sum of $500.\u201d Even if it should be conceded that the verdict passed upon the issues made by the pleadings, the <em>judgment </em>was erroneous and must be reversed. The judgment was: \u201cWherefore, .... it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said plaintiff do have and recover from said defendant the sum of $500 damages, together with said plaintiff\u2019s costs and disbursements incurred in this action, amounting to the sum of $90.45.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">This is no adjudication of the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession, or with reference to the ouster, or as to defendant\u2019s alleged withholding of the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The verdict and judgment for $500 were intended to be either for \u201c rents and profits \u201d or for \u201c damages for withholding.\u201d The plaintiff was authorized to unite a claim to recover specific real property with a claim for damages for withholding thereof, and for rents and profits of the same; ' (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 427.) Whatever may be the difference between the two claims last mentioned, they are to be treated as in nature of an alleged <em>trespass for mesne projits,-which, </em>can be recovered only after or. contemporaneously with a judgment for recovery of the pos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>sion of the demanded premises.
