The mortgage was executed in \u00a1November, 1879, to secure the payment of a promissory note payable in three years. It contained no special covenants as to payment of taxes. In January, 1883, the mortgagor paid the full amount of the note and interest, less three hundred and ninety-five dollars, which sum he had paid in taxes on the mortgage interest, without being requested to do so by the mortgagee. The action was brought to foreclose the mortgage for this last-named sum. The remaining facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-9\"><em>M.

Waiving all defects of form, defendant was justified in claiming the sums paid by him for plaintiff\u2019s taxes as payments upon the mortgage debt. There was no contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee by which the former agreed to pay the taxes upon the mortgaged premises, the obligation of which was impaired by the provisions of the new Constitution. It is said that to hold that the mortgagor is to be allowed the sum by him paid for taxes assessed against the mortgagee, is to relieve him from the payment of a part of the money which he agreed to pay. But a power superior to both has relieved the mortgagor of a part of the taxes he was previously bound to pay, and has imposed upon the mortgagee a tax upon property previously not taxable. The mortgagor never owed the mortgagee any money for taxes. Under the former system he owed the <em>State </em>the taxes assessed upon the whole valuation of the property; under the present system he owes the State primarily the tax upon the value of the property, less the mortgage debt, and the mortgagee owes the tax levied on the mortgage interest. The mortgagor having paid an amount due from the mortgagee to the third party\u2014the State\u2014is entitled to recover the amount so paid. <em>(McCoppin </em>v. <em>McCartney, </em>60 Cal. 371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
