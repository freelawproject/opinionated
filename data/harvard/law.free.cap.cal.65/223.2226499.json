The word <em>public </em>is used in the clause of the Constitution in opposition to secret. As said by Judge Cooley, it is not meant that every person who sees fit shall in all cases be permitted to attend criminal trials. \u201c The requirement of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused; that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned, and that the presence of interested spectators may keep his triors keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility, and to the importance of their functions, and the requirement is fairly observed, if without partiality or favoritism, a reasonable portion of the public is suffered to attend, notwithstanding that those persons whose presence would be of no service to the accused, and who would only be drawn thither by a prurient curiosity are excluded altogether.\u201d (Const. Lim. Side p. 312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
