Law\u2014Instructions\u2014Degree of Crime. \u2014 The defendant was charged with the crime of murder, and convicted of murder of the second degree. The court instructed the jury that \u201cinsulting words, gestures, <em>or actions </em>will not reduce an unlawful killing from murder to manslaughter, unless the gestures or actions are such as to reasonably induce the belief of danger to life, or of great bodily harm, in the mind of the party against whom'they are used.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that if the defendant reasonably believed from the \u201cactions used\u201d that he was in danger of losing his life or of receiving great bodily harm, the killing of his assailant was justifiable, and as there was testimony before the jury upon which they might have found a verdict of manslaughter, the instruction was erroneous.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b594-15\">Id,\u2014Confession of Demurrer.\u2014An order allowing the prosecution in a trial for murder, to confess a demurrer to the information, followed by a direction that the district attorney file another information, is an order \u201cto the effect\u201d that the demurrer be allowed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Id.\u2014Information\u2014Title of Court\u2014Name of County.\u2014The omission to name the county in the title of an information is a technical defect, not affecting the substantial rights of the defendant when the name of the county appears in the body of the information.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b595-5\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-7\"><em>W.

Upon the jury was imposed the task of determining which, if any, of the statements of each witness were to be believed. A careful examination of the bill of exceptions shows that there was evidence before them upon which they might have based a verdict, guilty of manslaughter. The charge was plainly erroneous in respect to a material matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">As appears from the bill of exceptions, on the 14th day of September, 1882, \u201c counsel for the prosecution moved the court to grant an order setting aside the order of this court made and entered on the 8th inst., overruling the demurrer to the information herein, and allow the prosecution to confess said demurrer, which motion is granted, and it is therefore ordered that the said order overruling the said demurrer made and entered herein on the 8th day of September, 1882, be, and the same is hereby set aside and vacated. Counsel for the prosecution thereupon confessed the said demurrer, and upon suggestion of counsel for the prosecution, the court orders that the district attorney file a new information against the defendant,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Section 1007 of the Penal Code reads: \u201cUpon considering the demurrer, the court must give judgment either allowing or disallowing it, and an order to that effect must be entered upon the minutes.\u201d It is contended by appellant that the demurrer \u201cconfessed\u201d by the prosecution was never finally disposed of-that no order was entered in the minutes allowing or disallowing it. It would certainly have been more regular to have entered an order expressly allowing the demurrer, but we think the order allowing the prosecution to confess that the demurrer was well taken, followed by a direction that the district attorney file another information, was an order \u201cto the effect\u201d that the demurrer be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">It is contended by appellant that the court below erred in disallowing defendant\u2019s demurrer to the information filed September 22,1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Section 951 of the Penal Code provides: The indictment or information may be substantially in the following form: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cThe people of the State of California against A B, in the Superior Court of the county of-, the \u2014 day of-, A.

A B is accused by the grand jury of the county of-, by this indictment (or by the district attorney by this information), of the crime of (giving its legal appellation, such as murder, arson, or the like, or designating it as felony or misdemeanor), committed as follows: The said A B, on the \u2014 day of-, A. D. 18\u2014, at the county of-(here set forth the act or omission charged as an offense), contrary to the form, force, and effect of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity o'f the people of the State of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The information is entitled: \u201cIn the Superior Court of the county of-, State of California, The People of the State of California against Patrick Biggins: Information for murder.\u201d It proceeds: \u201c Patrick Biggins is accused by the district attorney of ' the said county of <em>Fresno,\u201d </em>etc. We think the omission of the name of the county in the title is a technical error or defect which did not affect the substantial rights of the defendant. It must, therefore, be disregarded by this court. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1258.) The information concludes, \u201ccontrary to the form, force, and effect of the statute in such cases made and provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>and against the peace and dignity of the people of the State of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The information sufficiently avers that the acts of defendant wer<em>e </em>contrary to the force and effect of the statute.\u201d The objection that it only charges that deceased died contrary to the form, force, etc., is hypercritical.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
