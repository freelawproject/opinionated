The petitioner was convicted of battery by a Justice\u2019s Court and sentenced to fifty days\u2019 imprisonment. He appealed from the judgment to the Superior Court, and was released from custody pending the appeal. The Superior Court dismissed the appeal, and an order was made recommitting him to prison. The fifty days expired during the pendency of the appeal, and a discharge from imprisonment under the order was asked on the ground that the appeal did not stay the execution because there was no certificate of probable cause.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-12\">W. <em>E.

This is not disputed. But it is claimed that the appeal did not stay execution because there was no \u201ccertificate of probable cause,\u201d such as the Code requires in order to have the appeal operate as a stay. The appeal, however, was duly taken, and the justice, sheriff, and petitioner treated it as a stay of execution during its pend-ency. We think, under such circumstances, the same effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>should be given to the dismissal of the appeal as would be given to it if there had been a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Application denied and petitioner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
