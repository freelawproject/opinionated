Defendant demurred to the complaint, and at the time he appeared and demurred (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 396), demanded in writing that the trial be had in San Francisco, the proper county. Upon due notice defendant moved for a change of the place of trial upon affidavit that, at the commencement of the action and afterwards, he resided in the city and county of San Francisco, and no affidavit denying the statements of defendant\u2019s affidavit was filed on the part of plaintiff. When, on the 27th of October, 1883, defendant\u2019s motion came on to be heard, and after defendant\u2019s counsel had read the papers designated in Ms notice of motion, and the court had sustained an objection of defendant to the hearing of a cross-motion by plaintiff to retain the cause in El Dorado County, \u201cfor the convenience of witness,\u201d the court ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201c that further hearing of defendant\u2019s motion be postponed until defendant files his answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and that plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion be heard at the time when the further hearing of defendant\u2019s motion is heard, and that said motion and cross-motion may be brought on for final hearing upon ten days\u2019 notice by either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">This order, in its legal effect, was an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a change of the place of trial. It effectually deprived him of his right to have his demurrer heard in San Francisco. <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>61 Cal. 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The order of the 27th of October, 1883, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">As the court erred in continuing the hearing of defendant\u2019s motion until he should file an answer, and as it appears from the bill of exceptions, settled and certified by the learned judge below, that defendant, on the 17th day of November, 1883, pursuant to the order of the court, \u201cwas compelled to and did serve and file his answer,\u201d it follows that the order of January 18, 1884, was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Orders reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
