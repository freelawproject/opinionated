The jury were not told that they could not find any other verdict, and the court was not requested to charge them that they could.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">It appears that when the jury were leaving the court-room on their way to the jury-room the clerk handed them three forms of verdict corresponding to those mentioned, and that they returned one of them as their verdict. That is, they found the defendant guilty of grand larceny. This does not, in our opinion, constitute an error, or even an irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Thornton, J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
