The defendant John Dascey filed his petition in insolvency, and in his schedule the premises were properly described and alleged to be a homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The answer presented the defense, that the insolvent petitioned the county court to set apart the premises as a homestead, and that said court, after hearing the proofs of the respective parties, did adjudge that-the premises were not impressed with the character of a homestead, but that they were assets subject to the payment of debts, and directed the defendant as assignee to sell the same and apply the proceeds to the payment of the insolvent\u2019s debts, and that by this finding and adjudication, the plaintiffs are estopped from claiming the premises as a homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">This court said in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>62 Cal. 440, \u201c there is no statute of this State authorizing a sale in insolvency proceedings, of property which has been declared a homestead.\u201d The Homestead Act of 1852 (under which the declaration of homestead in this case was made), declared that the premises selected \u201cshall not be subject to forced sale, on execution, or any final process from any court, for any debt or liability contracted or incurred after the passage of the act to which this is amendatory.\u201d Section 6 of the Insolvent Act of 1852 made it the duty of the judge of the insolvency court to set apart property not subject to execution. The Insolvent Act did not in terms, nor by any inference, declare that the neglect or refusal of the judge of the insolvency court to set apart property should be a conclusive adjudication that it was not a homestead under the Homestead Act, or should be equivalent to an abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Sharpstein, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
