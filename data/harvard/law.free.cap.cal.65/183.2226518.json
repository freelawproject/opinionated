The death of the defendant\u2019s intestate did not annul the grant. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>5 Allen, 454.) Readiness and willingness of plaintiff to marry, she having the requisite legal status, makes out her case. (2 Chitty\u2019s Plead. 571; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>64 Ind. 571.)

B. \u00a1Nagle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">' As the case is presented, it appears that at the time of the execution of the contract both of the contracting parties were unmarried; that the plaintiff, in accordance with the obligations imposed on her thereby, remained unmarried, and was, from the time of the making of the contract to the time of the death of Jarvis, which occurred on the 8th of September, 1882, always ready and willing to marry him, of which he was constantly advised; but that he in disregard of the obligation imposed upon him by the contract refused to marry the plaintiff, and continued such refusal to the time of his death. After the death of Jarvis, an administrator of his estate was appointed, to whom the plaintiff presented a verified claim based on the contract, which claim was rejected by the administrator. The action is to recover of the administrator the value of the bonds and one half of the accrued interest thereon. The interpretation of the contract adopted by the court below was, that, on the part of Jarvis, there was a mere promise to deliver the bonds upon the marriage of the parties within a reasonable time. \u201c The happening of a future event, viz., the marriage, was,\u201d said the court, \u201c a condition precedent to the vesting of the bonds in plaintiff.\u201d We cannot so construe the contract. The language is: \u201c The party of the first part grants and gives to the party of the second part\u201d certain described bonds then in the possession of the party of the first part, \u201call of which he promises to deliver to her, the party of the second part, on or before the day of their said marriage, to be and become her own absolute property in her own name as her separate estate.\u201d The bonds which he granted and gave he promised to deliver to the plaintiff on or <em>before </em>the day of their marriage] and the consideration for this was, the affection existing between the parties and their mutual agreement to marry. It was nothing more nor less than an antenuptial settlement, the consequences of which could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>avoided by Jarvis\u2019 refusal to consummate Ms agreement to marry the plaintiff\u2014she being at all times ready and willing to marry him and no reason for his refusal appearing. It was not for her to seek him, but it was his duty to have sought her in marriage within a reasonable time after the engagement. \u201c The modesty of the sex is considered by the common law,\u201d said Lord Coke.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Jarvis having without excuse refused to consummate his engagement, and the plaintiff having in all things complied with the obligations imposed on her by the contract, she is legally and justly entitled to receive the consideration for which she plighted her troth. That the promise and conduct of the plaintiff constituted adequate and valuable consideration for the settlement does not admit of doubt. The circumstance that the marriage was not in fact consummated is immaterial. It was not consummated because of the fault of Jarvis, and it is a maxim of the law that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong. Besides, with respect to the sufficiency and value of the consideration, there does not appear to be any real and substantial distinction between a marriage formally solemnized and a binding and obligatory agreement, fairly made, to form such connection and enter into that relation. \u201cAll the consequences of a legal obligation,\u201d as said by the court in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Alien, </em>5 Allen, 458, \u201c accompany such an agreement. The law enforces its performance by affording an effectual remedy against the party who shall, 'without legal excuse, fail to fulfill it. But a contract of this kind is not to be regarded as a valuable consideration merely because damages commensurate with the injury may be recovered of the party who inexecusably refuses to fulfill it. It is peculiar in its character, and has other effects and consequences attending it. It essentially changes the rights, duties and privileges of the parties. They cannot, while it exists, without a violation of good faith, as well as of the material obligations to which it subjects them, negotiate a contract for such an alliance with any other person. A woman who has voluntarily made such an agreement cannot without indelicacy, and so not without exposing herself to unfavorable observation, and to some loss of public favor and respect, seek elsewhere, except for good and substantial reasons withdrawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>from, the engagement by which she has bound herself, for preferment in marriage; and thus her promise and agreement to marry a particular person essentially change her condition in life. They materially affect not only her opportunities but her right to attempt in that way to improve them. A legal contract and promise made in good faith to marry another must, therefore, like an actual marriage, be deemed to be a valuable consideration for the conveyance of an estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to the court below to overrule the demurrer to the amended complaint with leave to the defendant to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">McKinstry, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
