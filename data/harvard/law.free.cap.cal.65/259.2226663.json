(2) Errors in law occurring at the trial,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the judgment is not a statutory cause on which to base a motion for a new trial, nor can such motion be based on the ground that the <em>judgment </em>is against law. The motion should be directed at the decision. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Matfield, </em>49 Cal. 42.) As the proceedings leading to an application for a new trial are initiated only by a motion to set aside the <em>decision, </em>it follows that they cannot be commenced by notice of motion to vacate and set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The statement on motion for new trial (so called) in the transcript, cannot be considered by this court. It is not signed nor certified by the judge of the court below. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 659, 660; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>55 Cal. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The order granting a new trial must be reversed, because there was no notice or statement such as authorized the court below to act upon the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The order was not made by the court on its own motion. It does not purport to be such an order, but was made on the application of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
