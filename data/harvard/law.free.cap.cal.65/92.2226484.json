The plaintiff set out in his complaint the terms of the affidavit made and filed by him upon his application to purchase, which failed to state whether there were or were not settlers upon the land. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained, and the plaintiff declining to amend, the defendant had judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>T. </em>M. <em>McNamara, A.

The statute under which the plaintiff\u2019s application is made (Pol. Code, \u00a7 3443) requires the affiant to state, among other things, that he knows the land applied for and the exterior bounds thereof, and knows, of his own knowledge, that there are no settlers thereon; or, if there are, that the land has been segregated more than six months by authority of the United States. From the affidavit of the plaintiff it does not appear whether there are or are not settlers on the land which he seeks to purchase. The courts cannot hold immaterial, matters which the statute declares must be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">McKinstry, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
