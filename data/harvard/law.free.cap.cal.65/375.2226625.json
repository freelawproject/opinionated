(Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1254.) If possession has been taken in advance of such order by the court allowing plaintiff to take possession, the Superior Court has power to have the possession restored to the defendant. Hence the applicant has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, by recourse by motion to the Superior Court above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Writ denied and application dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
