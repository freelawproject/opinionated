Under these circumstances plaintiff commenced the action in hand for a partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Partition may be had of real property, held and occupied by several persons as coparceners, joint tenants, or tenants in common, according to their respective rights and interest in it, whether the estate which they own therein be an estate of inheritance, or for life or lives, or for years. (\u00a7 752, Code Civ. Proc.) But in the land itself, described in the deed under which defendant derives his right, the defendant was not a coparcener, joint tenant, or tenant in common. The deed only vested in him a particular estate, <em>i. </em>e., the right of taking from the land any minerals or ores in place in it, to the extent of the interest in them granted to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">A \u201cmining right\u201d upon a specific piece of ground is a right to enter upon and occupy the ground, for the purpose of working it, either by underground excavations or open workings, to obtain from it the minerals or ores which may be deposited therein. By implication the grant of such a right carries with it whatever is incident to it and necessary to its beneficial enjoyment. (C<em>lark </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>15 Cal. 86; <em>Cave </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>53 Cal. 135.) In addition to that implication the grant, in this instance, conveyed an interest \u201c in the water rights, reservoirs, and tail race \u201d on the mining ground. But it did not convey the exclusive dominion of any portion of the ground so as to make the grantee a joint tenant or tenant in common with the grantor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>It conveyed only a particular estate, or incorporeal hereditament, in land of which the grantor held the general estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">This particular estate or incorporeal hereditament is what is known in law as a servitude \u201cin gross,\u201d or a personal servitude, imposed upon land for the benefit of the person or persons owning the right, irrespective of the ownership of the land. The right is usufructuary in its nature and character, and entitles the owner to the use of the land for the profits which may be derived from its rents, or from quarrying and digging it for ores, or from harvesting its fruits, crops, and vintages, etc. (\u00a7\u00a7 802-806, Civ. Code.) As an incorporeal hereditament, it is subject to the general rules which govern the enjoyment of real property, and to the laws of descent, devolution, and transfer by act of law, according to the freehold or chattel interest acquired in it; but it is not in its nature capable of partition, because a division of the right would enlarge the original grant beyond the intention of the grantor, and likewise prove a greater charge than was originally intended by the owner of the soil (Bacon\u2019s Ab. 359); and because, so long as the minerals and ores, which are the subject of the servitude, are in place, unworked and unsevered from the soil, they are incapable of allotment according to quality and quantity relatively considered. (\u00a7 764, Code Civ. Proc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\"><em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>23 Cal. 502, is not in conflict'with this conclusion. The land sought to be partitioned in that case was a \u201c mining claim,\u201d which the court held was the subject of partition the same as other real property. But why? Because, as was said in <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Judd, </em>14 Cal. 60, \u201c'our courts have given mining claims the recognition of legal estates of freehold; and as to all practical purposes, if we except some doctrine of abandonment, not, perhaps, applicable to such estates, they unquestionably are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The working of a mine under a bare \u201cmining right\u201d has been uniformly considered by courts of equity as a species of trade. Hence the legal relation existing between two or more persons interested in such a right is that of a qualified partnership ; and the remedies relating to a mining partnership are available for the assertion or violation of any right arising out of it. (\u00a7 684, and ch. 4, title 10, Civ. Code; <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Cal. 164; <em>Duryea, </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>28 Cal. 569; <em>Settembre </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>30 Cal. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">McKinstry, J., and Ross, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
