We think the testatrix\u2019s express intention was that it should not become due and payable until after her debts and funeral expenses had been paid. As we construe the language of the will,'it was to be paid out of the first moneys realized from the estate after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>payment of said debts and funeral expenses. This being the only question presented on this appeal, it follows that so much of the decree as awards $962.50 interest to respondent on said legacy of $5,000 must be reversed <em>\u2022 </em>and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
