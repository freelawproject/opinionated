Whether there was error in granting the injunction is not now for consideration. The case being here upon <em>certiorari, </em>the inquiry, of course, goes only to the power of the court to make the order. The jurisdiction of the court to grant a preliminary injunction, restraining the defendant from interfering\u2019 with the flow of water pending the litigation cannot be doubted, and we cannot see that its jurisdiction is exceeded when it requires the removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>of the <em>means </em>by which the diversion is made. The ultimate aim of the injunction is the undisturbed flow of the water. The objections to the removal of the means by which the diversion is made are no more cogent than the objections to preventing the diversion of the water itself. Upon the hearing in the court below there was testimony tending to show that after the dam that diverted the water had, been in part removed, it was rebuilt by the direction of petitioner, and the diversion of the water continued, notwithstanding the injunction of the court. We do not think the court exceeded its power in adjudging the petitioner guilty of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Writ denied and petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">McKee, J., and McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
