The respondent insists that this court has no jurisdiction to review the judgment. But as the case involves the alleged right of defendants to possess the lands claimed to constitute a toll-road, as against all who shall not pay toll for passing over them, we think the judgment appealable. (Const, art. vi. \u00a7 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">2. Defendants claim to have acquired a franchise from the board of supervisors to collect tolls, and that the board was empowered to grant the franchise by the Act of April 1, 1878, entitled \u201can act to authorize the board of supervisors of Amador County to declare that portion of the Amador and Nevada wagon road which lies in Amador County a toll-road.\u201d (Stats. 1877-78, p. 963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The act is in the words following :\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\u201cSection 1. The board of supervisors of Amador County are hereby authorized to declare that portion of the Amador and \u00a1Nevada wagon road which lies in Amador County a toll-road, to keep the same in repair, to adopt and make rules governing the travel thereover, and to fix the rate of tolls <em>thereon; provided, </em>that the supervisors of said county shall have the right to declare said road a \u2018free road\u2019 at any time, and all improvements that may be or that have been made on said road shall revert for the benefit of the county of Amador, without cost to said county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201cSection 2. The tolls on said road shall not exceed the rates heretofore fixed by the board of supervisors of said county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">\u201cSection 3. All acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">If it be conceded' that the act is constitutional, and that it has not been repealed (Stats, and Arndts, to the Codes, 1883, p. 20, \u00a7 21), it simply grants the franchise to the <em>county </em>to collect tolls on the road, and does not purport to authorize the county to grant any franchise to other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
