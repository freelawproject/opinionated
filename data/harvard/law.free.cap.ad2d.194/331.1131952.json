The same result is compelled in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">On our own <em>de novo </em>review of the matter, we note that before the witness took the stand the prosecutor stated that the witness was testifying \"under his own volition\u201d, noting, \"The People have not made any promises to him as far as his pending case is concerned, no promises whatsoever.\u201d In fact, as the record of the post-trial hearing discloses, a supervising attorney from the prosecutor\u2019s office told the witness, \"[I]t\u2019s a question of trust. We trust you. If you trust us, we trust you. You testify on the witness stand, and we will work out a disposition that will be favorable to you, but we can\u2019t tell you any promises. We make no promises what they will be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In his trial testimony, the witness repeatedly denied being given any promise for his testimony, although at one point he stated that he understood that his case was to be dropped or the charges reduced. He retreated from this statement, however, and continued to deny that any promise had been made. So profuse where his denials of any \"deal\u201d that at one point the court, exasperated at the number of times the question as to what benefit the witness expected as a result of his testimony, stated, \"Last time I\u2019m going to let that question be asked. It\u2019s been asked at least a half a dozen times. I\u2019ll allow it this time. Let\u2019s see what the answer is.\u201d The witness answered, \"Nothing\u201d. The trial court reiterated the answer by commenting, \"Nothing, okay\u201d. The prosecutor repeated this theme in her summation, stating repeatedly, \"There was no deal made\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In the circumstances, we believe that the prosecutor\u2019s and witness\u2019s specific denials of any promise or other motivation for the witness\u2019s testimony mandate reversal.
