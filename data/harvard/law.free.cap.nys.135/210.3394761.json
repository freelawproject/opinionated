J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIp\">This appeal is from an order that denies a motion to vacate an injunction order. The plaintiff as stockholder in a corporation complains against the corporation and its officers of an issue of the capital stock out of the treasury to the defendant M. Proskey, the wife of the president of the corporation, without consideration, and by connivance of the president, in order that M. Proskey and her son, the defendant D. V. Proskey, treasurer of the corporation could secure the controlling interest and a majority of the capital stock, of \u201cwhich this plaintiff had control\u201d before such issue. The specific relief asked was the surrender of the certificate issued to the defendant M. Proskey for cancellation and return to the treasury. There was also a prayer for any appropriate general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-19\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The, Special Term upon a contested motion made an order that inter alia provided that the application to stay the officers and directors of the defendant and .their attorneys, servants, or agents \u201cfrom exercising any corporate management or proprietorship whatever or interfering in any way with the management of the business of the said corporation until the final determination of this action\u201d be granted, provided the plaintiff file a bond in the sum of $1,000 securing the defendant corporation and D. Proskey and D. V. Proskey, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>officers and directors thereof, \u201cfor the faithful accounting to the said parties for the assets of the\u201d corporation, \u201cnow or heretofore in the hands of the said\u201d plaintiff \u201cor hereafter received by her.\u201d The order is too drastic.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Presumably the power of managing the business of a corporation is vested solely in its officers and directors. M\u00f3rawetz on Corporations (2d Ed.) \u00a7 511, and cases cited, including Conro v. Port Henry Iron Co., 12 Barb. 27. The court may arrest such officers in some proposed course or halt them in the doing of some specific act, but it cannot in such an action as the one at bar virtually remove the directors, \"for it thereby practically winds up the corporation pendente lite, or, if not, it vests some of the corporate powers in a mere stockholder by virtue of such status, which it cannot do. See Cook on Corporations, \u00a7 746, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion must be granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
