The action is brought to recover damages for the alleged breach of a contract to do rock drilling for the plaintiff in Columbia county. The damages claimed are $6,000, for which judgment is demanded. The answer admits the making of the contract, denies that the plaintiff performed on its part, and as a separate defense and by way of counterclaim alleges that the defendant has sustained damages to the amount of $500 by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to keep the pit or excavation where the drilling was to be done dry and free from water, which, it is claimed, the plaintiff had agreed to do. The contract was to be performed in Columbia county. Substantially all the matters involved in, or connected with, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action, as well as the defendant\u2019s alleged counterclaim, arose in that county, where the defendant resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">It is obvious from the papers presented that, upon the trial of the issues raised, most of the witnesses must be obtained in that county where they reside. Under such circumstances, the general rule should be applied, which is that in transitory actions the issues should be tried in the county where the transactions involved in the controversy took place, unless the greater number of witnesses live in another county. Spanedda v. Murphy, 144 App. Div. 58, 128 N. Y. Supp. 884; Fluckiger v. Haber, 144 App. Div. 65, 128 N. Y. Supp. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">_ The order appealed from, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
