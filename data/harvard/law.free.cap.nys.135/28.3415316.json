It is further alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u201cThat thereafter notice of the presentment, demand, nonpayment, and protest of said note as aforesaid was not given to the defendants within the time required to charge the indorser thereof, to wit, the defendant, George Hoffman, but that, notwithstanding the omission to give such notice, the said defendant Hoffman, with knowledge of such omission, did thereafter make payments on account of said note, and promised the then holder thereof to pay the balance remaining due after crediting such payments, and that by reason thereof the said defendant, Hoffman, waived the notice of dishonor and the omission to give same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">All these allegations are denied, and the plaintiff put to his proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It is clear that the complaint alleges due presentment, and that the only waiver alleged is of due notice of dishonor. This does not include waiver of due presentment. It was therefore incumbent upon plaintiff to prove due presentment, which means that he should have proven that on the date on which the note fell due it was presented for payment at the Hudson Trust Company, where by its tenor it was payable. Section 133, Negotiable Instruments Law. This proof the plaintiff did not make, and thereby failed to prove the case alleged in the complaint. It must therefore be assumed, for the purposes of this appeal, that due presentment and demand was not made, and that the indorser was thereby released, as well as by the subsequent failure to give him due notice of dishonor. The evidence at most might have justified a finding that the appellant had waived the omission to give him due notice of dishonor, and this is all that the complaint alleges that he waived. It is not alleged that he waived due presentment and demand, nor does it appear that he knew that there had been any omission in this regard. He could not be held to have waived that of which he was ignorant.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The judgment and determination appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant in all courts to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
