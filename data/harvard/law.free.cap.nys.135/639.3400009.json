Some time after the expiration of that year, the defendant and his wife entered into a further agreement with the plaintiffs\u2019 assignor, whereby the defendant agreed to pay the sum of $200 in consideration of the extension of the terms of the agreement to repurchase until November 1, 1908. The plaintiff brings'suit upon this agreement, <em>\u25a0and </em>the defendant sets up as a defense that the agreement was usurious, in that it required him to pay $200 and 6 per cent, interest for the forbearance of the plaintiffs\u2019 assignor. The trial justice directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the ground that the consideration was not for the forbearance of a loan, but was merely an extension of an agreement to repurchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">While in form the original agreement was merely an agreement to repurchase a mortgage, the evidence adduced even by the plaintiffs is sufficient to show that, in fact, the agreement sued upon was an extension of time merely to pay a sum of money due to their assignor. The plaintiff himself testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201cOn or about the day the $6,000 became due, I served notice under the agreement on Dr. Rosenberg, demanding the money, but the money was not paid on the day it fell due under the original agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">.Under such circumstances, in spite of the fact that the parties have \u2022continually denominated the agreement as an agreement for a reassignment, it was at least a question of fact whether or not in its essence it was an agreement merely for the payment of a sum of money, and whether or not the extension of that agreement was not a forbearance within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
