The answer sets up a counterclaim, alleging damages of $1,700, and asking an affirmative judgment for a portion of the said claim not exceeding $500. It appeared at the trial that a prior action was pending between the same parties in the County Court of Westchester county upon the cause of action alleged in the counterclaim. The learned trial justice thereupon dismissed the counterclaim without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">It seems to me that this dismissal was error. It is true that the plea of another action pending is ordinarily good against a cause of action alleged in a counterclaim as well as against a cause of action alleged in a complaint (Ansorge v. Kaiser, 3 N. Y. Supp. 785), and the Code (section 495) expressly provides that, where this objection appears on the face of the counterclaim, a demurrer thereto will lie. The object of the rule that the pendency of a former action between the same parties for the same cause may be pleaded in abatement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the second \u00e1ction \u201cis to prevent vexation and the plea can never prevail except where the second suit is vexatious.\u201d Compton v. Green &amp; Ide, 9 How. Prac. 228. There can be no doubt but that a suitor having a claim against another person has the right either to bring an independent action or in a proper case to interpose his cause of action as a counterclaim or set-off. Ordinarily, where he has chosen to bring an independent action, he may interpose his claim as a counterclaim only after discontinuing his prior action, for the law does not look with approval upon the pendency of two actions where full relief .may be afforded in one action. The Municipal Court has not, however, jurisdiction to award judgment upon a counterclaim for more than the sum of $500. This defendant, therefore, by interposing .his counterclaim, cannot obtain the full relief claimed upon his cause of action. Nevertheless, he is not entirely precluded either from interposing his claim as a counterclaim or from obtaining in another action the relief which the Municipal Court cannot give him. By section 157 of the Municipal Court Act he is expressly given both these rights. A judgment in the Municipal Court upon his counterclaim would not bar a.larger recovery in another action in a court of greater jurisdiction, and the pendency of an action in such a court is not vexatious, and should not bar the defendant from interposing his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
