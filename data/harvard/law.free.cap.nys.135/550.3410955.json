We are of opinion, however, that the other relief demanded by the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">It is argued in behalf of the respondent that the facts alleged upon which specific performance is demanded are also alleged as a separate defense, and that either under the denials of the allegations of the complaint, or by virtue of the separate defense, they are available, if proved, to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and that therefore the plaintiff is entitled to have the issues arising on the allegations of the complaint tried before a jury. This contention would doubtless prevail were it not for the fact that the issues arising on the counterclaim involve, not only the issues arising on the allegations of the complaint, but the right of the defendants to specific performance. In the event that the defendants succeed on their counterclaim, that would be an adjudication that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and, if the defendants should be defeated, that would establish the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the amount paid to apply on the purchase price of the premises. The defendants having interposed a counterclaim for equitable relief, the trial of the issues arising thereon must be at Special Term, as if the defendants had brought an action against the plaintiff for the same relief as that demanded in the counterclaim (section 974, C. C. P.), and in such case, where the equitable counterclaim, if established, would extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, the practice requiring the issues arising thereon to be first tried is sustained by authority. Goss v. Goss &amp; Co., 126 App. Div. 748, 111 N. Y. Supp. 115. See, also, section 973 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the dissenting opinion of Ingraham, P. J., in Cohen v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>American Surety Company, 129 App. Div. 166, 113 N. Y. Supp. 375. The respondent, for its contention in this regard, relies principally upon Bennett v. Edison Electric II. Co., 164 N. Y. 131, 58 N. E. 7. In that action, the facts, upon which the defendant sought to have the contract, upon which the action was based, reformed, constituted a complete defense to the action, without reformation of the contract, and thus the defendant could be \u2022 afforded on the trial of the issues arising, on the allegations of the complaint relief from the contract as fully, as if the counterclaim were established and allowed; but here, as has- been seen, the defendants could not obtain, on the defense to the allegations of the complaint, the relief to which they are entitled, and for which they pray in their counterclaim. The decision of this court in'Cohen v. American Surety Co., supra, also relied upon by counsel for the respondent, is distinguishable from the case at bar upon the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, without costs, to the extent of requiring a separate trial of the issues arising on the counterclaim and reply thereto, and staying the trial of the other issues in the meantime. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
