The Pennsylvania warrant charged the plaintiff, with others, with unlawfully and willfully, falsely, and maliciously conspiring to cheat and defraud. It did not charge him with \u201cfalse pretenses and grand larceny.\u201d Nor could the court hold as a matter of law that the defendant had justified the publication. In order to justify a libelous publication, the justification proved must be as broad as the charge, and, whatever view may be entertained as to defendant\u2019s proof bearing on that subject, it was not so clear or convincing as to warrant the court in disposing of it as a matter of law. On the contrary, a question of fact was presented, which should have been left to the jury.'</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
