The goods were those used in and about a bakery, which by a number of instruments of transfer had been placed in the name of the plaintiff under circumstances which indicate clearly that he, who admitted on the stand that he was a workman in the clothing business, acted merely as a dummy in the transaction. It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the jury was affected by some consideration other than the evidence submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-17\">Judgment in favor of plaintiff must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
