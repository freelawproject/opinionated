On that date a resolution of the board of aldermen of the city went into effect fixing the salary \u201cfor the position of architectural draughtsmen at $45 a week,\u201d but on the 30th of the same month another resolution was passed fixing such salary at $35 a week. Plaintiff claims that notwithstanding the resolution of . June 30th, he was entitled to receive the amount stated in the resolution of June 9th\u2014 that is, $45 per week\u2014and here seeks to recover the difference for six years immediately prior to the commencement of the action be-' tween that sum and what he was paid. The action was commenced on April 24, 1911. \u2018 Between April 1, 1905, and January 9, 1906, plaintiff received' $30 per week, and since then $35 per week. Defendant admits for a period of six years immediately prior to the commencement of the action a liability for the difference between the amount paid and the amount as fixed in the resolution of Jun\u00e9 30th\u2014 $35 per week. The amount of the unpaid salary admitted by the defendant is $185.83. The interest thereon is $72.40, making in all $258.23, and for that sum a verdict in favor of plaintiff was directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The plaintiff appeals, claiming he was entitled to receive the difference, together with the interest thereon,. between what was paid and $45 per week. The defendant appeals on the ground that the plaintiff was entitled to interest only from the date of the filing of notice of claim with the comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The question raised by the defendant\u2019s appeal was settled adversely to its contention by a recent decision of this court. Smith v. Board of Education, 135 N. Y. Supp. 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The principal question presented by the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is whether the board of aldermen had the power to reduce the salary from $45 to $35 per week by the resolution of June 30, 1903. Section 56 of the Greater New York charter conferred upon the board of aldermen the power to fix salaries. Such power plainly contemplated that the board might fix the salaries, either by an increase or decrease. Counsel for plaintiff, however, urges that a reduction of his salary by the resolution of June 30th, if such effect be given to it, amounted to a removal from his position by placing him in a lower position than the one theretofore held; that this .could not be done, except in violation of section 1101 of the Greater New York Charter, which provides for the retention of a position by an employ\u00e9 except under certain conditions; which are not here applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Prior to the passage of either resolution, the civil service com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>mission had \u201cgraded the position of architectural draughtsman according to annual compensation.\u201d Thirteen grades were made dependent upon the amount of annual compensation received). But the rate of compensation fixed by the resolutions of the board of aldermen did not place the plaintiff in any of the grades which the proof shows the civil service commission established. The $35 a week rate would have amounted to $1,820 annually, and the $45 a week rate to $2,340 annually. No such grade or position was shown to have been established, and, if so, it would seem to be unavailing to the plaintiff, because, in December, 1903, the grades of position of architectural draughtsmen were abolished. Once the grades were abolished, even though it be conceded that the plaintiff\u2019s position theretofore came within one of the established grades, and that his salary could not, while such grades existed, be reduced, then the resolution applied. The resolution of June 30th unquestionably reduced the plaintiff\u2019s salary from $45 to $35 a week. People ex rel. Stokes v. Tully, 108 App. Div. 345, 95 N. Y. Supp. 916, 1153. The board of aldermen had as 'much power to diminish salaries as to increase them. Buckbee v. Board of Education, 115 App. Div. 366, 100 N. Y. Supp. 943, affirmed 187 N. Y. 544, 80 N. E. 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel also urges that the verdict was inadequate, in that he was only permitted to recover for six years immediately prior to the commencement of the action\u2014that is, from April 24, 1905\u2014his claim being that he should have been permitted to recover from April 1, 1905, because the salary for April was not payable until the last of that month. It was stipulated at the trial that the salaries of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s were \u201cpayable on the last day of each month.\u201d Under the stipulation, therefore, the plaintiff should have been permitted to recover for the entire month of April, and, if he had, the recovery would have been $282.37, instead of $258.23. In the brief presented by defendant\u2019s counsel it is conceded that, if the plaintiff is in a position to raise the question, the court has the power to increase the judgment to this extent. Plaintiff is in a position to raise the question, and the judgment should, therefore, be increased to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The judgment is modified by increasing the amount of plaintiff\u2019s damage from $258.23 to $282.37, and, as thus modified, affirmed without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
