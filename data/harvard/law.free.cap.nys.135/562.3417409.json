Thereafter he filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against the builder, who discharged the lien by filing a bond. This action is brought against the principal and sureties on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-22\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> At the trial the plaintiff proved the delivery of the materials called for by the contract. The defendant then produced evidence that the material was defective in appearance. The defects, however, were entirely patent, and yet it is undisputed that the defendant used them in the building without any objection. Under these circumstances the purchaser of the trim waived the defects, and the judgment in his favor must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The sureties, however, claim that the judgment must be affirmed as to them because the plaintiff failed/to introduce in evidence the mechanic\u2019s lien, and would therefore at most be entitled only to a personal judgment against the owner. Even if this were true, the sureties would be entitled only to a dismissal of the complaint, and not to a judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> I find, however, no sufficient issue raised' by the pleadings upon this point. The owner admits the filing of the lien, and the denial of the sureties is absolutely frivolous, being a denial \u201cof any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief\u201d of the filing of the lien, which was not only a public record, but of which they must, according to the recitals of the bond, have had personal knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Judgment should be reversed) and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
