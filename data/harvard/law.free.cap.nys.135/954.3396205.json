See Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1776; City of New York v. Matthews, 180 N. Y. 41, 72 N. E. 629; Dahlstrom v. Gemunder, 198 N. Y. 449, 92 N. E. 106, 19 Ann. Cas. 771; Borough Construction Co. v. City of New York, 131 App. Div. 278, 1.15 N. Y. Supp. 697; Stone v. Auerbach, 133 App. Div. 75, 117 N. Y. Supp. 734; Preston v. Cuneo, 140 App. Div. 144, 124 N. Y. Supp. 1031; Olsen v. Singer Mfg. Co., 143 App. Div.1142, 127 N. Y. Supp. 697. It is true that in the Condemnation Law, which is now a part of the Code of Civil Procedure (sections 3357-3384), there is no express restatement of the rule contained in section 1776 with regard to the form of pleading in an action necessary to put in issue the fact of corporate existence. But there is a clear indication of a legislative purpose to conform the procedure under the Condemnation Law so far as possible to that in actions and other special proceedings (see sections 3364-3366, 3368, 3372, 3375, 3376), and it is expressly provided in section 3382 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">\u201cWhere the mode or manner of conducting all or any of the proceedings therein is not expressly provided for by law, * * * the practice in such cases shall conform, as near as may be, to the ordinary practice in such court.\u201d See In re N. Y., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 99 N. Y. 12, 1 N. E. 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-9\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The learned court at Special Term held that, as \u201cthe right of the petitioner to condemn the property in question has not been adjudicated,\u201d no power existed to award temporary possession of the land. This construction not only reads into the statute language not contained therein, but is directly contrary to the clear meaning and intent thereof. If no answer is interposed, and it appears from the-petition that plaintiff is ehtitled to the relief demanded, judgment is forthwith entered condemning the land and appointing commissioners to ascertain the compensation to be made to the owners thereof. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3369. If an answer is interposed and the decision goes in favor of plaintiff, a similar judgment is entered, while, if judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ment goes in favor of defendant, the petition is dismissed. Id. _ When no answer is interposed, the Legislature has made no provision for temporary possession, perhaps influenced by the expectation that there should be no considerable delay in determining the amount of compensation to be received by those entitled thereto. That section 3380 contemplates an application between the interposition of an answer and the entry of judgment upon a determination of the issues raised thereby is clear from the provision contained therein that, if judgment goes for the defendant, the \u201cpossession of the property shall be returned to him,\u201d and the sum deposited, or so much as may be necessary, shall be applied to the payment of any damage which he may have sustained by entry upon and use of his property. So far as plaintiff is concerned, the purpose of the statute is to enable him to proceed at his own expense with the projected improvement pending the determination of his right to condemn, provided he chooses to take the risk of an unfavorable decision upon that issue, with the consequent loss to him not only of the amount expended in the meantime, but with the certain obligation to make good to defendant all his damage resulting therefrom. This purpose would be defeated if in each instance the right to condemn must first be established. In a condemnation proceeding the issuable facts are those facts which \u201care essential as a basis for the institution of the proceeding.\u201d City of Geneva v. Henson, 195 N. Y. 447, 88 N. E. 1104. The right of a public service corporation to condemn land may be resisted upon several grounds. Among these are (a) that it is not an existing corporation\u2014In re B. W. &amp; N. Ry. Co., 72 N. Y. 245; In re New York Cable Co. v. Mayor, 104 N. Y. 1, 10 N. E. 332; (b) .that the Legislature has not conferred upon it the right to exercise the power of eminent domain\u2014In re N. F. &amp; W. R. Co., 108 N. Y. 375, 15 N. E. 429; Erie R. Co. v. Steward, 61 App. Div. 480, 70 N. Y. Supp. 698, affirmed 170 N. Y. 172, 63 N. E. 118; (c) that the use for which the property is sought is not a public use, or, if, so, that it is not the specific public use for which plaintiff was given the power of condemnation\u2014Queens Terminal Co. v. Schmuck, 147 App. Div. 502, 132 N. Y. Supp. 159; or (d) that there is no necessity for the acquisition of the land for such use\u2014In re Staten Island R. T. Co., 103 N. Y. 251, 8 N. E. 548; Long Island R. R. Co. v. Sherwood, 205 N. Y. 1, 98 N. E. 169. All of these are issuable facts. It is hard to think of a case\u2014in fact, none suggests itself to our minds\u2014in which the statute would be available if construed so as to require a determination favorable to plaintiff of either of these basic facts before temporary possession might be given. But defendant contends that, when the issue of necessity is raised, it cannot be determined that \u201cthe public interests will be prejudiced by delay\u201d without in effect determining in advance that issue, since, if there is no necessity, public interests will not be affected. To a degree, if not to the same degree, the argument applies, also, to a case where resistance is made upon either of the other grounds stated. The \u201cpublic\u201d interests cannot be affected if plaintiff is not a corporation, or has no power of condemnation, or the use is not a public use or is not the specific public use for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>the power of eminent domain has been conferred. The statute must, if possible, be so construed as to give it vitality. We think its fair meaning is that when the use specified is a public use and when the court is satisfied that, assuming that the issues raised by the petition and answer will ultimately be decided in plaintiff\u2019s favor, public interests will be prejudiced by the delay necessary to the determination thereof, it may grant the relief asked for. The situation is somewhat analogous to that presented when in an action for equitable relief by way of injunction a provisional remedy by order is granted, which, for the time being, affords the same relief sought to be obtained by final judgment. There is a preliminary hearing there which to some extent involves the merits. We see no reason for holding that the Legislature intended to except from the beneficial provisions of the act the case when \u201cnecessity\u201d was the fact at issue, while making it applicable to every other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\"><bracketnum>[5,6]</bracketnum> The constitutionality of this act was considered and its validity sustained in Re N., L. &amp; O. Power Co., 111 App. Div. 686, 97 N. Y. Supp. 853, and there is a dictum to the like effect in Re St. L. &amp; <em>A. R. </em>Co., 133 N. Y. 270, 31 N. E. 218, where the court said: \u201cThe provision made by section 3380 fully satisfies the constitutional obligation.\u201d Viewing it as an original proposition, we should reach the same result. Our Bill of Rights contains this provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">\u201cNor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d Const, art. 1, \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">It does not in express terms require compensation to precede pos-' session, although the title does not pass from the owner until such compensation is actually received. \u201cIf compensation need not be first made, then the whole matter rests in the discretion of the Legislature and the right to possession is complete when the conditions precedent imposed by statute have been complied with\u201d (2 Lewis on Eminent Domain [3d Ed.] \u00a7 833), provided some definite provision is contained\u2019 therein whereby it is made secure and certain that the owner will ultimately obtain compensation (Bloodgood v. M. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 18 Wend. 9, 31 Am. Dec. 313; Sage v. City of Brooklyn, 89 N. Y. 189; In re St. Lawrence, etc., R. R. Co., 66 Hun, 306, 21 N. Y. Supp. 131; Brewster v. Rogers Co., 169 N. Y. 73, 62 N. E. 164, 58 L. R. A. 495; Cherokee Nation v. Kansas R. R. Co., 135 U. S. 641, on page-659, 10 Sup. Ct. 965, 34 L. Ed. 295);</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The fact that defendant omitted to state in the answer any sum \u201cas the value of the property\u201d will not prevent the court from, granting the application and fixing the sum to be deposited which shall be adequate indemnity. In re N., L. &amp; O. Power Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the proceeding remitted to the Special Term to pass upon the merits of the application.
