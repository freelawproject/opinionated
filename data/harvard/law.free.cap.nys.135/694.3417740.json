Section 2060 provides that: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">\u201cWhere a prisoner, who stands charged, upon a criminal accusation, with a bailable offense, has perfected, or intends to take, an appeal from a final order dismissing the proceedings, remanding him, or otherwise refusing to discharge him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Section 2061 provides for a recognizance upon admitting a prisoner who thus stands charged to bail. The prisoner in this case does not stand charged with any offense. He is held under the conviction of a court of competent jurisdiction, and is serving out his sentence under such judgment. We therefore think the court has no power to admit the prisoner to bail pending the appeal. No reason is shown why an order staying the proceedings should be granted. If the judgment of this court is correct, the proper place for the prisoner is in state\u2019s prison serving out his sentence. If the Court of Appeals should reverse the order of this court, it can discharge the prisoner from the state\u2019s prison as well as from the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">The application is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
