Full size drawings and models of the fixtures were to be submitted for the -approval of the architect before proceeding with the work. The 'plaintiff is an Illinois corporation having its place of business in Chicago, where defendant\u2019s architect was also located. The drawings and models were submitted to, and approved by, the architect, and the goods shipped. But plaintiff failed to prove that the contract was either fully or substantially performed, in so far as installing the fixtures in defendant\u2019s building was concerned. In his brief respondent\u2019s counsel takes the stand that the words \u201cplace in position\u201d do not mean to install, and calls it- a \u201cfalse assumption,\u201d and a \u201cpreposterous contention throughout the trial,\u201d of appellant\u2019s counsel. When we turn to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, we find the contract thus alleged, \u201cPlaintiff agreed to furnish certain gas and electric fixtures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>and <em>install </em>the same,\u201d and, further, \"that plaintiff thereafter and in pursuance of said agreement duly furnished and <em>completely installed </em>all of said fixtures above referred to, in accordance with the said agreement.\u201d Respondent should have read his own pleading before w'riting his wholly unjustifiable attack upon his adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Plaintiff employed a Mr. Fuller, an electrician of Greenwich, to do the work of installing these fixtures. Fuller was not called as a witness, nor was his deposition taken, nor his absence explained. No evidence was offered by plaintiff tending to prove that the fixtures were installed, except to read from the deposition of the defendant taken before trial this question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">\u201cQ. Outside of those six brackets, everything else was put up, was it not? A. In a way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">This is far from being sufficient to prove complete or substantial performance. The court deemed this sufficient to make out a prima facie case, and held that the burden rested upon the defendant to prove nonperformance, but, when the defendant was on the stand, sustained objections to his explaining his testimony before trial, or to his testifying to the exact conditions with respect to the installation of the fixtures.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Several errors were committed in ruling upon the admission and exclusion of evidence and in the charge, referable to the erroneous theory that the burden rested upon the defendant to establish nonperformance. We do not deem it necessary to refer to them in detail, as a new trial must be had, and we do not believe that they would be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The rejection of the letters written by defendant to plaintiff (Defendant\u2019s Exhibits F and G for identification) was error. Plaintiff had put in evidence several letters of the parties, and these were a part of the same correspondence, and purported on their face to be answers to letters in evidence and were therefore admissible. The rejection of Exhibit G was particularly prejudicial. Plaintiff had offered in evidence a letter written by plaintiff to defendant, which contained a detailed statement of plaintiff\u2019s contention. This letter, not answered, might afford the basis of an admission of the facts therein stated. Exhibit G was the defendant\u2019s answer to this letter, and should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
