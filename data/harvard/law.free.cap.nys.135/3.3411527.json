It appeared likewise, as a part of her proof, that on the night in question it had been raining heavily, and that that portion of the street where the accident took place was below grade, and because of lack of proper sewer facilities was subject to flooding whenever there was a considerable rainstorm; that this condition had existed for a very long time, and that when the trolley car approached the spot in question it was operated at such a rate of speed that it rocked from side to side.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">It seems to us that under these circumstances it was a question of fact for the jury whether the motorman should not have anticipated the presence of a large body of water at this spot, in view of the fact that water did accumulate there after every heavy rainstorm, and whether with such anticipation it was not negligent for him to run his car into such a body of water at such a rate of speed' as to bring the floor of his car in very violent contact with the water, and thus produce the result which happened. The presence of the trapdoor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>was not in itself an act of negligence, nor might the fact that water came into the \"car constitute negligence on the part of the defendant. But it seems quite plain that the cause of the trapdoor springing up so violently was the great force with which the car was brought in contact with the body of water then flooding the spot in question. If the motorman was bound to anticipate the presence of water on the street at that place, as it usually happened after a heavy rainstorm, then it is a question whether it was the exercise of due care for him to drive his car into that body of water under such circumstances as to bring about a violent contact with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
