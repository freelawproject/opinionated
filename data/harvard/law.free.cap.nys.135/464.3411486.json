This plea would seem to be a conclusive answer to plaintiff\u2019s claim under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>principles laid down in Lewis v. N. Y. &amp; Harlem R. R. Co., 162 N. Y. 202, 56 N. E. 540, and Hindley v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 185 N. Y. 335, 78 N. E. 276, but for a single circumstance which, it is insistently argued, serves to differentiate the present case from those cited. This circumstance is the fact that, before the construction of the railway, the company then about to erect it applied to the owners of the property in respect of which the plaintiff sues, and obtained from them or one of them a qualified consent to the erection. The property abuts upon the Bowery, a very wide street. The consent which was signed by one of its then owners was thus qualified \u201cprovided only that the road be erected in the center of the street.\u201d The road was not erected in the center of the street, but along the curb on either side. This entirely nullified the consent so that it became of no effect, and the company having refused to comply with its conditions, must be deemed to have built its road without the consent of the abutting owner. Shaw v. N. Y. Elevated R. R. Co., 187 N. Y. 186, 79 N. E. 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">The case up to this point, therefore, is exactly as if the railroad company had constructed its road along the curb in front of the plaintiff\u2019s premises without any consent at all on the part of the owner. It is said, however, that defendant entered upon the abutters\u2019 easements in subordination to the title of the owner, because by the act of applying to the owners of the abutting property for their consent to the erection of the railway it recognized their ownership of easements in the street, and therefore, although it did not obtain an effective consent, it must be deemed to have erected its road in subordination to the owners\u2019 incorporeal interests in the street, and not in derogation of them. It is not to be presumed that either the owners or the railway company knew when the consent was applied for that the construction of the road would destroy or impair property rights in the street appurtenant to the abutting property and to which a money value would attach. Hindley Case, supra. It can scarcely be said therefore, with justice, that the company\u2019s application to the abutting owners for their consent to the building of the road involved a conscious recognition of the owner\u2019s street easements. Did it amount to such recognition as matter of law? What the railway company sought from the owners was not any portion of their property rights, but merely their consent which was required by the state Constitution (article 3, \u00a7 18), and the Rapid Transit Act (chapter 606, Laws 1875). By the terms of the act (section 4), it was necessary that an attempt should be made to obtain the consents of the abutting owners before application could be made to the General Term for the appointment of commissioners, and the act of the company in applying to plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in title for a consent should, in my opinion, be given no greater significance than to be regarded as an admission that the persons applied to were owners of property \u201cbounded on\u201d the street. It certainly should not be treated as a recognition of property rights at that time undreamed of. The paper signed in behalf of the owners of the property either was a consent or was not. Since it was fettered with a condition to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the company never acceded, it certainly was not a consent, and the road was not built under it. Shaw Case, supra. Consequently the road was built without the consent of the owners of the abutting property, and in open denial of and hostility to any property rights which said owners then had in the street. In my opinion the case is not to be distinguished in principle from the Hindley and Lewis Cases. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The petition signed by some of the owners of the property and addressed to the Supreme Court commissioners advocating a particular location for the road was not a transaction with the company, but simply an appeal to the discretion of public officers not representing nor controlled by the company. Koehler v. N. Y. El. R. R. Co., 9 App. Div. 449, 41 N. Y. Supp. 209, affirmed 159 N. Y. 218, 53 N. E. 1114. It did not operate as a consent by the property owner, and, since the company was not a party to it, certainly did not amount to a recognition by the company of any rights of any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In my opinion the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
