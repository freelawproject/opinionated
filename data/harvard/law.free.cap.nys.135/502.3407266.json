The action was brought to reform an agreement dated December 23, 1904, transferring to the defendant certain shares of stock in the C. P. Easton corporation, and to have such transfer, which was absolute on its face, declared to be void and setting .the same aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">The court submitted to the jury as questions of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">First. \u201cDid Alice E. Pray comprehend and understand the document of December 23, 1904, at the time she signed it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">To this question the jury answer: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">Second. \u201cDid Alice E. Pray understand at the time she signed! the document of December 23, 1904, that she was transferring her stock to the bank absolutely?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>To this question the jury answer: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Third. \u201cDid Alice E. Pray \u00e1t the time she signed the document of December 23, 1904, think she was pledging her stock to the bank to secure debts contracted by the firm of C. P. Easton &amp; Co. and the corporation of the same name?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">To this question the jury answer: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Fourth. \u201cDid Alice E. Pray ever receive any consideration from the New York State National Bank for the transfer of her stock to it by the instrument of December 23, 1904?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">To this question the jury answer: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The court adopted the verdict of the jury, and rendered its decision, upon which judgment in conformity thereto was entered against the defendant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201cthat Alice E. Pray, the plaintiff herein, have judgment against New York State National Bank, Albany, the defendant herein, rescinding, annulling, declaring void, and setting aside the transfer by her of 320 shares of the preferred capital stock of the corporation of C. P. Easton &amp; Co. to said defendant, said New York State National Bank, Albany, on or about the 23d day of December, 1904, and rescinding, annulling, declaring void, and setting aside so much of said contract, or agreement, bearing date December 23, 1904, as relates to the transfer by said Alice E. Pray to said New York State National Bank, Albany, of said 320 shares of capital stock as aforesaid and as hereinbefore adjudged to have been made and entered into between said Alice E. Pray and said New York State National Bank, Albany.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">From such judgment the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">It is evident from the testimony given upon the trial that the negative answer of the jury to the fourth question submitted to them was founded upon a misconception of the evidence, or a misunderstanding of what was necessary to constitute a consideration for the transfer by plaintiff of her stock to the defendant. Such finding is clearly against the evidence. It is plain from reading the record that the affirmative answer of the jury to question \u201cThird\u201d should have controlled the decision of the court, and that the order for judgment, and the judgment entered thereon, should have provided!, instead of as above recited, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">\u201cThat Alice E. Pray, the plaintiff herein, have judgment against New York State National Bank, Albany, the defendant herein, that said plaintiff never int\u00e9nded that said transfer of said 320 shares of the preferred capital stock of said corporation of O. P. Easton &amp; Co. to the defendant, or that the transfer by her of all the shares constituting the capital stock of said corporation of C. P. Easton &amp; Co., held by her, to the defendant, should be absolute and without limitation or equity of redemption, and should vest the entire and unqualified title thereto in the said New York State National Bank, but that said plaintiff did intend, by said contract or agreement, to transfer said shares of stock to the defendant as a further pledge or security for the indebtedness of the firm of C. P. Easton &amp; Co., and of the corporation of C. P. Easton &amp; Co. to said New York State National Bank, Albany.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">Said judgment as so modified should be affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">Judgment modified as per opinion, and, as so modified, unanimously affirmed without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
