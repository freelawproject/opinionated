Defendant counterclaimed for $546.97. At the trial both -the complaint and the counterclaim were dismissed. The only question is whether under these circumstances the defendant is entitled to costs. It is clear that he is.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">Under section 3228, Code of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff is entitled to costs in an action like the present only \u201cupon the rendering of a judgment in his favor.\u201d By section 3229 the defendant is entitled to costs in such an action \u201cunlegs the plaintiff is entitled to costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">In .the present case no final judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff, and he was not therefore entitled to costs. Consequently, the def\u00e9ndant was so entitled. The test afforded by the Code is the fact of the rendition of a judgment in favor of plaintiff, and the fact that defendant was unsuccessful in sustaining a counterclaim is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-19\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
