It also satisfactorily appears that defendant, Carmer, never made any valid tender of the amount due upon the lien, nor in fact of any amount whatever.\" But we are unable to find any warrant of law for the award to plaintiff of the sum paid out for insurance and watchmen. Under the original agreement in writing between the parties, it was made the duty of the Restaurant Company to keep the painting insured for Carmer\u2019s benefit in the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of $50,000, the expense of which was to be borne by the company. While the attorney for the assignee claims to have notified the attorney for Carmer that, if the painting was held any longer, the insurance and care thereof would be charged against Carmer, there is no proof that the latter ever agreed thereto, nor was he legally chargeable with such expense. The legal duty, by contract, was upon the company to keep the painting insured, and the only subsequent agreement of Carmer was that the amount of the insurance should be reduced to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The judgment appealed from will therefore be modified by striking out the sum of $546.88, with interest thereon from June 18, 1910, and the further sum of $96, and, as so modified, it is affirmed without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
