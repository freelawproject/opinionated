While we think the explanation of the respondent is not satisfactory, we are not disposed to disagree with the referee, who has had the witnesses before him and has had a much better opportunity of judging of their credibility, and we, therefore, with one exception, confirm his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">The learned referee, in speaking of the second charge against the respondent, recommends that it should be dismissed upon his payment of the sum of $40 to Mrs. Kate Q. Johnson, who is clearly entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> This court has consistently refused to consider the repayment of moneys that have been misappropriated by an attorney after the commencement of the proceedings against him as in any way affecting the charge. The respondent either fraudulently misappropriated the money, in which case he should be disciplined, or his retaining that sum of money was justified. He admits he received the money for his client, and his explanation is that the money was received during his absence and used for defraying oEce expenses, and the respondent was not told about the receipt of the money on his return or until the charges were preferred against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-21\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The referee has accepted this explanation, and the respondent is to be censured for not returning the money as soon as his attention was called to its receipt. The proceedings are not dismissed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>his making that repayment, but because of the fact that his explanation was satisfactory to the referee and excused his not repaying the money. These proceedings are never used as a means of enforcing the claim of a client against an attorney, and the payment of money after charges are \u00bfreferred is not of the slightest consequence in determining the question of a respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The report of the referee is approved, with the exception of the particular mentioned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
