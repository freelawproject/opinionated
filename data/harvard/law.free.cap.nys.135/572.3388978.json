The testimony of the happening of the accident is not very satisfactory; but, even if we accept as true the testimony most favorable to the plaintiff, I do not think that he has established that his horse was killed by any negligence of the defendant. At most, the testimony established that the defendant allowed his horse and a light runabout wagon to stand unattended and unattached in Chambers street; that plaintiff\u2019s horse pulling a one-horse truck loaded with 20 barrels suddenly fell some distance in front of defendant\u2019s horse; that defendant\u2019s horse started to run, and the front wheel of his light wagon passed over the neck of plaintiff\u2019s horse; and that plaintiff\u2019s horse died a few minutes thereafter. There is no dispute but that plaintiff\u2019s horse was pulling a heavy truck, and had on a heavy collar, and that defendant\u2019s wagon was a light unoccupied wagon. There is no evidence that the wagon crushed the neck of plaintiff\u2019s horse or left any mark. There is no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s horse showed any signs that its neck was not broken before the wagon wheel ran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>over it. It is quite impossible to claim any inference from these facts that plaintiff\u2019s horse was killed by defendant\u2019s wagon rather than by the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
