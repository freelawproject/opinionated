The respondent having submitted his answer, the matter was referred to a referee, who has filed his report upon which, together with the testimony taken before the referee, this proceeding now comes before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The referee has sustained these charges, and, as hereinbefore stated, an examination of the testimony has satisfied us that the referee\u2019s conclusions are sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Having thus adopted the report of the referee, the court has then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>to consider the final action which should be taken. The respondent was an officer of the court . whose duty it was to aid in the administration of justice. The proper performance of his duty to his client did not in the slightest degree justify his presenting to the court any fact which he knew or should have known was untrue. He was endeavoring to defend his client against the charges of two women who had been his client\u2019s wives, and, in the presentation of these cases, it was the obvious duty of the respondent to be careful in presenting the facts in regard to the relations between his client and the woman who had been his wife and the one who was his wife. In matrimonial disputes the state has a direct interest quite different from that in ordinary litigations which have to do with money or property. By careful provisions of law the state has interposed to prevent judgments in such actions without a consideration of the public interests. The due administration of justice imposes upon the courts the most careful scrutiny in regard to the relations existing between husband and wife, and it is the duty of the court to protect the minor children of the parties to matrimonial actions, whose welfare it is the direct duty of the courts to conserve. This makes a performance of a lawyer\u2019s obligation to be extremely accurate and entirely frank in his dealings with the court in relation to such actions one of paramount importance. In violation of this obligation the respondent presented to the Supreme Court in the two proceedings affidavits from the children directly contradictory, in one of which the stepmother was held up as a good wife and mother, caring for and protecting the children, and in the other as neglecting and ill treating them\u2014conduct that the court cannot too strongly condemn and which violated the respondent\u2019s duty to the court and the obligation which he assumed when he was admitted as a member of the bar. Practice of this kind cannot be justified, and there is but one consideration which induces us to refrain from discipline, and that is the good character of the respondent, which seems to have impressed the refere\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">After a careful consideration of the situation here presented, the court has come to the conclusion in this case the respondent should be severely censured for his conduct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
