On the 14th of September, 1910, the plaintiff sold and delivered to the defendants a quantity of liquors, for which they agreed to pay $330.51. The agent of the plaintiff who made the sale testified that the merchandise was sold on four months\u2019 time; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>while the testimony of Charles W. Rech was that the agent \u201ctold me that I could take my own time. Four months is sometimes a reasonable time and sometimes it is not. I would consider four months a very fair time. I have had longer time.\u201d On the 21st of November, 1910, at the request of the plaintiff, the defendants gave their promissory note to the plaintiff for the amount of the account, due in three months from its date. The note was not drawn with interest. When.received by the plaintiff, it caused the words, \u201cWith interest at 6 per cent.\u201d to be written in the note above the signature of the defendants, and without their knowledge. About the time the note became due, the defendants paid thereon $105.51, and gave another note dated February 1, 1911, due in three months, for $225, which, with the payment, equaled the face of the claim. At the time of the giving of the second note the defendants did not know of the alteration of the first note, and the last note was not given with interest. Immediately after it was received, the bookkeeper of the plaintiff, with the knowledge of the officers of the plaintiff, altered the note by adding, \u201cwith interest 6%.\u201d When the note came clue one of the defendants went to the bank where it was made payable for the purpose of paying it, and then first learned of the alteration. He first testified that he \u201cwanted to pay the $225, but I wouldn\u2019t pay the interest. The bank refused to accept the $225. They said they couldn\u2019t accept it.\u201d Later he said: \u201cThey (the plaintiff) didn\u2019t say they would take $225. I didn\u2019t offer to pay $225 at the bank. I didn\u2019t offer them anything since then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The complaint set out two causes of action, one on the original indebtedness, and the other on the note; and on the trial the plaintiff offered to surrender the note, and sought to recover the balance alleged to be due on the account. The sole question submitted to the jury was whether the alteration of the note was made \u201cwith fraudulent intent to compel the defendants to pay something more than they were morally or legally obligated to pay,\u201d and, if so, \u201cthen your verdict will be in favor of the defendants,\u201d otherwise for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The addition, \u201cWith interest -6%,\u201d constituted a material alteration of the note. Negotiable Instruments Law, \u00a7 206, subd. 2 (3 Consolidated Laws 1909, p. 2507). .If the alteration was made fraudulently, as the jury have found, the taint not only vitiates the note, but also extinguishes the original indebtedness.

Eichmeier, 109 Iowa, 301, 304;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Daniel on Neg. Insts. (5th Ed.) \u00a7 1410a; Randolph on Commercial Paper (2d Ed.) \u00a7 1763; Tiedeman on Bills &amp; Notes, \u00a7 150. While the penalty imposed is severe to the plaintiff, and the defendants have sustained no pecuniary loss, as they are asked simply to pay the balance of the debt, which they originally incurred and which has not been paid, the reason for the drastic rule is found in the necessity for visiting the full measure of punishment to one perpetrating the fraud. Loss to one person or gain to another are not considerations which induced the adoption of the rule adverted to. As was said in Daniel on Negotiable Instruments, \u00a7 1410a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cIt is necessary that the law should impose this forfeiture of the debt itself upon one who fraudulently tampers with the instrument which evidences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>or secures it; and it is done upon the principle that 'no man should be permitted to take the chance of gain by the commission of a fraud, without running the risk of loss in the case of detection.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The fraud might have extended to simulating the handwriting of the writer of the note, and the defendants might have been unable to detect the alteration; or, if they had died! before the maturity of the note, discovery of the fraud might have been difficult. The plaintiff is responsible for the alteration, and \u201cit is for the purpose of discouraging such attempts that the \"law denies relief to a plaintiff who comes into court with his hands soiled with a fraud so inexcusable. That the effect of such denial will be to benefit the other party is not a sufficient ground for overlooking the fraud!.\u201d Meyer v. Huneke, 55 N. Y. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is claimed that the proof does not justify the inference that 'the alteration was fraudulently made. No officer of the plaintiff testified in its explanation. The bookkeeper in attempting to excuse it said the account was past due, and he \u201cpresumed it was an oversight on the part of the party that drew the note leaving it off. That is what caused me to put it on,\u201d and that in making the alteration he had no intention \u201cto defraud anybody,\u201d but it was made for the purpose of collecting the interest when the note matured. It is not important that the bookkeeper did not act with any purpose to defraud. He made the alteration with the knowledge of \u201cthe firm,\u201d as he designated the plaintiff. The alteration was in fact made, was material, and with no effort to justify it by those responsible for it. The jury were warranted in determining that it was fraudulently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with one bill of costs in favor of the respondents. All concur, FOOTE, J., not sitting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A6-\"> 80 N. W. 395.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
