Whether the diamonds were the property of the plaintiff or defendant was the subject of dispute. The plaintiff testified that she owned the diamonds, and that her husband wished to loan one Schaffer $100, and asked her to pawn the diamonds for that purpose. She says that she \u201craised Cain,\u201d and \u201cafter he got through fighting with me he asked me to go down and pawn them for him, which I done. I couldn\u2019t help myself, and I done it.\u201d Not only was there an absence of evidence as to the value of the diamonds, but the facts proved did not establish a cause of action for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, without costs to either party.
