The attendant was licensed under the law of the state of New York (Public Health Law [Laws of 1909, c. 49, art. 8]), but thereby he is not permitted to administer drugs or to perform surgery with instruments. Thereby he became a doctor of osteopathy. This license places no other limitation upon his status as a physician or his service to persons in sickness. Matter of Bandel v. Department of Health, 193 N. Y. 133, 85 N. E. 1067, 21 L. R. A. (N. S.) 49. So he was regularly licensed to attend the assured when sick, to administer anything curative save drugs, and to do what a surgeon may do without instruments. The statute gave him the legal status of a physician, and that was what the policy contemplated. The policy required a person to attend the assured, licensed by the state to do so, for the cure of the disease. The term used is equivalent to one that the assured shall, be attended by one authorized by the law to treat the sick. I find a definition adopted by learned writers that a \u201cphysician is one who is versed in medical science, a branch of which is surgery, and a surgeon is a physician who treats bodily injuries and ills by manual operations and the use of surgical instruments and appliances.\u201d The osteopath can use no instruments or drugs, and would not, but he is licensed to treat the injured and ailing bodily under a statute that regulates the \u201cpractice of medicine.\u201d Section 160, Public Health Law (article 8) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-8\">\u201c(7) The practice of medicine is defined as follows: A person practices medicine within the meaning of this article, except as hereinafter stated, who holds himself out as being able to diagnose, treat, operate or prescribe for any human disease, pain, injury, deformity or' physical condition, and who shall either offer or undertake, by any means or method, ,to diagnose, treat, operate or prescribe for any human disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical condition. (8) \u2018Physician\u2019 means a practitioner of medicine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Where the Legislature states what the practice of medicine is and who may practice it, the words have the meaning, a modified one perhaps, which the statute gives them.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">The plaintiff should have judgment for $201.65, with interest from May 20, 1910, with costs. All concur, except JENKS, P. J., and CARR, J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
