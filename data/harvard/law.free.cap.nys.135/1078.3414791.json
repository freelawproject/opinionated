The question of the acceptance of the machine is, as matter of law, irrelevant to an action for a breach of warranty. So, also, the issue as to the breach of warranty was, I think, upon the ev'idenpe, properly decided in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is plain, however, that the verdict was excessive. Plaintiff adequately proved certain damages arising out of loss of wages paid and. material destroyed through the defects against which the warranty had been given, and a verdict for the amount and value thereof would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>have been proper. The record is plain as to the amount of such damage. The jury, however, manifestly awarded consequential damages arising out of loss of profits on the articles which were to have been manufactured by the machines sold. It is conceded\u2019 that plaintiff had no orders or contracts for the sale of these articles. He showed only that he had done an extensive business in the same class of goods, which he had previously manufactured by hand, and his principal witness on this branch of the case, a former customer, testified in this regard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Had Mr. Schug been able to furnish you with machine-made ribbon blocks, would you have continued to trade with him? A. Everything being equal, probably we would have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel appeals to the rule laid down by the Court o\u00ed Appeals in Wakeman v. Wheeler &amp; Wakeman Mfg. Co., 101 N. Y. 205, 4 N. E. 264, 54 Am. Rep. 676, as justification for the recovery of consequential damages under these circumstances. In that case, however, the plaintiff, who had a contract to sell machines in Mexico, practically as the agent of defendant, was permitted to recover for breach of contract by defendants consisting in refusal to fill plaintiff\u2019s further orders. The correct rule as to damages (in that case measured by the value of the contract to the plaintiff) is tersely stated in the headnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-7\">\u201cThe rule that damages which are contingent and uncertain cannot be recovered embraces only such as are not the certain <em>result </em>of the breach; not such as are the certain result, but uncertain <em>in amount.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Further light on this distinction is cast by the citation in the opinion of the views of Grover, J., in Taylor v. Bradley, 39 N. Y. 129, 100 Am. Dec. 415, reported in 4 Abb. Dec. 363. Judge Grover says in part :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1119-9\">\u201cProfits which would certainly have been realized but for the defendant\u2019s default are recoverable. * * * It is not an uncertainty as to the <em>value </em>of the benefit or gain <em>to </em>be derived from performance, but an uncertainty or contingency <em>whether such gain or benefit would be derived at all. * </em>* * It is sometimes said that speculative damages <em>cannot </em>be recovered because the amount is uncertain, but such remarks will generally be found applicable to such damages as it is uncertain <em>whether sustained, at all </em>from the breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">He further points out that the objection is sometimes as aptly denominated \u201cremoteness\u201d as \u201cuncertainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">Applying this distinction to the case at bar, it is evident that plaintiff failed, when measured by this rule, to prove that he lost any profits by reason of the breach of defendant\u2019s warranty. He- had no orders for the goods to be manufactured, and all that he proved was that by the breach he was deprived of the opportunity to manufacture goods which he had good reason to hope that he could sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
