At the previous trial there was a verdict in favor of the defendant, and upon appeal a new trial was ordered and the judgment reversed. See the opinion of Mr. Justice Lehman (67 Misc. Rep. 78, 121 N. Y. Supp. 577). After the reversal and before the second trial, the plaintiff died. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney made a motion to continue the action in the name of the administratrix, which motion was granted. At the second trial the plaintiff\u2019s attorney offered in evidence the testimony of the decedent taken at the first trial. This was rejected, and, .after proof of the death of Benjamin Daniel, the original plaintiff, the action was dismissed. There is only one question involved in this appeal, and that is whether the cause of action set forth died with the \u2022plaintiff or survived to his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff endeavors to bring this action within the class of actions which survive by alleging that it was brought for a breach of contract to carry safely. In Kentucky, where a cause of action for assault does not survive, it was held in Winnegar\u2019s Administrator v. Central R. R. Co., 85 Ky. 547, 4 S. W. 237, that, where the action is laid in contract for breach of the contract to carry safely, such an action does survive. This case was cited with approval but not on this point in Gillespie v. R. R. Co., 178 N. Y. 347 at page 358, 70 N. E. 857, 66 L. R. A. 618, 102 Am. St. Rep. 503. It was held in the previous appeal of this case, following Busch v. Interborough R. T. Co., 187 N. Y. 388, 80 N. E. 197, 10 Ann. Cas. 460, that, although a Municipal Court has no jurisdiction of an action for assault, yet when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>assault is committed on a passenger and the action is laid in contract, as here, that the Municipal Court has jurisdiction. Bradshaw and Wife v. R. R. Co., L. R. 10 C. P. 189, was an action' by the' personal representative of a person killed in a railway accident brought to recover for injury to decedent\u2019s estate by reason of his inability to attend to business, for medical attendance, etc., before his death. It was there held that such an action would! lie, although an action might lie also under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, for the death. This case is cited in Hegerich v. Keddie, 99 N. Y. 269, 1 N. E. 794, 52 Am. Rep. 25, the court referring to the Bradshaw Case, saying: \u201cThe action was there based upon the theory of a breach of contract to carry the passenger safely.\u201d The action at bar is based on an alleged breach of contract and brought to recover the damages .caused the estate of or property interests of decedent before his death.-</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Wie think this cause of action survives, and the judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
