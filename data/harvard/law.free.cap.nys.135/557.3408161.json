It failed to deliver this lumber to plaintiff, but delivered it to one W. G. Maher upon an order purporting to be signed: \u201cA W. Burritt Company per J. T. O\u2019N.\u201d This order was signed by J. T. O\u2019Neill, an employ\u00e9 of Maher, but not of the plaintiff, and the jury\u2019s verdict has established that O\u2019Neill had no authority from the plaintiff to bind it. It appears, however, that prior to this delivery the plaintiff had agreed to sell this car load of lumber to W. G. Maher,, but had not sent him any invoice or memorandum of sale, as it was. doubtful of his financial security. When it discovered that the lumber was actually delivered to Maher, it sent him an invoice, showing that the car load was sold to him. This invoice is dated August 1st before the delivery to Maher. Subsequently, and with knowledge of these facts, it paid the defendant by check its transportation charges, it filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against Maher, and it filed its claim for the value of the lumber against Maher in the bankruptcy court. The case was submitted to the jury upon the theory that defendant was liable to the plaintiff if it did not receive an order from the plaintiff to deliver the lumber to Maher, and that this evidence was admissible only upon the point whether the order to deliver the lumber was in fact made by authority from the plaintiff. There is no dispute, but that the defendant is as a matter of law relieved from liability, if in fact it delivered the lumber to the real owner entitled to its possession, even without the order of plaintiff, since the bill of lading was not negotiable. The subsequent acts of the plaintiff point so eloquently to a complete ratification of the delivery to Maher and show so completely that the plaintiff regarded Maher as the owner of the-lumber that I do not think it possible, in spite of plaintiff\u2019s explanation, to hold that the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon this record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The exceptions to the charge and the requests to charge sufficiently pointed out this issue to the trial judge, and require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
