It does appear, however, that an order has been granted directing a third party to appear and submit to an examination concerning the judgment debtor\u2019s property which it is claimed is held by him. A copy of such order is not set forth, nor are sufficient facts stated to enable the court to determine whether that order was granted in this proceeding, or whether there is any basis for requiring appellant to appear as a witness and give testimony concerning the judgment debtor\u2019s property held either by him or such third party. '</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Moreover, it appears that a receiver has already been appointed in proceedings supplementary to execution, at the instigation of another judgment creditor. Upon his appointment and qualification the title to all of the judgment debtor\u2019s personal property, whether held by the judgment debtor or a third party, vested in him. Moore v. Taylor, 40 Hun, 56. If there is property in the hands of a third party for whose examination an order has been obtained, that can now be reduced to possession only by the receiver. The examination of the appellant as a witness in a proceeding under that order would be futile, because, if property were discovered, it would belong to the receiver to be disposed of by him under an order of the court. Sorrentino v. Langlois, 144 App. Div. 271, 128 N. Y. Supp. 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">The order appealed from therefore is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
