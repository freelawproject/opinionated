Thereafter the order appealed from was signed, restoring the case to the general calendar and setting it down for the 9th day of March, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> By rule 2 of the City Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-14\">\u2022 \u201cIf the trial shall actually occupy more than two hours, the court may, In its discretion, send the cause to the foot of the general calendar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1116-15\">This does not permit the court to set the case down for any particular day on the \u2019general calendar, as such a disposition may well bring the cause on for trial ahead of younger issues. The discretion vested, in the court is either to hear the case through, or to send it to ttie\u201efoot of the general calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There is nothing in section 791 of the Code to justify this preference by the court. It does not appear from the pleadings that the status, of the parties to the action, or the issues involved, bring the case, within that section, nor was a notice of preference served with the notice of trial, or an application upon due notice made for an order, preferring the case, as provided in section 793 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-17\">The order, so far as appealed from, must therefore be reversed, with. $10 costs and disbursements, and the case restored to the foot of thee general calendar as of the date of the mistrial. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
