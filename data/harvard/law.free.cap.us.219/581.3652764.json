On the disclosure of this situation further argument was dispensed with; and for the reason which led to that action, that is, as we have said, that the controversies between the parties had -become in all respects moot, the appeals must be dismissed. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>McChesney, </em>218 U. S. 487, 492, and cases cited. Appeals dismissed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
