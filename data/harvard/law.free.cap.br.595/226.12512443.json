INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 16, 2018, Charles River Associates (\"\n   <em>\n    CRA\n   </em>\n   \") filed an objection (the \"\n   <em>\n    Objection\n   </em>\n   \") to certain IRA accounts that Donald Jeffrey Painter (the \"Debtor\") claims as exempt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 55]. On February 5, 2018, the Debtor filed a response to the Objection (the \"\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   \"). [Doc. No. 58]. On February 28, 2018, this Court held a hearing (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hearing\n   </em>\n   \") on the Objection and the Response. The only person to testify at the Hearing was the Debtor. The Court admitted exhibits 1, 7, 11, and 12 submitted by CRA and exhibits 1-10 submitted by the Debtor. After listening to the testimony, reviewing exhibits, and hearing closing arguments, the Court directed CRA and the Debtor to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Court also continued the Hearing to June 19, 2018. At the continued Hearing on June 19, 2018, the Court heard additional argument from the parties. At the conclusion of the Hearing, the Court requested additional briefing and continued the Hearing to August 10, 2018. At the August 10, 2018, Hearing the Court heard additional argument from counsel for CRA and counsel for the Debtor. At the conclusion of the Hearing on August 10, 2018, the Court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy Rules 7052 and 9014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court now issues these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law explaining its decision to overrule the Objection. To the extent that any Finding of Fact is construed to be a Conclusion of Law, it is adopted as such; and to the extent that any Conclusion of Law is construed to be a Finding of Fact, it is adopted as such. The Court reserves the right to make additional findings and conclusions as it deems appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The Debtor was employed by CRA from approximately July 22, 2015, to May 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Upon the termination of the Debtor's employment with CRA, CRA made a demand that the Debtor return a sum\n   certain of money that CRA had previously given to the Debtor as a \"forgivable loan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. Subsequently, in August of 2016, CRA filed a civil lawsuit in Massachusetts state court to recover the funds related to the \"forgivable loan\" that the Debtor refused to return. This lawsuit was styled as\n   <em>\n    CRA International, Inc. v. Donald J. Painter,\n   </em>\n   Civil Action No. 16-2417 BLS 2 (the \"\n   <em>\n    State Court Action\n   </em>\n   \"). On September 26, 2016, the court in the State Court Action entered a \"Stipulated Order Regarding Defendant's JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Account\" (the \"\n   <em>\n    Stipulated Order\n   </em>\n   \"). [CRA Ex. 1]. The Stipulated Order provides, in part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to Superior Court Rule 9A, Plaintiff CRA International, Inc. (\"CRA\") served a Motion for Attachment by Trustee Process of Defendant Donald J. Painter's (\"[the Debtor]\") bank accounts with JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (the \"Chase Account(s)\") in an amount up to $933,550.68. Painter served an Opposition pursuant to Rule 9A. The parties have resolved the issues raised in the Motion for Attachment, and are filing this Stipulated Order instead of the motion papers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   CRA hereby moves, and [the Debtor] hereby stipulates and consents, that the Court enter the following order concerning the Chase Account(s):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. [The Debtor] represents to CRA and the Court that he currently has more than $1 million in the Chase Account(s).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Absent further order of this Court or by written agreement signed by the parties or their counsel, [the Debtor] is prohibited from withdrawing funds from the Chase Account(s) that would bring the collective balance of the Chase Account(s) below $750,000 or from otherwise allowing the collective balance of the Chase Account(s) to drop below $750,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [CRA Ex. 1]. The Stipulated Order was signed by counsel for both CRA and the Debtor, as well as by the judge in the State Court Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   4. At the time of entering into the Stipulated Order, the Debtor held six accounts at Chase: (1) a checking account; (2) a savings account; (3) a brokerage account; (4) a business account; (5) a second business account; and (6) an IRA (the \"\n   <em>\n    Chase IRA\n   </em>\n   \") (all six of these accounts will hereinafter be collectively referred to as the \"\n   <em>\n    Chase Accounts\n   </em>\n   \"). The Chase IRA is a \"managed\" account. The Debtor testified that the term \"Chase Account(s),\" as it is defined in the Stipulated Order, included\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   of the Debtor's accounts at Chase, including the Chase IRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   5. At the time of entering into the Stipulated Order, the collective amount in the Chase Accounts was approximately $1,534,000.00. Of this amount, approximately $634,000.00 was in the Chase IRA and the remainder of $900,000.00 was spread amongst the other accounts. Accordingly, at the time the Stipulated Order became effective, the Debtor had sufficient non-retirement account holdings to satisfy his obligation to maintain the minimum $750,000.00 balance in the Chase Accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   6. At some point after entering into the Stipulated Order and prior to the Petition Date, the Debtor transferred significant amounts from his Chase checking, savings,\n   and brokerage accounts into accounts with Fidelity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   7. On or around April 11, 2017, judgment was entered against the Debtor in the amount of $1,007,104.44 in the State Court Action (the \"\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n   \"). [Claims Register, Claim No. 4-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   8. On May 15, 2017, (the \"\n   <em>\n    Petition Date\n   </em>\n   \") the Debtor filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. In his Schedule C, the Debtor claimed the Chase IRA as exempt. [Doc. No. 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   9. As of the Petition Date, there was approximately $760,300.00 in the Chase Accounts; of the $760,300.00, approximately $70,000.00 was comprised of non-IRA funds, thus making approximately $690,300.00 the total amount in the Chase IRA as of the Petition Date. Therefore, as of the Petition Date, in order to satisfy the requirement in the Stipulated Order that there be at least $750,000.00 in the Chase Accounts, the funds in the Chase IRA needed to be included to meet that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   10. On September 12, 2017, CRA filed a claim in the amount of $1,007,104.44, related to the Judgment. [Claims Register, Claim No. 4-1]. CRA represented that this claim was a secured claim. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On May 23, 2018, CRA filed an amended claim in the amount of $1,007,104.44 (again related to the Judgment); however, this time CRA represented that the claim was unsecured. [Claims Register, Claim No. 4-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   11. Only the Debtor testified at the Hearing. There was no testimony from any representative of CRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction, Venue, and Constitutional Authority to Enter a Final Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this contested matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 157(a). Section 1334(b) provides that \"the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11 [of the Code], or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\" District courts may, in turn, refer these proceedings to the bankruptcy judges for that district.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In the Southern District of Texas, General Order 2012-6 (entitled General Order of Reference) automatically refers all eligible cases and proceedings to the bankruptcy courts.

This matter is core pursuant to \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A) because its resolution concerns the administration of this Chapter 7 estate. Here, CRA has objected to the Debtor's claim of exemptions. These circumstances fit within the \"matters concerning the administration of the estate\" category of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A). This matter is also core pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B) because it concerns the Debtor's claim of exemptions from property of the estate. Last, this matter is core pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(O) because it involves the adjustment of the debtor-creditor relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Venue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Venue is proper pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201408\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) because the Debtor resided in the Southern District of Texas for the 180-day period immediately preceding the filing of the petition initiating the pending Chapter 7 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Constitutional Authority\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the wake of the Supreme Court's issuance of\n   <em>\n    Stern v.

In\n   <em>\n    Stern,\n   </em>\n   which involved a core proceeding brought by the debtor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(C), the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy court \"lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As already noted above, the pending matter before this Court is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), and (b)(2)(O). Because\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   is replete with language emphasizing that the ruling is limited to the one specific type of core proceeding involved in that dispute, this Court concludes that the limitation imposed by\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   does not prohibit this Court from entering a final order here.

First, the\n   Debtor has not used the Chase IRA as security for a loan. As noted in footnote 3, there was some testimony from the Debtor about a \"forgivable loan\" he received from CRA that served as the basis for the lawsuit in the State Court Action. However, there was no testimony adduced or exhibits introduced that indicate that the Debtor used the Chase IRA as security for either the \"forgivable loan\" or any other loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, CRA points to the language in the Stipulated Order and argues that the agreement for the balance of the Chase Accounts to not drop below $750,000.00 is a pledge of a security interest. This Court disagrees. The Court does agree, however, with counsel for CRA on the fact that the Stipulated Order was poorly drafted. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 81, Feb. 29, 2018, Hrg. Tr. 6:15-17]. If CRA wanted to use the Stipulated Order as a means to obtain a lient on the Debtor's assets (i.e., the Chase Accounts), then the Stipulated Order needed to be drafted much more clearly and precisely in order to accomplish that goal. As drafted, it does not do so. Nowhere is there a conveyance of a security interest in the Stipulated Order, which is what is required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rowe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3502792\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/369/73/#p77\">\n    369 B.R. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77 (Bankr. D. Ma. 2007) (explaining that in order to demonstrate a present intent to pledge the collateral, the document must contain \"granting\" language to find that the creditor holds a security interest; it is not sufficient to merely list the covered collateral in the document).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Third, even if the Debtor's use of the Chase IRA can be construed as a loan with an equitable lien under Massachusetts law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   CRA itself has filed a proof of claim, as amended, expressly stating under oath that CRA holds an unsecured debt. [Claims Register, Claim No. 4-2]. CRA cannot now take a contrary position to the amended proof of claim, or argue that even though it filed an amended proof of claim stating that it holds an unsecured debt, it does not really \"mean it.\" For the above discussed reasons, CRA's argument that the Chase IRA lost its exempt status under \u00a7 408(e)(4) fails as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the Court overrules the Objection. An order overruling the Objection will be entered simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    At the hearing on February 28, 2018, CRA clarified that the only IRA account that it is objecting to is the IRA account held by the Debtor at Chase Bank.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Hereinafter, any reference to a \"Rule\" is a reference to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. Moreover, any reference to \"the Code\" refers to the United States Bankruptcy Code, and reference to any section (i.e., \u00a7) refers to a section in 11 U.S.C., which is the United States Bankruptcy Code, unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    There was very little testimony at the Hearing regarding the \"forgivable loan\" that the Debtor allegedly owed CRA at the conclusion of his employment. Although the terms and conditions of the \"forgivable loan\" are unclear, what is clear is that upon the termination of his employment with CRA, CRA initiated a lawsuit against the Debtor, described in more detail above, to try and recover the funds related to the \"forgivable loan.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    It should also be noted that the Stipulated Order does not grant a security interest in any property of the Debtor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court also notes that the Sixth Circuit has held that an IRA does not lose its exempt status merely because the client relationship agreement grants a lien on the retirement funds to cover any potential.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Daley v. Mostoller (In re Daley),\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178970,3576324\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/506/\">\n     717 F.3d 506\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 508-09 (6th Cir. 2013) (overturning bankruptcy court and district court and holding that debtor's IRA did not lose its exempt status when the debtor entered into a \"Client Relationship Agreement\" with Merrill Lynch which granted Merrill Lynch a lien on the retirement funds to cover any potential debts to Merrill Lynch when, in fact, the debtor never borrowed from the IRA and Merrill Lynch never extended credit to the debtor based on the existence of the IRA).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    CRA points to the language in the Stipulated Order and argues that this language gives CRA an equitable lien and cites the following cases in support of this argument:\n    <em>\n     Snyder v. Smith,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826487\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/185/58/\">\n     185 Mass. 58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20N.E.%201089\">\n     69 N.E. 1089\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1904) and\n    <em>\n     In re Rare Coin Galleries of America, Inc. v.

The Court disagrees with this interpretation of the Stipulated Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
