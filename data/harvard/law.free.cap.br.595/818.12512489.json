Kaufman, United State Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2005, plaintiff Asphalt Professionals, Inc. (\"API\") sued defendant Darin Davis (\"Davis\") and T.O. IX, LLC (\"T.O.\"), among others, for breach of a subcontract agreement and fraud, among other claims, in state court. The subcontract agreement included a reciprocal attorneys' fees provision; Davis was not a signatory to the agreement, but the agreement provided for T.O. to enforce all provisions of the agreement. At all times, API alleged that T.O. is an alter ego of Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After splitting the action into three phases, the state court ruled in API's favor on API's breach of contract claim and API's alter ego allegations, holding that T.O. is an alter ego of Davis. Based on the subcontract agreement, the state court also awarded API attorneys' fees in connection with litigating the breach of contract claim, for which Davis was held liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the parties' state court litigation, Davis filed a chapter 7 petition. Subsequently, API filed a complaint to establish nondischargeability of its debt and denial of Davis's discharge. API's claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) mirrored API's claim of fraud in state court; before the state court reached the fraud phase, this Court adjudicated API's claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). The Court entered judgment in favor of Davis on API's claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 727. Davis's motion for an award of attorneys' fees followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Davis asserts he is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to the subcontract agreement and in accordance with California Civil Code \u00a7 1717 and/or California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1021 and 1032. API contends it is not liable for Davis's attorneys' fees because: (A) the action is not an \"action on a contract\" for purposes of California Civil Code \u00a7 1717 ; (B) the language of the subcontract agreement\n   does not entitle Davis to an award of attorneys' fees; (C) Davis is not a prevailing party because API prevailed in state court; (D) Davis is not a signatory to the agreement; (E) the state court's alter ego holding does not entitle Davis to collect attorneys' fees pursuant to the subcontract agreement; and (F) Davis is barred from collecting attorneys' fees pursuant to California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7 7031. This Memorandum explains the Court's reasoning in awarding Davis his incurred attorneys' fees and costs with respect to this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Subcontract Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 2, 2004, API, as the subcontractor, and an unidentified contractor (the \"Contractor\") entered into the subcontract agreement (the \"Agreement\"). In the Agreement, T.O. was identified as the \"Owner\" and as a third-party beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In relevant part, the Agreement (\u00b6\u00b6 1, 23) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    PARTIES\n   </em>\n   : This Subcontract Agreement (\"Agreement\") is between Contractor and Subcontractor. Any references to \"Owner\" shall refer to T.O. IX, LLC. The Owner is an express third-party beneficiary to this Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Owner has the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement against Subcontractor\n   </em>\n   . At any time Owner requests information it deems necessary from Subcontractor, Subcontractor agrees to provide such information within three (3) days of Owner's request. In the event Contractor's involvement in the Project terminates for any reason, Subcontractor will, upon Owner's written request, recognize Owner or any person or entity designated by Owner as the successor-in-interest to Contractor under this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    ATTORNEYS' FEES\n   </em>\n   : In the event that Contractor prevails in any reference proceeding or court action arising out of this Agreement or the enforcement or breach thereof, or in any action brought against Subcontractor by third parties in which Contractor is joined as a party or interpleads, whether the same proceeds to judgment or not, Subcontractor agrees to pay to Contractor reasonable attorneys' fees. In the event that Subcontractor prevails in any reference proceeding or court action arising out of this Agreement or the enforcement or breach thereof, or in any action brought against Contractor by third parties in which Subcontractor is joined as a party or interpleads, whether the same proceeds to judgment or not, Contractor agrees to pay to Subcontractor reasonable attorneys' fees. The parties' covenants set forth in this Paragraph 23 shall survive and be enforceable following termination of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The State Court Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 29, 2005, after T.O. did not pay API for all of API's work on a project, API sued T.O., Davis and others in state court (the \"State Court Action\"). In the State Court Action, API asserted claims of breach of contract, foreclosure of a mechanic's lien, quantum meruit and fraud. Throughout its fourth amended complaint filed in the state court (the \"FAC\"), API alleged that, at all times, T.O. was the alter ego of Davis, among others. API also alleged that on \"June 2, 2004, [API] entered into a written contract\n   <em>\n    with defendants T.O., D and S, D &amp; S Development, [Davis]\n   </em>\n   \" and others. API alleged that all of these named defendants had breached the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court trifurcated the State Court Action into three trial phases, with the first phase involving API's causes of\n   action for breach of contract, foreclosure on a mechanic's lien and quantum meruit. On October 29, 2010, after a bench trial, the state court entered a judgment in favor of API and against T.O. on API's breach of contract, foreclosure of mechanic's lien and quantum meruit claims (the \"Phase One Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 18, 2011, after entry of the Phase One Judgment, the state court entered an order against T.O. awarding API attorneys' fees (the \"Fees Order\"). The state court based its award on the attorneys' fees provision in the Agreement (\"The attorney fee clause and only the attorney fees clause can ultimately render the aggrieved party whole....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second phase of the State Court Action involved API's alter ego claims. On December 23, 2011, after trial, the state court issued a statement of decision on alter ego liability (the \"Alter Ego Judgment\"). In relevant part, after making extensive findings, the state court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   There is such a unity of interest and ownership that the separateness of defendants T.O. IX, LLC, D and S Homes, Inc., D &amp; S Development, L.L.C., [Davis]... has ceased;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Adherence to the separate existence of defendants D and S Homes, Inc., D &amp; S Development, L.L.C., [Davis]... with T.O. IX, LLC, would, under the particular circumstances of this case, sanction a fraud or promote injustice; that is, if the acts are treated as those of T.O. IX, LLC alone, an inequitable result will follow;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants D and S Homes, Inc., D &amp; S Development, L.L.C., [Davis]... are each the alter ego of defendant T.O. IX, LLC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The liability of the Interlocutory Judgment After Court Trial entered October 29, 2010 and of the Order Re Attorney Fees entered January 18, 2011 and any other or future order or orders awarding damages, punitive damages,\n   <em>\n    attorneys fees and/or costs\n   </em>\n   to [API] against T.O. IX, LLC in this case hereby is and will be extended to defendants D and S Homes, Inc., D &amp; S Development, L.L.C., [Davis]... jointly and severally, based upon the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    alter ego\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Emphasis added). The Alter Ego Judgment was affirmed on appeal (the \"Alter Ego Appellate Decision\"). In the Alter Ego Appellate Decision, the appellate court noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   API signed the subcontract with T.O. IX but the agreement provides the parties are API, the subcontractor, and a \"Contractor\" that is not identified. After signing the contract, API learned that T.O. IX was not the builder. On August 11, 2005, Davis, the president of D &amp; S Homes, notified API that he was terminating the T.O. IX contract. In that letter he referred to that agreement as \"our contract,\" not as T.O. IX's contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Davis's Bankruptcy Case and the Adversary Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 15, 2010, Davis filed a voluntary chapter 7 petition. On August 16, 2010, API filed a complaint against Davis (the \"Adversary Complaint\"), objecting to Davis's discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (a)(4) and requesting nondischargeability of any debt owed to it pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). In the Adversary Complaint, API alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Davis] falsely represented that he intended to act as a licensed general contractor for a proposed building project in Thousand Oaks. [Davis] also falsely represented that he and various unlicensed entities he owned or controlled were \"owner/builders\" of the proposed building project, rather than licensed general contractors. From 2003 until\n   2005, [Davis] and the unlicensed entities proceed to construct the subject real property. [Davis] knew that, under California law, only a properly licensed general contractor could construct, or contract with other to construct, the subject real property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2004, [Davis] and entities he owned and controlled knowingly entered into the Agreement with [API] for labor, materials and services without disclosing that [Davis] and the entities he owned and controlled were unlicensed contractors and without disclosing that the construction engineering, surveying, plans and drawings provided to [API] were based on an inaccurate and incomplete 40-year-old \"as built\" survey. Because of the incomplete and inaccurate information provided to [API], [API] was unable to construct a portion of the curbs, gutters and public roadways at the subject real property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Rather than disclose the truth about the survey, [Davis] (a) intentionally terminated the Agreement; (b) refused to pay [API] for past due labor, materials and services provided to date; (c) refused to pay [API] the agreed upon amount in the Agreement; (d) engaged the services of other sub-contractors to remove and replace the portion of the curbs, gutters and public roadways that [API] could not construct; and (e) back-charged [API] for an amount in excess of the cost [Davis] incurred to construct the improvements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Had [Davis] disclosed that the subject real property was constructed in violation of California law or that the plans provided to [API] were inaccurate or incomplete, [API] would not have entered into the Agreement. Through [Davis's] express and implied representations, [Davis] was able to deceive [API] into entering into the Agreement with T.O. As a result, [API] requests a nondischargeable judgment against [Davis] in the amount of $1 million plus interest accrued on said amount to the date of payment, plus the costs of this proceeding and attorney's fees incurred by [API] in this adversary proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Aside from these allegations, the Adversary Complaint also included allegations that Davis did not accurately complete his bankruptcy schedules and statements and that, as a result, Davis should be denied a discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   API also continued to allege that Davis was a party to the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   (\"During 2004,\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   and entities he owned and controlled, knowingly entered into a sub-contract agreement with plaintiff....\") (emphasis added). In its prayer for relief, API requested attorneys' fees incurred by API during the course of the adversary proceeding. On September 17, 2010, Davis filed an answer to the Complaint (the \"Answer\") [doc. 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On June 26, 2013, API filed an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment (the \"Satisfaction of Judgment\") in state court. Through the Satisfaction of Judgment and the stipulation attached thereto, API acknowledged that the Phase One Judgment and any attorneys' fees awarded to date had been paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court bifurcated this proceeding, such that the Court first heard API's claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On December 23, 2014, the Court entered judgment in favor of Davis on API's claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [doc. 113]. The Court initially stayed the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   portion of this adversary proceeding to await conclusion of the State Court Action. On April 19, 2017, nearly seven years after Davis filed his chapter 7 petition, API and Davis appeared for a status conference. At that time, the Court informed the parties that\n   it would no longer delay prosecution of this adversary proceeding until the State Court Action was resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 31, 2017, the parties filed a joint pretrial stipulation (the \"JPS\") [doc. 140]. In the JPS, the parties agreed that the Court would try the following issues of law, among others:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) Whether or not, by reason of the false and misleading express and implied representations of [Davis] and by reason of [API's] reliance upon the truthfulness of the same, the obligation owed to [API] is nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) Whether or not, as a result of the intentionally false and misleading representations of [Davis], [API's] Claim in the amount of $1,130,951.42 is allowed and nondischargeable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (c) Whether [Davis] had a legal duty to disclose to [API] that T.O. was not a California licensed general contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (d) Whether [Davis] had a legal duty to disclose to [API] that entities in control of the subject project were not licensed general contractors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (e) Whether [Davis] had a legal duty to disclose to [API] the age of any plans given to [API].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (f) Whether [Davis] had a legal duty to disclose whether any plans given to [API] were inaccurate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   API also asserted that Davis was a party to the Agreement in both the JPS and a prior pretrial stipulation filed in this adversary proceeding [docs. 69, p.4, 140, p.4]. In both pretrial stipulations, API also continued to assert that T.O. and other entities were alter egos of Davis [docs. 69, pp. 6-7, 140, pp. 6-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. The Trial and Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On April 23 and 24, 2018, the Court held trial on API's claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). At trial, the Court made several findings regarding the Agreement, including findings regarding how T.O. was characterized in the Agreement, how certain terms were defined, which contractor's license number was included in the Agreement, the nature of oral communications between the parties regarding licensure at the time the parties entered into the Agreement and the review of the as-built survey provided with the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On June 13, 2018, the Court issued a decision after trial (the \"Court's Decision\") [doc. 219]. In the Court's Decision, the Court held that API did not establish that Davis made oral or written representations to API regarding T.O.'s license status or the age of the as-built survey before the parties entered into the Agreement. The Court also held that any omission by Davis regarding the license status of T.O. or the age of the as-built survey was not fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On June 18, 2018, the Court entered judgment in favor of Davis [doc. 221].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On June 29, 2018, Davis filed a motion requesting attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201717\">\n    Cal.

On September 17, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the Motion. At that time, the Court continued the hearing to provide API an opportunity to brief issues API raised for the first time at the hearing on the Motion. On October 3, 2018, API filed its supplemental brief [doc. 244]. API argued, for the first time over the course of the eight years of litigation between the parties in this Court, that Davis is not a party to the Agreement. API also asserted that B &amp; P \u00a7 7031 bars Davis's recovery of attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On October 17, 2018, the Court held a continued hearing on the Motion. Although the Court issued a ruling on Davis's entitlemen\n   t to attorneys' fees, the Court continued the hearing once more to provide Davis an opportunity to supplement the Motion with a declaration regarding the fees Davis incurred defending against API's claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those questions had been answered in arbitration, and confirmed by a State Court; indeed, in the nondischargeability action Bos conceded that such contracts were valid and that he had breached them. The litigation from that point forward asked only whether federal bankruptcy law forbade Bos from discharging the debts everyone agreed he owed to the Funds.

Appellants argue that the phrase \"[i]f this Agreement\n   <em>\n    gives rise to\n   </em>\n   a lawsuit or other legal proceeding\" (our italics) must be interpreted in a transactional sense; that is, in the sense that the litigation has arisen from the entirety of the circumstances of the real estate transaction of which the Purchase Agreement was the defining statement. Respondents, on the other hand, contend that their dispute with appellants cannot be said to have arisen from the Purchase Agreement, because the alleged actions, omissions, or misstatements with which that dispute was concerned, all occurred prior to the execution of the Purchase Agreement. In short, respondents focus on the chronology of the events in relation to the actual execution of the Purchase Agreement, while appellants more broadly address the entire transaction, of which the Purchase Agreement was the written memorandum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20486\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court held that the action could properly be regarded \"as having arisen from\" the purchase agreement even under the defendants' narrower interpretation of the language, because the purchase agreement provided for certain inspections after the signing of the agreement, which inspections were allegedly deficient and partly formed the basis of the plaintiffs' lawsuit against the defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1343-44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20154\">\n    5 Cal.Rptr.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court held that the plaintiffs' broader interpretation of the language was accurate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   In any case, we must apply the rule that words in a contract are to be understood in their usual sense. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644.) In our opinion, appellants' interpretation more fairly reflects the ordinary and usual sense of the phrase \"gives rise to,\" which the parties agreed to in the Purchase Agreement. In ordinary popular speech, as well as in legal opinions, it is common to use the phrase \"arises from\" or \"arises out of\" in a far more general, transactional sense than is suggested by phrases such as \"derives from\" or \"proximately caused by.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20486\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at 1344. The\n   <em>\n    Xuereb\n   </em>\n   court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Appellants' interpretation is also buttressed by the interpretational principle that a contract must be understood with reference to the circumstances under which it was made and the matter to which it relates. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 1647.) The circumstances of the Purchase Agreement and the matter to which it related was a large real property transaction, in which the buyer and the seller made certain reciprocal agreements with respect to the inspection of the premises and a variety of contingencies which were supposed to take place prior to the close of escrow. It was out of these contingencies, or the alleged failure thereof, that the lawsuit arose. The attorney fees provision specifically included the \"Agent\" among the parties with respect to which disputes could arise that would trigger a right to attorney\n   fees. In light of all these circumstances, we conclude that the phrase \"gives rise to\" must be interpreted expansively, to encompass acts and omissions occurring in connection with the Purchase Agreement and the entire transaction of which it was the written memorandum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20486\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Post-\n   <em>\n    Xuereb\n   </em>\n   , several courts have afforded the same broad interpretation to comparable attorneys' fees provisions.

To support its argument, API refers to the appellate court's comment that the Agreement was between API and \"a 'Contractor' that is not identified.\" Although the appellate court did note that the Agreement did not identify the \"Contractor,\" neither the appellate court nor the trial court held that Davis was not a party to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In fact, the trial court implicitly found that Davis\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a party to the Agreement. In its Fees Order, the state trial court awarded API attorneys' fees based on the attorneys' fees provision in the Agreement. Subsequently, in its Alter Ego Judgment, the trial court held that Davis, among others, was liable for the attorneys' fees because Davis was an alter ego of multiple other entities, including T.O.

Subcontractor agrees to pay to Contractor reasonable attorneys' fees. In the event that Subcontractor prevails in any reference proceeding or court action arising out of this Agreement or the enforcement or breach thereof ... Contractor agrees to pay to Subcontractor reasonable attorneys' fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Based on this language, API contracted for reciprocity as to liability for attorneys' fees. Had API prevailed on its nondischargeability claim, because of the Alter Ego Judgment, API would have been able to collect its award of attorneys' fees from Davis. In fact, in the Adversary Complaint, API requested an award of attorneys' fees; for a nondischargeability claim under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), API's bases to obtain an award of attorneys' fees are the Agreement's attorneys' fees provision\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   the Alter Ego Judgment. Based on the authorities above, as a prevailing party, Davis may receive an award of attorneys' fees under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Although API now argues that the term \"Contractor\" is too vague to allow for Davis's recovery of attorneys' fees, the Agreement (\u00b6 1) explicitly provides T.O. the right to enforce any provision in the Agreement, including the attorneys' fees provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   This Subcontract Agreement (\"Agreement\") is between Contractor and Subcontractor. Any references to \"Owner\" shall refer to T.O. IX, LLC. The Owner is an express third-party beneficiary to this Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Owner has the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement against Subcontractor\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   (Emphasis added). In light of this provision, API agreed that T.O. would have the right to enforce any provision of the Agreement. Because the state court held that T.O. is an alter ego of Davis, Davis also has a right to enforce any provision of the Agreement. As such, Davis is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees because: (A) API contracted for reciprocity; (B) API agreed that T.O. has the ability to enforce any provision in the Agreement; (C) the state trial court held, and the state appellate court affirmed, that T.O. is an alter ego of Davis; and (D) had API prevailed, API would have been able to recover its attorneys' fees from Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Because the state court determined that Davis would be properly treated as an alter ego of T.O., API became entitled to recover its breach of contract damages, and related attorneys' fees, from Davis. As this Court previously noted, API's judgment for breach of contract damages and attorneys' fees against Davis (and others) has been paid in full. Moreover, during the course of this adversary proceeding, API continued to refer to Davis as a party to the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, under comparable circumstances, allow nonsignatory defendants to collect attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burkhalter Kessler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514149\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/228/154/\">\n    19 Cal.App.5th at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   46 n.2 (\"This case raises an interesting tactical issue: whether a plaintiff should plead an alter ego defendant in the initial complaint (and risk a dismissal with prejudice and possible payment of attorney fees); or should a plaintiff hold off and later seek to amend a prevailing judgment.

Courts consider the following factors when applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   First, a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled. Absent success in a prior proceeding, a party's later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations, and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity. A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped. In enumerating these factors, we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel. Additional considerations may inform the doctrine's application in specific factual contexts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p749\">\n    532 U.S. at 750-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Here, API repeatedly contended that Davis is a party to the Agreement and that Davis is an alter ego of several entities, including T.O. API succeeded in persuading the state court of its position: consequently, the state court held Davis\n   responsible for breach of contract damages arising from the Agreement, and for payment of API's attorneys' fees pursuant to the Agreement's applicable provisions. API's prior position that Davis is a party to the Agreement (and consequently liable for breach of contract damages and API's related attorneys' fees) is inconsistent with API's current position that Davis is not a party to the Agreement and thus may not receive an award of attorneys' fees, under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Finally, API would derive an unfair advantage if API were allowed to maintain its inconsistent position. API, having obtained a holding that Davis is liable for breach of the Agreement and for the payment of API's attorneys' fees (in accordance with the Agreement), may not avoid the consequences of the same contractual provisions when Davis constitutes the prevailing party.

B &amp; P \u00a7 7031 Does Not Bar Davis's Recovery of Attorneys' Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Pursuant to B &amp; P \u00a7 7031 -\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   (a) Except as provided in subdivision (e), no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor, may bring or maintain any action, or recover in law or equity in any action, in any court of this state\n   <em>\n    for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required\n   </em>\n   by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person, except that this prohibition shall not apply to contractors who are each individually licensed under this chapter but who fail to comply with Section 7029.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   (b) Except as provided in subdivision (e), a person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state\n   <em>\n    to recover all compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor for performance of any act or contract\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   B &amp; P \u00a7 7031(a), (b) (emphases added). B &amp; P \u00a7 7031 plainly is not applicable to the facts here. Davis is not attempting to recover compensation for work he performed as a contractor. Davis is attempting to recover attorneys' fees he has incurred in defending API's claim of nondischargeability\n   <em>\n    against Davis\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, Davis himself\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a licensed contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The single case cited by API does not state otherwise.

Here, neither T.O. nor Davis is attempting to recover compensation for work performed as a contractor.

As such, for the reasons stated on the docket [docs. 248,\n   254], the Court will award Davis $91,390.92 in attorneys' fees and $956.87 in costs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
