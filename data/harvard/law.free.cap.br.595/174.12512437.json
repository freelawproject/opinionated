In addition to arguing that Ms. Peterson has not proved excusable neglect for filing a late claim, the objection includes a request that any order denying the Late Claim Motion also prohibit further correspondence and filings by Ms. Peterson regarding her claims. Ms. Peterson filed a Response on November 14, 2018, and a hearing was held on November 19, 2018. At the hearing, the Court admitted the Liquidating Trustee's exhibits into evidence, after overruling Ms. Peterson's objections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also considered all exhibits and attachments to Ms. Peterson's Late Claim Motion and other filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Late Claim Motion will be denied and the further relief requested by the Liquidating Trustee will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy case filings related to Ms. Peterson\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 6-7, 2016, each of the Debtors filed its respective\n   <em>\n    Schedule of Assets and Liabilities\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Statement of Financial Affairs\n   </em>\n   (the \"Schedules\" and the \"SOFA\"), which were amended on August 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Exhibit 7 to the SOFA, Debtor Hastings Entertainment, Inc. listed legal actions, administrative proceedings, executions, attachments or audits, which included a customer discrimination proceeding commenced by\n   Ms. Peterson in the Superior Court for the State of Washington, Case No. 15-3993-00 (the \"Customer Discrimination Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Hastings Entertainment's Schedules E/F, Ms. Peterson is identified as a potential creditor holding a contingent, unliquidated, disputed claim based on the Customer Discrimination Action (the \"Peterson Scheduled Claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 6, 2016, the Court entered an Order establishing bar dates for filing proofs of claim (the \"Bar Date Order\"), setting October 28, 2016 as the deadline for certain creditors to file proofs of claim against the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rust Consulting/Omni Bankruptcy, the Debtors' court-appointed claims and noticing agent (the \"Claims Agent\"), mailed a notice of the Bar Date and proof of claim forms to the Debtors' creditors and other known parties in interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 9, 2016, Ms. Peterson was served with a copy of the Bar Date notice, which was mailed to her address in Moses Lake, Washington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors have no record of Ms. Peterson filing a proof of claim before the applicable Bar Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 29, 2017, the Liquidating Trustee filed an objection to the Peterson Scheduled Claim on the grounds that it was contingent, unliquidated, and/or disputed, and because no additional information had been provided by the claimant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Liquidating Trust's notice agent mailed the Fourth Omnibus Objection to Ms. Peterson at the same address in Moses Lake, Washington to which the Bar Date Notice was sent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Peterson did not respond to the Fourth Omnibus Objection in a timely manner.

At the hearing, the Court determined that Ms. Peterson did not file a claim before the Bar Date and did not respond to the objection to her scheduled claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court noted Ms. Peterson's allegation that the notices were not properly addressed and decided that she should be permitted to file a motion seeking leave to file a late claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court entered an Order granting the Liquidating Trustee's motion to dismiss or deny the Petition, and set a deadline for Ms. Peterson to file a motion for leave to file a late claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 11, 2018, Ms. Peterson filed the Late Claim Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 5, 2018, the Liquidating Trustee filed an objection to the Motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Ms. Peterson filed a Response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hearing on the Late Claim Motion was held on November 19, 2018, which Ms. Peterson attended by telephone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under Bankruptcy Rule 3003(c)(3), a bankruptcy court fixes a deadline\n   for filing proofs of claim in a chapter 11 case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the deadline for filing claims has passed, a claimant may file a motion under Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1) seeking the court's permission to file a late claim, which the court should grant only if the party's failure to file a timely claim was the result of \"excusable neglect.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its well-known\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   decision, the United States Supreme Court concluded that determining whether neglect is \"excusable\" depends upon all relevant circumstances surrounding the party's omission, including, in particular, consideration of the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) the danger of prejudice to the debtor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (ii) the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (iii) the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (iv) whether the movant acted in good faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"All factors must be considered and balanced; no one factor trumps the others.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Bar Date for filing claims in the Debtors' bankruptcy cases was October 28, 2016. Ms. Peterson did not file a claim in the bankruptcy case by the Bar Date. She also did not respond timely to the Liquidating Trustee's objection to her scheduled claim, which was disallowed by Order dated July 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In October 2017 -- about one year after the Bar Date and three months after the Order was entered granting the objection to the scheduled claim -- Ms. Peterson contacted the Liquidating Trustee about asserting a claim in the case. In November 2017 and in July 2018, she sent a letter and a petition to the Bankruptcy Court in an effort to assert a late claim. Her Late Claim Motion describes the basis of her claim and asserts that notices sent by the Claims Agent were not addressed properly. In response, the Liquidating Trustee argues that an analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factors weighs against allowing Ms. Peterson to file a late claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Prejudice to the Debtors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor -- prejudice to the Debtor -- \"does not refer to an imagined or hypothetical harm; a finding of prejudice should be a conclusion based on the facts in evidence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relevant considerations regarding prejudice include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   the size of the claim with respect to the rest of the estate; whether allowing the late claim would have an adverse impact on the judicial administration of the case; whether the plan was filed or confirmed with knowledge of the existence of the claim; the disruptive effect that the late filing would have on the plan or upon the economic model upon which the plan was based; and whether allowing the claim would open the floodgates to other similar claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Damage to other creditors in the form of a reduced recovery is not a consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Liquidating Trustee argues that allowing Ms. Peterson to file a late claim would result in prejudice to the Trust, as successor to the Debtors' estates. Ms. Peterson asserted her claim after confirmation of the liquidating Plan. The Trust has already made an initial distribution to holders of general unsecured claims under the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Late Claim Motion is granted, the Liquidating Trustee argues that the Trust will incur additional and unnecessary administrative expenses litigating Ms. Peterson's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Peterson describes her claim, in part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   I was falseley [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] arrested for a felony inside of Hastings Entertainment, Moses Lake, WA. It held over my head 543 days. I have several different damages. Personal, Injury Punitave [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] from loss of livestock. Unlawful imprisonment damages.

Scandalous malicious behavior, Rule 56 Defendants havnt [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] cooperated or communicated in any legal way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ms. Peterson provides no plausible facts in her filings, except those describing her allegedly false arrest on April 17, 2013 in a Hastings Entertainment store.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Debtors scheduled a contingent, unliquidated and disputed claim by Ms. Peterson based on a lawsuit that she filed in Washington State Court against John Marmaduke and Hastings Entertainment. The state court lawsuit was dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ms. Peterson did not file a proof of claim by the Bar Date and, later (post-confirmation), Ms. Peterson did not provide information to support her claim in response to the Liquidating Trustee's objection. The Late Claim Motion contains a mixture of legal conclusions and unknown theories of damages, with little or no credible support. To grant leave to file her claim at this juncture would disrupt the Trust's administration of the estate and cause the Trust to incur significant time and money to determine the validity and amount of the claim. The Debtors' liquidation may further complicate the Trust's ability to find witnesses and evidence to verify the claim. Reviewing this matter in light of the considerations for prejudice recognized by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    O'Brien Environmental\n   </em>\n   , I conclude that this factor weighs in favor of the Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    Length of the delay and impact of the delay on judicial proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factor to consider is the length of the delay in asserting a claim and the impact of the delay on the judicial proceedings. Here, Ms. Peterson first contacted counsel for the Liquidating Trustee one year after the Bar Date and about three months after the Court granted the Trust's objection to her scheduled claim. She followed up by filing a letter with the Court in November 2017 and the Petition in July 2018. Even if I determined that the actual length of this delay was not excessively long, still, the delay will impact estate administration. As discussed above, the state court action was dismissed, and the Trust needs witnesses and evidence to determine the validity and amount of Ms. Peterson's claim, most likely through litigation. This factor weighs in favor of Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    Reason for the delay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The concept of excusable neglect anticipates that the movant's lack of care may have caused the delay, i.e., neglect on the part of the one seeking to be excused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, however, should also examine whether the debtor's actions contributed to the neglect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The gist of Ms. Peterson's argument is that she did not receive proper notice of the Bar Date or of the objection to her scheduled claim. She argues that the mailing address used by the Claims Agent was incomplete because it did not include her apartment or unit number: \"n.e. # 10. To support this claim, she attached to her Motion copies of the envelopes received from the Debtors' Claims Agent with the incomplete address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Peterson's possession of the envelopes contradicts the basis underlying her request to file a late claim. The envelopes demonstrate conclusively that she\n   <em>\n    actually received\n   </em>\n   notices from the Claims Agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Liquidating Trustee's noticing agent used the same address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the Debtors nor the Liquidating Trustee contributed to Ms. Peterson's delay in filing her claim. Ms. Peterson provided no other explanation to\n   excuse her late filings.

The Liquidating Trustee questions Ms. Peterson's good faith because she claimed that she was not properly served with notices, even though she had envelopes from the Debtors' Claims Agent in her possession. However, even assuming, without deciding, that Ms. Peterson acted in good faith, that finding would not materially alter the foregoing analysis determining that the other three\n   <em>\n    Pioneer\n   </em>\n   factors weigh against a determination of excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Additional Relief Requested by the Liquidating Trustee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Liquidating Trustee's objection includes a request that any order denying the Late Claim Motion also prohibit further correspondence and filings by Ms. Peterson regarding her claims. The Liquidating Trustee seeks this relief \"to ensure the orderly and efficient administration of the Trust,\" because Ms. Peterson has sent numerous emails to the Liquidating Trustee's counsel, in addition to filing the petition and motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trustee Exhibit 5 contains an email chain between the Liquidating Trustee's counsel and Ms. Peterson, in which Ms. Peterson at times accuses counsel of concealing files or lying, and other times seeks counsel's advice. For example, the emails contain attacks or threats to counsel, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Anybody that goes against Legislature Law and protecting Cival [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Liberty Rights is obviously hiding more criminal acts. You treated me like dirt like my suffering held prisoner was no big deal. How about you be held 543 days inside your home held with no freedom. I didn't do anything wrong in any realm defending my federal rights. Why would you hate me for standing for Truth and Justice? Why wouldn't you want Justice and Trust out on facts if you sincerely represent this case in an honest manner? The file you have needs to be given to someone who takes my claim serious and dosnt conceiling [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] my paperwork for months.

You have very personal information of mine your [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] holding on to and would appreciate you giving my file up so Judge Carey gets his letters you have and you have all my papers for entry I typed for the courts back in July.

Why did you ask me to send them to you if your [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] not the one shedding light on the fraud? I am not Attorney and I pray God has mercy on the souls of entities ignoring victims of terrorist acts like you have done so well [counsel]. Thanks for standing with me on fighting for Truth, Justice and protecting our homeland. If your [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] against me you are the enemy in every realm. Power abusers in the Judicial process of these cases needs to end. The creditors are suffering not you, not Marmaduke, not Crow or Billy Mays. The company needs held responsible for unlawful imprisonment, I have punitive damages and kinda think it's priority over a gas bill. I am a nobody in this case and you would like it to remain that way.
