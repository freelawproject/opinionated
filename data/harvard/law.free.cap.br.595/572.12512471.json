The Court reviews the June 26, 2018 \"Amended Tentative Ruling\" issued by Bankruptcy Judge Margaret\n   M. Mann of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California. (R.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 4-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8019(b), the Court finds the matter suitable for adjudication without oral argument. For the reasons stated below, the bankruptcy court's June 26, 2018 Order is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 3, 2010, Debtor James Marvin Roth (\"James\") filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Bankruptcy Case No. 10-7659-MM11, Dkt. No. 1.) In August 2011, an evidentiary hearing was held concerning the approval of the Chapter 11 Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 314.) At the end of the hearing, the court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   made a motion to appoint an examiner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 351.) On September 27, 2011, Christopher Barclay was appointed as the Chapter 11 Examiner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 359.) On June 22, 2012, the Chapter 11 Plan was confirmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 483.) The Plan provided that \"[p]ending any discharge of either or both Reorganized Debtors, all Creditors are enjoined and stayed from taking any action against the Reorganized Debtors, their estates, or property of their estates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 509 at 55.) On August 29, 2012 the bankruptcy court approved an order directing that \"Roth [James] and RMC are ordered not to incur any new debt or obligations, including by [sic] not limited to incurring guarantees, trade debt, secured loans or unsecured loan, without the approval of Anice Plikaytis\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Disbursing Agent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 535 at 16.) On April 5, 2013, James was authorized to borrow money from Debra's separate property on an unsecured basis and the estate and its property would not be liable for the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 854.) According to Appellant, she lent money to James on an unsecured basis and claims $ 148,537 is due. (Bankruptcy Case No. 10-90359-MM, Dkt. No. 384, TPC \u00b6 4.3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2013, at a hearing on Anna Plikaytis' motion to convert James' case to a Chapter 7 liquidation, the bankruptcy court denied the motion to convert and amended the Plan and appointed former examiner Barclay to be the Post-Confirmation Estate Fiduciary. (Bankruptcy Case No. 10-7659-MM11, Dkt. No. 1002 at 2.) The Estate Fiduciary is vested with the authorities and responsibilities comparable to a trustee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 22, 2013, in the underlying adversary proceeding, Appellee Anice Plikaytis's (\"AP\") obtained a judgment in the bankruptcy court in the amount of $ 2,997,000 against James Roth for the portion of his debt to her under a final judgment entered in the San Diego Superior Court as nondischargeable. (R. at 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 28, 2017, the bankruptcy court held a hearing concerning the completion of the Plan. (Bankruptcy Case No. 10-7659-MM11, Dkt. No. 1254 at 1.) Barclay, the Estate Fiduciary, sought abandonment of James' 100% equity interest in the Zanzibar rental properties as of October 1, 2012 and the bankruptcy court granted his motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 5; R. at 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In anticipation of the abandonment, on Saturday, September 30, 2017, Debra prepared a deed of trust to secure money she had loaned to James for necessary legal\n   services and gave them to her husband unsigned knowing that the properties would be abandoned by the bankruptcy estate on Monday, October 2, 2017 and knowing that the actual liens could not be created until Monday, October 2, 2017. (R. at 115-116.) On the same day, Debra accompanied James to the notary public where he signed the Deed of Trust with Assignment of Rents with respect to Zanzibar properties. (Bankruptcy Case No. 10-903598-MM, Dkt. No. 442 at 55-56; R. at 39-43.) On Monday, October 2, 2017, James went to the San Diego County Recorder's Office and recorded the Deeds of Trust (\"DOT\") at 8:26 a.m. (R. at 116.) When he returned, James delivered the DOT to Debra and she accepted their delivery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 2, 2017, the bankruptcy court issued an abstract of judgment on AP's judgment. (Bankruptcy Case No. 10-90359-MM, Dkt. No. 244.) On Tuesday, October 3, 2017, AP recorded her abstract of judgment with the County Recorder's office. (R. at 67-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 17, 2018, Debra filed a Third Party Claim asserting an interest superior to that held by Creditor AP in the monies received from rents owed to James based on his interest in the Zanzibar properties. (R. at 4.) An opposition was filed on April 30, 2018. (R. at 3.) Debra filed a reply. (Dkt. No. 408.) On May 10, 2018, the bankruptcy court issued a tentative ruling concluding that the Third Party Claim be overruled. (R. at 88.) The court found that the DOT was void as the acts preparing the DOT violated the automatic stay as the stay prohibits all actions against the property. (R. at 93-94.) On June 25, 2018, the court held a hearing and after allowing Debra to file a supplemental brief, issued an amended tentative ruling sustaining tentative ruling that overruled the Third Party Claim and entered judgment. (R. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant challenges the bankruptcy judge's ruling that the \"deed of trust under which Debra claimed as superior right to Zanzibar was prepared and executed in violation of the automatic stay was therefore void. Since Debra's DOT was void, AP's objection to Debra's TPC was sustained.\" (Dkt. No. 5 at 6.) This conclusion is based on the bankruptcy court's finding that \"the transfer was not initiated by James but by Debra and her request and for her benefit.\" (R. at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Appellant does not dispute the facts or the applicable law, but challenges the interpretation of the facts as applied to the law; specifically, the question raised is whether the violation of the automatic stay was debtor-initiated or creditor-initiated and whether the automatic stay provisions have been violated. Therefore, the Court reviews the bankruptcy order\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In response, Appellee argues that the bankruptcy court properly found that the preparation and execution of the DOT by Debra was a creditor-initiated transaction, and a creditor imposed lien is a violation of the automatic stay provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To determine which whether \u00a7 549 or \u00a7 362 applies, the Court must determine whether the transfer or action taken against the Zanzibar properties was debtor-initiated or creditor-initiated.

The bankruptcy court determined that Debra, on her own initiative, typed up the DOT, and at her request, James executed a deed of trust against the Zanzibar properties, and then she accompanied James to get it notarized. (R. at 5, 9) (\"DOT was entered into at her request and for her benefit. She also participated in the drafting and preparation.\"). The court concluded that it was clear that the transfer was initiated by Debra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Without legal support or explanation, Appellant claims the creation of the DOT was debtor-initiated, not creditor-initiated because James \"obtained a post-petition credit facility from Debra and created Debra's DOT.\" (Dkt. No. 5 at 14.) Appellant also argues that the bankruptcy court erroneously focused on the \"initiation of the\n   <em>\n    transaction\n   </em>\n   \" rather than the \"initiation of the resulting\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   \" but does not explain the significance of this difference or provide any legal support for her position. (Dkt. No. 5 at 13 (emphasis in original).) She further asserts \"[h]ad the Bankruptcy Court correctly focused its analysis on who initiated the transfer than what initiated the transaction, the conclusion based on undisputed evidence was that it was James, and not Debra, who initiated the transfer effectuated by Debra's DOT\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 14), yet provides no factual or legal explanation as to the significant of her assertion. These claims do not support her argument that the transfer was initiated by James, the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2005, with the enactment of the BAPCPA, Congress redefined \"transfer\" to mean\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (A) the creation of a lien;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (B) the retention of title as a security interest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (C) the foreclosure of a debtor's equity of redemption; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (D) each mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting with-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (i) property; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (ii) an interest in property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (54).

(R. at 115, Debra Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 4.) She recognized that AP had a non-dischargeable judgment and she would take action to impose a lien on the properties so Debra had to act quickly to prepare deeds of trust to secure her loans by gaining priority over AP's judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On September 30, 2017, Debra typed up two DOTs in order for James to record them as soon as the properties were abandoned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The DOTs were signed and notarized on September 30, 2017 by James. (R. at 120, James Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 5.) Debra accompanied James to the notary. (R. at 5.) After that, James maintained possession and control of the DOTs. (R. at 120, James Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 6.) On Monday, October 2, 2017, at 8:26 a.m., James recorded the DOTs with the San Diego County Recorder's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) When he returned, James handed the recorded DOTs to Debra. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) James and Debra state they knew that liens could not be created before the abandonment was complete and the acts were done to prepare the DOTs so they could be later used to create liens to secure Debra's loans. (R. at 120, James Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 8; R. at 115, Debra Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The undisputed facts mandate a conclusion that Debra initiated the process of creating a lien to secure her loan.
