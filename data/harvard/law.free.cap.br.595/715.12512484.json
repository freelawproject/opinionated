One factor is inapplicable: Factor 8 - Because the proceeding against Evans Trucking is entirely core, there are no non-core claims that could be severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Abstention is appropriate in the proceeding against Evans Trucking under the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   1 - Abstention's effect on the efficient administration of the estate: Ramco being the only unsecured creditor, at least at this\n   juncture, abstention would have no effect on the administration of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   2 - Extent to which state law issues predominate over bankruptcy issues: The proceeding is based entirely on state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   4 - Presence of related proceeding in state court: Upon remand, all the other proceedings in the Lawsuit will be pending in the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dubose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9229654\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/318/419/#p423\">\n    318 F.Supp.2d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"preference for having an entire dispute resolved in one court\" is ground for remand under \u00a7 1452(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   5 - Jurisdictional basis other than bankruptcy: There is no jurisdictional basis other than the Pending Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   9 - Burden on bankruptcy court's docket: Retention would increase the burden on this Court's already overburdened docket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   10 - Likelihood of forum shopping: The filing of the bankruptcy cases mere days before trial and Defendants' notice of removal three days later strongly suggests forum shopping, as does the fact that Debtor in the Closed Case listed no assets and Ramco as its only creditor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.
