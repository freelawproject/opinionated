On Schedule A, Debtor listed certain real property located at 5522 Deer Creek Ln., Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91737 (the \"Property\"), and valued the Property at $1,608,699.00. On Schedule C, Debtor claimed an exemption in the Property\n   in the amount of $100,000. On Schedule D, Debtor listed three liens on the property: (1) a first mortgage, held by Mr. Cooper Home Loans, in the amount of $895,952.46; (2) a second mortgage, held by Specialized Loan Servicing, in the amount of $581,946.44; and (3) an HOA statutory lien, in the amount of $14,586.35, held by Deer Creek HOA. On March 23, 2018, First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust, Mortgage Loan Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-FFC, U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, successor in interest to Bank of America, N.A., as Trustee, successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association, as Trustee (collectively, with Specialized Loan Servicing LLC, \"Defendants\") filed a proof of claim in the amount of $357,975.27 (\"Claim 12\"). Claim 12 is related to the second mortgage, and is identified as secured by the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 21, 2018, Debtor filed a complaint against Defendants for: (1) declaratory relief; (2) to avoid the second deed of trust; and (3) to disallow Claim 12. On June 5, 2018, Debtor filed an amended complaint, listing three causes of action: (1) avoidance of a fraudulent transfer; (2) recovery of the transferred property; and (3) disallowance of Claim 12. On June 19, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint (the \"Motion\") for failure to state a claim. On July 6, 2018, Debtor filed an opposition. On July 25, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the Motion, and continued the matter for supplemental briefing. After supplemental briefing from both parties, the Court held a continued hearing on October 3, 2018, and granted the Motion. On October 22, 2018, the Court entered an order stating that the Motion was \"granted based on the findings, facts, conclusions of law on the record and the pleadings filed in this case,\" and that Debtor had leave to amend until November 5, 2018, otherwise the case would be dismissed with prejudice. Two days later, the Court vacated the interlocutory order, stating that it would \"issue a memorandum decision without further briefing or argument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This adversary proceeding stems from a consent judgment entered into by, among others, Bank of America and certain attorneys general on April 4, 2012 (the \"Consent Judgment\"). Debtor is not a party to the Consent Judgment. At the time of the Consent Judgment, both of Debtor's mortgages were held by Bank of America. According to Debtor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Consent Judgment provided that if B of A held two mortgages on the same residence, then if it modified the first mortgage by reducing the principal balance it was required to modify the second mortgage according to certain stated terms. (Consent Judgment at page 167, part h.) On February 22, 2013, B of A modified the first mortgage on the Property by reducing the principal balance. Therefore, it was required to modify the second mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [Dkt. No. 8, pg 4, lines 17-21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Debtor's argument, while novel, can be succinctly summarized as follows. First, Bank of America's failure to extinguish the second mortgage, when it was allegedly obligation to by the Consent Judgment, constitutes a transfer of an interest in property. Second, Debtor did not receive any value in return for the transfer, and Debtor was insolvent at the time the transfer was made, rendering the transfer constructively fraudulent under applicable law. Third, the IRS has standing to avoid the transfer, the IRS is the holder of an unsecured claim, and thus Debtor is allowed to step into the shoes of the IRS and avoid the transfer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants raise a variety of arguments to support dismissal of the amended complaint: (1) Debtor lacks standing; (2) this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the action; and (3) the failure to extinguish the second mortgage is not a transfer as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    I. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION AND STANDING\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the Motion, Defendants argue that: (a) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action; and (b) that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring this claim. It appears that Defendants have abandoned their argument that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction - Defendants' subsequent pleadings lack any reference to the argument. Nevertheless, for the reason stated in Plaintiff's opposition to the Motion, namely that each of the claims brought by Plaintiff is a core proceeding, the Court concludes that it does have subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regarding standing, Defendants' argument is somewhat confusing. In its supplemental brief, Defendants argue that \"determining whether the lien should have been released requires enforcement of the Consent Judgment, which the Trustee lacks standing to do.\" [Dkt. No. 20, pg. 9]. The Court disagrees with this assertion because the amended complaint does not necessarily require this Court to\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   the consent judgment. Instead, it would appear that the amended complaint simply requires an interpretation of the Consent Judgment. Defendants' argument that \"the only way to determine whether BOA was required to release the lien per the Consent Judgment is by initiating an action to enforce the Consent Judgment,\" [Dk. No. 20, pg. 9] does not appear to be correct. As such, the Court assumes, for the purposes of this decision, that Plaintiff has standing to bring the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    II.

The extent of the analysis provided by the bankruptcy court is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 101(54)(B) provides that the retention of\n   <em>\n    title\n   </em>\n   as a security interest constitutes a transfer. For example, if a sailboat is sold and the seller retains title to the boat until the boat is fully paid for. The retention of title serves the same purpose as a transfer of a lien against the property by the buyer. Both Oregon and federal bankruptcy law define \"transfer\" as every mode of parting with property or an interest in property. The specifics given in the definitions are merely examples of parting with property or an interest in property. I do not find that the retention of its\n   <em>\n    security interest\n   </em>\n   by RRM constitutes the parting by Sequoia of an interest in its property under either Oregon or federal bankruptcy law. For that reason, summary judgment will be grated to Defendant on Counts 3, 4, and 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 (footnote and citation omitted). While not identified by the parties here, the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Partners\n   </em>\n   has clearly emphasized the distinction between \"title\" and \"security interest,\" even providing a contrasting example of a situation which would appear to fit within the wording of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (54)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In response to\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Partners\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Partners\n   </em>\n   essentially reduced the definition of a transfer to that contained within \u00a7 101(54)(D). Plaintiff argues that this interpretation of \u00a7 101(54), a disjunctive statute, is incorrect. Clearly, Plaintiff is correct that when a statute provides four options, separated by the disjunctive \"or,\" only one of such options need be satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court notes that there is a reasonable basis for Plaintiff's reading of the excerpt from\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Partners\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the sentence stating that: \"[t]he specifics given in the definitions are merely examples\n   of parting with property or an interest in property,\" combined with the fact that the bankruptcy court footnoted that sentence with a citation to \u00a7 101(54)(D), does provide an opportunity for the argument that the bankruptcy court reduced \u00a7 101(54) to \u00a7 101(54)(D). Nevertheless, in light of the example cited by the bankruptcy court, a seller retaining title to a sailboat until the boat is fully paid for, the Court finds Plaintiff's reading to be incorrect. While the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Partners\n   </em>\n   analogized the retention of title to the creation of a lien, ostensibly in order to fit \u00a7 101(54)(B) into the general definition of a transfer as \"parting with property or an interest in property,\" such analogy is unnecessary in light of the fact the Bankruptcy Code explicitly creates two separate categories for those two actions, each of which is separate from \u00a7 101(54)(D). And the retention of a lien is materially different from both \u00a7 101(54)(A) (\"the creation of a lien\") and \u00a7 101(54)(B) (\"the retention of title\") as demonstrated by the brief example in\n   <em>\n    Sequoia Partners\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, Plaintiff's conflation of \"lien\" and \"title\" in 11 U.S.C \u00a7 101(54)(B) would appear to conflict with caselaw binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    In re Wind Power Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119728,11296003\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/288/\">\n    841 F.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (9th Cir. 1988), stated that: \"the renewal of a lien or security interest is not a new transfer within the meaning of section 547 if it merely continues an existing interest; it does not diminish the collection of assets to be distributed among the general creditors.\" Because the Ninth Circuit has concluded that the renewal of a lien is not a transfer because it merely continues an existing interest, Plaintiff's argument that retention of a lien can be a transfer would appear to contravene binding law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, and, arguably, most importantly, Plaintiff's interpretation of the definition of transfer, if accepted, would have monumental implications far outside the instant case. If the Court were to substitute \"lien\" for \"title\" in \u00a7 101(54)(B), it would not be clear why every single secured creditor of a debtor in bankruptcy would not have been considered to have retained lien as a security interest, and thus committed a potentially avoidable transfer. This inevitably results because the term \"retention\" would seem to operate essentially as an antonym of \"transfer\"; at any given point, a holder of an interest is either transferring that interest or retaining it. Therefore, if the Court permitted Plaintiff to substitute \"lien\" for \"title\" then every single lienholder might be subject to an avoidable preference action. While Plaintiff points to an event which he asserts imposed a requirement on Bank of America to release the lien, the occurring of such an event would not seem to be required by the plain language of the statute. Quite simply, Plaintiff appears to have started from a wholly unsupported legally position, then tempered the position by resorting to the facts of the instant case, to make the position appear less absurd.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, this limiting of \u00a7 101(54)(B) is not supported by the plain language of the statute. Because the Court has an obligation to read a statute in a manner which does not produce an absurd result, the Court cannot see any basis to permit \"lien\" to be substituted for \"title\" in \u00a7 101(54)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    C. Transfer in \u00a7 101(54)(D)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff has not presented a clear argument as to how the failure to extinguish\n   the second mortgage could be considered a transfer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (54)(D). In his supplemental brief, Plaintiff concedes that \"if \u00a7 101(54) consisted solely in \u00a7 101(54)(D), the Defendants' position might possibly be vindicated,\" though he continued on to state that \"Mr. Boyd does not concede this possibility.\" [Dkt. No. 21, pg. 2]. The Court will construe Plaintiff's supplemental brief as arguing that because Defendants allegedly had a duty to extinguish the second mortgage, the failure to do so was a constructive transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In support of Plaintiff's position, Plaintiff refers to\n   <em>\n    In re Forman Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392378\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/273/408/\">\n    273 B.R. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 2002), a case not binding on this Court. Nevertheless,\n   <em>\n    In re Forman Enters.\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiff's position here. While it is true that the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    In re Forman Enters.\n   </em>\n   stated that \"[n]owhere is there any indication in the Bankruptcy Code that action, as opposed to inaction, by a debtor is required for there to be a transfer,\" that case also stated that \"[d]efendants ultimately may turn out to be correct in asserting that there was no post-petition transfer in this regard but have not been persuasive to date in establishing whether there is such a change.\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392378\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/273/408/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9392378\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/273/408/\">\n    at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, that bankruptcy court revisited the issue approximately six months later, concluding that no transfer occurred.\n   <em>\n    In re Forman Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11450422\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/281/600/\">\n    281 B.R. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2 COLLIER'S ON BANKRUPTCY \u00b6 101.54[4][a] (16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2011) (\"The pass-through of net operating losses or other tax consequences from a Subchapter S corporation to its principals is not a transfer. The pass-through occurs by operation of law, not by any act on the part of the corporation or its principals.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that the \"[t]he hallmark of a 'transfer' is a change in the rights of the transferor with respect to the property after the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094364\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/408/318/#p338\">\n    408 B.R. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 2009). Here, Plaintiff simply cannot point to any relevant change in the respective rights or interests in the Property. Plaintiff's argument that a transfer occurred, based on the idea that a transfer includes the failure to make an allegedly required transfer, if accepted, would open a bankruptcy trustee's avoiding power to almost unlimited ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For all of the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege a transfer as a matter of law, and therefore the amended complaint's first claim is DISMISSED. Because the amended complaint's second and third claims are contingent on the first claim, those claims are also dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    This approach is apparent in docket number 21, page 3, where Plaintiff distinguishes\n    <em>\n     Sequoia Partners\n    </em>\n    by stating: the fundamental difference between the two cases if that B of A was required by court order to reconvey, whereas the\n    <em>\n     Sequoia Partners\n    </em>\n    lienholder was not.\" While such a distinction, if correct, would be of practical or equitable importance, it is impossible to ground that distinction in the plain language of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
