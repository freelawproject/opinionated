Counsel was the Debtor's second lawyer to appear in this case, after the first lawyer's motion to withdraw was granted. Perkins Coie was representing the Debtor\n   <em>\n    pro bono\n   </em>\n   in this case. On October 23, 2018, Perkins Coie moved to withdraw as counsel for the Debtor because of irreconcilable differences. On November 21, 2018, Perkins Coie' motion to withdraw was granted. The Debtor-Defendant now appears in this case\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .

Aspire filed an opposition to the Motion. (\"Opposition,\" ECF Doc. # 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Case Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Aspire made three loans to Robinson's wholly owned taxi companies: Nine T Thirty One Shearn Corporation (\"9T31\"), 5584 Chicago Corporation (\"5584\") and 2331 Chicago Corporation (\"2331,\" and with 9T31 and 5584, each a \"Company\" and collectively, the \"Companies\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, 15, 17.) In December 2013 and January 2014, Robinson caused each Company to take a loan from Aspire and secured by an interest in the Company's property, including vehicles, medallions, moneys, accounts and receivables. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 15, 17.) Robinson personally guaranteed the repayment and other obligations of each Company under the loan documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17.) The 9T31 loan required monthly payments of $3,890.17, and the 2331 and 5584 loans each required monthly payments of $1,082.27. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) By May 2016, Aspire served notice of defaults and acceleration for each of the loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about October 19, 2016, Aspire filed an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Robinson and 9T31 for replevin of collateral owned by 9T31 consisting of a New York City taxi medallion and vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Aspire submitted a motion for an order of seizure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Days later, Debtor filed the chapter 7 petition (\"Petition\") in an apparent bid to block the state court from granting Aspire replevin of the collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Aspire commenced this adversary proceeding objecting to the Debtor's discharge under sections 727(a)(2)(A), 727(a)(3), 727(a)(4)(A), 727(a)(4)(D), 727(a)(5), and 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Complaint contains the following factual allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (i) Debtor evaded Aspire's security interest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (ii) Debtor's petition and schedules are materially false;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (iii) Debtor gave materially false testimony at the section 341 meeting;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (iv) Debtor failed to keep books and records;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (v) Debtor transferred funds representing Aspire's collateral; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (vi) Debtor converted and encumbered Aspire's collateral.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Robinson moves to dismiss all six claims for relief in the Complaint under Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Mot. at 5.) Robinson argues that the Complaint against her should be dismissed for two reasons. First, the factual assertions are barebones; Aspire's vague assertions fail to specifically request a piercing of the corporate veil, and Aspire merely copies and pastes into the Complaint the entirety of the Bankruptcy Code sections that allegedly have been violated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Second, Robinson contends that the Complaint fails to allege that she intended to violate sections 523(a)(6) and 727(a), a necessary element of those sections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

S.D.N.Y. May 13, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Robinson's attack on Aspire's first claim for relief under section 727(a)(2)(A) centers on the assertion that Aspire should have requested a piercing of the corporate veil in the Complaint. (Mot. at 12.) Specifically, Robinson argues that \"since all of Plaintiff's claims rely upon the\n   <em>\n    Corporations' disposition\n   </em>\n   of Plaintiff's alleged collateral, and the Plaintiff did not plead to pierce the corporate veil, the Complaint must be dismissed in its entirety for failure to state a plausible cause of action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). In the Opposition, Aspire partially addresses this argument by pointing out that not all of Aspire's claims depend on the Companies' disposition of Aspire's alleged collateral. (Opp'n at 17.) Specifically, allegations that Robinson concealed her property-as opposed to the Companies' property-can survive Robinson's motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To the extent that Aspire's Opposition addresses the veil-piercing argument, Aspire's argument is more convincing. Indeed, in addition to the conversion of collateral by the Companies, the Complaint alleges with sufficient specificity that Robinson concealed her status as a shareholder of a cooperative apartment, a personal investment account, 100% ownership of Three Two Nine Corp., receipt of governmental assistance, and a $50,000 claim against her ex-husband. (Compl. \u00b6 21A-S.) All of these properties constitute \"property of the debtor\" as that term is used in section 727(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Robinson's veil-piercing argument is also unavailing.

The Complaint adequately does so. First, the Complaint sets forth allegations that Robinson made false statements under oath in the Petition and schedules, the Creditor's Meeting, and Rule 2004 examinations. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 21-24.) These factual allegations are sufficiently specific.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15-17.) This suggests that Robinson knew of Aspire's security interest in the collateral and was aware of her obligation to obtain Aspire's permission prior to the sale or encumberment. Moreover, after defaults on the loans, Robinson changed her course of conduct; she no longer remitted business receipts, allegedly part of Aspire's collateral, to Aspire on a monthly basis. Instead, she transferred these business receipts elsewhere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Here, malice can be implied because Robinson allegedly deviated from her contractual duty to remit business receipts to Aspire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Because the Complaint pleads factual allegations related to section 523(a)(6) with sufficient specificity, the Motion with respect to the sixth claim for relief is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Motion to Dismiss each claim for relief is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
