BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor is the owner of The Crossings Mall in Elkview, West Virginia. It is a multi-tenant commercial property consisting of about 200,000 square feet. Public access to it is limited to a bridge over Little Sandy Creek. Elswick, doing business as Anytime Fitness, operates a 24-hour, 7-day a week fitness center at The Crossings Mall since executing a July 1, 2013 lease agreement with the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Crossings Mall was previously an asset of Interstate Properties, LLC. In October 2012, that entity filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the Northern District of Georgia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2013 UBS Real Estate Securities, Inc. (\"UBS\") agreed to refinance The Crossings Mall for about $14 million on certain conditions, including that the borrower, which is the Debtor in this case, was to be an affiliate or wholly owned subsidiary of Interstate Properties' principal, Mr. Abruzzino. In addition, the Debtor had to be a single-purpose entity that was prohibited from engaging in any business activity other than owning The Crossings Mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To close the refinancing, UBS loaned the Debtor $13,650,000 on or about September 17, 2013. UBS subsequently assigned the loan to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for Comm2013 CCRE 12 Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, and in 2017, that entity assigned the loan to Comm2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the parties' loan agreement, interest accrues at 6.34%, the default rate is 5% higher, the monthly debt service is $84,846.02 (excluding taxes, insurance, and capital reserves), and the stated maturity date is October 6, 2023.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The loan agreement is secured by a deed of trust, and it also required the execution of several other documents, including the Assignment of Leases and Rents, the Cash Management Agreement, and the Management Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Regarding the payment of tenant rents, the parties established the Clearing Account, which was under the sole dominion and control of Comm2013 and its servicer. All rents paid by the tenants of The Crossings Mall were paid directly to the Clearing Account and not to the Debtor or its management company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Clearing Account was swept daily and any funds in it were placed in the Cash Management Account, which was also under the sole dominion and control of Comm2013 and its servicer. The Debtor had no independent ability to make withdrawals. The Cash Management Account contained multiple subaccounts, including accounts for taxes, insurance, debt service, capital expenditures, and operating expenses. Comm2013 was also the Debtor's irrevocable attorney in fact with full power of substitution to exercise the Debtor's rights in the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Capital Expenditures Fund in the Cash Management Account consisted of a monthly payment of $3,493.62 to pay for capital expenditures approved by Comm2013, the approval for which \"shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\" (Document No. 19-2, p. 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding the tenant leases, the Debtor absolutely and unconditionally assigned all of them to Comm2013. The assignment was absolute and was not an assignment\n   for additional security. Comm2013 also retained an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest to collect and receive rents and, upon default, to incur expenses to operate and maintain the property, including exercising all rights and powers of the Debtor with respect to the leases. Property management was governed by a Management Agreement dated September 2, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In negotiating its rent, Elswick agreed to pay a minimum rent of $3,750 per month, plus an insurance contribution of $62.50, a common area maintenance contribution of $203 and a tax contribution of $270.83, for a total monthly payment of $4,286.33. Elswick deposited its monthly rent in the Clearing Account maintained by Comm2013's servicer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2016, the Debtor's management company obtained a quote for $9,200 to \"replace a drop inlet culvert at the entrance of the Crossings Mall in Elkview.\" (Document No. 1, p. 64). In a subsequent email to Comm2013's loan servicer, the Debtor's property manager related that if this matter \"is not resolved immediately the only entrance to the center could collapse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 22, 2016, the servicer responded that it first wanted an explanation of why rent rolls were below the expected receipts. Collected rents were between $89,000 and $96,000 a month, and the scheduled rent was $128,420.80. Ultimately, the servicer did not release the requested funds for the culvert repair. In June 2016, the bridge running across the culvert washed away in a flood. In a July 28, 2016 letter from the Debtor's attorney to Comm2013's loan servicer, the Debtor stated that a new bridge would cost between $750,000 and $1 million. Comm2013 refused to fund the additional expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Elswick states that the loss of the bridge resulted in numerous individuals being stranded at The Crossings Mall and significant business losses for tenants. On April 5, 2017, Elswick filed its proof of claim in the amount of $1 million. On May 22, 2017, it amended its proof of claim listing the amount as \"undetermined.\" Comm2013 filed its proof of claim on February 27, 2017, in an amount exceeding $17 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 9, 2018, the Debtor filed its objection to Comm2013's proof of claim. (Document No. 538 in Case No. 17-bk-57). Among other things, the Debtor states that Comm2013 had an obligation to fund repairs to the culvert, the Debtor had no independent ability as a single purpose entity without revenue to make the repairs that were under Comm2013's \"assumed actual participatory control,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48), and Comm2013's refusal to release funds to make the necessary repairs would have prevented the bridge from washing away in the flood. The Debtor further details Comm2013's alleged failure to make repairs after the flood and alleges that its refusal to release capital expenditure funds was in bad faith and in breach of its loan agreement. Then, the Debtor alleges that it and Comm2013 had a \"special relationship\" that makes Comm2013 liable in tort for property damages, economic losses, and which entitles the Debtor to equitably subordinate Comm2013's \"claim to every other claim in the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In a separate adversary proceeding, on July 20, 2018, the Debtor filed a third-party complaint and second amended counterclaim against Comm2013. (Adv. P. No. 18-ap-10, Document No. 72). Among other things, the Debtor alleges causes of action against Comm2013 for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference with business relationships with respect to the Debtor's tenants. These allegations are based on alleged\n   facts that are substantially the same as those raised by Elswick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Comm2013 asserts that Elswick lacks standing to assert that Comm2013's proof of claim should be recharacterized or subordinated. In resolving Comm2013's standing argument, the court will examine Elswick's constitutional, prudential, and statutory standing. Then, the court will consider whether allowing Elswick to separately assert these claims furthers the expeditious and efficient administration of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To assert a cause of action, a litigant must have constitutional standing, which requires that there be an injury-in-fact, traceable to the alleged conduct of the defendant, and which is subject to redress by the courts.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

As stated by Professor Pathak, statutory standing is not a threshold question equal to constitutional or prudential standing; rather, it is merely a \"useful shorthand\" for the proposition that the \"plaintiff must fall within the class of plaintiffs to whom Congress has made the cause of action available in order to recover.\" 62 Okla.

Elswick's Standing to Assert a Recharacterization Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Recharacterization generally occurs when a party asserts that a loan was made but the original circumstances of the loan compels treating the advance not as debt but as equity. 4\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 510.02[3] (2018). Thus, recharacterization cases determine whether a debt exists that can be asserted on a proof of claim, or whether it is an equity interest asserted by a proof of interest.\n   <em>\n    Fairchild Dornier GmbH v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors (In re Dornier Aviation (N. Am.), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336093,5858846\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/225/\">\n    453 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (4th Cir. 2006). \"Recharacterization is a definitional attack.\"\n   <em>\n    FCC v.

Thus, Elswick has constitutional standing to request recharacterization of Comm2013 proof of claim because: (1) Elswick has asserted an unsecured claim\n   against the Debtor's bankruptcy estate and the payment on that claim may be non-existent, or reduced, based on the existence of Comm2013's alleged secured claim against the Debtor's bankruptcy estate; (2) Elswick's injury - a potential inability-receiving less than a 100% payment from the bankruptcy estate - is directly traceable to Comm2013's classification of the amount owed to it as debt; and (3) the injury is subject to redress by the court because the court has the equitable power to recharacterize Comm2013's debt claim as an equity interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similarly, Elswick has prudential standing to assert a claim for recharacterization because Elswick is asserting rights that are associated with its direct damages resulting from the loss of access to The Crossings Mall. The bankruptcy court has the equitable power to recharacterize Comm2013's proof of claim as an equity contribution so that Elswick can receive a greater distribution from the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regarding Elswick's statutory standing to bring a cause of action for recharacterization, the court notes that there is no express cause of action in the Bankruptcy Code for recharacterization, which is essentially an objection to a claim on the basis that it is an equity interest.\n   <em>\n    In re Protea Biosciences, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-1200,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205734464\">\n    2018 WL 5734464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2018 Bankr.

Oct. 13, 2011).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In this case, to show a particularized injury, Elswick asserts that it has a lease with the Debtor that required it to pay amounts in addition to the minimum rent for the maintenance of the common areas of The Crossings Mall. Comm2013 controlled how the rents were distributed. When the Debtor's management company made a request for funds to repair a culvert in January 2016, Comm2013 did not fund that request. When a subsequent flood washed away the only bridge access to The Crossings Mall, Elswick asserts that it suffered a particularized injury because it suffered business damages as a result of the flood and collecting a monthly amount from it for common area maintenance and then failing to use those funds for their promised purpose is a violation of its individual lease agreement. Elswick also asserts that Comm2013 had independent duties to all customers, employees, licensees, and invitees located at the Crossings Mall; however, in its prayer for relief it only requests that Comm2013's loan be subordinated to its unsecured claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In the Debtor's bankruptcy case, in addition to the claims scheduled by the Debtor, eighty proofs of claim have been filed, most of which are related to damages sustained after the loss of bridge access to The Crossings Mall. There appear to be a few claims unrelated to the loss of the bridge, such as a tax claim, and an unpaid water bill.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Also, the Debtor has already filed its own objection to Comm2013's proof of claim asserting, among other things, that Comm2013's claim should be equitably subordinated. The grounds alleged by the Debtor to support its equitable subordination argument are substantially similar to the grounds asserted by Elswick. More specifically, the Debtor alleges that Comm2013 failed in its duty to authorize funding to repair the culvert under the bridge and as a result of its alleged inequitable conduct, Comm2013's claim \"should be equitably subordinated to every other claim in the case.\" (Case No. 17-bk-57, Document No. 538, \u00b6\u00b6 48-52). In addition, the Debtor has asserted causes of action against Comm2013 in its Third Party Complaint and Second Amended Counterclaim whereby the Debtor alleges causes of action for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference with business relationship - all of which arise out of the same operative facts that give rise to Elswick's claim for equitable subordination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Of course, the Debtor is not a party to this adversary proceeding and therefore has not had an opportunity to be heard on whether Elswick should be allowed to proceed on its claim for equitable subordination, or what kind of case management, if any, the Debtor desires in the administration of its estate.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Consequently, the court will deny Comm2013's motion to dismiss Elswick's claim for equitable subordination on grounds of standing, and will\n    direct Elswick to file a motion in the Debtor's main bankruptcy case seeking authority from the court, on notice to the Debtor, to pursue its claim for equitable subordination in this adversary proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
