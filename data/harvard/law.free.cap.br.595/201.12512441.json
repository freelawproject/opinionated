On August 14, 2014, Debtors' son, Matthew Gaither, died in an aviation accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. On January 8, 2015, the Charleston County Probate Court named Debtors the personal representatives of Matthew's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. On January 26, 2015, Debtors filed a lawsuit against Coastal Aviation, Inc. and William Peterson for the damages resulting from Matthew's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. On May 6, 2015, the Charleston County Court of Common Pleas approved a settlement of $1.3 million in favor of Debtors. The net recovery of the settlement totaled $830,183.67 (\"Settlement Proceeds\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. On the same day, Debtors disclaimed their rights to the Settlement Proceeds. As a result, the Settlement Proceeds passed to Debtors' three surviving children, and each child received $276,727.89-a one-third interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. The surviving children subsequently formed ZJB, LLC (the \"LLC\") and deposited the Settlement Proceeds in an account owned by the LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   7. Debtors filed their chapter 7 bankruptcy case on March 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   8. In an amended proof of claim, the Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") claimed Debtors owed the federal government a total of $787,239.85.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the total amount, the IRS listed $332,023.52 as the total amount of secured claims and $455,216.33 as the total amount of unsecured claims.

On August 17, 2018, Trustee filed an objection to Defendants' Motion. [Docket No. 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   12.

Additionally, the Court permitted Defendants to file a final supplemental reply and Trustee to respond to Defendants' final supplemental reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   14. On November 2, 2018, Trustee filed a supplemental response to Defendants' Reply. [Docket No. 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   15.

Dismissal is appropriate under Rule 12(b)(1) where the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. A party bringing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) contends that the complaint fails to state facts upon which jurisdiction can be founded. When a defendant brings a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove jurisdiction, and the court must regard the allegations in the pleadings as \"mere evidence on the issue, and may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R.

To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must provide \"more than mere labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Defendants rely on two assertions in support of this argument: (1) the FDCPA does not apply to the IRS because the IRS must abide by the Internal Revenue Code, and (2) only the federal government may utilize the FDCPA, and thus a trustee standing in the shoes of the IRS may not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1) The FDCPA Applies to the IRS.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants argue that the FDCPA does not apply to the IRS because the IRS must abide by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in collecting debts. Specifically, Defendants argue that \u00a7 6901 of the Internal Revenue Code sets forth the procedures the IRS must follow to collect unpaid taxes owed by a transferor of assets, and thus the FDCPA does not apply. Defendants cite to a list of authorities in support of their assertion that the FDCPA does not apply to the IRS;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the cases Defendants referenced in their briefs are not analogous to the present case and do not support Defendants' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    McKean v.

The majority of courts interpreting \"applicable law\" in the context of \u00a7 544(b)(1) have come to this conclusion.
