Limited. The Complaint alleges that Montco is entitled to recover unpaid amounts owed to Montco for performing plugging and abandonment services, damages associated with performing additional, unanticipated decommissioning work, and damages arising from alleged misrepresentations and omissions surrounding the work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Black Elk and Nippon moved to dismiss Montco's Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8 and 9. Black Elk and Nippon alternatively argue that Montco's claims fail as a matter of law or are barred by Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nippon's Motion to Dismiss Claim I of Montco's Second Amended Complaint as it refers to Nippon is granted. Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Claim I of Montco's Second Amended Complaint as to Black Elk is denied as to Job 2, EC 33 CF. Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Claim I of Montco's Second Amended Complaint as to Black Elk is granted as to all other jobs. Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is granted as to Montco's false, misleading, and incomplete information claim; failure to pay claim; and Turnkey Job Price and Incentive Fee claim. Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is denied as to the indemnity claim. Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count IV of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 11, 2015, three creditors filed an involuntary chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against Black Elk. (Case No. 15-34287, ECF No. 1). Black Elk filed its consent to the Order for Relief and a motion to convert its involuntary chapter 7 case to a voluntary chapter 11 case on August 31,\n   2015. (Case No. 15-34287, ECF Nos. 68, 69). The Court subsequently granted Black Elk's motion. (Case No. 15-34287, ECF No. 75). Montco, a Louisiana limited liability company, is a project management, engineering, and oilfield personnel service provider and general contractor. (ECF No. 33 at 2). As part of the confirmation of Black Elk's chapter 11 plan, Montco and Black Elk entered into a Turnkey Service Agreement (the \"Black Elk Contract\"), which the Court subsequently approved. (Case No. 15-34287, ECF No. 682).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the Black Elk Contract, Montco agreed to perform the plugging and abandonment work on Black Elk's offshore oil and gas sites in order to bring those sites into conformance with federal regulations. (ECF No. 33-2 at 2). The Black Elk Contract listed specific jobs that Montco was required to complete. (ECF No. 33-2 at 21-22). In exchange for completing these jobs, Montco would be paid a turn-key price for each obligation it completed, \"regardless of the actual fees, costs and expenses incurred.\" (ECF No. 33-2 at 3). Montco would receive payment upon the release of proceeds from surety bonds securing or cash collateral collateralizing Black Elk's plugging and abandonment obligations on its sites. (ECF No. 33-2 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two amendments-dated May 26, 2016, and June 11, 2016-supplemented the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33-3; ECF No. 33-4). The first amendment added Jobs 19, 20, and 21 to the list of jobs to be completed by Montco as part of its responsibilities under the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33-3 at 3). The second amendment added Jobs 22, 23, 24, and 25 to the list of jobs for Montco to complete. (ECF No. 33-4 at 4). Both amendments provided a funding mechanism to pay Montco for its services on these additional jobs. (ECF No. 33-3 at 4; ECF No. 33-4 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon approval of the Black Elk Contract, Montco commenced its plugging and abandonment work on the Black Elk job sites. (ECF No. 33 at 17). Montco's services included: make-safe operations for preparing personnel platforms; the investigation of job sites for well intervention, and well plugging and abandonment spreads in order to abandon all wells; the investigation of job sites with additional equipment to clean vessels and prepare platforms for decommissioning; the deconstruction of platforms; the extraction of objects from the Gulf of Mexico; the employment of vessels to trawl each site; and the filing of end-of-operations reports with the federal government for site clearance. (ECF No. 33 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the course of performing under the Black Elk Contract, Montco alleges that it encountered undisclosed wells, abandoned equipment, and structures vastly different than those described in the Black Elk Contract, Black Elk and Nippon's disclosures during contract negotiations, and government or publicly available records. (ECF No. 33 at 6-7). These liabilities consequently required Montco to perform substantial amounts of unanticipated work in order for Black Elk's Job sites to be lawfully decommissioned. (ECF No. 33 at 6). Montco allegedly notified Black Elk of these unanticipated liabilities and resulting work through daily reports and summaries. (ECF No. 33 at 7). Black Elk purportedly did not object to Montco completing this unanticipated work. Black Elk, however, refuses to pay Montco for this work. (ECF No. 33 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Montco also claims that it identified and undertook work on various Black Elk job sites to manage uncontrolled well flows, as well as the cleaning and disposal of natural and human-made hazardous materials and waste. (ECF No. 33 at 6). These issues with the job sites also required Montco to\n   take actions beyond those listed in the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33 at 6). These issues were not disclosed to Montco at the time the parties negotiated and executed the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33 at 6). However, Montco asserts that Black Elk agreed to indemnify it for such unanticipated work under Sections 7.9.4 and 7.9.8 of the Black Elk Contract because such problems are impossible to predict in advance for purposes of a turn-key contract for plugging and abandonment work. (ECF No. 33 at 13-14; ECF No. 33-2 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 17, 2017, Montco filed its own chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. (Case No. 17-31646). On May 18, 2017, Montco filed this adversary proceeding seeking to recover amounts allegedly due to it under the Black Elk Contract, as well as damages associated with its unanticipated work. (ECF No. 1). The \"Defendants\" in Montco's suit included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Black Elk, the owner and operator of the oil drilling platforms and oil wells upon which Montco worked. (ECF No. 33 at 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The Black Elk Trust, the liquidating trust for Black Elk's bankruptcy estate. (ECF No. 33 at 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Richard S. Schmidt, the Trustee to the Black Elk Trust. (ECF No. 33 at 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 W &amp; T Offshore Inc., an independent oil and natural gas acquisition, exploitation, and exploration company. (ECF No. 33 at 3). W &amp; T was a predecessor in title to various Job sites covered by the two amendments to the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 62 at 5). Under the amendments, W &amp; T expressly agreed to a limited, conditional payment obligation to Montco. (ECF No. 33-3 at 4; ECF No. 33-4 at 4-5; ECF No. 62 at 5-6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 McMoRan Oil &amp; Gas LLC, an oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production company. (ECF No. 33 at 3). McMoRan holds a working interest in one Job site covered by the first amendment to the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No.62 at 5). Under the two amendments to the Black Elk Contract, McMoRan expressly agreed to a limited, conditional payment obligation to Montco. (ECF No. 33-3 at 4; ECF No. 62 at 5-6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Energy XXI GOM, LLC, an owner and operator of oil and gas properties. (ECF No. 33 at 3). Montco categorizes Energy XXI as a working interest holder because it co-owns interests in Job sites with Black Elk. (ECF No. 103 at 3). Energy XXI's plugging and abandonment obligations with respect to its co-owned sites are secured by surety bonds issued by Westchester Fire Insurance Company, the surety, on behalf of Energy XXI, the principal, in favor of BOEM, the obligee. (ECF No. 103 at 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Argonaut Insurance Company, a specialty property and casualty insurance, reinsurance, and managed risk solutions company. (ECF No. 33 at 3). Argonaut executed performance bonds on behalf of Black Elk and other various obligees to secure performance of plugging and abandonment obligations on Black Elk job sites. (ECF No. 103 at 3-4). The completion of Montco's services on various sites triggers certain payment obligations of Argonaut due to Montco. (ECF No. 33 at 6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Westchester Fire Insurance Company, a fire and casualty insurance company. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Westchester executed performance bonds\n   to fund Energy XXI's share of the decommissioning costs on two Black Elk Job sites. (ECF No. 63 at 2). Westchester agreed to release its collateral under the two bonds to Montco once Montco completed the decommissioning work on the sites and BOEM released Westchester's bonds. (ECF No. 63 at 2-3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Energy Resources Technology GOM, LLC, an oil and gas exploration, generation, production and development company. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Montco categorizes Energy Resources as a working interest party. (ECF No. 33 at 5). Pursuant to Section 2 of the of the second amendment, Energy Resources agreed to pay Montco for its services on two separate Black Elk job sites within 45 days once these jobs were completed and Energy Resources received performance reports. (ECF No. 33-4 at 4; ECF No. 104 at 2-3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Fairways Offshore Exploration, Inc., an oil and gas exploration and development company. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Montco categorizes Fairways as a working interest party whose interest falls under the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33 at 5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Fieldwood Energy LLC, an oil and gas acquisition and development company. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Fieldwood was a co-working interest owner with Black Elk on one Job site covered by the second amendment to the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33-4 at 4-5; ECF No. 105 at 6-7). Fieldwood signed the second amendment for the purpose of funding its respective working interest share of the decommissioning work on the Job site; Fieldwood did not assume any other liabilities or obligations beyond payment of the decommissioning work on the site upon which it held a working interest. (ECF No. 105 at 7).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 JX Nippon Oil Exploration U.S.A. Limited, an oil and gas exploration, development, and production company. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Montco categorizes Nippon as a legacy owner because it previously owned interests in Black Elk job sites. (ECF No. 103 at 3). Argonaut, among other sureties, executed performance bonds on behalf of Black Elk, the principal, in favor of Nippon, the obligee, to secure performance of plugging and abandonment obligations on the sites previously owned by Nippon. (ECF No. 103 at 3-4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Merit Energy Company, L.L.C., a private equity firm specializing in the acquisition, operation, and development of oil and gas properties. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Montco categorizes Merit as a legacy owner of Black Elk Job sites. (ECF No. 33 at 5). Merit is not a signatory party to either amendment to the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 62 at 6).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Maritech Resources, Inc., an acquirer, developer, and producer of oil and gas. (ECF No. 33 at 4). Montco categorizes Maritech as a legacy owner of Black Elk Job sites. (ECF No. 33 at 5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Travelers Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, a commercial property casualty and personal insurance underwriter. (ECF No. 33 at 5). Travelers, as surety, executed a bond covering the plugging and abandonment obligations on a Black Elk job site. (ECF No. 98 at 4). The bond listed the United States acting through BOEM. (ECF No. 98 at 4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 The Doe Defendants, purported legacy owners or other parties interested\n   in the wells and job sites subject to Montco's Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 33 at 5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   W &amp; T, Nippon, Merit, Maritech, and the Doe Defendants are collectively referred to as the \"Legacy Owners.\" McMoRan, Energy XXI, Energy Resources, Fairways, and Fieldwood are collectively referred to as the \"Working Interest Parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Montco's Amended Complaint asserted six claims against the Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (i) Count I. A breach of contract claim against Black Elk, Argonaut, and the other signatories to the Black Elk Contract's amendments based upon those Defendants' failure to remit payment to Montco for the work it completed pursuant to the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 33 at 24).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (ii) Count II. A breach of contract claim against Black Elk and W &amp; T for failure to indemnify Montco under the Black Elk Contract for services performed while controlling wild or uncontrolled wells, as well as the cleaning and disposing of hazardous materials and waste. (ECF No. 33 at 25).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (iii) Count III. A breach of contract claim against all of the Defendants for failing to pay Montco for the extra-contractual work it completed on the Black Elk Job sites. (ECF No. 33 at 26-27).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (iv) Count IV. In the alternative, a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim against all of the Defendants for accepting the benefits of Montco's unanticipated work but failing to pay Montco for such benefits. (ECF No. 33 at 28).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (v) Count V. In the alternative, a misrepresentation claim against all of the Defendants for misrepresentations and omissions of material fact made to Montco during the negotiation and bidding process for the Black Elk Contract regarding the true scope of the work required to plug and abandon the oil wells and structures on the Black Elk Job sites. (ECF No. 33 at 28).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (vi) Count VI. A claim for declaratory judgment of Montco's legal rights and the Defendants' obligations to Montco. (ECF No. 33 at 29-30).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On August 10, 2017, Montco stipulated to the dismissal of Travelers from the adversary proceeding. (ECF No. 111). On August 14, 2017, Montco stipulated to the dismissal of Westchester Fire from the adversary proceeding. (ECF No. 113). The remaining Defendants individually and jointly filed motions to dismiss Montco's Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On August 15, 2017, Montco filed an Omnibus Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss and stipulated to the withdrawal of Count I of its Amended Complaint against all parties, except Black Elk and Argonaut, with prejudice. (ECF No. 115 at 23 n.4). Montco's Omnibus Brief additionally stipulated to the dismissal of Count V of its Amended Complaint against the Working Interest Parties and Argonaut without prejudice. (ECF No. 155 at 43 n.9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the Defendants' motions to dismiss Montco's Amended Complaint on August 21, 2017. During the hearing, the Court stated that Montco was allowed to replead its misrepresentation claim against Defendants as to the additional, unanticipated work it completed pursuant to the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 135 at 58). Additionally, the Court limited Montco's indemnity claim against Black Elk based upon the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 135 at 64-65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On September 11, 2017, the Court took Defendants' Motions to Dismiss Montco's Amended Complaint under advisement. On October 3, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Dismissal Order on the motions to dismiss in which the Court: dismissed Count I of the Amended Complaint as to all Defendants and without prejudice as to Black Elk upon the satisfaction of the conditions to payment; dismissed Count II as to all Defendants except Black Elk; dismissed Counts III, IV, and VI as to all Defendants; and allowed Montco to replead Count V. (ECF No. 146; ECF No. 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Montco filed a Second Amended Complaint on April 2, 2018. (ECF No. 158). Montco's Second Amended Complaint asserts four claims against Black Elk and Nippon:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (i) Count I. A misrepresentation claim against Black Elk and Nippon for misrepresentations and omissions of material fact made to Montco during the negotiation and bidding process for the Black Elk Contract regarding the true scope of the work required to plug and abandon the oil wells and structures on the Black Elk Job sites. (ECF No. 158 at 78-85).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (ii) Count II.

(ECF No. 158 at 86-91).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (iii) Count III. A\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim against Black Elk for accepting the benefits of the work Montco performed under the first and second amendments of the Black Elk Contract that never became effective because the parties did not sign the amendments and Black Elk did not procure their signatures. (ECF No. 158 at 92-97).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (iv) Count IV. A\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim against Black Elk for accepting the benefits of Montco's unanticipated work, but failing to pay Montco for such benefits. (ECF No. 158 at 98-105).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On March 30, 2018, Montco and Maritech agreed that any claims that Montco may have against Maritech were abated until further order of the Court. (ECF No. 157). The remaining Defendants, Black Elk and Nippon, individually and jointly filed Motions to Dismiss Montco's Second Amended Complaint, generally arguing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 Montco's Second Amended Complaint fails to plead the facts and its causes of action with particularity, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 Montco cannot state a plausible claim for its various breach of contract allegations, those claims fail as a matter of law, or those claims are barred by Texas law; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 Montco's\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim is barred because it was previously decided by this Court.

While Montco claims that Black Elk \"reported\" that the two wells were previously permanently plugged and abandoned, it does not provide any further details about the \"reporting,\" nor does it specify when or where this \"reporting\" occurred. Although Montco indicated that \"Maritech, the Legacy Owner of the platform, likewise confirmed to [Montco] before the Black Elk contract was executed that the wells were permanently plugged and abandoned ...\", it again failed to indicate with specificity when and where these misrepresentations were made.

(ECF No. 158 at 53). Montco claims that it relied on this drawing in bidding on the Job. (ECF No. 158 at 53).

However, Montco argues it discovered that the outer casings of well A-5 had 225 psi of sustained casing pressure. (ECF No. 158 at 53). In turn, these alleged misrepresentations materially increased the work required to plug and abandon the well.

Although Montco indicated that \"Legacy Owner Maritech\" had also reported that well A-4 \"had been previously temporarily abandoned and only required conductor removal,\" information that was in line with the communications provided by Black Elk, it similarly makes no indication as to where or when either communication occurred. As to the A-5 well, although Montco provides that the misrepresentations evident in the drawings were further confirmed by a Black Elk memo, it again fails to plead with particularly the time and place of the memo provided to it.

Breach of Contract Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In Count II of its Second Amended Complaint, Montco alleges a breach of contract claim against Black Elk, claiming that: Black Elk materially breached the Black Elk Contract by providing false, misleading, and incomplete information regarding the Jobs, failing to pay amounts due to Montco for completing the Jobs and work regarding wild wells, blowouts, uncontrolled flows, and hazardous materials and waste, and failing to demand payment from its Working Interest Parties, its Legacy Owners, and the issuers of bonds covering the plugging and abandonment work performed by Montco; Black Elk could not lawfully terminate the Black Elk Contract, or refuse to make payments under it because Black Elk had previously breached the contract and frustrated Montco's performance; and because Black Elk materially breached the Black Elk Contract, Montco is contractually permitted to collect the entire Turnkey Job Price and the prorated Incentive Fee pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 158 at 86-91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In its Motion to Dismiss, Black Elk argues that Montco failed to allege or prove that Black Elk received any funds from the sureties or that the applicable obligees for any bond or bonds associated with individual Jobs fully terminated or canceled such bonds without residual liability. (ECF No. 162 at 2). As to Montco's indemnification claims, Black Elk argues that the claims are barred by the plain language of the Black Elk Contract because it only agreed to indemnify Montco from third-party claims arising out of Montco's work regarding wild wells, blowouts, uncontrolled flow, and hazardous materials and waste, not for the work itself. (ECF No. 162 at 2). Lastly, Black Elk argues that Montco failed to prove that it terminated the Black Elk Contract and consequently cannot recover the Turnkey Job Price and Incentive Fee under Section 6.3 of the Contract.

(ECF No. 158 at 86-91). Under Texas law, \"courts interpreting unambiguous contracts are confined to the four corners of the document and cannot look to extrinsic evidence to create ambiguity.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas v. Am.

Instead, Montco claims that Black Elk provided the false, misleading, and incomplete information during contract negotiations and in the bid packages. Black Elk thus could not have breached the Contract on these grounds because there is no provision in the Contract, and Montco points to none, that contained the purported false information that Black Elk could have breached. As such, Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is granted as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    B.

(ECF No. 158 at 86-91). If a plaintiff is required to perform under a contract, then prior to the time the defendant is obligated to perform, the plaintiff must prove that it satisfied every condition precedent before it may assert a claim for breach of contract against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Solar Applications Eng'g, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320887\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/327/104/#p108\">\n    327 S.W.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Pursuant to the Court's Dismissal Order dated October 3, 2017, this claim was dismissed because all conditions precedent necessary to payment were not met. (ECF No. 146). The Court found that every contractual condition for Montco's payment from Black Elk had not been satisfied because Black Elk's obligation to pay Montco for its services under the Black Elk Contract was conditioned upon the release of funds by the sureties, and no such release had occurred. (ECF No. 146). Accordingly, the Court held that Black Elk was excused from its obligation to pay Montco unless Montco carried its burden of proving that all conditions precedent necessary to give rise to a right to payment were met. (ECF No. 146).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In its Second Amended Complaint, Montco fails to allege that the contractual conditions (the release of surety funds) for Montco to receive payment from Black Elk were satisfied. Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is accordingly granted as to the failure to pay claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    C. Indemnity claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Montco next argues that Black Elk breached the Black Elk Contract by failing to indemnify it for services it performed to control wild wells, blowouts, and uncontrolled flows on a Black Elk Job site pursuant to Section 7.9.4 of the Contract. (ECF No. 158 at 40-44, 86-91). Montco argues that Black Elk breached its contractual obligations under Section 7.9.8 of the Black Elk Contract by failing to indemnify it for the cleaning and disposing of hazardous materials and waste. (ECF No. 158 at 40-44, 86-91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In response to Montco's allegations, Black Elk argues that Montco's indemnity claims are barred by the plain language of the Black Elk Contract because it only agreed to indemnify Montco from third party claims arising out of Montco's work regarding wild wells, blowouts, uncontrolled flow, and hazardous materials and waste, not for the work itself, under Sections 7.9.4 and 7.9.8 of the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 162 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In its Memorandum Opinion dated October 3, 2017, the Court denied Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Montco's Amended Complaint as to the indemnity claim. (ECF No. 146). The Court held that Montco's Amended Complaint raised its right to relief against Black Elk as to the indemnity claims beyond a speculative belief because the Amended Complaint included allegations that it performed services to control wild wells, blowouts, and uncontrolled flows on Job sites covered by the Black Elk Contract, as well as to deal with hazardous materials on such sites. (ECF No. 146). Montco pled the same factual allegations to support its indemnity claim in its Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   For the same reasons as stated in the Court's Dismissal Order dated October 3, 2017, Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is denied as to the indemnity claims because Montco stated a plausible breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    D. Failure to pay the Turnkey Job Price and Incentive Fee claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Lastly, Montco claims that it is permitted to collect the entire Turnkey Job Price and the prorated Incentive Fee pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the Black Elk Contract because Black Elk materially breached the Black Elk Contract. (ECF No. 158 at 90). Under Section 6.3, \"[i]f [the] Contractor terminates all or part of a Job because of Company's uncured default, Contractor shall receive (a) the Turnkey Job Price for such terminated Job, ... and (b) the Incentive Fee.\" (ECF No. 158, Ex. 1). Section 6.1 provides a \"Party may terminate [the contract] immediately for fraud ... and in such case, the opportunity to cure shall not apply.\" (ECF No. 158, Ex. 1). Under Section 16.1 of the Black Elk Contract, Montco is defined as \"Contractor.\" (ECF No. 158, Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Black Elk argues that Montco's breach of contract claim for the Turnkey Job Price and Incentive Fee is barred by the plain language of the Black Elk Contract because Montco did not terminate the Black Elk Contract as required under Section 6.3 of the Contract. (ECF No. 162 at 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Section 6.3 of the Black Elk Contract required Montco to \"terminate\" the Contract in order to receive the Turnkey Job Price and Incentive Fee. However, Montco only claims that the Black Elk trustee terminated the Black Elk Contract in its Second Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 158 at 76). Therefore, Black Elk cannot recover the Turnkey Job Price and Incentive Fee pursuant to the explicit language of the Black Elk Contract because Montco did not \"terminate\" the Contract. Thus, Black Elk's Motion to Dismiss Count II of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is granted as to the turnkey job price and incentive fee claim because Montco did not state a plausible breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count III. Quantum Meruit - First and Second Amendments to the Black Elk Contract claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Montco argues that it performed work pursuant to the \"unexecuted\" First and Second Amendments to the Black Elk Contract that benefitted Black Elk. (ECF No. 158 at 92-97). Montco claims that the Amendments never became effective because the parties thereto did not sign the Amendments, and Black Elk did not procure their signatures. (ECF No. 158 at 92-97). Montco voluntarily dismissed Count III of its Second Amended Complaint pursuant to its Motion to Dismiss filed on June 14, 2018. (ECF No. 167). The Court accordingly does not address this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count IV. Quantum Meruit - Additional Work claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Under Count VI of the Second Amended Complaint, Montco alleges a claim of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against Black Elk. (ECF No. 158 at 98-105). Montco specifically argues that it conferred a benefit upon Black Elk by performing additional, undisclosed work on Black Elk Job sites in order to properly decommission those sites. (ECF No. 158 at 102). Montco claims that it did not know, nor could it have known, about the unanticipated issues it discovered at the Black Elk Job Sites. (ECF No. 158 at 99). While completing this additional but unanticipated work, Montco states it provided daily reports on its work to Black Elk. (ECF No. 158 at 101). Ultimately, Black Elk accepted the benefits of Montco's unanticipated work on the Job sites but failed to compensate Montco for its work. (ECF No. 158 at 103). As such, Montco claims Black Elk was unjustly enriched to its detriment. (ECF No. 158 at 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Black Elk moves to dismiss Count IV primarily on the ground that it is barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   Black Elk claims that Count IV of Montco's Second Amended Complaint is identical to Count IV of Montco's Amended Complaint, which the Court dismissed pursuant to its Dismissal Order dated October 3, 2017.
