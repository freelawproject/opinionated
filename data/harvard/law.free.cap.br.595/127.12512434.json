Pryor Esq., to the homestead exemption claimed by the debtor in her residence located at 17 Laurelton Avenue, Lake Grove, New York (\"Lake Grove Property\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   New York Debtor and Creditor Law \u00a7 282,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 5206,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b). Specifically, the trustee asserts that the debtor cannot claim a homestead exemption because prior to filing her bankruptcy case she entered into a contract to sell the Lake Grove Property. This, according to the trustee, establishes that the debtor did not intend to permanently reside at the Lake Grove Property on the date she filed for bankruptcy, a prerequisite, he asserts,\n   to claiming a homestead exemption under \u00a7 522(b)(3) and CPLR \u00a7 5206. Although the debtor acknowledges that she entered into a contract to sell the Lake Grove Property, she takes a different view of the applicable statutory requirement. The debtor argues that the Lake Grove Property was her principal residence on the date she filed her bankruptcy petition and nothing in CPLR \u00a7 5206(a) requires that a debtor manifest an intent for long-term or permanent residency beyond the petition date as a condition precedent to claiming the homestead exemption. The debtor therefore contends that she is entitled to the claimed homestead exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and the Standing Order of Reference entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), dated August 28, 1986, as amended by Order dated December 5, 2012, effective\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   as of June 23, 2011.

Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 24, 2016, the debtor filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition together with all of the required schedules and statements. [dkt. no. 1]. In her schedule A/B (property), she identified as her only real property her residence at 17 Laurelton Avenue, Lake Grove, New York, i.e., the Lake Grove Property. In schedule C (property claimed as exempt), the debtor claimed a homestead exemption under CPLR \u00a7 5206 in the Lake Grove Property in the amount of $125,713. [dkt. no. 1]. The trustee filed an objection to the debtor's claimed homestead exemption and subsequently moved to assume a contract to sell the Lake Grove Property entered into by the debtor prepetition. [dkt. nos. 11 and 12]. The debtor opposed. [dkt. no. 19]. At the initial hearing on the trustee's objection, the trustee argued for the first time that the debtor's interpretation of the New York homestead exemption law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. At the Court's direction, the parties filed supplemental pleadings on the trustee's Fourteenth Amendment claim. [dkt. nos. 24 and 25]. The trustee served a copy of his Memorandum of Law and Notice of Claim of Unconstitutionality Pursuant to E.D.N.Y. LBR 9005-1 upon the Attorney General of the State of New York (\"NY Attorney General\"). [dkt. no. 26]. The Court also certified the matter to the NY Attorney General, setting a deadline for the NY Attorney General to intervene should it choose to do so. [dkt. no. 31]. The NY Attorney General did not intervene nor file any response to the trustee's claim of unconstitutionality. The parties then continued to file unsolicited pleadings and responses. [dkt. nos. 35, 36, 38, 40, 41, 42, and 44]. The Court held a status conference on February 6, 2018 and\n   requested additional briefing on the effect of the contract to sell the Lake Grove Property and the purported termination of that contract by the buyer. The parties timely submitted their respective pleadings. [dkt. nos. 47, 48, and 51]. Once the issues were fully briefed, the Court held oral argument on March 6, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B. Factual Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As noted above, on June 24, 2016, the debtor filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and all of the required schedules and statements. [dkt. no. 1]. On page 2 of the debtor's bankruptcy petition, in response to question 5 (where you live), she listed the Lake Grove Property. In response to question 6 (venue) on page 2 of her bankruptcy petition, the debtor represented that for the 180-day period prior to the filing of the petition, she has lived in this district longer than in any other district. Additionally, in response to question 2 in her statement of financial affairs, the debtor stated that during the three-year period prior to the petition date she has lived solely at the Lake Grove Property. In schedule A/B (property), the debtor listed as her only real property her residence, i.e., the Lake Grove Property, with a current value of $366,371. The Lake Grove Property is encumbered by a mortgage held by Island Federal Credit Union having a balance as of the petition date of $240,658.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   schedule D (secured claims). In schedule C (property claimed as exempt), the debtor claimed a homestead exemption under \u00a7 522(b)(3) and CPLR \u00a7 5206 in the amount of $125,713, the difference between the value listed for the Lake Grove Property in schedule A/B and the amount of the mortgage debt listed in schedule D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the petition date, the debtor had negotiated a contract to sell the Lake Grove Property for $389,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Residential Contract of Sale. [dkt. no. 12-2]. The contract provided for a $20,000 down payment which the debtor has acknowledged receiving, and a closing date of June 1, 2016. The contract of sale was not listed by the debtor in her schedule G (executory contracts and unexpired leases), and the copy provided to the Court is not dated nor signed by the debtor. Accounting for the debtor's mortgage obligation as of the petition date ($240,658), a sale of the Lake Grove Property for $389,000 would result in gross proceeds of $148,342 prior to any closing costs. The sale of the Lake Grove Property did not occur prior to the petition date and the purchaser has since terminated the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor has returned the downpayment to the purchaser. Because the sale did not close before the debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, there is no question that the debtor resided at the Lake Grove Property as of the petition date and has continued to reside there during the pendency of her chapter 7 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C. The Trustee's Objection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trustee contends that in order for the debtor to claim a homestead exemption in her principal residence under CPLR \u00a7 5206(a), she must show (i) ownership, (ii) occupancy, and (iii) an intent to reside there permanently. In the trustee's view, the debtor cannot establish the third element\n   because by entering into a contract prepetition to sell her home, she lacks the requisite intent to reside at the property on a permanent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trustee also contends that the New York State exemption law as set forth in CPLR \u00a7 5206(a) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause directs that \"all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    473 U.S. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute on other grounds.\n   </em>\n   The focus of the trustee's Fourteenth Amendment claim is that a debtor claiming a homestead exemption in the cash proceeds from a voluntary sale of her home is treated differently from a similarly situated debtor who elects not to claim an exemption in her home, but rather opts to claim the more limited cash exemption provided under NYDCL \u00a7 283(2). The trustee argues that the homestead exemption under CPLR \u00a7 5206 is meant to preserve a debtor's homestead from an involuntary seizure by a judgment creditor, not to protect cash proceeds from a voluntary sale of a debtor's home. The trustee notes that NYDCL \u00a7 283(2) limits the cash exemption to $5,000 for a debtor who does not own real property and therefore exempts cash or, despite owning a homestead, elects not to claim the homestead exemption. In the trustee's view, no rational basis exists to allow a debtor to claim a homestead exemption of $165,550\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the cash proceeds from the voluntary sale of her home. To do so, he alleges, treats a selling debtor differently from other similarly-situated debtors who opt to exempt cash, rather than claim the homestead exemption. Those claiming the cash exemption are capped at $5,000, a far cry from the amount a debtor may claim as a homestead exemption. The selling debtor is thus able to exempt cash well in excess of the allotted cash exemption under NYDCL \u00a7 283(2) and that, according to the trustee, results in disparate treatment. In sum, the trustee contends that the application of CPLR \u00a7 5206(a) to the proceeds of a voluntary sale violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lastly, although the trustee recognizes that the purpose of the New York homestead exemption is to protect a debtor and her family from an involuntary sale of her home by a money judgment creditor, that public policy is not, according to the trustee, furthered when a debtor voluntarily seeks to sell her home prepetition. The trustee argues that an intent to sell prepetition means that at the time of the bankruptcy filing a debtor lacks the intent to reside in the home permanently. It is that lack of intent, he asserts, that leaves a debtor ineligible to claim the homestead exemption under CPLR \u00a7 5206. The trustee maintains that if the New York homestead exemption does not apply to the proceeds of a voluntary sale by a debtor outside of bankruptcy, then there is no basis for allowing the exemption if a debtor closes on a voluntary sale of her residence during the bankruptcy case. According to the trustee, the timing of the sale should not lead to an inconsistent result. If the closing occurs a day before the bankruptcy filing, the proceeds of sale are not protected by the homestead exemption. That outcome, the trustee urges, should not change if a debtor intends to sell her\n   home prior to filing for bankruptcy even though she resides there on the petition date and the sale closes postpetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   D. The Debtor's Opposition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The debtor contends that intent to reside at one's primary residence is measured as of the petition date. According to the debtor, any decision on her part to sell the Lake Grove Property postpetition does not change the fact that she owned and occupied the Lake Grove Property as her permanent residence on the petition date. That, the debtor urges, is all that is required to claim the homestead exemption under CPLR \u00a7 5206(a). In short, the debtor insists that the statute does not require as a condition to claiming the homestead exemption that a debtor show an intent for long-term or permanent residency beyond the petition date. Additionally, the debtor points out that the trustee's view is contrary to established precedent in this district as courts have uniformly upheld a debtor's right to the homestead exemption where a debtor entered into a contract of sale prepetition but the sale closed post-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Addressing the trustee's Fourteenth Amendment claim, the debtor argues that the cash exemption permitted under NYDCL \u00a7 283(2) bears no relation to whether a debtor may properly claim the homestead exemption. The debtor points out that the cash exemption is available only if a debtor elects not to claim the homestead exemption. In this respect, the debtor draws a distinction between a homeowner and a lessee, focusing on the attributes of home ownership and the policy behind the homestead exemption. The debtor asserts that the homestead exemption encourages ownership and is designed to protect the homeowner from the involuntary seizure of the family dwelling and from thereby becoming a ward of the state. According to the debtor, an individual acquires residential real property with the intent of long-term occupancy and invests substantial assets and resources in the property with the expectation that she will reap the financial benefit of any appreciation in value. On the other hand, a lessee only has a short-term interest; has invested, at most, a security deposit and first month's rent; and has no right to share in any appreciation in the value of the property during the lease term. Thus, the debtor maintains that the trustee's Fourteenth Amendment claim fails because there is a rational basis for any perceived difference in the treatment of an individual debtor who chooses the homestead exemption and an individual debtor who foregoes the homestead exemption in favor of the cash exemption under NYDCL \u00a7 283(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.

While the bankruptcy discharge is most often associated with the fresh start policy, exemptions\n   are also a critical component of this basic bankruptcy principle. Absent such protection, all of a debtor's property would be liquidated by the chapter 7 trustee and used to satisfy creditor claims. Exemption laws, therefore, strike a necessary balance between the need of a debtor to protect her family from impoverishment and the need for general creditors to receive a distribution - property claimed as exempt is excluded from the bankruptcy estate and kept by a debtor even though creditors are not paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

The New York homestead exemption allows a debtor to exempt his or her interest in real property not exceeding a specified dollar amount\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   in value above liens and encumbrances, that is \"owned and occupied as a principal residence\" from the application of a money judgment, unless the judgment was recovered wholly for the purchase price of the property (i.e., a mortgage foreclosure).

The property was conveyed back to him prior to the petition date. In his bankruptcy case, the debtor sought to claim the vacation property as exempt even though he was often absent from the property because he was a watermelon farmer and lived in a different county during the watermelon farming season. The court found sufficient evidence of intent by the debtor to make the seasonal home his principal residence where the debtor's absence was due to work, and the debtor undertook efforts to establish a residence in the seasonal home by applying for an\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   tax exemption with respect to the property, changing the address of his driver's license, moving into a mobile home located on the property, and remaining at the property overnight since the bankruptcy filing.

The Santiago court also concluded that CPLR \u00a7 5206(e) did not apply because that section deals with the conditional exemption of sale proceeds from an involuntary sale of the homestead by a judgment creditor for a period of one year to allow a judgment debtor to reinvest the proceeds in another homestead. In short, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   are not akin to the facts in this case where a sale of the\n   debtor's homestead, i.e., the Lake Grove Property, has not yet occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The trustee's argument that the homestead exemption is subject to a showing of intent to permanently reside in the homestead as of the bankruptcy filing date is reasonable but, in the end, unconvincing. The Court finds instructive the well-reasoned and thoughtful opinions of the bankruptcy courts in the Second Circuit that have addressed the issue of whether a debtor may claim the homestead exemption in the face of a prepetition contract to sell the homestead that has not closed at the time the bankruptcy case is filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martiny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5449662\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/378/52/#p53\">\n    378 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   53 ;\n   <em>\n    Belllafiore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176011\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/492/109/#p113\">\n    492 B.R. at 114, 115-116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, under New York exemption law, where a debtor owns and occupies a single residence as of the petition date, the issue of intent to reside there permanently is not determinative of whether the debtor has met the requirement of ownership and occupancy sufficient to claim the homestead exemption. The existence of a prepetition contract of sale is immaterial if the debtor still owns and resides at her principal residence on the petition date, the very basis for a homestead exemption in New York. The debtor's \"clear intent to sell, in the future, without more, cannot establish a present abandonment of her homestead. The converse is equally true. The mere intention of future occupancy is not sufficient to constitute a homestead.\"\n   <em>\n    Bernstein v.

To find otherwise, to wit, that intent to permanently reside in one's principal residence beyond the petition date is outcome determinative of whether a debtor may claim the homestead exemption, would supplant a clear, bright-line rule with one that is (i) imprecise and arbitrary, and (ii) without any criterion as to what constitutes requisite intent, when the intent arose, and how long must that intent last. For example, if a debtor prepetition signed a listing agreement with a real estate broker or a binder to sell her principal residence but changed her mind and later filed for bankruptcy relief - is the listing agreement or binder sufficient to form an intent to abandon the homestead?\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6111851\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/62/545/#p549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6111851\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/62/545/#p549\">\n    62 B.R. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And suppose a debtor prepetition entered into contract to sell her principal residence but the sale failed to close (whether due to an adverse inspection, mortgage contingency or title issue) and the debtor postpetition decided to remain in the home. In both examples, the debtor owns and occupies a single homestead which is her \"principal residence\" as of the bankruptcy filing date. Yet, under the trustee's reasoning he may sell the home free of any homestead exemption simply because the debtor, in his view, could not have intended to reside in the home on a permanent basis. This is so, he contends, despite any change of heart by the debtor in her relocation plans or circumstances that prevented the closing of the sale prepetition. The Court does not agree. That outcome undermines the distinct social policies of why we have exemption laws in the first place and countermands the protection given a debtor and her family from a forced sale of the homestead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   D.

The exemption laws identify property, such as a homestead, that a debtor keeps even though her creditors are not paid in full or not paid at all. This, as noted above, furthers public policy and advances the individual debtor's fresh start. The exempt property is protected from administration in the debtor's chapter 7 case and exemptions, together with the discharge, enables the individual debtor to provide for her and her family while she recovers financially and avoids the adverse consequences of impoverishment. There can be no dispute that CPLR \u00a7 5206, which permits the individual debtor to claim the homestead exemption, is rooted in New York's public policy of preserving a debtor's homestead for the benefit of her and her family, allowing the debtor to obtain a fresh start and preventing the debtor and her family from becoming a ward of the state. The disparate treatment between a homeowner and a tenant under a residential lease is rationally based. In fact, New York increased the amount of the homestead exemption in 2005 from the $10,000 set in\n   1977 to $50,000, and then increased the amount again in 2010 to $150,000 for homesteads located in the counties of Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk (where the Lake Grove Property is located), Rockland, Westchester and Putnam in order to account for rising home values.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    1256 Hertel Ave. Assocs., LLC v.

It is this distinction which the trustee says gives rise to his Fourteenth Amendment claim.

As noted, the trustee's challenge requires the Court to apply a rational basis scrutiny,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cleburne Living Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    473 U.S. at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Beach Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 508 U.S. at 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11912\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/307/#p313\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Court finds the state policy of allowing an individual debtor to keep cash proceeds from the voluntary sale of her homestead postpetition is rationally related to a legitimate state interest, to wit, the protection of a debtor and her family from the adverse consequences of impoverishment and the need for public assistance. For this reason, the\n   Court denies the trustee's equal protection challenge and finds that there is a rational basis for any perceived difference in the treatment of a debtor claiming the homestead exemption under CPLR \u00a7 5206 in the cash proceeds of a voluntary sale of her home and a debtor who foregoes the homestead exemption and instead avails herself of the more limited cash exemption under NYDCL \u00a7 283(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   E. Voluntary Sale of the Homestead in Bankruptcy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The trustee maintains that because the New York homestead exemption under CPLR \u00a7 5206(a) does not apply to the proceeds of a voluntary sale of a debtor's principal residence outside of bankruptcy, then there is no basis for allowing the exemption if a debtor closes on a voluntary sale of her residence during her bankruptcy case. Outside of bankruptcy, the New York \"homestead exemption ceases if the property ceases to be occupied as a residence by a person for whose benefit it may so continue, except where the suspension of occupation is for a period not exceeding one year, and occurs in consequence of injury to, or destruction of, the dwelling house upon the premises.\" CPLR \u00a7 5206(c). In short, the trustee reasons that if the applicable state statutory scheme does not protect cash proceeds from the voluntary sale of the homestead before bankruptcy, commencement of the bankruptcy case should not change that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court does not agree. First, the trustee's argument ignores the \"snapshot rule\" of bankruptcy law that exemptions are determined as of the petition date,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222473\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/305/\">\n    500 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6506809,6222473\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/1833/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and do not change by reason of subsequent events,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119082,4168669\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/384/\">\n    744 F.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In deciding whether a debtor has properly claimed the homestead exemption under New York law, the court's focus is on whether the debtor owned and occupied the homestead as of the petition date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apergis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345104\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/24/#p28\">\n    539 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   28 ;\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5761353\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/392/530/#p531\">\n    392 B.R. at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, the trustee's argument that bankruptcy law may not affect state homestead exemptions overlooks the federal limitations placed on state homestead exemptions. In three separate instances, the Bankruptcy Code caps the amount of the state homestead exemption. See \u00a7 522(o), (p) and (q). Although the facts before the Court do not include the circumstances addressed by these limiting provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, it is instructive that bankruptcy law does indeed alter the scope and amount of state homestead exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Third, the trustee's position does not consider yet another section of the Bankruptcy Code that affects state exemption law. When a debtor has elected to have her exemptions determined under applicable state and nonbankruptcy federal law, we look to the Bankruptcy Code to determine which state law is the applicable law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 522(b)(3). Section 522(b)(3) addresses the concern raised by the \"wandering debtor\" - the debtor who changes her residence before filing for bankruptcy in order to take advantage of more favorable exemptions offered in the state she claims as her domicile as of the bankruptcy filing date. This section governs which state law applies and will serve to preclude a debtor from taking advantage of a state's more generous exemptions. Thus, if a debtor lived in more than one state during the 730-day period prior to filing her bankruptcy case, and elects to claim exemptions under applicable state and nonbankruptcy federal law, \u00a7 522(b)(3) provides that her exemptions will be determined by the law of the state where she resided for 91 of the 180 days prior to the 730-day period and\n   not by the law of the state of her current domicile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Fourth, the trustee's argument fails to recognize the import of \u00a7 522(c). Section 522(c) provides, in part, that \"[u]nless the case is dismissed, property exempted under this section is not liable\n   <em>\n    during or after\n   </em>\n   the case for any debt of the debtor that arose, or that is determined under section 502 of [the Bankruptcy Code] as if such debt had arisen, before the commencement of the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added). Thus, subject to exceptions contained in subparagraphs (1)-(4) of paragraph (c), property that is properly claimed as exempt is kept by the debtor free of the claims of certain creditors both during and after the bankruptcy case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In keeping with the \"snapshot rule\" noted above, courts will generally not consider subsequent events when asked to determine whether a debtor has properly claimed an exemption for purposes of applying \u00a7 522(c).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3164927\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/318/#p324\">\n    513 F.3d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (1st Cir. 2008) (proceeds from postpetition sale of exempt homestead did not lose exempt status);\n   <em>\n    In re Gamble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639627,11765174\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/442/\">\n    168 F.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445 (11th Cir. 1999) (chapter 13 trustee may not hold onto exempt property in the event the case was ultimately dismissed and must turnover exempt property to the debtors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit held that proceeds from the postpetition sale of the debtor's homestead remained exempt and thus unavailable to satisfy the claim of a creditor's prepetition, nondischargeable debt.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   By the plain language of the statute, exemptions under \u00a7 522(c) persist beyond the termination of the case, making the property subject to an exemption unavailable for the satisfaction of pre-petition debt (other than for the categories noted in \u00a7 522(c) itself) .... Moreover, it is a basic principle of bankruptcy law that exemptions are determined when a petition is filed.

There is no provision similar to \u00a7 1306(a)(1) in chapter 7, and once property is properly exempt in\n   a chapter 7 case, that property, albeit property of the estate, remains with the debtor and is not administered by the bankruptcy trustee \"even if the debtor acquires the new property interest by transforming a previously exempted asset into a nonexempt one.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270187,12264222\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/287/\">\n    871 F.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Zibman\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that because the chapter 7 debtors failed to reinvest the proceeds from the sale of their homestead within the requisite six-month period lost the homestead exemption in the sale proceeds. Like the debtors in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   , the debtors in\n   <em>\n    Zibman\n   </em>\n   sold their homestead prepetition, and their interest in the cash proceeds at the time the bankruptcy case was filed remained subject to Texas' six-month conditional exemption.\n   <em>\n    Hawk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270187,12264222\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/287/\">\n    871 F.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that if the debtors in\n   <em>\n    Zibman\n   </em>\n   had owned the homestead at the time their bankruptcy case was filed, the homestead would have been subject to an unconditional exemption under Texas law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is also interesting to note that the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Frost\n   </em>\n   did not address the \u00a7 522(c) discussion in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gamble\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the Fifth Circuit sought to distinguish the Texas homestead exemption statute from exemption statutes found in Massachusetts and in Georgia on the basis that a debtor's interest under the applicable law of those states remained the same despite a sale of the homestead, i.e., a \"monetized interest in equity\"; whereas under Texas exemption law, the debtor's interest in his homestead changes from an unconditional exemption in the residence itself regardless of value to a conditional exemption in monetized proceeds from the sale of that homestead - and the exemption expires if not timely reinvested in another homestead.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041.001\">\n    Tex. Prop. Code Ann. \u00a7 41.001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2001). At the time\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   was decided, Massachusetts permitted an exemption of \"[a]n estate of homestead to the extent of the declared homestead exemption in a home\" and such \"declared homestead exemption\" was an exemption set in the amount of $300,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 188, \u00a7 1 et al. (West 2011). Similarly, Georgia's exemption statute provides that \"[t]he debtor's aggregate interest, not to exceed $21,500 in value, in real property or personal property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor uses as a residence\" is exempt for purposes of bankruptcy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2044-13-100\">\n    Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 44-13-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . New York's exemption statute resembles that of Massachusetts and Georgia. CPLR \u00a7 5206(a) exempts a monetized interest in \"[p]roperty ... not exceeding [$165,550]\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... in value above liens and encumbrances, owned and occupied as a principal residence\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Lastly, the trustee asserts that the debtor does not need the cash proceeds from the sale of her home in order to avail herself of the \"fresh start\" policy. He insists that the debtor can use the funds currently held in an individual retirement\n   account to pay for new housing. Those funds aggregate approximately $200,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   schedule A/B (property) [dkt. no. 1]. Again, the Court disagrees with the trustee's position. The fact that the debtor has exempt retirement funds does not affect whether she may properly claim the homestead exemption as the exemptions are mutually exclusive. The homestead exemption is governed by CPLR \u00a7 5206, whereas the exemption for individual retirement accounts under New York law falls under CPLR \u00a7 5205(c). Nothing in either CPLR \u00a7 5206 or CPLR \u00a7 5205 requires a debtor to choose between the two exemptions. Additionally, absent a finding of fraud, pre-bankruptcy planning on the part of a debtor in order to maximize exemptions does not preclude a debtor from properly claiming exempt status for assets owned at the time her bankruptcy case is filed.\n   <em>\n    Apergis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345104\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/24/#p28\">\n    539 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   30 ;\n   <em>\n    Martiny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5449662\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/378/52/#p53\">\n    378 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   54 ;\n   <em>\n    Bedell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6105630\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/173/463/#p466\">\n    173 B.R. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   It is undisputed that on the petition date, the debtor owned and occupied the Lake Grove Property and that the Lake Grove Property was her principal residence. The debtor has resided at the Lake Grove Property for more than 35 years and has continued to live there after commencement of her bankruptcy case. Her bankruptcy schedules reveal no other residence or investment property. Because the debtor owned and occupied the Lake Grove Property as her principal residence on the date she filed her bankruptcy petition, the Court finds that the debtor has properly claimed the homestead exemption under applicable New York exemption law. If the debtor decides to voluntarily sell the Lake Grove Property during her bankruptcy case, the debtor's homestead exemption will be preserved under \u00a7 522(c) with respect to any net sales proceeds up to $165,550.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   III.
