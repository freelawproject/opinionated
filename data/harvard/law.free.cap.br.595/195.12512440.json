The dispute here is over the scope of the exemption for property held as tenants by the entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under \u00a7 522(b)(3), exempt property includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   any interest in property in which the debtor had, immediately before the commencement of the case, an interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant to the extent that such interest as a tenant by the entirety or joint tenant is exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00a7 522(b)(3)(B). Thus, the question is whether the debtor's entireties interest in the Property \"immediately before the commencement of the case\" was \"exempt from process under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\" The burden is on the trustee to prove the exemption is not properly claimed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4003(c). The court concludes the debtor's entireties interest was not exempt from process by the IRS, and therefore is not exempt to the extent of the tax claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There is no dispute that, to the extent \"applicable nonbankruptcy law\" includes state law, the debtor's interest in the Property\n   is exempt under Maryland law from the claims of non-joint creditors.\n   <em>\n    In re Bell-Breslin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11355360\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/283/834/#p837\">\n    283 B.R. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 837 (Bankr.

Had it done so, the IRS could be paid from the debtor's interest in the Property by way of its properly obtained, prepetition lien. He contends that because it did not do so, the IRS is nothing more than an individual unsecured creditor of the debtor and cannot reach the entireties interest. The debtor argues that in the absence of a valid and enforceable tax lien, the exemption applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The status of the IRS lien against the debtor's interest in the Property as of the petition date is not seriously in dispute. Under\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   and by application of the tax code, the statutory tax lien attached against the debtor's interest in the Property after assessment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206321\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6322.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As pertinent here, the statutory lien exists until the taxes, interest and other amounts are paid.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206322\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although no further action is required for the statutory lien to exist, the lien does not have priority in the absence of a \"Notice of Federal Tax Lien\" and \"remains unperfected and unsecured until a notice of lien is filed in accordance with \u00a7 6323(f).\"\n   <em>\n    In re Barnett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114245\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/62/638/#p640\">\n    62 B.R. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (Bankr.

Section 522(b)(3)(B) does not speak of liens and the status of the lien is not pertinent for purposes of this section.

The interest therefore was not \"exempt from process\" by the IRS prior to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the debtor focuses exclusively on the status of the lien, he does not argue that the interest was exempt from process by the IRS \"immediately before the commencement of the case.\" He offers no reason or authority that could support the position that the interest was exempt from process prior to the petition. Indeed, debtor's recognition that the IRS could have filed a notice of tax lien and obtained a valid and enforceable lien against the interest before the case was filed defeats his contention that the interest is exempt from the tax claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Support for this holding is further found in\n   <em>\n    Sumy v. Schlossberg.\n   </em>\n   As stated above, there the Fourth Circuit held that property held as tenants by the entireties is not exempt under \u00a7 522(b)(3)(B) to the extent of joint creditors because, under Maryland law, joint creditors can levy upon entireties property to satisfy the debt.\n   <em>\n    Sumy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6128060,1521708\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/777/921/\">\n    777 F.2d at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit explicitly held that the joint creditors' claims need not be secured or reduced to judgment.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   We also agree with the conclusion stated in\n   <em>\n    Sefren\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Seidel\n   </em>\n   that the joint creditors need not obtain or already possess a joint judgment against the debtor and the nonfiling spouse or a lien against their entireties property.... Moreover, the absence of a judgment or lien has no bearing on the hypothetical issue of whether the debtor's interest would be exempt from process under state law, so the property cannot be exempted and remains part of the estate to the extent of joint claims regardless of the joint creditors' actual possession of a judgment or lien under state law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.14. The same rationale applies to tax claims. To defeat the exemption, tax claims need not be reduced to judgment or, as debtor contends, secured by enforceable liens. The sole question is whether the asset is exempt from process immediately before the debtor files the petition. Stated otherwise, the question is\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   the creditor have sought a judgment, or in the case of the IRS, obtained an enforceable lien, before the petition was filed, and not\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   the creditor or IRS do so. Here, the debtor's interest in the Property is not exempt from process by the IRS, and therefore, it is not exempt to that extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The debtor relies on the following passage from a memorandum of the IRS Office of Chief Counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Generally, exempt property is not liable for any prepetition debts during or after the bankruptcy case except debts secured by unavoided liens and tax liens with respect to which a Notice of Federal Tax Lien has been filed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). In essence, a debtor may avoid a statutory tax lien on his exempt property by exempting the property from the estate, but he may not avoid a tax lien where a Notice of Federal Tax Lien has been filed. Whereas excluded property never becomes property of the estate, exempt property initially becomes estate property under section 541(a) and later, during the case, is returned to the debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IRS CCA 200634012 (I.R.S. June 23, 2006). This passage is unavailing. The first sentence simply recognizes that exempt property remains subject to valid and unavoidable liens under \u00a7 522(c), but otherwise is not liable for prepetition debts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides\n   no insight into what property is exempt. The second sentence, which points out that the statutory lien of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206231\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is subject to avoidance on exempt property but the enforceable lien that arises upon the filing of a notice of lien is not, essentially paraphrases the effect of \u00a7 522(c)(2)(B). The third sentence describes the exemption process. This passage focuses exclusively on post-petition matters and does not support the necessary predicate for establishing the exemption - that debtor's interest in the Property was exempt from process by the IRS immediately before the commencement of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the debtor cites several cases that addressed\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   in the context of a chapter 7 trustee's strong-arm powers under \u00a7 544. Under \u00a7 544, a trustee holds, as of the commencement of the case, the rights and powers of a hypothetical \"creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case.\" \u00a7 544(a)(2). After\n   <em>\n    Craft,\n   </em>\n   trustees argued that they could assert the rights of the IRS as the hypothetical \"creditor that extends credit\" and assert the IRS's rights to purse an entireties interest where no federal tax debt existed.\n   <em>\n    See Schlossberg v. Barney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217954,9208980\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/174/\">\n    380 F.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (4th Cir. 2004);\n   <em>\n    see also In re Knapp,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1173720\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/285/176/\">\n    285 B.R. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2002). As the Fourth Circuit stated, \"every court to have addressed\" this issue rejected the trustee's argument.\n   <em>\n    Schlossberg v. Barney,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217954,9208980\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/174/\">\n    380 F.3d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The cases are inapposite. The trustee here is not asserting the rights of the IRS, or any creditor, under the strong-arm provisions of \u00a7 544. Rather, she is seeking to administer the interest in the Property under her duty to \"collect and reduce to money the [nonexempt] property of the estate.\" \u00a7 704(a)(1). The debtor's interest in the Property is property of the estate that is not exempt from process by the IRS to the extent of the tax claim. Therefore, the trustee may administer the interest to the extent of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons the court will sustain the trustee's objection to the debtor's entireties exemption of his interest in the Property to the extent of the IRS claim.
