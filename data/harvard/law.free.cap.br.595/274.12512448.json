According to Buch, his relationship with the debtor has improved over the years but he does not wish to be married now or at any point in the future because he wants to live an autonomous life. Buch worked for large corporations early in his professional life but for the past twenty-plus years has made his living by buying farms and other properties, renovating them, selling them for a profit, and immediately reinvesting the proceeds into additional properties. When Buch met the debtor in 2011, he was running a 400-acre farm in Eureka Springs, Arkansas [the farm] that he had purchased in or around 2001 with cash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor graduated from medical school in 2009. She established Amy Garrison, M.D., PLLC [the PLLC] in 2011 and completed her residency in family medicine in June 2012. Her first post-residency job was as an emergency room physician in Batesville, Arkansas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2012, the debtor bought a home located at 110 Joe Baker Road in Cushman, Arkansas [the Cushman property], a small town near Batesville, for $209,000.00. The debtor financed her purchase of the Cushman property through First Community Bank. On September 10, 2012, Buch paid off the debtor's outstanding student loan debt of approximately $90,000.00, and the same day, the debtor signed an informal agreement stating that she would repay Buch the full amount of the loan when she was financially stable. According to both Buch and the debtor, Buch's payment of the debtor's student loan debt was a loan, not a gift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately six months after Buch loaned the debtor the money to pay off her student loans, he hired real estate agent Kevin Lunceford [Lunceford] to look for commercial properties in Greenbrier and Conway-Greenbrier because the debtor wanted to open a medical practice there and Conway because Buch wanted to move closer to his elderly parents. At the beginning of April 2013, Lunceford told Buch about a piece of commercial property located at 2645 Prince Street in Conway, Arkansas [the Prince property] that would soon be listed for sale by Pam Macdowell Properties, where Lunceford worked. This particular property contained both office spaces and apartment units. Buch testified\n   that he was told by Lunceford that the Prince Street property would sell quickly once it hit the market. In April 2013, Buch had approximately $2,000,000.00 in assets, including real estate worth $1,495,000.00 and an IRA account containing $338,620.00, but he did not have sufficient liquid assets at his disposal to buy the Prince Street property outright, which was his preference and historical practice. Although Buch was trying to sell his farm in Eureka Springs at the time, he was concerned that the Prince Street property would no longer be on the market by the time he sold the farm. As a result, Buch took Lunceford's recommendation that Buch expedite his purchase of the Prince Street property by having the debtor help him obtain immediate financing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The debtor, who was still working in Batesville at the time and had regular income, agreed to co-sign a loan to facilitate Buch's purchase of the Prince Street property. On April 15, 2013, the debtor and Buch applied for a loan with First Community Bank-the same bank that the debtor had used to finance her home in Cushman. The loan application signed by both Buch and the debtor stated that the purchase price of the property was $240,000.00 and that title to the property was to be held by Paul Buch. UST Ex. 12. The loan application also contained a note identifying an account at First Community Bank that would be the source of a 20% down payment of $48,000.00. Both the account identified in the loan application and the funds in the account were Buch's; the debtor did not contribute any of her own money toward the down payment. The day of the closing, May 13, 2013, Buch wired $50,109.97 (the down payment of $48,000.00 plus closing costs) from his account at First Community Bank to Faulkner Title Company, the title company handling the closing. The \"special instructions\" section of the wire transfer form contained a note that identified the wired funds as \"closing money for Paul Buch 2645 Prince Street, Conway, AR.\" Def. Ex. 16. Despite the loan application stating that Buch was to hold title to the Prince Street property, the seller deeded the property to both Buch and the debtor when the transaction closed on May 13, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beginning in May 2013, Buch paid every monthly mortgage payment of $1039.37 on the Prince Street property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June 2013, the debtor opened a rural \"concierge\" practice in Greenbrier, Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few months later, her PLLC opened a weight-loss clinic called Hippocrates Health Concierge Family Medicine [Hippocrates Health], in one of the Prince Street property's office spaces. In November 2013, the debtor worked her last shift at the Batesville emergency room and moved out of the Cushman property to reside with Buch in one of the Prince Street property's apartments. The same month, the debtor's PLLC began paying Buch $500.00 each month to rent space in the Prince Street property for Hippocrates Health.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Buch collected rent payments of roughly the same amount from other tenants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of the utilities for the Prince Street property were in Buch's name and were paid for by Buch. In the months immediately following the purchase of the Prince Street property, Buch petitioned the City of Conway to rezone the property and paid the associated costs. Buch communicated with a representative from an insurance company to obtain quotes for coverage on both the Prince Street property itself and the debtor's medical practice inside the property, but the policies themselves were separate-Buch paid the premiums on the property itself and the debtor paid the premiums related to her medical practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Buch spent roughly $50,000.00 on repairs and renovations to the Prince Street property. The debtor did not contribute any of her own funds for those repairs and renovations but paid for items related specifically to her practice such as the Hippocrates Health sign for the outside of the building. Buch paid the property taxes on the Prince Street property every year. Def. Ex. 43. Although the debtor claimed ownership of the Prince Street property on her 2013 tax return, she subsequently amended the return to remove that representation, stating on the return that she had incorrectly claimed an \"office building rental property\" in her original return on Schedule E.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   UST Ex. 41. According to her amended return, disclaiming any ownership of the Prince Street property resulted in no change to the debtor's tax liability for 2013. UST Ex. 41. At trial, the debtor's attorney questioned her about how the amendment to her 2013 return came about:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. Okay. Tell the Court what happened in the amendment of the tax return, the 2013 tax return; did you have a discussion with your CPA about it after the -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Yes. He -he- when he saw that I was paying rent, he realized that the property was not mine. That was an assumption that he made\n   incorrectly. And then he had to amend that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Okay. So the only - the only amendment was to the 2013; you did not do it - carry that in '14 or '15, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. Okay. And, of course, in '14 were - the filing of the '14 was before you filed your bankruptcy in '15?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. So you had corrected it at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Trial Tr. vol II, 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 7, 2014, the debtor sold his Eureka Springs farm for $440,000.00 and used some of the proceeds to pay off the loan on the Prince Street property. After Buch paid the loan in full, First Community Bank released its lien on the Prince Street property despite a cross-collateralization provision in the mortgage stating that the mortgage secured all other debts owed to the bank by Buch or the debtor. UST Ex. 13. After Buch satisfied the debt to First Community Bank, the debtor's PLLC continued to make monthly rent payments to Buch for four more months. The debtor wrote the PLLC's last rent check to Buch in October 2014. UST Ex. 39. The same month, the debtor closed her Conway location to open a practice in Maumelle, Arkansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Buch testified that in early 2015, a couple that owned a restaurant across the street from the Prince Street property approached him and expressed interest in buying the Prince Street property. While the couple never made a written offer to buy the property because they were unable to get financing, Buch testified that it was their interest in the property that precipitated his realization that the debtor's name was on the deed to the Prince Street property. Trial Tr. vol II, 15-16. Buch and the debtor both testified that their intent was always for the Prince Street property to be Buch's alone. After Buch discovered that the Prince Street property was not titled solely in his name, he asked the debtor to execute a quitclaim deed that transferred her interest to him in order to clear up title to the property. Trial Tr. vol I, 167-68. The debtor executed the quitclaim deed on April 6, 2015, and the deed was filed of record two days later without transfer tax stamps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the debtor called Jim Pender [Pender] to testify as an expert in the area of real estate transactions. In addition to being a licensed attorney, Pender founded and owns First National Title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pender testified that in the event a warranty deed is issued that is contrary to the intent of the parties as to ownership of the property, a quitclaim deed is an inexpensive method of cleaning up the resulting cloud on the title. Trial Tr. vol II, 50. He also testified that, under Arkansas law, if no consideration is paid for property, transfer tax stamps would not appear on the deed. Trial Tr. vol II, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although the debtor had not resided in her home in Cushman since November 2013, she continued to make mortgage\n   payments to First Community Bank until March 15, 2015. From November 2013 to March 2015, the debtor tried unsuccessfully to sell the Cushman property. The debtor testified that she believes the property did not sell because the road leading to it-a road that was paved when the debtor bought the property but had subsequently been turned into a gravel road by the county-had fallen into such disrepair that it was sometimes impassable. As a result, the pool of potential buyers for the Cushman property was limited to those with four-wheel drive vehicles. According to the debtor, three of the eleven homes in her small neighborhood had already gone into foreclosure when she moved out of her home in November 2013. On August 19, 2015, First Community Bank completed its foreclosure of the debtor's home in Cushman, resulting in the debtor owing a deficiency judgment of $53,941.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 31, 2015, the debtor filed a skeletal chapter 7 petition. On September 14, 2015, she filed her schedules and her statement of financial affairs [SOFA]. Relevant to the matters before the Court are the debtor's initial responses to three questions-one in her SOFA and two in Schedule B. Question 10 of the SOFA required the debtor to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   List all other property, other than property transferred in the ordinary course of the business or financial affairs of the debtor, transferred either absolutely or as security within\n   <strong>\n    two years\n   </strong>\n   immediately preceding the commencement of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response, the debtor marked the box labeled \"None.\" The trustees argue that the debtor should have disclosed in response to Question 10 that she transferred her interest in the Prince Street property to Buch on April 6, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor testified that she never believed herself to own any part of the Prince Street property because she did not pay for it-Buch did. She explained her initial failure to disclose the transfer on the amended SOFA that she filed on September 3, 2018:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   On 04/08/15, the Debtor signed a quitclaim deed clearing up a cloud on the title of 2645 Prince Street, Conway, Arkansas. Mr. Buch purchased the property, the legal title erroniously [sic] had debtor on the deed. I had no equity ownership interest in the property. I did not own an actual interest in the property. I understood the Quitclaim Deed removed the mistake of legal title. It may appear to be a transfer of interest but it is not an actual transfer of any financial interest in the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   UST Ex. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The instructions on Schedule B directed the debtor to \"list personal property of the debtor of whatever kind. If the debtor has no property in one or more of the categories, place an 'x' in the appropriate position in the column labeled \"None.\" ' Question 2 on Schedule B asked the debtor to describe and value\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Checking, savings, or other financial accounts, certificates of deposit, or shares in banks, savings and loan, thrift, building and loan, and homestead associations, or credit unions, brokerage houses, or cooperatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   UST Ex. 4. In response, the debtor listed a checking account at Bank of America with a balance of $5888.00 and a business checking account for her PLLC at Bank of America with a balance of $34.00. However, the actual balance in the PLLC's checking account on the date the debtor\n   filed her petition was $26,607.00. The debtor testified during her September 16, 2016 deposition that $34.00 was not the correct balance for the PLLC's account on the date that she filed her petition. At trial, the debtor testified that she filled out her schedules using an online form and that it was \"very frustrating\" because \"it would refresh automatically, all my data would disappear. It wouldn't save the data.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial. Tr. vol II, 83-84. The debtor said that she thought that she had put down a different balance for the PLLC account on her schedules and admitted-as she had done during her deposition-that the $34.00 balance reflected on her original schedule B was not correct. On her amended Schedule B filed on September 3, 2018, the debtor changed the value of the account from $34.00 to $1.00 and described the account as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Checking Account: business checking account (Amy Beard, MD, PLLC) net value of business includes checking account offset by business debts. Original Value used as marker, value of business included the value of company checking account less expenses. Location: Bank of America.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   UST Ex. 6. On both her original and amended schedules, the debtor valued her business interest at $20,000.00. At trial, the debtor's attorney questioned Wetzel about the interplay between the value of the debtor's interest in the PLLC and the balance in the PLLC's checking account on the date that the debtor filed her individual chapter 7 petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. Okay. The corporation did not file bankruptcy along with Ms. - Ms. Beard, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Just her interest in the professional corporation would be included within the bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. Right. But that would only be the net interest, correct, not-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Well, not to put too fine a point on it, it would be the net - net worth of the professional corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. Correct. And so, the cash in a checking account, in and of itself, if there were outstanding credit card charges that had to be paid by the PLLC, would deduct from the net value of that corporation, would it not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. As a liability, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. Okay. And so, the cash in hand doesn't necessarily correspond - the cash in the checking account doesn't necessarily automatically increase or decrease the value of the - of the corporation; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Well, it increases or decreases the value of the corporation depending on the amounts of the debits and credits to the account, so the net worth is going to fluctuate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Trial Tr. vol I, 89-90.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. Okay. And so, the cash available in the checking account would need to be offset by those debts to find out what the available cash, plus any other outstanding debts that the PLLC owed, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. That would be correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Trial Tr. vol I, 91-92. On August 31, 2015, the PLLC had total outstanding credit card debt of $20,664.28, leaving an available balance of $5942.72 in the PLLC's account with which to pay employees and other business expenses. In response to\n   her attorney's questions regarding what she intended to disclose about the PLLC's value, the debtor testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. Okay. The net balance was what you intended to put into the value of the practice, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Okay. Were you trying to hide any of this? You disclosed the checking account of the corporation, but the corporation was not filing bankruptcy, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Trial Tr. vol II, 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Question 7 asked the debtor to list and value \"Furs and jewelry.\" In response, the debtor put an \"x\" in the column labeled \"None.\" However, on the date the debtor filed her petition, she owned a Tag Heuer watch gifted to her in 2007 by her former husband and some \"small pieces of costume-like jewelry.\" Trial Tr. vol I, 86-87,141. When asked to explain why she did not disclose the watch on Schedule B, the debtor said that she did not consider watches to be jewelry-though she admitted that they do qualify as such-and she had not given any thought to the value of the watch or believed it to be valuable. Trial Tr. vol II, 86-87. In her amended schedules, the debtor added \"Rings, Watch, Earrings\" valued at $1200.00 to Schedule B and claimed an exemption of the same amount in her amended Schedule C. The debtor admitted at trial that she testified at her \u00a7 341(a) meeting of creditors on October 15, 2015, that she had listed her assets and debts and that her original schedules and statements were true and correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The trustees contend that the debtor's discharge should be denied under \u00a7 727(a)(2) and \u00a7 727(a)(4) because of her failure to disclose her transfer of the Prince Street property to Buch, her failure to schedule her jewelry-specifically, the Tag Heuer watch-and her failure to schedule the correct balance for the PLLC's bank account. In addition, Wetzel argues that the debtor fraudulently transferred her interest in the Prince Street property to Buch and that, as a result, Wetzel is entitled to recover the property for the benefit of the estate under \u00a7 548(a)(1)(A)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court denies both complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Law &amp; Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To resolve these two adversary proceedings, the Court must decide the following: (1) whether the debtor fraudulently transferred the Prince Street property to Buch, entitling Wetzel to avoid the transfer and recover the value of the property for the benefit of the debtor's bankruptcy estate; and (2) whether the trustees' objections to the debtor's discharge should be sustained.

As a result, the Court will consider evidence of Buch's intent, including whether he had a reason to title the property in the debtor's name (other than to give her a gift); whether he managed the property; collected the rents; paid taxes and insurance; paid for repairs and improvements; or otherwise asserted ownership of the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1740777\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/282/61/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court found Buch credible when he testified that he asked the debtor to co-sign the loan with First Community Bank because he believed that the Prince Street property would be off the market before he could generate the funds from the sale of his farm to allow for a cash purchase. The Court also believes that Buch never intended for the debtor to share in his ownership of the property. In fact, the loan application-signed by both Buch and the debtor-clearly indicated that title to the property was to be held by only Buch. Further, the debtor contributed none of her own funds toward the purchase or improvement of the Prince Street property-she paid none of the closing costs, none of the sizeable down payment, and none of the renovation costs. Buch paid for all of those things plus incurred the cost associated with rezoning the property. Buch also paid the insurance premiums on the Prince Street building, as well as the property taxes each year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition,\n   Buch collected rent payments from the tenants of the Prince Street property-tenants that included the debtor's PLLC. During the time that the debtor operated her PLLC d/b/a Hippocrates Health out of the Prince Street property, the PLLC paid rent to Buch in an amount that matched or closely approximated the amount of rent paid by Buch's other Prince Street tenants. Although Wetzel argued that the PLLC's $500.00 monthly payments to Buch were really the debtor's half of the $1039.37 mortgage payment to First Community Bank simply disguised as rent payments, the evidence demonstrated that the PLLC's payments to Buch were actually rent. The PLLC's monthly payments to Buch corresponded to the dates that the PLLC did business as Hippocrates Health at the Prince Street location. Specifically, the debtor's rent payments to Buch began in November 2013-when she opened Hippocrates Health-despite the fact that Buch had begun making mortgage payments to First Community Bank in May 2013. Likewise, the debtor continued to pay Buch rent for four months after he paid the debt to First Community Bank in full. Had the debtor been paying half of the mortgage payments, the payments to Buch would have started in May 2013 when Buch bought the property and would have ended in June 2014 when Buch paid off the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based on the evidence discussed above, the Court finds that Buch paid for the Prince Street property without financial contribution from the debtor and did not intend to give the debtor a share of the property as a gift. Therefore, a resulting trust was established in favor of Buch and the debtor had only bare legal title to the property. As a result, the debtor had a duty to convey the property to the rightful owner, which she did on April 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cowden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6516963\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/154/531/\">\n    154 B.R. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The debtor transferred property to Buch, whom she had been dating for approximately four years at the time of the transfer. Although the Court recognizes that Buch and the debtor were not-and are not-married or otherwise related, the code's definition of an insider is not exclusive and the Court finds that the debtor's long-term committed relationship to Buch qualifies him as an insider in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Vu\n   </em>\n   , No. BKY 12-46862,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205442275\">\n    2013 WL 5442275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr. D. Minn. Sept. 30, 2013) (finding that debtor's transfer of property to her boyfriend of five years was a transfer to an insider).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court finds that the second badge of fraud is not present here because the debtor did not retain possession or control of the property after she transferred it to Buch. In fact, she moved Hippocrates Health out of the Prince Street property in October 2014-six months prior to transferring her interest in the property to Buch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court's determination of the third badge of fraud-whether the transfer was disclosed or concealed-is mixed. The debtor failed to disclose her transfer of the Prince Street property when she filed bankruptcy, meaning that the transfer was initially concealed from the UST, Wetzel, and the debtor's creditors. However, First Community Bank-the creditor holding the debt that led to the debtor's bankruptcy filing-knew that the Prince Street property would be titled in only Buch's name because the loan application that the bank approved specifically stated that very thing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, it does not appear that the debtor's transfer of title to Buch concealed anything substantive from First Community Bank in the light of the fact that the bank believed that Buch was already the sole titleholder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court finds that the fourth badge is not present here. Although the debtor made her last mortgage payment on the Cushman property in March 2015, she had not yet defaulted on her obligation to First Community Bank when she transferred her interest in the Prince Street property to Buch and had not been sued or threatened with suit at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Court also finds that the fifth badge is not present in this case. The debtor transferred bare legal title to Buch and, as the Court stated above in its discussion of \u00a7 548, bare legal title has no economic value. As a result, the debtor's transfer of an asset with no value was not a transfer of substantially all of her assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court finds that the sixth badge of fraud is not present in this case because the debtor did not abscond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court finds that the seventh badge is present. Although there is no evidence that the debtor removed assets, she concealed her Tag Heuer watch and other jewelry when she failed to list them in her original schedules. However, the Court does not assign the presence of this particular badge much weight due to the plausibility of the debtor's explanation for her initial omission of the items-the watch was a gift she received in 2007 from her ex-husband that she did not, at the time she filled out her schedules, consider \"jewelry\" and the rest of her jewelry was costume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Court finds that the eighth badge is not present in this case. The debtor transferred her valueless interest in the Prince Street property to Buch and received nothing in exchange. Therefore, the Court finds that the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kapila v. Moodie\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Moodie\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959057\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/362/554/#p562\">\n    362 B.R. 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2007) (transferring bare legal title for free is reasonably equivalent value).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court finds that the ninth badge of fraud is not present. There is no evidence to suggest that the debtor was insolvent on the date she transferred her interest in the Prince Street property to Buch and the\n   Court finds that she could not have become insolvent as a result of transferring bare legal title that had no economic value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959057\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/362/554/#p562\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3959057\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/362/554/#p562\">\n    at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring a valueless asset has \"no effect on solvency either positively or negatively.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court finds that the tenth badge is present. The debtor transferred her interest to Buch shortly before she stopped making mortgage payments to First Community Bank on the Cushman property, leading the bank to foreclose and resulting in the debtor owing a $53,941.15 deficiency judgment. The Court finds that the eleventh badge, which relates to a transfer of business assets, is not applicable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   After examining the circumstances surrounding the debtor's transfer of her interest in the Prince Street property to Buch, including the badges of fraud discussed above, the Court finds that the evidence fails to establish that the debtor made the transfer with the actual intent to defraud a creditor or her bankruptcy estate. Therefore, the Court finds that the trustees failed to carry their respective burdens of proof under \u00a7 727(a)(2) and denies the relief requested pursuant to that subsection in both complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Based on the fact that the debtor initially failed to list her jewelry, the correct balance in the PLLC's bank account, and the transfer of the Prince Street property on her schedules and SOFA but made oaths to the contrary, the Court finds that the first two elements under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) are satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Before discussing the third and fourth elements, the Court will address\n   the fifth element under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) -whether the statements related materially to the debtor's bankruptcy. \"A false statement is material if it 'bears a relationship to the [debtor's] business transactions or estate, or concerns the discovery of assets, business dealings, or the existence and disposition of [her] property.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127905\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/726/#p733\">\n    258 B.R. at 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mertz v.
