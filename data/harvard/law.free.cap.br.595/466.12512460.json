Background of the Chapter 11 Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 6, 2016, the above-captioned debtors (the \"Debtors\") filed voluntary petitions with this Court for relief under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"). On September 21, 2017, the Debtors filed the Amended Joint Plan for La Paloma Generating Company, LLC, et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Plan\"). On October 30, 2017, the Court confirmed the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. First-Lien Obligations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   LNV is the sole lender under (i) the First-Lien Working Capital Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2014, by and between LPGC, the First-Lien Lender and L/C issuers party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the \"First-Lien WCF Agreement); and (ii) the First-Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2014, by and between LPGC, the First-Lien Lender, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the \"First-Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement\"). The obligations under the First-Lien WCF Agreement and the First-Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (collectively, the \"First-Lien Obligations\"), are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Debtors pursuant to, among other things, the (i) Second Amended and Restated Deed of Trust Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing, dated as of February 20, 2014, and recorded on February 24, 2014 with the Kern County, California Recorder's Office (the \"Deed of Trust\") and (ii) the First-Lien Security Agreement, dated as of August\n   16, 2015 (the \"First-Lien Security Agreement\"). The First-Lien Security Agreement was reaffirmed under the First-Lien WCF Agreement and First-Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement pursuant to that certain Reaffirmation and Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2014 (the \"Reaffirmation Agreement\"). Under the First-Lien Security Agreement and the Deed of Trust, proceeds of a sale of the Debtors' assets are to be distributed through the Collateral Agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Second-Lien Obligations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 20, 2014, LPGC entered into that certain Second Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the \"Second-Lien Credit Agreement\"), by and among LPGC, SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent (the \"Second-Lien Administrative Agent\"), Macquarie Bank Limited, as the letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto (the \"Second-Lien Lenders\"). The Debtors' obligations under the Second-Lien Credit Agreement (the \"Second-Lien Obligations\") are secured by the same assets as the First-Lien Obligations on a junior basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Intercreditor Agreement\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 16, 2005, the Debtors, the Collateral Agent, the administrative agents under each of the First-Lien WCF Agreement, the First-Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Second-Lien Credit Agreement, and certain other parties entered into the Intercreditor Agreement. Section 9.9 of the Intercreditor Agreement expressly provides that it \"shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York ....\" The Intercreditor Agreement was reaffirmed under the First-Lien WCF Agreement, the First-Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Second-Lien Credit Agreement pursuant to the Reaffirmation Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As Section 3.1(k) of the Intercreditor Agreement expressly permits, the Second-Lien Agent filed a proof of claim (the \"Second-Lien Claim\"). The Second-Lien Claim expressly states: \"This Claim is a secured claim to the extent of the Debtor's interest in the Collateral, pursuant to the Security Agreements, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and applicable law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Second-Lien Claim also notes that \"the Debtor has asserted that the foregoing security interest is unperfected, at least with respect to the Collateral that is not the subject of the foregoing Deed of Trust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Settlement and the Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtors filed the Plan on September 21, 2017, incorporating a settlement\n   reached with LNV following extensive settlement negotiations. The settlement resolves a number of disputes relating, in part, to the lapsed UCC financing statement filed in favor of the Collateral Agent (the \"First Lien Settlement\"). These settled issues include (i) the amount of LNV's credit bid and secured claim, (ii) the extent to which the assets to be sold are subject to a perfected lien and (iii) the extent to which the Debtors' postpetition revenue is subject to perfected lien. Among other things, the Plan provides that LNV will credit bid for the Debtors' power facility and related assets, LNV will receive certain cash indisputably pledged to it, the liens of the Collateral Agent are left intact, and the First-Lien Lender has agreed to forego the benefit of its liens on certain assets for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Distributions that theoretically would go to the Second-Lien Lenders on account of their unsecured claim (which is their entire claim), i.e., the Contested Funds, are to be held in reserve with the Collateral Agent (commensurate with the First-Lien Security Agreement, Deed of Trust and Intercreditor Agreement) pending a determination by this Court as to whether the Second-Lien Lenders are entitled to such distribution in light of the Intercreditor Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan also provides that the Intercreditor Agreement \"shall remain in full force and effect\" and \"shall be fully enforceable according to its terms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \"[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable non-bankruptcy law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under New York law, which governs the Intercreditor Agreement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court need not look \"outside the four corners\" of a complete document to determine what the parties intended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, neither party has alleged that the Intercreditor Agreement is an incomplete document, so it is not necessary to resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret it. Moreover, neither party contends that any term in the Intercreditor Agreement is ambiguous-instead, each party relies on its own \"plain reading\" in reaching competing results. A contract is not ambiguous merely because the parties offer different constructions of the same term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that the Intercreditor Agreement is not ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the Court reaches the conclusion that the Intercreditor Agreement is unambiguous, the Court then relies on long-recognized canons of interpretation to determine its meaning. First, \"[t]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, should there be an inconsistency between a specific and general provision of a contract, the specific controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, \"[a] reading of the contract should not render any portion meaningless.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   LNV asserts that under the explicit terms \"all principal and other amounts\" payable to the First-Lien Lender in respect of the First-Lien Obligations must be paid in full before the Second-Lien Lenders are allowed to receive any recovery on account of the Second Lien Obligations. The Second-Lien Lenders assert that because the First-Liens lapsed\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the Petition Date, that all money should be distributed in accordance with the Plan, which includes to the Second-Lien Lenders pursuant to their proof of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Payments Over\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Section 4.2 of the Intercreditor Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Payments Over.\n   </strong>\n   (a) So long as the Discharge of First-Lien Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any Bankruptcy has\n   <strong>\n    been\n   </strong>\n   commenced by or against La Paloma or any other Grantor,\n   <em>\n    any Collateral or proceeds thereof\n   </em>\n   (including assets or proceedings subject to Liens referred to in the final sentence of Section 2.3) received by Second-Lien Administrative Agent, the MS Counterpart, any other Second-Lien Claimholder, or any Third-Lien Claimholder\n   <em>\n    in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off) by the Collateral Agent or any such Person relating to the Collateral in contravention of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith paid over to the Collateral Agreement (for the benefit of the First-Lien Claimholders) ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to Section 4.2(a), LNV must show that each of this section's four elements are satisfied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   i. The distribution must be \"Collateral or proceeds thereof;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ii. The distribution must be received \"in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy\" by the Second-Lien Claimholders;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   iii. Any such exercise of a right or remedy must \"relat[e] to the Collateral;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   iv. The exercise of such right or remedy must be \"in contravention of this [Intercreditor] Agreement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Not surprisingly, LNV asserts that all four elements are met and the Second-Lien Lenders argue that three have not been met. Pursuant to the First-Lien settlement, distributions that theoretically would go to the Second-Lien Lenders on account of their unsecured claim (which is their entire claim) are being held with the Collateral Agent pending determination of these Motions. As such, the Court will go through each element in turn:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    (i) \"Any Collateral or proceeds thereof.\"\n   </em>\n   Section 1.2 of the Intercreditor Agreement defines \"Collateral\" as \"all of the Property of any Grantor, whether real, personal, mixed, constituting or intending to constitute all of the First-Lien Collateral, the Second-Lien Collateral or the\n   Third-Lien Collateral.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Section 2.1(b) of the Intercreditor Agreement clarifies that the First-Lien Lenders' priority over the Second-Lien Lenders in Collateral is not affected by any issue concerning \"(iii) the perfection of or avoidability of such liens or claims secured [by the First-Lien Security Agreement or] ... (vi) any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, the Liens securing the First-Lien Obligations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the prepetition lapse of the First-Lien Holders' claims does not give rise to issues between and among the First-Lien and Second-Lien Lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Second-Lien Lenders assert, without argument, that there\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   to be unencumbered assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, without argument or reference to the documentation regarding such unencumbered assets, the Court is hard-pressed to find that such a broad definition of \"Collateral\" does not include substantially all of the assets of the Debtors. Substantially all of the Debtors' assets were sold pursuant to the Plan\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the sale proceeds were distributed as part of the confirmed Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Intuitively, there are no truer definition of \"proceeds of Collateral\" other than the proceeds from the sale of that Collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that regard, the Court finds that distributions pursuant to the Plan are \"Collateral or proceeds thereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) \"Exercise of Remedies.\"\n   </em>\n   The Second-Lien Lenders asserts that\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   the distributions are Collateral or proceeds thereof, such distributions are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   being \"received ... in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy.\" The Second-Lien Lenders claims that such distributions would be from its proof of claim and not and exercise of any right or remedy. Here, the Intercreditor Agreement authorizes the Second-Lien Lenders, through their Agent, to file a proof of claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   LNV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   asserts that the Second-Lien Lenders have been active participants in these cases and have continually advocated for distributions which\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   an exercise of their remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The parties refer to this Court's opinions in\n   <em>\n    Energy Future Holdings\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   to argue whether the Second-Lien Holder's filing of a proof of claim was an \"exercise of remedies.\" Therein, and in both\n   <em>\n    EFH I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    EFH II\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that it was \"not inclined to hold that filing a proof of claim was an exercise of remedies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Energy Future Holdings\n   </em>\n   , the intercreditor agreement in dispute defined \"exercise of remedies\" and such definition did not include the filing of a claim; the cash collateral order entered by the Court in those cases specifically stated that the first lien creditors were exempted from filing a proof of claim, and the proof of claim played no role in generating plan distributions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Contrary to the\n   <em>\n    Energy Future Holdings\n   </em>\n   intercreditor agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement explicitly includes filing a proof of claim amount the \"exercise of remedies\" in Section 3.1. Section 3.1(a)(i) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In exercising rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral, the Collateral Agent, at the direction of an Act of Required Lenders, may enforce the provisions of the First-Lien Collateral Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of the Collateral Agent to sell or otherwise dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition, and to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the UCC and the First-Lien Collateral Documents and of a secured creditor under Bankruptcy Laws of any applicable jurisdiction; provided that unless and until the Collateral Agent shall have received such direction, the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, in order to preserve or protect its Liens on and the value of the Collateral, with respect to any Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Secured Parties....\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Such language is substantially repeated in Section 3.1(a)(ii) regarding the Second-Lien Lenders. In other words, exercise of remedies is about foreclosure and seizing property pursuant to various restrictions. However, Section 3.1(k) of the Intercreditor Agreement also explicitly states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Second-Lien Administrative Agent, MS Counterparty and each other Second-Lien Claimholder may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) file a claim or statement of interest in a Bankruptcy of La Paloma or any other Grantor ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In other word, notwithstanding all of these rules and restrictions on how to exercise remedies, the Second-Lien Claimholders may, as an\n   <em>\n    exercise of remedies\n   </em>\n   , file a\n   claim. The Intercreditor Agreement explicitly states that one of the many things that the Second-Lien Lenders may do, in order to exercise its remedies, is to file a claim. Language which was missing from the intercreditor agreement in\n   <em>\n    Energy Future Holdings\n   </em>\n   . As such, the Court finds that in this case, a filing of a proof of claim is an \"exercise of remedies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    (iii) Exercise of Remedies must relate to the Collateral\n   </em>\n   . The next question is whether the filing of the proof of claim relates to the collateral. Section 3.1(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Except as specifically set forth herein or in the Security Deposit Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the receipt by the Second-Lien Administrative Agent, MS Counterparty or any other Second-Lien Claimholders of the required payments of Interest Expense, principal and other amounts owed in respect of the Second-Lien Obligations so long as such receipt is not the direct or indirect result of the\n   <em>\n    exercise\n   </em>\n   by the Collateral Agent (on behalf of the Second-Lien Claimholders), the Second-Lien Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Second-Lien Term Loan Claimholders), MS Counterparty or any other Second-Lien Claimholder\n   <em>\n    of rights or remedies as a secured creditor\n   </em>\n   (including set-off)\n   <em>\n    or enforcement in contravention of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   of any Lien held by any of them or as otherwise expressly prohibited hereby.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As filing of a proof of claim is an exercise of remedies under the Intercreditor Agreement and it specifically relates to the Second-Lien Lenders' claims under the Second-Lien Agreement, the Court finds that such exercise of rights relates to the Collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    (iv) In contravention of the Intercreditor Agreement.\n   </em>\n   The Court reads this phrase to mean that the Second-Lien Lenders would have received the funds to \"pay over\" in \"contravention of the agreement.\" Here, as filing a proof of claim is permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Second Lien Holders would not be receiving these \"funds\" in contravention of the Agreement. However, if the Second-Lien Lenders received proceeds before the First-Lien Obligations are satisfied in full as a result of exercising the Second-Lien Holder's rights or remedies (i.e. filing a proof of claim), then Section 3.1(c) of the Intercreditor Agreement would be violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Additional Elements\n   </em>\n   . An element not discussed by the Second-Lien Lenders is the phrase \"[s]o long as the Discharge of the First-Lien Obligations has not occurred.\" LNV asserts that the First-Lien Lender's claim is deemed allowed under the First-Lien Settlement in the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the First-Liens' UCC filings lapsed prior to the Petition Date, they are valid as to the Second-Lien Lenders who entered into an Intercreditor Agreement acknowledging the First-Liens and who are not \"surprised\" by the existence of the First-Liens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even though the Second-Lien Lenders have not actually received any monies to \"pay over,\" if they did, Section 4.2 of the Intercreditor Agreement would require that such monies be \"paid over\" to the First-Lien Lenders. Thus, Section 4.2 of the Intercreditor Agreement dictates if the Second-Lien Lenders do collect monies from Plan distributions, collected as a result of exercising their remedies under the Intercreditor Agreement, that such funds must be \"paid over\" to the First-Lien Lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Thereafter, Section 4.2(a) states that the Collateral or proceeds thereof are remitted to the Collateral Agent and the Collateral Agent must then make distributions of such assets pursuant to the waterfall of Section 4.1(a) of the Intercreditor Agreement. As set forth above, LNV meets all the criteria of Section 4.2(a); thus, the Court will look to the waterfall in Section 4.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

These contractual provisions are obviously designed to ensure that the senior loan is paid in full before Highland is permitted to keep any money received in repayment of the mezzanine loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although the\n   <em>\n    Highland Park\n   </em>\n   intercreditor agreement specifically provides for \"Payment Subordination,\" it also stands for the proposition that intercreditor agreements delineate the relationship between groups of creditors. Furthermore, the Intercreditor Agreement states that the First-Lien Obligations shall be satisfied in full prior to the payment of the Second-Lien Obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, throughout the pendency of the bankruptcy cases, no party-in-interest sought to avoid, or avoided, the First-Lien Claims. Furthermore, First-Lien Claims were reinstated as part of the Settlement embodied in the plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the First-Lien Claims are in full force and effect as to the Debtors and the Second-Lien Lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ion Media Networks, Inc. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Ion Media\n   </em>\n   court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Giving effect to the plain language of the Intercreditor Agreement in this manner also reinforces general principles of public policy. Affirming the legal efficacy of unambiguous intercreditor agreements leads to more predictable and efficient commercial outcomes and minimizes the potential for wasteful and vexatious litigation. The sophisticated parties who entered into the Intercreditor Agreement were certainly aware of the nature of ION's business and the well-known restrictions and limitations applicable to security interests in FCC Licenses.
