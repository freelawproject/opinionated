For the reasons set forth below, the Court affirms the Judgment on the Pleadings, Declaratory Judgment, and Fee Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The litigation history between the parties, including Dex Media's wholly owned subsidiary SuperMedia, LLC (\"SuperMedia\"), is significant in each of these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. License\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SuperMedia publishes yellow pages telephone directories and provides print, mobile, and Internet advertising to small- and medium-sized businesses. (DEX 560 \u00b6 10). Years ago, SuperMedia was the yellow pages publishing arm of Verizon, operating under the name Verizon Directories Corp. (\"Verizon Directories\"). On November 12, 2001, Verizon Directories agreed to license a total of 5,000 stock photographs from a Florida company then known as Yellow Pages Photos, Inc. (\"Old YPPI\"), a company wholly owned and operated by Trent Moore (\"Moore\"). Verizon Directories, \"on behalf of itself and all of its affiliates,\" entered into a Service Contractor Agreement with Old YPPI (the \"License\" or \"License Agreement\"). (DEX 577). The License granted Verizon Directories a \"perpetual\" right to use Old YPPI's 5,000 images (the \"Licensed Images\") in any \"print, electronic or other medium that may be used by Verizon Directories for publication of directories without limit, ROYALTY FREE.\" (DEX 589). In exchange, Verizon Directories paid Old YPPI a total of $660,000, the final installment of which was paid in 2004. (DEX 658 \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The License contained a transfer restriction, providing that Verizon Directories \"may not transfer these images to other parties or individuals unless authorized by YPPI; provided however, that Verizon Directories is authorized... to utilize these photographs and images in the advertising purchased by its customers ....\" (DEX 590). The License also contained an anti-assignment provision, which stated that Old YPPI \"shall not assign its rights nor delegate its duties under this Agreement ... to any third party[ ] without Verizon Directories' prior written consent in each instance.\" (DEX 584 \u00a7 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2006, Moore changed the name of Old YPPI - the Florida company that had licensed the images to Verizon Directories - to AdMedia Systems, Inc. (\"AdMedia\"). (DEX 561 \u00b6 13). At the same time, Moore created a second Florida company and named it, confusingly, \"Yellow Pages Photos, Inc.\" (\"YPPI\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thereafter, AdMedia assigned its copyrights in the Licensed Images to this new YPPI, despite the License's anti-assignment provision. Moore did not inform anyone at Verizon Directories (or its successors) that he had created a second company called \"Yellow Pages Photos, Inc.\" or that AdMedia had assigned its copyrights to this new company. (DEX 504-506). In November 2006, Verizon Directories spun off its directory publication business into a public company, Idearc Media Corp. (\"Idearc\"), which succeeded to Verizon Directories' rights under the License. (DEX 561, \u00b6 14). In July 2007, Idearc and Moore agreed to amend the License to clarify that Idearc's contractors were authorized \"users\" of those images. (YPPI Appx. 65-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 31, 2009, Idearc filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the \"Idearc Bankruptcy\"). (YPPI Appx. 5, \u00b6 14; 6, \u00b6 16);\n   <em>\n    In re Idearc Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790342\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/423/138/\">\n    423 B.R. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2009). Its Chapter 11 plan of reorganization listed all contracts to which Idearc was a party under its schedule of executory contracts. Idearc assumed the License without objection from YPPI. (YPPI Appx. 6, \u00b6 16). On December 31, 2009, Idearc emerged from bankruptcy as SuperMedia LLC (\"SuperMedia\"), which now enjoyed the right to use YPPI's images under the License. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nearly four years later, on March 18, 2013, SuperMedia's parent company, SuperMedia, Inc., commenced a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding before The Honorable Kevin Gross in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. (YPPI Appx. 7, \u00b6 21). The Chapter 11 plan contemplated a merger between SuperMedia, Inc. and Dex One Corporation, with the merged entity called Dex Media; SuperMedia would emerge from bankruptcy as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Dex Media. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ). The Bankruptcy Court confirmed SuperMedia's plan of reorganization on April 29, 2013, and the plan went effective the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Since then, Dex Media has been the holding company and indirect parent to SuperMedia. (YPPI Appx. 7, \u00b6 21; 12, \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SuperMedia Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 30, 2013, YPPI filed two claims against SuperMedia's estate, both of which alleged that SuperMedia breached the License and, as a result, infringed YPPI's copyrights. YPPI's first claim was a motion for the allowance and payment of an administrative expense claim that alleged that the License was valid and enforceable and that SuperMedia violated its transfer restriction during the \"administrative expense period\" - the period between when SuperMedia filed for bankruptcy protection (March 18, 2013) and when it emerged\n   from bankruptcy (April 29, 2013) (the \"Administrative Expense Claim\"). (DEX 9-14). YPPI's second claim was a Proof of Claim that likewise alleged that the License was valid and enforceable and that SuperMedia breached its transfer restriction but that covered the time period before SuperMedia filed for bankruptcy (the \"Prepetition Claim\"). (YPPI Appx. 41-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over the next three years, YPPI litigated its claims against SuperMedia before the Bankruptcy Court, which, as the record reflects, included two phases of fact and expert discovery, dozens of discovery disputes, multiple dispositive motions, two trials, and more than 40 hours of testimony (the \"SuperMedia Litigation\"). The SuperMedia Litigation was premised on YPPI's allegation that SuperMedia \"violated the transfer restriction set forth in the License by transferring the Licensed Images to third parties\" and the third-party transferees used the images without authorization. (DEX 601, \u00b6 15; 13, \u00b6 19). One of the alleged third-party transferees was Dex Media. (DEX 117-18; DEX 60; DEX 39 (\"SuperMedia has transferred copies of Yellow Pages' images to a number of unlicensed third-parties ..., and there is evidence of the images being used for at least one unlicensed publisher, SuperMedia's affiliate Dex.\") ). YPPI maintained that the License was a valid and enforceable contract, as both of its claims hinged on the allegation that SuperMedia breached the transfer restriction in the License. Specifically, YPPI alleged that the License passed through the Idearc Bankruptcy and that \"Idearc Media's rights under the Agreement and the License ... vested in SuperMedia.\" (DEX 74-75, \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   YPPI Appx. 45, \u00b6 11 (\"As successor to Idearc, SuperMedia, LLC[ ] remained bound by the Agreement and the License with YPPI under all of the terms and provisions of the License ...\") ). YPPI also sought to recover attorneys' fees under the License.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. YPPI's Assumption Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   YPPI filed a Motion to Compel Assumption or Rejection of Executory Contract (the \"Assumption Motion\") before the Bankruptcy Court. (DEX 1-8). In its Assumption Motion, YPPI \"maintain[ed] that the License is an executory contract and, consequently, must be either assumed or rejected by the Debtors as part of their bankruptcy case.\" (DEX 5, \u00b6 18). On October 9, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied the Assumption Motion, ruling that the \"License is not an executory contract.\"\n   <em>\n    In re SuperMedia, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205567838\">\n    2013 WL 5567838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Del. Oct. 9, 2013). The Bankruptcy Court noted that \"[f]or a contract to be executory, there must be unperformed obligations on behalf of both parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Here, once \"delivery of the images and the payments were completed nearly ten years ago [in 2005], the parties ha[d] received the benefit of their bargain\" and no unperformed obligations remained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   YPPI moved for reconsideration of the denial of its Assumption Motion. (DEX 28-39). The Bankruptcy Court denied that motion, reiterating its holding that the License is not an executory contract. (DEX 40-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. YPPI's Administrative Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 9, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court commenced a three-day bench trial on YPPI's Administrative Expense Claim. YPPI introduced evidence of allegedly infringing advertising videos that had been created for Dex Media by an outsourcer called bieMedia. (DEX 155 at 15:6-10; DEX 158-59 at 18:22-19:22). YPPI argued that SuperMedia was responsible for these infringing videos, arguing that bieMedia could only have obtained copies of the Licensed Images used in the videos from SuperMedia because, according to YPPI, it \"never sold any images to ... outsourcer[s\n   ]\" such as bieMedia. (DEX 164 at 23:17-19). In an opinion dated December 29, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court held that SuperMedia breached the License by transferring YPPI's images to its third-party contractors, but it did so\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   SuperMedia filed for bankruptcy protection.\n   <em>\n    In re SuperMedia, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207403448\">\n    2014 WL 7403448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *13 (Bankr. D. Del. Dec. 29, 2014). The Bankruptcy Court found no evidence of any such transfers during the administrative expense period, (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207403448\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), and, therefore, denied YPPI's Administrative Expense Claim. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207403448\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at * 19-*20 ). On February 11, 2015, YPPI moved for reconsideration of the Bankruptcy Court's denial of its Administrative Expense Claim. (DEX 218-223). In that motion, YPPI again argued that SuperMedia had \"transferred the Licensed Images to Dex Media.\" (DEX 221, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13). The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion for reconsideration, holding that there was no evidence of a \"deliberate physical transfer\" of the Licensed Images to Dex Media. Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court held: \"The transfer of the Licensed Images resulted from the merger between SuperMedia, Inc. and Dex One. It was the combining of operations between SuperMedia, Inc. (SuperMedia's parent) and Dex One that created the 'transfer,' not a deliberate physical transfer. [Thus] the merger between SuperMedia's parent and DexMedia did not result in a transfer which would constitute a tortious act.\" (DEX 224-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Rule 60(b) Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 12, 2015, SuperMedia filed an adversary proceeding formally objecting to YPPI's Prepetition Claim (discussed below). (DEX 242-52). During discovery, it came to light that YPPI had licensed its images to several outsourcers, including bieMedia. (DEX 227-33). This was contrary to Moore's prior testimony that YPPI had never licensed its images to \"outsourcers,\" and, therefore, if any outsourcers were in possession of YPPI's images, they must have come from SuperMedia. (DEX 164 at 23:17-19). On May 29, 2015, SuperMedia filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and sought sanctions against YPPI and its counsel for false representations to the Bankruptcy Court (\" Rule 60(b) Motion\"). (DEX 227). On September 3, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Rule 60(b) Motion in part (\" Rule 60(b) Opinion\"), finding that YPPI intentionally \"hid\" its license with bieMedia (and a license with another outsource, ASEC) from both SuperMedia and the Bankruptcy Court, and that YPPI and its counsel made \"deliberate misrepresentations and non-disclosures\" before, during, and after the April 2014 trial. (DEX 226-239). The Bankruptcy Court found \"most egregious\" the fact that Moore \"forcefully testified under oath, testimony which profoundly affected the Court's Opinion.\" (DEX 230). Based on these findings, the Bankruptcy Court sanctioned YPPI and its counsel, barring recovery for any alleged transfers to bieMedia or other outsourcers whose licenses had been concealed. (DEX 238). The Bankruptcy Court further awarded $111,679 to SuperMedia for its fees and costs in bringing the Rule 60(b) Motion. (DEX 240-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    4. AdMedia Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court scheduled a trial on YPPI's Prepetition Claim for November 2015. In July 2015, SuperMedia deposed Moore and learned that the \"Yellow Pages Photos, Inc.\" that had filed claims in the Bankruptcy Court was\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the same entity that signed the License. (DEX 271-72). The counterparty to the License was Old YPPI, which had since changed its name to AdMedia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). SuperMedia was granted leave to amend its complaint in the adversary proceeding to assert that YPPI did not have standing to enforce the License.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Just before trial began, YPPI filed a motion to join AdMedia as an \"alternatively pled creditor.\" (DEX 342-50). In a separate post-trial opinion (\"AdMedia Decision\"), the Bankruptcy Court denied that motion, holding that YPPI acted with undue delay and in \"bad faith,\" had \"deceived\" the Court and SuperMedia by \"omitting from its filings facts essential for adjudication of this case,\" and \"actively concealed\" the fact that the YPPI before the Bankruptcy Court was a different entity than the YPPI that had entered into the License. (DEX 504; DEX 520; DEX 524).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Prepetition Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 23, 2015, shortly before the trial on YPPI's Prepetition Claim began, YPPI filed an amended Proof of Claim, raising a new theory of liability - the \"failure to assume\" theory. (DEX 306-336) (\"Amended Proof of Claim\"). As in the original Proof of Claim, the Amended Proof of Claim continued to allege that the License was valid and enforceable and that SuperMedia breached the transfer restriction in the License. (DEX 316, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25). In the alternative, however, YPPI now alleged that the License was invalid and unenforceable because SuperMedia's predecessor, Idearc, failed properly to assume the License during its 2009 bankruptcy. (DEX 314, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). Specifically, YPPI alleged that Idearc breached the License before the Idearc Bankruptcy, \"failed to cure\" these breaches during its 2009 bankruptcy, and thus could not assume the License when it exited bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). YPPI maintained, if Idearc did not properly assume the License, then \"\n   <em>\n    any use\n   </em>\n   or transfer of the Licensed Images by SuperMedia\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     at any point in time\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   has been a violation of Yellow Pages' copyrights in the Licensed Images.\" (DEX 316, \u00b6 26). Prior to the November 2015 trial, however, YPPI abandoned its \"failure to assume\" theory and, instead, pressed forward with its original claim that the License was a valid agreement that SuperMedia breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The November 2015 trial of YPPI's Prepetition Claim focused on the damages attributable to SuperMedia's pre-petition breach of the License's transfer restriction. In an attempt to establish the value of the YPPI images that SuperMedia transferred to its contractors, YPPI introduced evidence of \"hundreds\" of print advertisements containing the Licensed Images, which had been published in \"Dex Media\" directories. (Adv. No. 15-50044-KG, D.I. 153, 11/15/15 Hr'g Tr. at 164:17-190:1). The evidence that YPPI introduced included a yellow pages directory published by Dex Media in 2015, which contained print advertisements using YPPI images. (DEX 487 at 72:11-15). While YPPI cited the use of its images in print advertisements as evidence of the images' value, YPPI conceded that the use of its images in print advertisement - including in the 2015 directory-was\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   an infringing use. YPPI's counsel stated: \"[W]e don't dispute, of course, that they license[d] the images and they were allowed to use them in printouts.\" (DEX 381 at 62:21-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DEX 408 at 186:22 (\"I'm not saying the uses are infringing.\")). YPPI's principal, Moore, admitted the same thing while testifying under oath: \"I do not think that the print ad is a violation of the license agreement.\" (DEX 415 at 269:7-17). Moore's testimony on this point was clear: Q. \"And SuperMedia was allowed to use your images in print ads, correct?\" A. \"Yes, they were.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 269:12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 4, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court handed down its \"final decision on the merits\" of the SuperMedia Litigation.\n   <em>\n    In re SuperMedia LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201367070\">\n    2016 WL 1367070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr D. Del. April 4, 2016) (\"April 2016 Opinion\"). The Bankruptcy Court held that YPPI could not recover statutory damages\n   or attorneys' fees under the Copyright Act because it had failed to timely register its copyrights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The Bankruptcy Court further held that YPPI could not recover attorneys' fees under the License because AdMedia, not YPPI, was the real party to the License.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   YPPI was left with a claim for actual damages based upon SuperMedia's unauthorized transfers to its contractors. The Bankruptcy Court awarded YPPI $303,210 in actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. SuperMedia has paid that judgment in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Dex Media Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Florida Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 29, 2016, less than a month after the Bankruptcy Court's April 2016 Opinion, YPPI sued SuperMedia's parent, Dex Media, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleging that Dex Media infringed YPPI's copyrights on the same 5,000 images at issue in the SuperMedia Litigation. On July 8, 2016, Dex Media responded to that complaint by filing the instant Adversary Proceeding in its pending Chapter 11 case before Judge Gross (the \"Dex Media Litigation\"). (YPPI Appx. 1-86). In its adversary complaint, Dex Media objected to YPPI's claims against its estate and sought a declaratory judgment that Dex Media \"has not infringed any of the Licensed Images ....\" (YPPI Appx. 13-14, \u00b6 43). Given the extensive overlap with the SuperMedia Litigation, the Bankruptcy Court agreed to exercise jurisdiction over the Adversary Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 30, 2016, YPPI filed its Answer and Counterclaims in the Dex Media Litigation, asserting copyright infringement against Dex Media (\"Counterclaims\"). (YPPI Appx. 87-117). YPPI's Counterclaims were premised on the same \"failure to assume\" theory that YPPI previously raised, and abandoned, in the SuperMedia Litigation. Specifically, in the Dex Media Litigation, YPPI alleged that the License was \"never effectively assumed in the Idearc Bankruptcy Case\" due to Idearc's failure to cure existing breaches and, as a result, \"no rights under the [License] remained or otherwise inured to the benefit of SuperMedia following the Idearc Bankruptcy confirmation hearing.\" (YPPI Appx. 107-09, \u00b6\u00b6 36-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   YPPI's Counterclaims against Dex Media also relied on two propositions that contradicted YPPI's representations during the SuperMedia Litigation. First, whereas in the SuperMedia Litigation, YPPI alleged that the License was a valid agreement that had fully \"vested in SuperMedia,\" (DEX 74-75, \u00b6 11); in the Dex Media Litigation, YPPI asserted that SuperMedia had \"no rights\" under the License as of December 30, 2009. (YPPI Appx. 107-09, \u00b6\u00b6 36-45). Second, whereas in the SuperMedia Litigation, YPPI represented that the use of YPPI's images in print advertisements published in Dex Media directories was not an infringing use; in the Dex Media Litigation, YPPI alleged that those same print advertisements infringed YPPI's copyrights. (YPPI Appx. 110, \u00b6 51). YPPI's Counterclaims in the Dex Media Litigation also alleged that the License was an executory contract (YPPI Appx. 105-06, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32), even though the Bankruptcy Court twice held it was no longer executory as of 2005 in ruling on the Assumption Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Dex Media filed a Motion to Dismiss YPPI's Counterclaims and for Judgment on the Pleadings (the \"Motion for Judgment\"). (YPPI Appx. 406-510). Dex Media advanced four grounds in support of its Motion for Judgment: (1) YPPI's claims were barred by claim preclusion or\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ; (2) YPPI's claims\n   were barred by judicial estoppel; (3) YPPI's claims were barred by collateral estoppel; and (4) YPPI failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. (YPPI Appx. 412-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On January 19, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Judgment on the Pleadings on three of the four grounds: claim preclusion (\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ), judicial estoppel, and collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dex Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n    564 B.R. at 214-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the Bankruptcy Court held that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   applied because \"the claims in both actions are similar if not identical\" such that \"[t]rying the Dex Media case would be a retrial of the SuperMedia Litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n    at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Bankruptcy Court held that judicial estoppel barred YPPI's claims in the Dex Media Litigation because they were an \"improper\" attempt to \"flip-flop\" on its positions on the validity of the License and the non-infringing nature of print ads.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n    at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, the Bankruptcy Court held that collateral estoppel barred YPPI's claims in the Dex Media Litigation because they depended on two elements essential to its Counterclaims: the executory nature of the License, and a transfer of the Licensed Images to Dex Media. The Bankruptcy Court stated, \"[i]t is abundantly clear that the Court adjudicated both of these issues, and that the determination was necessary to the court's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n    at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court entered its Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Judgment on the Pleadings in favor of Dex Media. On January 30, 2017, YPPI filed its notice of appeal of the Judgment on the Pleadings. (Adv. D.I. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Declaratory Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thereafter, Dex Media filed a \"Certification of Counsel\" and proposed form of Declaratory Judgment on the basis that the Bankruptcy Court failed to enter a judgment \"in a separate document\" as required by Rule 58(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Adv. D.I. 49). YPPI opposed entry of judgment, arguing that the deadline for filing a motion for an award of attorneys' fees expired on February 2, 2017, that Dex Media had missed the deadline, and that the request for entry of the separate Declaratory Judgment was a ploy to \"reset the clock\" so that Dex Media could timely file a motion for attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B)(i) (a motion for attorneys' fees \"must ... be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment.\"). On March 8, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Declaratory Judgment. (Adv. D.I. 55). On March 13, 2017, YPPI filed its notice of appeal of the Declaratory Judgment. (Adv. D.I. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Fee Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On March 23, 2017, Dex Media submitted its Amended Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs under Section 505 of the Copyright Act. (Adv. D.I. 64). Prior to responding, YPPI was permitted to take the deposition of not only the lead partner representing Dex Media, but also one of the associates on the Dex Media team. (Adv. D.I. 76 at \u00b6 15; Adv. D.I. 81). Following those depositions, YPPI submitted its opposition to Dex Media's fee application. (Adv. D.I. 91). Dex Media submitted its reply brief on June 26, 2017. (Adv. D.I. 94). The Bankruptcy Court heard oral argument on Dex Media's fee application on January 11, 2018. (Adv. D.I. 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On January 30, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Memorandum Opinion granting the Fee Award. (Adv. D.I. 104 &amp; 105). The Bankruptcy Court agreed with YPPI that \"a court may not award attorneys' fees as a matter of course but only after making a 'particularized case-by-case assessment.' \" (Adv. D.I. 104 at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kirtsaeng v.

Given the facts of\n   this case, however, the Bankruptcy Court was \"convinced beyond near certainty that YPPI's lawsuit against Dex Media was a situation of 'objective unreasonableness.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kirtsaeng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1985 ) ). In reaching this conclusion, the Bankruptcy Court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In its lawsuit YPPI is making claims contrary to its previous representations to the Court in the SuperMedia action. For instance, in the prior SuperMedia action, YPPI claimed that the license was valid, enforceable and that print advertisements were not infringement. In its new action, YPPI instead claims that the License was not valid and therefore SuperMedia and its affiliates and customers had no right to use the License. There are other inconsistencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Bankruptcy Court further held that fee shifting was warranted based upon considerations of deterrence, finding that it is \"very important for SuperMedia to end YPPI's harassment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As the Bankruptcy Court found: \"YPPI filed the Dex Media lawsuit [in Florida] mere weeks after the Court's ruling in the SuperMedia case. YPPI waited months to serve Dex Media with the Complaint in the Florida Action. The Complaint in the Florida Action also asserts positions contrary to YPPI's claims in previous litigation. Deterrence is therefore an important consideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). To determine a reasonable fee award, the Bankruptcy Court \"reviewed the Dex Media attorneys' time records - line by line.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). \"For each and every time record, the [Bankruptcy] Court used its independent judgment to approximate the time necessary for the dispute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on this analysis, the Bankruptcy Court awarded Dex Media fees of $504,025.50 and expenses of $2,522.45 - a reduction of roughly 33% of the fees and expenses Dex Media incurred, and paid, in defending against YPPI's claims.

Specifically, YPPI's Counterclaims allege that Idearc \"failed to assume\" the License Agreement during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, rendering the License unenforceable on December 30, 2009, such that SuperMedia therefore had \"no rights\" according to YPPI to use the Licensed Images. (DEX 663 \u00b6 35; DEX 665 \u00b6 45). YPPI admits that it raised this same \"failure to assume\" theory of liability in the SuperMedia Litigation (YPPI Br. at 15): indeed, in its Amended Proof of Claim, YPPI alleged in the SuperMedia Litigation that, \"as successor to Idearc,\" SuperMedia \"did not effectively assume the Agreement\" and, as a result, \"any use or transfer of the Licensed Images by SuperMedia at any point in time has been a violation of Yellow Pages' copyrights in the Licensed Images.\" (YPPI Appx. 421).

According to YPPI, the Counterclaims assert instances of copyright infringement that post-date the complaint filed in the SuperMedia Litigation: that Dex Media published ads containing YPPI copyrighted images in telephone directories \"since May 1, 2013\" - after SuperMedia's April 30, 2013 plan confirmation date. (YPPI Br. at 23-24). Because these instances of infringement occurred after the filing of the SuperMedia Litigation, YPPI argues that its Counterclaims are not barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion. YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court \"expressly declined\" to apply the Third Circuit decision in\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    , and its holding must be reversed. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court does not agree. The Bankruptcy Court distinguished the claims in\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    from the Counterclaims in this case, which are based on events that pre-date the filing of the SuperMedia Litigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at 213-14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As YPPI admits, to prevail on its Counterclaims against Dex Media, \"YPPI needs to prove that Dex Media published YPPI's copyrighted images without having a license.\" (YPPI Br. at 31). According to YPPI, the reason that Dex Media did not have a license is Idearc's breach and failure to assume the License in 2009, which would have occurred years before the filing of either the SuperMedia Litigation or the Dex Media Litigation, and which YPPI knew had occurred before the conclusion of the SuperMedia Litigation.\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at 215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because the Counterclaims are premised on an event that already occurred at the time of the prior suit,\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    may apply even if plaintiffs alleged new facts that occurred after the first suit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Foster v.

That the Counterclaims allege new infringement claims post-dating the SuperMedia Litigation is inconsequential where, as here, they are based on the same \"failure to assume\" theory that YPPI raised and abandoned in the SuperMedia Litigation in favor of its theory that the License was effectively assumed but later breached. Recognizing that it could not pursue such inconsistent theories of liability at trial, YPPI chose to abandon its \"failure to assume\" argument in the SuperMedia Litigation and cannot resurrect it now. The Bankruptcy Court correctly determined that \"abandoning a claim does not negate claim preclusion which is based on what was or could have been asserted.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    214 (citing\n    <em>\n     SupplyOne, Inc. v.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Br. at 28-32). A determination of whether two cases have \"the same cause of action\" for purposes of claim preclusion \"[t]urns on the essential similarity of the underlying events giving rise to the various legal claims\" in both actions.\n    <em>\n     Churchill v.

Dex Media argues that no such analysis is needed because YPPI admits that its Counterclaims are the same claims YPPI asserted in the SuperMedia Litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Here, the two cases involve the same 5,000 \"Licensed Images,\" the same 2001 License Agreement, and the same parties. It is also undisputed that in both the SuperMedia Litigation and the Dex Media Litigation, YPPI asserted claims based on\n    the same theory: that Idearc failed to assume the License and, therefore, the subsequent use of YPPI's images constituted copyright infringement. YPPI attempts to downplay the essential similarity of the underlying events, alleging that only \"some underlying events were the same in both cases.\" (YPPI Br. at 35). YPPI argues that the direct copyright infringement alleged in its Counterclaims is based on Dex Media's\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      post-confirmation publication\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    of Licensed Images, which lacks \"essential similarity\" with its prior claims based on SuperMedia's\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      pre-petition transfer\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    of Licensed Images to third-parties alleged in the prior litigation, which also included claims for breach of contract. (YPPI Br. at 29-30). YPPI further argues that claims in the Dex Media Action and the SuperMedia Litigation \"require different evidence:\" proof of SuperMedia's unauthorized transfer of the Licensed Images to third-parties in violation of the parties' License, on the one hand, versus proof of Dex Media's publication of the Licensed Images without any license, on the other hand. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 30-31). YPPI cites the\n    <em>\n     Athlone Industries\n    </em>\n    case, where the Third Circuit reversed dismissal of an action based on claim preclusion because \"the suits involved different statutes, different acts, different wrongs and necessitated different evidence to support the different material facts alleged.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Athlone Indus., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648890\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/746/977/#p986\">\n     746 F.2d 977\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 986 (3d Cir. 1984). According to YPPI, the Dex Media Action and the SuperMedia Litigation also involve different acts and different wrongs. The Court, however, is not persuaded. YPPI's \"different wrongs/different evidence\" argument might appear logical if it was not predicated on YPPI's flip flop on the facts critical to the claims in the prior litigation - the assumption and validity of the License.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    YPPI argues on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding that the prior and subsequent suits involved \"the same parties or their privies\" because Dex Media was a close privy of SuperMedia. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Br. at 26-28). The Bankruptcy Court noted that \"SuperMedia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dex Media which justifies the finding of privity.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    214 (citing\n    <em>\n     Lubrizol Corp. v.

YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in finding that SuperMedia was a privy of Dex Media based solely on a finding of a subsidiary-parent relationship. According to YPPI, the Bankruptcy Court failed to undertake the appropriate factual inquiry \"requiring evidence of whether the parent controlled the earlier lawsuit and its interests were represented by the subsidiary in that earlier action.\" (YPPI Br. at 27 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Kaiser Group Int'l, Inc. v.

D. Del. 2007).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Court agrees with Dex Media that YPPI has waived this argument on appeal. In its Motion for Judgment, Dex Media argued that YPPI's claims in the Dex Media Action involved \"the same parties or their privies\" as the SuperMedia Litigation. (DEX 696-97). The record reflects that YPPI did not dispute this point in its opposition or raise it during oral argument. (\n    <em>\n     See DEX\n    </em>\n    781-815; DEX 1055-1134). Having \"never argued or mentioned\" this issue below, YPPI has waived the right to raise it on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     C.A.C. v.

As Dex Media points out, unlike a new plaintiff, the Third Circuit has held that \"a lesser degree of privity is required for a new defendant to invoke claim preclusion\" and this \"lesser degree of privity\" is satisfied so long as \"there is a close or significant relationship between successive defendants.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <em>\n     Lubrizol\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545346\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/929/960/#p966\">\n     929 F.2d at 966\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

(YPPI Br. at 35). YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court's application of judicial estoppel rests on erroneous findings that YPPI reversed two of its positions. Although YPPI maintained in the SuperMedia Litigation that the License was \"valid and enforceable,\" (DEX 796 n.18), YPPI argues there is no inconsistency with its current position because it has not argued in the Dex Media Litigation that the License is \"invalid\" only that it was not properly assumed. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Br. at 37 (\"YPPI expressly alleged in the Dex Media Action that the Service Agreement, to which the License was part, was\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      not assumed\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    by Dex Media's predecessor in the Idearc Bankruptcy.\") ). According to YPPI, YPPI's Counterclaim merely alleges that: Idearc failed to take the statutory steps necessary to assume the Service Agreement; no rights under the Service Agreement remained or otherwise inured to the benefit of SuperMedia following the Idearc Bankruptcy, and no rights passed or inured to the benefit of Dex Media through the Merger or otherwise.\" (YPPI Br. at 38). Dex Media counters that \"this is a semantic distinction without a substantive difference.\" (Dex Br. at 35). The Court agrees with Dex Media that, regardless of word choice, YPPI has taken conflicting positions. In the SuperMedia Litigation, YPPI stated: \"Under the chapter 11 plan, Idearc Media's rights under the Agreement and License, subject to the Amendment, vested in SuperMedia.\" (DEX 74-75, \u00b6 11). In the Dex Media Litigation, YPPI asserts: \"[N]o rights under the Service Agreement remained or otherwise inured to the benefit of SuperMedia following the Idearc Bankruptcy confirmation hearing.\" (DEX 665, \u00b6 45).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    YPPI further asserts that it did not take an \"irreconcilably inconsistent position\" regarding print ads. According to YPPI, its introduction of print ads in the SuperMedia Litigation was intended for the limited evidentiary purpose of establishing the value of its images and, in doing so, YPPI confirmed \"that it was\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      not alleging in that case\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    that SuperMedia's print ads were an infringing use.\" (YPPI Br. at 38) (emphasis added). According to YPPI, such actions were not \"irreconcilably inconsistent\" with YPPI's position in the Dex Media Litigation that Dex Media's publication of print ads is an infringement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Court agrees with Dex Media that YPPI did not just \"fail to allege\" that print ads were an infringing use in the SuperMedia Litigation; rather, YPPI represented that the print ads were not an infringing use.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    YPPI's current position cannot be reconciled with its prior position.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    YPPI further argues that the Bankruptcy Court \"abused its discretion in holding that YPPI's reversal of positions requires the Bankruptcy Court to apply judicial estoppel.\" (YPPI Br. at 39). According to YPPI, the Third Circuit has been clear that merely reversing positions alone does not support application of judicial estoppel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ryan Ops.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6467132,7650398\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/355/\">\n     81 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    362 ;\n    <em>\n     EXDS, Inc. v.

But YPPI chose to abandon that theory and pursue one based on the validity of the\n    License which contained a fee-shifting provision and the possibility of recovery of its attorneys' fees. Following the Bankruptcy Court's ruling that \"YPPI cannot enforce the License Agreement, including the right to attorneys' fees,\" YPPI reversed course by filing the Florida Action and trying its luck in a different court.

Dex Media disputes this, arguing that YPPI had all of the facts \"necessary to trigger\" its failure to assume claim in June 2015, when SuperMedia admitted to the 2005 and 2006 transfers, which transfers are, according to YPPI, the uncured prepetition breaches that prevented Idearc from assuming the License. The Court agrees. YPPI's triggering argument does not hold up where YPPI asserted its \"failure to assume\" claim in its Amended Proof of Claim filed on October 23, 2015 - months before the April 2016 Opinion was issued.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Finally, the Court rejects YPPI's argument that the Bankruptcy Court ignored the judicial estoppel requirement that the first court must have accepted the party's earlier inconsistent position.

YPPI argues that, in the SuperMedia Litigation, the Bankruptcy Court rejected YPPI's argument that the License was properly assumed in the Idearc Bankruptcy. (Appx. YPPI 527; YPPI 969). The Bankruptcy Court, however, adopted YPPI's prior position that the License was valid and enforceable when it entered a liability judgment finding that SuperMedia breached the License's transfer restriction in December 2014.\n    <em>\n     SuperMedia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207403448\">\n     2014 WL 7403448\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *20.

The first issue is whether the License was an executory contract at the time of the Idearc Bankruptcy. Dex Media argues that the Bankruptcy Court found that it was not, and this finding dooms YPPI's \"failure to assume\" claim: as a non-executory contract, the License could be neither assumed or rejected in the Idearc Bankruptcy. (Dex Br. at 43). The second issue is whether SuperMedia transferred the Licensed Images to Dex Media. Dex Media argues that the Bankruptcy Court found that there was no transfer, and this also doomed YPPI's \"failure to assume\" claim: absent a transfer, there was no basis to conclude that Dex Media possessed or was using the Licensed Images. Based on the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that \"YPPI [wa]s therefore collaterally estopped from establishing two elements which are essential to its Counterclaims.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). YPPI argues on appeal that the Bankruptcy Court's ruling that collateral estoppel barred YPPI's Counterclaim is unsupported both legally and factually. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Br. at 44-49).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    With respect to the nature of the License during the Idearc Bankruptcy, YPPI argues that although the Bankruptcy Court found in 2013 that the License was not an executory contract at the time of the then-pending SuperMedia Litigation, it \"changed its analysis\" and made later \"rulings\" in 2015 and 2016 that the License was executory in the Idearc Bankruptcy. The issue of whether the License is an executory contract was raised in the Assumption Motion filed on May 30, 2013. After a full round of briefing the Bankruptcy Court denied YPPI's motion. The Bankruptcy Court explained that \"[f]or a contract to be executory, there must be unperformed obligations on behalf of both parties.\" In the case of the License, the Bankruptcy Court ruled, \"once delivery of images and the payments were completed nearly ten years ago [in 2005], the parties ha[d] received the benefit of their bargain.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). YPPI moved for reconsideration of this ruling, and, after another full round of briefing, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed its prior ruling. (DEX 40-41). Based on these prior rulings the Bankruptcy Court determined that YPPI was precluded from again claiming that the License was an executory contract. The Bankruptcy Court considered and rejected YPPI's argument that there had been some change in its analysis or later rulings on the executory nature of the License. On appeal, the Court finds no support for YPPI's contention. The later \"rulings\" that YPPI cites are not rulings on the executory nature of the License at all. In ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment in 2015, the Bankruptcy Court made the statement that \"in the Idearc bankruptcy YPPI was an executory contract claimant.\"\n    <em>\n     In re SuperMedia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350694\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/540/85/#p93\">\n     540 B.R. 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 93 (Bankr. D. Del. 2015). In the April 2016 Opinion, the Bankruptcy Court similarly described the License as an executory contract in the Idearc Bankruptcy.\n    <em>\n     SuperMedia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201367070\">\n     2016 WL 1367070\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *5. These characterizations were not rulings on the executory nature of the contract. Dex Media points out that, as is common for administrative convenience, Idearc's Chapter 11 plan listed every\n    contract to which Idearc was a party - executory or not - on a schedule. It was not until YPPI filed the Assumption Motion that the Bankruptcy Court addressed whether the License was in fact executory. The Court finds no error in the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that the issue of whether the License was an executory contract in the Idearc Bankruptcy, filed 2009, has been adjudicated. The Bankruptcy Court has twice ruled that the License was no longer executory once delivery of the images and the payments were completed in 2005, years before the 2009 Idearc Bankruptcy was filed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    YPPI does not dispute that the issue of whether SuperMedia transferred the images to Dex Media was actually litigated and decided in the SuperMedia litigation. The Bankruptcy Court held three times that there was no evidence of a transfer. (DEX 213-14; DEX 224-25; DEX 1148). Rather, YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court erroneously concluded that YPPI was collaterally estopped from establishing elements essential to its Counterclaims.\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at 216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . YPPI argues that proving that a transfer of the Licensed Images to Dex Media occurred is not an \"essential\" element to YPPI's copyright infringement claim. According to YPPI, the fact remains that Dex Media possessed and still possesses YPPI's copyrighted images and continues publishing them without YPPI's authorization. (YPPI Br. at 49). Dex Media disagrees, arguing that the Bankruptcy Court's prior ruling \"ruptures\" YPPI's copyright claims: having failed to establish that a transfer to Dex Media took place, YPPI is left to argue that Dex Media had \"access to\" the Licensed Images by virtue of the \"overlapping operations\" with SuperMedia. The Bankruptcy Court has already rejected this argument, finding that the \"combin[ed] operations\" of the two entities did not result in a \"physical transfer\" of the Licensed Images to Dex Media. (DEX 224-25). Despite having taken ample discovery on the issue, the Bankruptcy Court found no evidence that Dex Media actually possessed the Licensed Images. The Bankruptcy Court ruled that Dex Media \"does not own or have legal title to its subsidiary's assets,\" and that \"YPPI was ably represented and failed twice to establish the transfer [to Dex Media] occurred.\"\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at 216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court finds no error in the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion. Absent a showing that Dex Media possessed the Licensed Images, YPPI's copyright claims must fail.

Therefore, Dex Media argues, the Bankruptcy Court properly entered the separate Declaratory Judgment. Conversely, YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court should not have entered the separate Declaratory Judgment because the Bankruptcy Court's Opinion and Order already fully complied with Rule 58(a). According to YPPI, the Bankruptcy Court's Order (YPPI Appx. 807) meets all three criteria because it is \"self contained,\" \"notes the relief granted\" in paragraph 1, \"omits ... the trial court's reasons for disposing of the claims,\" and expressly notes that such reasons are \"explained in the accompanying Opinion.\" (YPPI Br. at 53). According to YPPI, no further judgment was appropriate or needed, and no authority exists for entering a second judgment on the same motion or pleadings. YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the later Declaratory Judgment \"was error and achieved the unjust result of excusing Dex Media from missing the strict deadline for filing a motion for attorneys' fees and costs.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Count I of the Complaint sought declaratory relief regarding Dex Media's noninfringement of YPPI's copyrights.

Contrary to YPPI's assertions, while the Court's January 19, 2017 Order granted Dex Media's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and, thus, specified \"who has won,\" the Bankruptcy Court's Order did not set forth \"what relief has been awarded\" to Dex Media as a result of the Bankruptcy Court's ruling, including the precise declaratory relief to which Dex Media was entitled, and the formal disallowance of YPPI's purported claims.

(Dex Br. at 54). The Court agrees. Where no final judgment has been set out in a \"separate document\" following an otherwise dispositive ruling like the one in the Bankruptcy Court's Opinion and Order, Rule 58 provides that \"[a] party may request that judgment be set out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a).\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(d). There is nothing in Rule 58 that restricts the Bankruptcy Court's ability to enter an additional document to further clarify its ruling, and YPPI does not cite a single case suggesting that a trial court's clarification of a prior decision, or the entry of multiple judgments under Rule 58(a), constitutes reversible error.

YPPI argues that \"paragraph 2 of the Declaratory Judgmen[t] is not accurate because it states that \"Dex Media has\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      not infringed\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    any of YPPI's copyrights as alleged in YPPI's Answer and Counterclaims.\" The crux of YPPI's objection is that the \"Bankruptcy Court never made a finding\" regarding whether Dex Media infringed YPPI's copyrights but instead \"found that YPPI is precluded from asserting its copyright claims.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 53). YPPI argues that \"no such ruling was made nor could have been made\" because the Bankruptcy Court found in its Opinion that YPPI was precluded from pursuing its copyright infringement counterclaim ... based on claim preclusion, judicial estoppel, and collateral estoppel.\" \"No other findings were made,\" \"no infringement analysis was conducted and no conclusion about infringement was reached.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 54). Conversely, Dex Media argues that, as the copyright claimant, YPPI bore the \"burden to prove that acts of infringement [by Dex Media] occurred.\" (Dex Br. at 55-56 (citing\n    <em>\n     William A.

In the Opinion, the Bankruptcy Court determined that YPPI was precluded, judicially estopped, and collaterally estopped from asserting that Dex Media had infringed YPPI's copyrights, so including such a ruling is not inaccurate. The Court agrees with Dex Media. Given that YPPI is barred from even asserting that Dex Media committed any acts of infringement, let alone meeting its burden of proving such infringement, there is nothing \"inaccurate\" about the Bankruptcy Court's issuance of a declaration of non-infringement in the Declaratory Judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B)(i). YPPI claims that Dex Media's filing of the Certification and Proposed Declaratory Judgment was a ploy \"to reset the clock\" on the 14-day deadline to file a motion for attorneys' fees because it \"forgot\" to file it. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Br. at 50 (\"But then, Dex Media forgot. Dex Media missed the deadline for filing a motion for award of attorneys' fees\") ). Dex Media calls this argument irresponsible:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    YPPI omits to mention the fact that Dex Media approached YPPI for its consent to file a Certification of Counsel containing the proposed [Declaratory] Judgment\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      before\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    the time for Dex Media's fee application purportedly expired. The only reason Dex Media did not file the Certification, or its fee application, at that time was because YPPI's counsel requested that Dex Media refrain from doing so until it had time to review the Certification. YPPI's counsel then waited nearly two weeks before advising Dex Media that YPPI would not consent to the proposed Final Judgment. If what Dex Media wanted was an extension of time to file its fee application, it could have simply requested such an extension from the Bankruptcy Court (and would have received an extension automatically by operation of Local Bankruptcy Rule 9006-2). In truth, what Dex Media wanted was to work cooperatively with YPPI to craft a Rule 58(a) form of judgment that the parties jointly could present to the Bankruptcy Court. Little did Dex Media know that YPPI would seize upon Dex Media's good faith efforts in a disingenuous attempt to challenge Dex Media's right to attorneys' fees.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    (Dex Br. at 56-57) (citations omitted).

According to YPPI, it simply \"accepted\" the Bankruptcy Court's finding in the earlier litigation, that a breach had occurred and that application of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1) leads to the conclusion that no assumption could have occurred. Therefore, YPPI argues, its change in position was in reliance on a previous ruling and cannot be bad faith. (YPPI Br. at 9, 23).

The Court rejects YPPI's argument for the same reason that the Bankruptcy Court rejected it: YPPI knew about the timing of SuperMedia's transfers \"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      before\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    the conclusion of the SuperMedia Litigation.\"\n    <em>\n     Dex Media\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272381\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/208/\">\n     564 B.R. at 215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As the Bankruptcy Court found:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    YPPI first alleged that the License Agreement between SuperMedia and YPPI was valid and enforceable.

The reassertion of a previously abandoned claims in new litigation against the same parties is objectively unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    YPPI further argues that it was not objectively unreasonable to sue Dex Media after having sued SuperMedia because YPPI's claims are based on acts of infringement by Dex Media since May 1, 2013, which is the day after the last date covered by any claims against SuperMedia. (YPPI Br. at 23). YPPI argues, \"these were new claims against a new party, which claims were not and could not have been raised in the SuperMedia litigation.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24). But YPPI not only could have raised these claims in the SuperMedia litigation - it did. (DEX 316, \u00b6 26).

As the Bankruptcy Court correctly noted in entering judgment against YPPI on its \"new\" claims on the basis of\n    <em>\n     res judicata\n    </em>\n    , the fact that these claims address a different or later time period does not save them, as \"the claims are based on events that pre-date the filing of the SuperMedia Litigation.\" The Bankruptcy Court's finding of objective unreasonableness of these claims was not clearly erroneous.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

YPPI argues on appeal that \"[n]o evidence supports a finding that YPPI needs to be deterred from filing frivolous cases.\" (YPPI Br. at 26-27).

Based on this record, the Court finds no error in the Bankruptcy Court's consideration of deterrence as one of the factors in awarding attorneys' fees.

In addition to the record of misrepresentations in the litigation between the parties, as detailed in the AdMedia Decision and the Rule 60(b) Decision, the Bankruptcy Court spent four years presiding over YPPI's litigation tactics, including three separate infringement actions, and was uniquely positioned to find that fee shifting was appropriate to deter YPPI from filing additional lawsuits.

D.I. 104 at 3 (citing YPPI's motion for fees and costs filed in copyright infringement litigation against Ziplocal, LP and Yellow Pages Group, LLC in the District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Case No.8:12-CV-755-T-26EAJ) ). In opposition to the award of fees here, however, YPPI submitted declarations\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    of its principal Moore indicating that, as of January 9, 2018, YPPI had only $1,016.23 in \"cash on hand\" and no income. The Bankruptcy Court took notice that,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , YPPI has earned more than $4 million from copyright lawsuits since 2009 and concluded that Dex Media \"had not presented a clear record of its financial circumstances.\" (Adv. D.I. 104 at 10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    On appeal, YPPI cites the Third Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Lieb\n    </em>\n    , which notes that the aims of \u00a7 505 are \"compensation and deterrence where appropriate, but not ruination.\"\n    <em>\n     Lieb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569476\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/151/\">\n     788 F.2d at 156\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court erred in awarding fees that will result in the \"financial ruination\" of its business. As the Moore Declaration demonstrates, and the Bankruptcy Court found, YPPI's \"business\" earns \"no income from the sale of its photographs.\" (Adv. D.I. 104 at 7). YPPI's argument would mean that regardless of how weak or objectively unreasonable its infringement claims, shifting of fees in any amount was an abuse of the Bankruptcy Court's discretion because\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      any\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    fee award (at least greater than $1,000) would result in YPPI's financial ruination. This is not the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    YPPI further argues that the Moore Declaration was the only uncontested evidence of its financial condition, and that, in determining a reasonable fee award, the Bankruptcy Court erred in failing to consider such evidence that fee shifting would result in YPPI's financial ruin. YPPI incorrectly characterizes the Moore Declaration as uncontested - it was clearly contested. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Appx. 1471). The record before the Bankruptcy Court showed that YPPI has settled actions for, or been awarded, significant sums in infringement litigation, which its counsel has conceded. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DEX\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    490-91 at 37:12-38:13; DEX 492 at 70:5-9; DEX 515; YPPI Appx. 1376, 1543). Settlement agreements reflecting significant settlement amounts were part of the record in the SuperMedia Litigation, and the Bankruptcy Court could take judicial notice of them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jones v.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    YPPI Reply at 8-9). At best, the Moore Declaration does not appear to paint a full picture of YPPI's financial condition. Even if YPPI's financial condition was clear from the record, YPPI cites no case holding that an award of fees under \u00a7 505 in excess of a litigant's \"cash on hand\" is necessarily an abuse of discretion, regardless of the facts and circumstances of the case. Based on this record, it was not clearly erroneous for the Bankruptcy Court to have found that YPPI had not presented a clear record of its financial circumstances sufficient to preclude a fee award, and the Court finds no abuse of discretion or reason to disturb the Bankruptcy Court's determination to award attorneys' fees on this basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <strong>\n     4.

D.I. 104 at 7). The Bankruptcy Court therefore determined that it was appropriate to calculate the fees of Dex Media's Non-Local Counsel based upon their normal hourly rate. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). On appeal, YPPI offers no basis to conclude that the Bankruptcy Court clearly erred in finding that the case fell within the first exception to the forum rate rule. YPPI argues that Dex Media failed to show the need for Non-Local\n    Counsel, but the Court disagrees. Here, the Bankruptcy Court found that Dex Media required the \"special expertise\" of the very same Non-Local Counsel that represented SuperMedia in YPPI's prior infringement action. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7 (\"The SuperMedia [L]itigation was essential to the arguments which proved successful in the Dex Media proceeding. New or different counsel would not have had the knowledge of the SuperMedia action which brought about the dismissal of the Dex Media action.\") ). YPPI also argues on appeal that \"Dex Media's Delaware counsel [Patrick Jackson] possessed knowledge equal to if not superior to that of its New York Counsel.\" (YPPI Br. at 34). The Court is not persuaded. As Dex Media argues, \"Mr. Jackson is a bankruptcy lawyer, and this was a copyright litigation.\" (Dex Br. at 40).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The record supports the Bankruptcy Court's conclusion that Dex Media required the \"knowledge and expertise\" of its Non-Local Counsel. Because the Bankruptcy Court's finding that \"[t]he expertise of Non-Local Counsel was clearly required\" is not clearly erroneous, and the award of fees based on Non-Local Counsel's normal hourly rate is consistent with Third Circuit law and was not an abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Calculation of Reasonable Hours\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Having determined that fee shifting was appropriate in this case, the Bankruptcy Court was required to determine what fees are reasonably awarded under the Act. Based on the Court's independent review, as described in the Opinion, the Bankruptcy Court determined that certain reductions in the attorneys' fees incurred (and already paid) by Dex Media were appropriate, and that fees in the amount of $504,025.50 were reasonably awarded. (Adv. D.I. 104 at 7, 10). The Court finds no basis to disturb the Bankruptcy Court's careful calculation of a reasonable award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The Bankruptcy Court was careful to identify concerns prior to its review. Specifically, while knowledge of the SuperMedia Litigation was of critical importance to success on the motion to dismiss, the Bankruptcy Court observed that Dex Media's Non-Local Counsel already knew the SuperMedia Litigation inside and out. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7-8). Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court found it appropriate to deduct all of the fees incurred with the Florida Action as \"separate litigation.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    While recognizing that the litigation expenses Dex Media was required to incur in response to the Florida Action related to YPPI's copyright claims, and presented a hindrance to Dex Media, the Bankruptcy Court declined to award fees relating to the Florida Action, as that litigation was not \"work product that was actually utilized in the instant litigation.\" (Adv. D.I. 104 at 8 (citing\n    <em>\n     Gulfstream III Assocs. Inc. v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514615\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/414/#p420\">\n     995 F.2d 414\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 420 (3d Cir. 1993) ) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Based on the foregoing considerations, the Bankruptcy Court conducted an independent\n    review of each attorney's time records. Giving consideration to Non-Local Counsel's prior knowledge of the SuperMedia Litigation, the Bankruptcy Court undertook a \"line by line\" review of each attorney's time records, and, \"[f]or each and every entry,\" the Bankruptcy Court \"used its independent judgment to approximate the time necessary for the dispute.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9). The Opinion included a chart setting forth each attorney's billed time, the reduced time as determined by the Bankruptcy Court's independent review, and the amount by which each attorney's fees were therefore reduced. As a result of the review, the 904.7 hours billed by Dex Media's Non-Local Counsel were reduced by 218.6 hours, resulting in a $161,023.00 fee reduction. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The Opinion also included a separate chart setting forth the Florida Action reductions in the amount of $103,950.00. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Between the Florida Action and the Non-Local Counsel Fees, the Bankruptcy Court's review resulted in a total reduction of $264,973.00 - or roughly 33% of the total fees requested by Dex Media. It is difficult to conceive of a more thorough review. As Dex Media correctly argues, \"the law requires nothing more.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Interfaith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917645\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/694/#p705\">\n     426 F.3d at 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (trial court should determine the attorney hours \"reasonably expended\" for the dispute).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    On appeal, YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court failed to \"identify the number of hours it found to be reasonably expended on the case below.\" (YPPI Br. at 35). This argument is unavailing. It is unclear what additional information YPPI would need in order to make such a determination. Dex Media's fee application included detailed time entries. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Adv. D.I. 64). The record reflects that YPPI deposed Dex Media's attorneys in connection with the fee application. (Adv. D.I. 83). The Bankruptcy Court excluded hours it deemed unnecessary, awarded fees based on those hours that were \"reasonably expended\" on the litigation, and listed the reduced hours on a chart by timekeeper. (Adv. D.I. 104 at 9). To the extent YPPI is arguing that the Bankruptcy Court failed to include a task by task explanation for its reductions, YPPI cites no authority imposing such a requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    <strong>\n     6. Travel Time and Costs\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The Bankruptcy Court found that \"[t]ravel time is appropriately billed because Non-Local Counsel worked on the case and needed to get to Wilmington from New York.\" (Adv. D.I. 104 at 9-10). YPPI argues that the Bankruptcy Court clearly erred in \"awarding Dex Media attorneys' fees and costs for the hours its New York counsel charged for travel time.\" (YPPI Br. at 38). Dex Media responds that the record reflects that its counsel only charged for travel if the attorneys were working on the Dex Media Litigation during that travel time. (Dex Br. at 42). \"If the attorneys were not working on the matter, they did not bill for travel time.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 42-43). The record supports this conclusion. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DEX 493-94 at 73:9-74:13). The Bankruptcy Court's finding that hours reasonably expended by Dex Media's counsel could include work on the case undertaken during travel presents no basis to disturb the Fee Award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    After presiding over YPPI's copyright infringement claims for more than four years, the Bankruptcy Court determined that YPPI was estopped from pursuing additional infringement claims against SuperMedia's parent on its previously abandoned \"failure to assume\" theory and granted the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Bankruptcy Court then properly entered a separate Declaratory Judgment specifying the relief granted. As the prevailing party in the litigation, the\n    Bankruptcy Court determined that a fee award was appropriate under \u00a7 505, based on the objective unreasonableness of YPPI's claims and the need to advance considerations of deterrence and compensation. The Bankruptcy Court undertook a line by line review of each attorney's time records, applied its independent judgment to approximate what fees were reasonably necessary for each dispute, and made significant reductions. In undertaking this careful review, the Bankruptcy Court fulfilled its obligation to determine \"whether the hours set out were reasonably expended for each of the particular purposes described and then exclude those that are 'excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.' \"\n    <em>\n     Interfaith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917645\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/426/694/#p705\">\n     426 F.3d at 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The Bankruptcy Court also noted that YPPI undertook the following actions in connection with the Florida Action: \"(1) filed its copyright lawsuit against SuperMedia's parent company, Dex Media, in Florida using the theory that was inconsistent with what it argued in the SuperMedia action; (2) did not serve the complaint in the Florida Action for more than 100 days; (3) refused Dex Media the courtesy of an extension of time to answer, move, or otherwise plead in the Florida Action; (4) moved to dismiss the action that Dex Media had filed in Delaware; and (5) sought in the Florida Action to enjoin Dex Media from proceeding in Delaware.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
