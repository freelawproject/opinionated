Walrath, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   Before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment under Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff-Intervenor Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB (\"WSFS\") seeks disgorgement of proceeds from certain goods sold on consignment. Defendant Performance Apparel Corporation (\"PAC\") contends it is entitled to keep the proceeds because WSFS's actual knowledge of the consignment relationship between PAC and the Debtors precludes WSFS from claiming a superior interest in goods that PAC sold to the Debtors on consignment. The Court agrees with PAC and finds that WSFS had actual knowledge of PAC's consignment interest which precludes it from obtaining a superior interest in the consigned goods. Accordingly, the Court will grant PAC's motion and deny WSFS's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this core adversary proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(K) &amp; 1334.

The Debtors were national retailers of sporting goods and active apparel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of their business, the Debtors developed a program for the sale of goods on consignment. To participate in the program, vendors entered into a \"pay by scan\" deal sheet specifying whether they would be paid on a cost or retail split basis. The Debtors would then pay the vendor in accordance with the terms of the consignment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PAC was one of the first vendors to begin selling goods on consignment to the Debtors. PAC filed a UCC-1 financing statement with respect to consigned goods on August 28, 2009, and gave notice to the Agent at that time for the Term Loan Lenders. (Orenstein Decl. Ex. K, Adv. D.I. 93-11; McNeill Decl. Ex. H at 2, Adv. D.I. 100-8.) However, there is no evidence that PAC filed a continuation statement for that UCC-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pre-petition, the Debtors had borrowed approximately $1.1 billion, which included a $650 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the \"ABL Loan\") and a Term Loan of $300 million. Bank of America\n   (\"BOA\") was the administrative agent under both loans. An Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was executed by BOA and the Debtors on November 16, 2010. (Orenstein Decl. Ex. D, Adv. D.I. 93-4.) The Term Loans were secured by a first-priority lien on the Debtors' hard assets, intellectual property and general intangibles as well as a second-priority lien on the Debtors' inventory and other assets that also served as collateral for the ABL Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. B, Adv. D.I. 93-2.) The Term Loan lien was perfected by the execution of a Security Agreement and the filing of UCC financing statements in the appropriate jurisdictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. B-F, Adv. D.I. 93-2,3,4,5,6.) On December 31, 2015, WSFS replaced BOA as the Administrative and Collateral Agent for the Term Loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. C. 31:8-10, Adv. D.I. 93-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As of the Petition Date, approximately 11-12% of the Debtors' total inventory was for sale on consignment. (McNeill Decl. Ex. F at 2, Adv. D.I. 100-6.) Early in the case, an issue arose as to the Debtors' authority to pledge or sell consigned goods in their possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pending the filing of (and ruling on) an adversary proceeding to determine respective rights to the consigned goods,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court permitted the Debtors to sell the consigned goods so long as they complied with the terms of the consignment agreements, including making payments to the consignors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The final order preserved WSFS's rights, as Term Loan Agent, including the right to recoup any payments made to the consignors from the sale of the consigned goods if it were determined that WSFS has a superior security interest in them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As of the Petition Date, all transactions between the Debtors and PAC were on a consignment basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) At that time, the Debtors estimated that the \"extended cost\" of all PAC consigned goods in the Debtors' possession was $1,586,446. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Postpetition, the Debtors continued to pay PAC for consigned goods that were sold pursuant to the Consignment Order. By the end of July 2016, the Debtors had returned or sold all consigned goods in their possession and paid the proceeds to PAC in accordance with the Consignment Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 15, 2016, the Debtors filed a Complaint against PAC seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment regarding the priority of PAC's interest in the consigned goods. (Compl., Adv. D.I. 1.) WSFS intervened as a plaintiff. (WSFS Intervention Order, April 27, 2016, Adv. D.I. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 19, 2016, WSFS filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings contending that its lien is superior to PAC's interests. (WSFS Motion, Adv. D.I. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court denied that motion finding there were factual issues in dispute. (Opinion, March 7, 2017, Adv. D.I. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 18, 2018, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment seeking a determination of their respective interests in the consigned goods and their proceeds. (WSFS Motion, Adv. D.I. 91; PAC Motion, Adv. D.I. 96.) Briefing is complete, and the matter is now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Rule 56 Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rule 7056 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure incorporates Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which sets forth the applicable summary judgment standard.

(Orenstein Decl. Ex. F at 7, Adv. D.I. 31-6.) That lien was secured by the execution of a Security Agreement and the filing of UCC-1 financing statements in the appropriate jurisdictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. G &amp; H, Adv. D.I. 31-7 &amp; 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WSFS also presented evidence that PAC had filed a UCC-1 financing statement with respect to the goods it sold to the Debtors on August 28, 2009, and gave notice to the Term Loan Agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. K, Adv. D.I. 94-11; McNeill Decl. Ex. H., Adv. D.I. 98-8.) No evidence was presented that PAC filed a continuation statement for that UCC-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a result, WSFS contends that its perfected security interest has priority over PAC's unperfected security interest in the consigned goods under \u00a7 9-322(a) of the UCC, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (a) General priority rules.

The facts of the\n   <em>\n    State Street\n   </em>\n   case are distinguishable from this case because the consignment arrangement there did not preexist the bank lien, and the bank only discovered that the debtor held a few cars on consignment from its monthly inspection of its collateral.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6103371\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/81/215/#p220\">\n    81 B.R. at 215-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It truly would be absurd to bind a secured creditor to the constructive notice of a consignor's interest arising from a UCC-1 filing or from the fact that the debtor is \"generally known\" to be selling consigned goods but not bind a creditor who has\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge of the consignor's interest in the goods when lending to the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The UCC is to be liberally construed to promote its underlying purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%206%2C%20%C2%A7%201-102\">\n    Del.

If the Term Loan Lenders had actual knowledge of PAC's consignment interests at the time the Term Loan was granted, they could not have been misled by any \"hidden\" lien. Requiring PAC to give them \"constructive\" notice, when they already had actual notice, would be to elevate form over substance and would not serve the purposes of the UCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that if the Term Loan Lenders knew PAC was a consignor of goods to the Debtors at the time they extended a loan to the Debtors, it would be absurd to conclude that PAC had to give constructive notice to them by filing a UCC continuation form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Term Loan Lenders' Actual Knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   PAC contends that the Term Loan Lenders had actual knowledge of its consignment arrangement with the Debtors at the time they lent to the Debtors. This is evidenced, it contends, by the very language of the Term Loan Credit Agreement Amended and Restated as of November 16, 2010. Section 7.01 of the Credit Agreement provides that the Debtors would not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   7.01.\n   <em>\n    Liens\n   </em>\n   . Create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property, other than the following Liens (Liens described below are herein referred to as \"\n   <em>\n    Permitted Liens\n   </em>\n   \"):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (b) Liens existing on the date hereof and listed on\n   <em>\n    Schedule 7.01(b)\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   7.02.\n   <em>\n    Indebtedness\n   </em>\n   .

Ex. D., Adv. D.I. 98-4.) PAC was listed as a Permitted Lien on that Schedule of the Credit Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Schedule 7.01(b).) WSFs' 30(b)(6) witness acknowledged that \"as of the time the credit agreement was entered, Bank of America and all the other parties to the credit agreement were on notice that [PAC] was a secured party with regard to its consignment inventory.\" (Healy Dep. 98:18-24, Jan. 17, 2018, Adv. D.I. 98-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   WSFS argues nonetheless that this was not\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge but only\n   <em>\n    constructive\n   </em>\n   knowledge. It argues that Schedule 7.01 merely gave constructive notice of those parties (including PAC) who had filed UCC-1 financing statements. It contends that there is no evidence that either BOA or it had any communications with the Debtors regarding its consignment program generally or PAC's consignment relationship in particular. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:18-51:7, 67:18-69:25.) It also notes that in the Security Agreement, the Debtors represented and warranted that they did not have any property on consignment except for \"an immaterial portion of total inventory for sale.\" (McNeill Decl. Ex. E at 32-33, Adv. D.I. 98-5.) Finally, WSFS asserts that even if the Collateral Agent had obtained actual knowledge of PAC's consignment arrangement, the Term Loan Lenders did not have any such knowledge because neither the Credit Agreement nor the Security Agreement required the Agents to forward that information to them and there is no evidence that they did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court rejects the latter assertion because the knowledge of an agent is imputed to the principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meisel v. Grunberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750748\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/651/98/#p110\">\n    651 F.Supp.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (\"Knowledge acquired by an agent acting within the scope of its agency is imputed to the principal.\") It was clearly within the scope of the Collateral Agent's duties to ascertain what other liens existed on property that it was taking as security for the Term Loan. Under section 9.01(b) of the Credit Agreement, \"each of the Lenders ... hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations ....\" (Orenstein Decl. Ex. D at 97, Adv. D.I. 93-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even if that knowledge could not be imputed from the Agent to the Term Loan Lenders, parties to a contract are conclusively presumed to know its contents and are bound by its terms.\n   <em>\n    Level Export Corp. v. Wolz, Aiken &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2229833\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/305/82/\">\n    305 N.Y. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20N.E.2d%20218\">\n    111 N.E.2d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (1953) (\"He who signs or accepts a written contract, in the absence of fraud or other wrongful act on the part of another contracting party, is conclusively presumed to know its contents and to assent to them.\") (citations omitted). The Term Loan Lenders are parties to the Credit Agreement and, therefore, are charged with knowledge of its terms. (McNeill Decl. Ex. D, Adv. D.I. 98-4.) Schedule 7.01(b) of that Agreement provided them with\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge that PAC had a permitted lien for \"Inventory (consigned).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nor does the Court accept the argument that the information was just constructive knowledge of PAC's security interest under the UCC and that the expiration of PAC's UCC-1 financing statement somehow caused that information to be lost. Schedule 7.01(b) expressly noted PAC's \"consignment\" interest in the inventory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In an analogous situation, the First Circuit held that a bank - which acquired a security interest after (and with notice of) a security interest filed by a vendor holding a purchase money security interest in goods it sold to the debtor - had actual knowledge of that interest which precluded it from asserting priority over the vendor's interest even after the vendor's lien became unperfected.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Halmar Distrib., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6520172,10514140\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/121/\">\n    968 F.2d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122-23 (1st Cir. 1992). In\n   <em>\n    Halmar\n   </em>\n   , after the vendor and then the bank obtained security interests in the debtor's inventory, the debtor moved. The vendor failed to file a UCC-1 financing statement in the new location.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6520172,10514140\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/121/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6520172,10514140\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/121/\">\n    at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding the provision of the UCC that the vendor's security interest became unperfected at the end of four months, the First Circuit held that the vendor's lien continued to have priority over the bank's lien because the bank had actual knowledge of the vendor's lien.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6520172,10514140\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/121/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6520172,10514140\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/121/\">\n    at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding the First Circuit stated that because \"the bank knew about [the vendor's] interest from the inception of its revolving credit arrangement .... [a]dditional notice to the bank in the form of refiling within the four-month period was as unnecessary and useless an act as can be imagined.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6520172,10514140\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/121/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that because the Term Loan Agent (and Lenders) actually knew of PAC's interest in the consigned goods at the time the Term Loan was extended, the UCC does not determine their relative priority and the rights of the consignor are paramount.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    GBS Meat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087997\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/474/1357/\">\n    474 F.Supp. at 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"where a secured creditor knows that the proceeds rightfully belong to a consignor, the consignor must have priority\");\n   <em>\n    Key Book\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6477590\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/103/39/#p43\">\n    103 B.R. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"where a secured creditor knows that goods rightfully belong to a consignor ... the consigned goods are not subject to that creditor's lien\");\n   <em>\n    Fariba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986210\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/178/156/#p169\">\n    178 Cal.
