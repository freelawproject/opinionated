Laney, III, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this adversary proceeding, Walter Kelley, the Chapter 7 Trustee (\"the Trustee\"), seeks an order determining the enforceability of a security interest that encumbers the Debtor's real property in Thomas County, Georgia. (Compl., A.P. No. 1). The Trustee argues that, because he may claim the interest of a bona fide purchaser pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), his interest in the property is free and clear of the security deed currently held by Deutsche Bank National Trustee Company (\"DBNT\"). (Id.) The Defendant, a servicer for DBNT,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed an answer disputing the Trustee's claim. (Answer, A.P. No. 7). The answer further sought a declaration that the security interest is enforceable or alternatively, for equitable recognition of the interest by subrogation or reinstatement. (Id.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. (Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., A.P. No. 17; Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., A.P. No. 28). The motions raised two issues. First, whether a hypothetical purchaser is deemed to have notice that, despite the recordation of two instruments canceling a security deed, a security interest encumbered the Debtor's real property. If not, the Court must address whether DBNT is entitled to an equitable recognition of its lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court heard the cross-summary judgment motions and, after the parties presented their arguments and the record in this case, the Court took the matter under advisement. Having carefully considered the issue before it, the Court concludes there is no issue of material fact and grants summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

FACTS IN THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to filing this case, the Debtor purchased real estate in Thomas County, Georgia. (Compl. \u00b6 7, A.P. No. 1). In 2006, the Debtor granted Option One Mortgage (\"Option One\") a security deed, which was recorded in the Thomas County real estate records on March 1, 2006 (\"the Security Deed\"). (Id. \u00b6 8). On August 4, 2008, a Satisfaction of Mortgage was recorded that referenced the Security Deed (\"the 2008 Satisfaction\"). (Id. \u00b6 9). The 2008 Satisfaction stated that the Security Deed had been paid in full and that the undersigned was the present owner of the referenced security interest by virtue of assignment or devise from Option One. (Id. Ex. B). The document, however, was not signed by agents of Option One; instead, the undersigned signed as assistant secretaries of H &amp; R Block Bank (\"H &amp; R Block\"). (Id.) On August 11, 2009-a little over one-year later, another Satisfaction of Mortgage was recorded that again referenced the Security Deed (\"the 2009 Satisfaction\"). (Id. \u00b6 10). Like the prior instrument, the 2009 Satisfaction stated the Security Deed had been paid in full and that the undersigned was the present holder of the Security Deed. And again, the document was signed by assistant secretaries of H &amp; R\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Block (the 2008 Satisfaction and 2009 Satisfaction will be referenced collectively as \"the Satisfactions\"). (Id. Ex. C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Thomas County title records do not reflect H &amp; R Block ever had a recorded interest in the Debtor's property. (Def.'s Stmnt. of Uncontested Facts \u00b6 12). DBNT asserts that the Satisfactions were recorded in error. (Id. \u00b6 16). The Trustee disputes this but does not cite to any document in record refuting this statement. DBNT, on the other hand, makes ample citations to support this statement. It points to the Debtor's affidavit, which stated the Debtor understood the security deed remained outstanding and that she continued to make payments on the note. DBNT also points to an affidavit from an officer at OCWEN who reviewed the assignments of the note and saw no indication that H &amp; R Block ever held an interest. Further, the record shows that when H &amp; R Block executed a cancelation of a mortgage originated by Option One concerning another property owned by the Debtor in Thomas County, it filed an \"affidavit of missing assignment\" prior to filing the cancelation. (Id. \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the Debtor filed a petition seeking relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Pet., Bankr. Doc. No. 1). The Trustee was appointed and sought to sell the Debtor's interest in the Thomas County property free and clear of the Security Deed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). (Mot. To Sell Property, Bankr. Doc. No. 12). The Trustee initiated this adversary proceeding to determine the secured status of the Security Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the Trustee filed this adversary proceeding, the Defendant recorded an instrument assigning Sand Canyon Corporation f/k/a Option One Mortgage Corporation's interest in the Security deed to DBNT. (Def.'s Stmnt. of Uncontested Facts \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Constructive Notice of the Security Deed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A bankruptcy trustee, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), may take for the bankruptcy estate the interest a bona fide purchaser would acquire. Here, the Trustee argues a bona fide purchaser could perfect its interest in the Debtor's property free and clear of the Security Deed because the Satisfactions purported to release the security interest. DBNT, on the other hand, argues a purchaser would have had constructive notice of Option One's outstanding security interest because the Satisfactions did not comply with Georgia law and were signed by a party without a recorded interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Resolving this issue requires first discussing the standards for determining whether a bona fide purchaser would have had notice of a superior interest in property. Considering these standards, the Court must then address whether the undisputed facts in this case lead the Court to conclude one party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Therefore, the relevant inquiry in this case is whether a bona fide purchaser would have had constructive knowledge of the outstanding security interest.

No. 06-6008, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 4653 *2-3 (Bankr. S.D. Ga. Oct. 12, 2006). There, the mortgage originator recorded security deeds perfecting senior and junior mortgages. The originator assigned the senior security deed to Household Financial Services (\"HFS\") and assigned the junior security deed to Household Reality Corporation (\"HRC\"). The recorded assignment of the junior mortgage, however, mistakenly referenced the deed book and page of the senior mortgage. On the same day the assignment to HRC was recorded, HRC also recorded a quit claim deed canceling its interest in the senior security deed. After the owner of the encumbered property filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, the trustee sought to avoid the senior security interest by arguing a bona fide purchaser would have concluded the quit claim deed canceled the senior mortgage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1088658\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/284/515/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DBNT cites\n   <em>\n    In re Neighbors\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that, if a party without a recorded interest in a property files an instrument canceling a security deed, a purchaser is under a duty to inquire whether the cancelation is effective. (Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Ap. Doc. No. 28-1 at pg. 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Neighbors\n   </em>\n   , 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 4653 *11) ). This Court, however, does not believe\n   <em>\n    In re Neighbors\n   </em>\n   supports this proposition. Inconsistencies in the chain of title-not that HRC did not have a recorded interest-led the\n   <em>\n    In re Neighbors\n   </em>\n   Court to find a purchaser would have had constructive notice of HFS's security interest. The court noted that a review of the recorded documents would have discovered \"the uncertainty concerning the status of both HFS and HRC's interest in the Debtor's property.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Neighbors\n   </em>\n   , 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 4653 *9. Further, the court noted HRC's cancelation \"of an instrument assigned to HFS [was] sufficient to constitute notice\" of an existing security interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9-10. Thus, the court concluded a purchaser would have inquired because the recorded documents assigned one security deed to two parties and only one of the parties canceled the security deed. That HFS had \"no recorded interest in the property\" was not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this case, the chain of title is consistent. While it is true that H &amp; R Block executed the Satisfactions without a prior recorded assignment, the Satisfactions stated H &amp; R Block was the holder of the Security Deed by virtue of an assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nothing recorded in real estate records is inconsistent with this statement. From the Security Deed's recording until after the Debtor filed the bankruptcy case-nearly twelve years-no recorded instruments contradicted the statements within the Satisfactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pointing to the affidavit of missing assignment filed in another property's title records, DBNT also argues that H &amp; R Block's general course-of-business when an assignment to the bank was not previously recorded was to file an affidavit before a cancelation. That H &amp; R Block did not file one here, DBNT argues, indicates the Satisfactions were recorded in error. The Court finds this evidence immaterial to the issue before the Court. First, one example does not demonstrate H &amp; R Block had a general policy of filing an affidavit under these circumstances. Secondly, even if H &amp; R Block had a policy of filing an affidavit, there is no evidence that a hypothetical purchaser would have been aware of that policy and would have questioned a cancelation without a prior recorded affidavit. As previously discussed, Georgia law does not require an assignee to file an affidavit of missing assignment before canceling the original security deed. The Court will not impose requirements beyond those made by Georgia's General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Lastly, DBNT argues that, because H &amp; R Block recorded two satisfactions approximately one year apart, a hypothetical purchaser would have inquired whether the instruments were filed in error. It also seems a fact finder could make the opposite interpretation: that filing two instruments with different persons executing the documents would assure a purchaser that the cancelation was genuine. Being at the summary judgment stage, the Court should not weigh evidence. But given other undisputed facts in this case, the Court can conclude any weight attributable to this fact would be\n   <em>\n    de minus\n   </em>\n   . Even viewed in the light most favorable to DBNT, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that because H &amp; R Block executed and recorded two consistent instruments it may have filed them in error, especially when the title records did not indicate any issue in the nearly twelve years following the Satisfactions' recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moving to the merits of the Trustee's motion, the parties make many of the same arguments. There is no reason to re-discuss these arguments. The Court's reasoning for denying DBNT's motion for summary judgment applies to the Trustee's motion and leads the Court to conclude the Trustee is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. It is, however, important to address DBNT's argument that, if the Court were to rule in favor of the Trustee, any mortgagor could file a fraudulent cancelation in the title records and this Court's ruling would effectively release the security interest. This overstates and misunderstands the issue. First, any fraudulent instrument is only effective as to a purchaser without actual or constructive notice of a superior interest. A mortgagor cannot simply file a cancelation to remove the security interest encumbering her property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Secondly, Georgia's recording statutes were written to protect the interest of a bona fide purchaser.\n   <em>\n    Hardin v. City Wide Wrecker Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"396947\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/232/617/#p618\">\n    232 Ga.

Considering this, a court's analysis must be based on the purchaser's perspective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DBNT v. JP Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166170\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/307/307/#p309\">\n    307 Ga.

Simply put, a court must determine what a purchaser would conclude upon reviewing the title records, regardless of the actual interests in the property. If the face of the title records show some legal defect, the purchaser cannot rely on them. If the records are inconsistent, the\n   purchaser should inquirer further. But if the title defect is hidden from the purchaser and the records do not reveal any facial deficiency, Georgia law protects the purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This is the case here. Although the evidence suggests that H &amp; R Block was not authorized to cancel the Security Deed and that the security interest remained on the property, Georgia's recording statutes protect the interests of bona fide purchasers. The Satisfactions had no facial defects. They stated H &amp; R Block was the assignee of the Option One mortgage. Given the instruments in the chain of title and the contents of those documents, there is nothing that would have \"excited the attention\" of a hypothetical purchaser. A purchaser reviewing those title records would have no reason to suspect the Security Deed remained effective despite the Satisfactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Compliance with Georgia Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Large portions of the parties' briefs are spent arguing Georgia law regarding the enforceability of assignments and cancelation of mortgages. DBNT notes that the assignment used the form provided in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-67(c), which applies where \"the original [security deed] has been lost, stolen, or otherwise mislaid.\" The original security deed in this case is not mislaid; it is in the servicer's possession. Further, although O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-64(d) states an assignment does not have to be recorded, DBNT notes the subsection only applies when the parties to the assignment make specific agreements regarding the assignment's terms and possession of the original deed. The record in this case does not show H &amp; R Block had an agreement with Option One or that it had possession of the original deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ultimately, however, compliance with these statutes is not an issue in this case. The issue before this Court is whether a hypothetical purchaser would have accepted the Satisfactions given the circumstances of their execution. Again, the inquiry is from the perspective of a hypothetical third-party purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   While there is no binding precedent, at least two Georgia bankruptcy courts have concluded that, if a cancelation uses the form provided by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-67(c), a hypothetical purchaser can accept the cancelation even without knowing whether the original deed was lost, stolen, or mislaid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. M &amp; I Bank FSB (In re Morgan)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049172\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/449/821/#p825\">\n    449 B.R. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2010) (holding a hypothetical purchaser could accept a cancelation, although it did not state the status of the original deed, because the presentation of a form provided by Georgia law \"evidences a sworn statement that the original security deed to be cancelled is unavailable for marking and recording, and that the cancellation instrument is to be accepted for such purpose\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gordon v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA (In re Ingram)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204048245\">\n    2013 WL 4048245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *3, 2013 Bankr.

The reasoning in these cases is persuasive here. The Court sees no reason why a hypothetical purchaser would second-guess a cancelation using a form provided by Georgia law merely because the form did not contain a statement regarding the whereabouts of the original deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Likewise, a hypothetical purchaser would not have known that there was no enforceable assignment between Option One and H &amp; R Block. It is true that the record in this case reflects that H &amp; R Block was never an assignee of the deed to secure debt. But, again, the relevant perspective is that of a hypothetical purchaser. Nothing on the face of the Satisfactions indicates H &amp; R Block was not assigned\n   the Security Deed. Rather, the instruments expressly state that H &amp; R Block was the owner of the security interest by virtue of an assignment. A purchaser would have concluded that H &amp; R Block acquired the deed through an unrecorded assignment; such a transfer is permitted by Georgia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Equitable Reinstatement of the Security Deed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Having determined a bona fide purchaser could take an interest in the debtor's property free from DBNT's interest, the Court must address DBNT's counterclaim for equitable reinstatement of the Security Deed. Georgia law recognizes that a \"cancellation obtained by fraud or mistake without payment may itself be canceled by a court of equity.\"\n   <em>\n    Decatur Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan v. Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"293313\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/268/362/#p364\">\n    268 Ga. 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"293313\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/268/362/#p364\">\n    489 S.E.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).

In particular, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 23-1-20 provides that \"[a] bona fide purchaser for value, and without notice of an equity, will not be interfered with by a court of equity.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.W.

But by holding the Trustee had no notice of DBNT's interest in the property, Georgia law directs the Court to dismiss DBNT's claim for equitable reinstatement. The Bankruptcy Code gives the Trustee the powers of a bona fide purchaser and, thus, the protections provided by Georgia law extend to the Trustee as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, the Trustee seeks an order determining the secured status of DBNT in relation to real property purchased by the Debtor. The Trustee, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), may take for the estate the interest of a hypothetical bona fide purchaser. Here, the real estate records show Option One recorded a security deed on the property. Subsequently, H &amp; R Block filed an instrument in the title records stating it was the assignee of the Security Deed and that the deed was canceled. H &amp; R Block filed a similar instrument nearly one year later. There were no indications that the title records were deficient or incorrect. Georgia law encourages a purchaser to rely on such documents. Therefore, a bona fide purchaser would not have notice of Option One's continued security interest.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court will refer to OCWEN and DBNT collectively as \"DBNT\" in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The parties have consented to the Court's entry of a final order; therefore, the Court has authority to enter a final order in this dispute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(K), (c)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Specifically, two of the Trustee's denied assertions of fact pertain to the corporate relationship between H &amp; R Block and Option One Mortgage.

F.R.C.P. 56(c)(A). Other than the Trustee's citations to district court orders, there is nothing in the record to support the Trustee's assertions regarding the corporate relationship between H &amp; R Block and Option One Mortgage. Therefore, the Court finds no basis to consider the Trustee's assertion.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20147721\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (c)(3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-2-1 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Every deed conveying lands shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county where the land is located.
