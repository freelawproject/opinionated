Shortly thereafter, George filed a voluntary chapter 7 petition in this court. Kevin, the original plaintiff in this adversary proceeding, filed a pro se complaint asserting that the judgment debt be should excepted from George's discharge and requesting additional nondischargeable damages beyond those awarded under the state court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The matter is currently before the court on cross motions for summary judgment. Kevin filed his motion for summary judgment on March 1, 2017 (AP Dkt. No. 116), and George filed a cross motion for summary judgment on May 18, 2017 (AP Dkt. No. 120). After the motions were filed, but prior to the scheduled hearing, Kevin Wigger filed his own chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Thomas A. Bruinsma was appointed as the trustee in Kevin's case, and was substituted as the Plaintiff in this adversary proceeding (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AP Dkt. No. 139).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 30, 2018, the Trustee filed a supplemental memorandum of law in support of Kevin's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kevin's motion for summary judgment, as adopted by the Trustee in his supplemental briefing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserts that the state court judgment debt should be nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(4) and \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is based, at least in part, on the collateral estoppel effect of the state court judgment. The Trustee also asserts that George made additional wrongful withdrawals totaling $18,575.00, which were only discovered by Kevin after the conclusion of the state court bench trial. The Trustee's supplemental brief argues that George is indebted to Kevin for these additional withdrawals, which were not included in the prior state court judgment, and that this debt should also be excepted from George's discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendant's motion for summary judgment asserts that the Plaintiff has failed to establish the requisite elements of his \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6) causes of action. The Defendant also argues that the Plaintiff's claims for additional damages, beyond those included in the state court judgment, are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Finally, the Defendant suggests that the Plaintiff is not entitled to equitable relief, including a nondischargeability determination, because of Kevin's \"unclean hands.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A hearing on the motions for summary judgment was held before this court on May 10, 2018. After the hearing, each party submitted a supplemental brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court subsequently ordered the Defendant to provide additional documentation from the state court record. The Defendant filed those supplemental documents on August 23, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court has jurisdiction over this bankruptcy case.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court has authority to enter a final order in this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Many of the facts that are material to this adversary proceeding were previously established in state court litigation. They are primarily set forth in the state court's Opinion and Order after Bench Trial and Opinion and Order regarding Summary Disposition Motions, which both parties have incorporated as part of the summary judgment record before this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those\n   undisputed material facts are summarized below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On or about June 2006, Kevin Wigger granted his son George a Durable Power of Attorney to manage Kevin's finances and assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion after Trial, at 3.) At that time, Kevin Wigger was incarcerated in the Muskegon County Jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The Durable Power of Attorney (sometimes referred to herein as the \"DPOA\") gives George broad authority to \"act in, manage, and conduct\" all of Kevin's affairs, \"as [his] agent\" for Kevin's \"use and benefit.\" (Debtor's Supplemental Brief, Exh. A; Trustee's Second Supplemental Brief, Exh. 3.) The DPOA specifically authorizes George to undertake fourteen different categories of actions on Kevin's behalf, including buying and selling property, and making \"deposits or investments in or withdrawals from, any account, holding, or interest\" which Kevin had or acquired \"in any banking, trust, or investment institution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Defendant has suggested that Kevin executed the DPOA because he wanted to hide his assets from the State of Michigan during his incarceration. In support of this assertion, the Defendant points to a statement in the Opinion after Trial, wherein the court notes that \"Kevin is not a sympathetic figure, with his criminal past and motivation to keep his money situation hidden from federal and state authorities.\" (Opinion after Trial, at 14.) The Defendant also offered a sworn declaration, stating that his father, Kevin, told him \"that he wanted to hide his assets from the State of Michigan.\" (Debtor's Supplemental Brief, Exh. F.) The Trustee disputes this allegation, pointing out that the state court also found that Kevin's criminal conviction was not relevant to the issues before it. (Opinion after Trial, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August 2012, George wrote a letter to Kevin stating that he used the DPOA to \"borrow\" $14,500 from Kevin in July 2007 to \"get [his] house.\" (Opinion on Summary Disposition, at 1; Opinion after Trial, at 10.) George apologized for doing this and promised to pay Kevin back. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The letter caused Kevin to investigate. (Opinion on Summary Disposition, at 1.) According to Kevin, his investigation revealed that George had made numerous withdrawals from Kevin's IRA account for his own personal use. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kevin filed a complaint against George and George's wife, Alyssa, in the Muskegon County Circuit Court. The Fourth Amended Complaint contained counts for fraudulent conversion, breach of contract, fraud, and constructive trust. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Supplemental Brief, Exh. B.) It alleged that George's improper withdrawals from the IRA account began on April 2, 2007 and continued through August 12, 2010 and that the total amount of the withdrawals was $51,200. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Motions for summary disposition were filed, and on June 4, 2015, the state court issued its Opinion on Summary Disposition. The state court dismissed the breach of contract count, because it found that no contract existed between Kevin and George. (Opinion on Summary Disposition, at 10.) It dismissed the fraud count because it concluded that the elements of fraud were not established, in part because Kevin \"willingly gave George access to the money.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) It also dismissed the constructive trust count, finding that imposition of a constructive trust was \"an equitable remedy,\" not an \"independent cause of action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) However, the state court denied George's motion as to the fraudulent conversion count. It also partially granted Kevin's cross motion for conversion\n   of $14,500, based on George's admission in his August 2012 letter that he had withdrawn this amount from the IRA. The court declined to enter judgment immediately, finding instead that trial testimony would be required to \"characterize the nature of the judgment\" and \"consider Kevin's request for derivative damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A trial was held in the state court on June 24, 25, 30, and July 9, 2015. On July 16, 2015, the state court entered its Opinion and Order after Bench Trial. The state court opinion begins by noting some of the difficulties the parties and the court had encountered as a result of Kevin's decision to represent himself in the litigation while incarcerated. (Opinion after Trial, at 1-2.) For example, the court explained that Kevin had contacted court staff after conclusion of the trial but prior to entry of the opinion, to advise the court that he had \"finally received\" additional bank records subpoenaed during trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1.) The court stated its belief that it had handled the subpoena issues raised by Kevin, and the overall scheduling of the trial, in a way that \"fulfilled its obligations to him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.) The court further explained that Kevin had \"represented himself well,\" although it noted that his decision to proceed without counsel had \"hindered him at certain points,\" particularly with respect to the subpoena issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The state court opinion goes on to indicate that, as of the time of trial, the only remaining count of Kevin's complaint was entitled \"fraudulent conversion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 5.) Although Kevin's complaint used the term \"embezzlement\" in several contexts, the court declined to construe the complaint as directly alleging a separate embezzlement count. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 5-6.) However, because the complaint included a citation to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .2919a, the court construed the complaint as including a claim for \"statutory conversion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) In its findings and conclusions, the state court opinion uses the terms embezzled and converted almost interchangeably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The state court opinion laid out a general timeline of the events in the case. It noted that Kevin purchased a \"starter\" house on Third Street\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   for George sometime in 2003, and that George claimed to have performed a lot of work on the house in 2005 and 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3.) The house was sold in June 2007, and George and his wife purchased a different home on Carr Road, in Muskegon, Michigan, in July 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The state court also found that George made fifteen withdrawals from Kevin's IRA account between April 2, 2007 and August 12, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3-4.) The total amount of these withdrawals was $51,200. The state court opinion recognized that George was acting pursuant to the DPOA when he made these withdrawals and at all other relevant times. It noted that George, \"to his credit,\" admitted withdrawing $51,200 from the IRA account. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7.) George also \"conceded that not all of the withdrawals were spent on the house,\" and alleged that Kevin had given him permission to borrow other amounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4.) In summary, the court explained that \"[m]uch of the case turns on the instructions Kevin gave George about how to manage the money and other items identified in the DPOA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The balance of the state court opinion attempts to reconcile the conflicting evidence and testimony presented by the parties on this point. The court noted, for example, that Kevin, in his judgment of divorce from George's mother, had promised to pay George $15,000 when the Third\n   Street house was sold. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7.) Other correspondence from Kevin to George gave George \"permission to borrow money, but ask[ed] him to keep track of it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For his part, George asserted that the money withdrawn from the IRA was spent on the Third Street house. The court noted, however, that George was never able to provide Kevin with a \"comprehensive tally\" of the \"sums he spent on the house.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 9.) Based on this, and other inconsistencies in George's testimony, the court concluded that George converted the money that was entrusted to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court made its most specific findings regarding George's conversion of the $14,500 he admitted to \"borrowing\" from his father in July 2007. The court quoted the August 2012 letter, in which George stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   I want to say sorry I borowed (sic) 14,500 from you in July of '07 to get my house. I didn't want to say anything. I didn't want you to get mad. I am going to pay you back when I get enuff (sic) equity in my house. I didn't realy (sic) have a choice. I needed to get a house. I was not going to buy that house from mom for 126,000. I had to pay some debt and put some on the house again I am sorry I pulled my power of attorney so I cant (sic) toch (sic) that moneny (sic).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10.) The court concluded that the \"thrust of this letter\" was that \"George took the money, knew it was wrong, and promised to make it right.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) According to the court, this conclusion was only bolstered by George's trial testimony, in which he admitted borrowing the money due to the financial stress he was under at the time and explained that he was ashamed of his actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The state court further held that the wording of George's letter established that this $14,500 withdrawal was \"in no way connected to the $15,000 George did not receive in the judgment of divorce, or to amounts he had invested in the Third Street property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ultimately, the court held that George had \"embezzled or converted certain of the sums\" that Kevin had entrusted to him under the DPOA. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10.) In support of this conclusion, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   There are several plausible explanations for George's conversion of the money entrusted to him. The first is that he may have had a fundamental misunderstanding ... about what the DPOA allowed him to do. Simply, the DPOA was not a gift to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Most people who misuse others' money, in this judge's experience, start with a fairly innocuous withdrawal and some intent to pay that money back. (Kevin's various communications may have created some of this.) However, when the first withdrawal is not detected, it becomes easier to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Perhaps the temptation here was simply too much for George. He admitted he was under financial pressure for much of this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   He also seemingly presumed or gambled that his father would not respond as he has ... However, these are choices George made, and he has lost that gamble.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court found that Kevin was entitled to damages in the amount of $51,200, plus an extra $2,000 George converted from Kevin's last paycheck and his employer's purchase of his tools, less $15,000 which was promised under the Judgment of Divorce and which was the \"amount Kevin agrees George's work [on the Third Street house] was worth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13-15.) Based on these figures, the court concluded that the net amount of compensatory damages\n   owed by George to Kevin was $38,200. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court declined to exercise its discretion to award treble damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .2919a for several reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 15-16.) First, it explained that \"Kevin's instructions about how and when to use this money were vague and ambiguous.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 16.) Second, it noted that \"George did perform many tasks for his father.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Finally, it stated that George did have some \"claim of right\" to a $15,000 payment relating to the house on Third Street and the Judgment of Divorce. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The state court also noted that Kevin had requested several other types of damages for which the evidence at trial was insufficient to grant a judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 15.) For instance, in his closing argument, Kevin argued that he may have sustained additional damages for \"penalties and interests\" due to the withdrawals George made. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The court held that Kevin presented no numbers on this issue \"from which the court [could] set a judgment amount.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The court found, however, the Kevin was entitled to recover certain attorney's fees, transportation costs, other \"routine\" court costs, and statutory interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 17.) The court invited Kevin to submit follow up documentation regarding these amounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After entry of the Opinion after Trial, Kevin filed a Motion for Entry of Judgment and brief in support of the motion on September 21, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Supplement to Summary Judgment Record, AP Dkt. No. 150, at Exh. B.) Despite the state court's prior findings about the damages to which he was entitled, Kevin's motion requests total damages of over $420,000. This request included $51,200 for the withdrawals from April 2, 2007, to August 12, 2010; $18,575.00 for \"Additional amounts embezzled;\" $270.00 for \"Wire transfer fees;\" $29,092.15 for \"Costs incurred from withdrawals;\" nearly $300,000 in treble damages; and other alleged attorney's fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) An appendix to Kevin's brief shows that the \"Additional amounts embezzled\" refers to \"newly found\" withdrawals alleged to have occurred in 2011 and 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at Appendix A.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the $270.00 in \"Wire transfer fees\" requested by Kevin, the appendix clarifies that $180.00 pertained to the 2007-2010 withdrawals, and $90.00 related to the 2011-2012 withdrawals. Similarly, the \"Costs incurred from withdrawals\" applied to both the previously litigated and the newly alleged withdrawals: $22,694.31 from the 2007-2010 withdrawals, and $6,397.84 from the 2011-2012 withdrawals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On November 4, 2015, the state court entered a judgment in favor of Kevin and against George in the total amount of $64,812.52. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Supplemental Brief, at Exh. 2.) Consistent with the findings regarding damages in the Opinion after Trial, the judgment amount was comprised of $38,200.00 in damages, $5,477.59 in Michigan Department of Corrections transportation costs, $13,684.58 in attorney's fees,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   $1,301.72 in other fees, and $6,148.63 in statutory interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1.) In the Order Entering Judgment, the state\n   court specifically denied Kevin's motion \"to the extent that it seeks to interject other alleged withdrawals (after 2010) that were not litigated in the trial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After entry of the judgment, Kevin filed several post-judgment motions in the state court, including a Motion for New Trial, Motion to Re-Open Discovery and Motion to Amend Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Supplement to Summary Judgment Record, AP Dkt. No. 150, at Exh. C, D and E.) The state court denied these motions in an order entered on November 20, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Supplement to Summary Judgment Record, AP Dkt. No. 150, at Exh. G) (sometimes referred to herein as \"Order Denying Post-Judgment Motions.\") The order noted that many of the claims raised in Kevin's post-judgment motions were \"simply requests for a 'do-over' of the trial already conducted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2.) The court opined that \"[t]o the extent that Kevin has viable claims which were not presented in the first case\" he might have other available options \"subject to principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The state court concluded that its order \"does not, by itself, bar Kevin from filing a new lawsuit\" but \"neither is it a finding that he can properly do that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   George filed his chapter 7 case on December 15, 2015. Kevin initiated this adversary proceeding on February 22, 2016. His amended complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserts that the damages awarded under the state court judgment should be nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6). Kevin's amended complaint also seeks a judgment from this court for the additional withdrawals from his IRA account he claims to have discovered after conclusion of the state court trial. Those withdrawals, which occurred between March 6, 2011 and March 26, 2012, total $18,575.00.

The Trustee, as representative of Kevin's bankruptcy estate, has asserted claims for additional damages for withdrawals that were allegedly made by George in 2011 and 2012 and were not included in the prior state court judgment. Therefore, the court must first determine whether the Trustee is permitted to bring these claims for additional damages, or whether the amount of the debt owed by George to Kevin is conclusively established by the res judicata effect of the state court judgment. This court must then consider whether the state court judgment is entitled to collateral estoppel effect in this adversary proceeding and, if so, whether the judgment debt, or some portion thereof, is nondischargeable based on the determinations made in prior state court litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Amount of the Debt and the Res Judicata Effect of the State Court Judgment\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition to seeking a determination that the prior judgment debt is excepted from discharge in George's chapter 7 case, the complaint in this adversary proceeding asks this court to find that Kevin is owed an additional debt for withdrawals that occurred from 2011 through 2012. George has moved for summary judgment on this portion of Kevin's complaint, arguing that res judicata bars Kevin, and now the Trustee as his privy, from seeking damages beyond those awarded in the state court action. As previously noted, res judicata, or claim preclusion, has limited applicability in nondischargeability proceedings, but applies to determinations regarding the validity, extent, or amount of the debt and precludes the bankruptcy court from revisiting those issues in most instances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckert v.

Although these additional withdrawals occurred during a later time period than the other transactions litigated in the state court, the last of the additional withdrawals occurred on March 26, 2012, which was nearly three years prior to the filing of Kevin's Fourth Amended Complaint on January 28, 2015. It was also well before the state court's Opinion on Summary Disposition, entered on June 4, 2015, and the Opinion after Trial, entered on July 16, 2015. Like the prior withdrawals, the 2011 and 2012 withdrawals are alleged to have been made by George from Kevin's IRA account pursuant to the DPOA. Therefore, the claims relating to the new withdrawals are related in \"time, space [and] origin\" to the withdrawals that were previously litigated in the state court and form \"a convenient trial unit\" with the prior withdrawals. Although George's answer to the complaint in this adversary proceeding contains only general denials of Kevin's allegations regarding the additional withdrawals, it is logical to assume that his justifications for making the withdrawals will be substantially similar to those asserted in the state court - i.e., that he had permission to use Kevin's money or misunderstood his responsibilities under the DPOA. Accordingly, the \"motivations\" for the additional withdrawals are likely to be the same, or very similar, to those already addressed by the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Trustee does not specifically dispute that the additional withdrawals were part of the same transaction as the withdrawals previously litigated.

The state court record supports Kevin's assertion that he was not aware of the 2011 and 2012 withdrawals until some time after the conclusion of the state court trial, but prior to entry of the state court opinion. But the record also suggests that Kevin's lack of knowledge was due to discovery issues and other practical obstacles relating to his incarceration. The Opinion after Trial specifically stated that Kevin contacted court staff on July 15, 2015, indicating that he had finally received additional bank records that he had subpoenaed. The opinion stated that Kevin had ample time to resolve subpoena issues prior to trial and noted that he might have benefitted from the assistance of counsel on these issues. Kevin's post-judgment motions for a new trial, to re-open discovery, and to amend his complaint, also reference the \"newly found\" 2011 and 2012 withdrawals. In denying these motions, the state court again noted the difficulties that Kevin had encountered as a pro se litigant. The court found, however, that he was not entitled to a \"do-over.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on a careful review of the state court record, this court finds no evidence that George concealed the 2011 and 2012 withdrawals from Kevin in the prior litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent these additional withdrawals were not disclosed, any fraud that\n   occurred in connection with the nondisclosure was confined to the discovery process and was intrinsic to the litigation.

His requests for relief were denied by the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Kevin had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims regarding George's conversion of funds from his IRA account in the state court litigation. He amended his complaint at least four times. The state court held four days of trial and issued a seventeen-page opinion. Kevin's claims for the 2011 and 2012 withdrawals were closely related to the claims that were asserted in the state court and could have been included in the prior litigation. They were not. Principles of res judicata preclude Kevin, and the Trustee by extension, from tacking additional damages on to the state court judgment that already addressed the validity and amount of his claim.

The state court found that Kevin gave George permission to borrow money and provided \"ambiguous\" instructions about how to manage the IRA account and other items covered by the DPOA. It also found that George was entitled to recover $15,000 from Kevin, to compensate for his work on the Third Street house and based on Kevin's promises prior to the Judgment of Divorce and in the judgment itself. In light of these facts, the court opined that George's conversion of the IRA funds may have come from a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" of what he was allowed to do pursuant to the DPOA or perhaps, from his willingness to \"gamble\" that his father would not respond as he did when he learned of the withdrawals. Neither of these potential explanations is consistent with a finding that George made the withdrawals with a knowing and wrongful intent to deprive his father of the IRA funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The single exception in the state court's opinion are its specific factual findings with regard to the $14,500 George admitted to \"borrowing\" from Kevin. Based on written statements in George's August 2012 letter about this transaction, the court held that George \"took the money, knew it was wrong, and promised to make it right.\" The state court also found that George's unauthorized conversion of these funds was entirely unrelated to his belief that Kevin owed him $15,000 under the judgment of divorce or was obligated to reimburse him for amounts spent on the Third Street property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   These findings establish that that George knowingly, intentionally, and fraudulently converted or embezzled the $14,500 from Kevin, which also\n   constitutes embezzlement under \u00a7 523(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The state court held a four-day bench trial on Kevin's claims and issued a detailed opinion after conclusion of that trial. No purpose would be served by revisiting the issues addressed by the state court in the context of this nondischargeability proceeding. A careful review of the state court's findings reveals that George acted with wrongful intent when he embezzled or converted the $14,500 from his father's IRA account. This amount, and the pro rata share of the derivative damages that are attributable to it, is excepted from discharge because it resulted from embezzlement under \u00a7 523(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment as to this amount. With regard to the other withdrawals addressed in the state court opinion and judgment, the state court's findings compel the conclusion that George was not acting with the requisite intent to deprive Kevin of his property. Accordingly, the debt for these amounts is not excepted from George's discharge as a debt for embezzlement under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and George is entitled to summary judgment on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Fraud or Defalcation in a Fiduciary Capacity\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   .

The court found that George took these funds from Kevin's IRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   account and knew it was wrong. This action was willful because George knew (and admitted) that Kevin was substantially certain to be harmed by this unauthorized withdrawal. It was also malicious, because the only reason George gave for the withdrawal - i.e., that he was under financial stress at the time - does not constitute just cause or excuse for converting his father's IRA funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The state court's findings similarly establish that the balance of the withdrawals were not made with willful or malicious intent. The state court made no findings that George acted with the intent to injure Kevin when making the withdrawals. By contrast, it did find that Kevin's ambiguous instructions and George's subjective beliefs about his entitlement to the funds, or some portion thereof, contributed to George's decision to make the withdrawals.

Like the state court, this court holds that the crimes for which Kevin is currently incarcerated are entirely irrelevant to the\n   claims in this adversary proceeding. The Defendant's more specific allegation that Kevin did not disclose the funds in his IRA account to the State of Michigan to avoid paying the costs of his incarceration is somewhat more relevant, but also lacks the direct connection required to invoke the unclean hands doctrine. Even if Kevin acted with the intent to defraud the State of Michigan, those actions do not directly relate to the wrongdoing asserted in Kevin's nondischargeable debt complaint, all of which pertain to George's conversion of the funds in the IRA account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, George's motion for summary judgment based on the doctrine of unclean hands is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, this court holds that the prior state court judgment conclusively established the existence, validity and amount of Kevin's claim against George for withdrawals made pursuant to the DPOA. To the extent the complaint in this adversary proceeding seeks to recover amounts beyond those included in the prior state court judgment, those claims are barred by res judicata.

This portion of the judgment debt, and the pro rata damages attributable to it, is nondischargeable as a debt for embezzlement under \u00a7 523(a)(4) and for willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).
