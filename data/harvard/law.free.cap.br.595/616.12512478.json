Ergo, once the Property Registrar (hereinafter \"Registrar\") qualifies the deeds that were presented in the Registry, they will be recorded as of the date of presentation. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed this interpretation. In\n   <em>\n    Gasolinas de Puerto Rico v. Richard Keeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896208\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/155/652/#p675\">\n    155 D.P.R. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (2001), the court concluded that the date of presentation will be the effective date of the recordation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words the recordation in the Registry produces its effects retroactively from the specific date of the presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Position\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff's contention in support of its challenge to Defendant's secured interest rests on the defects notified by the Registrar as to Segregation Deed No. 56\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (hereinafter\n   \"Deed 56\") which was executed by Lujan Developer, Inc., on November 13, 2009. These defects, the Trustee argues were never timely corrected. Pursuant to Article 1756 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, one of the requirements to constitute a mortgage contract is \"that the thing pledged or mortgaged is owned by the person who pledges or mortgages it.\" 31 PRLA \u00a7 5001(2). In the instant case, the property serving as collateral does not exist as it has not yet been segregated from Lot 500,029, therefore, Defendant cannot be construed as having a mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Article 238 of Law No. 210, 30 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 6390, provides in pertinent part that if a notification of defects is issued by the Registrar and not corrected or a writing for the Registrar to re-assess (\"recalificar\") the matters is not submitted in sixty (60) days, the Registry will issue an expiration note. The effect of the expiration note pursuant to Article 238, is found in Article 201 of said law. That Article provides that \"[t]he entries [\"asientos\"] of the Registry are extinguished and lose all its effect, in case of the cancellation, expiration or conversion. The right is considered to have ceased to exist from the moment of it being extinguished\". (\"The 'note of expiration in the presentation entry' (\"nota de caducidad en el asiento de presentaci\u00f3n\") \"expires\" and extinguishes the presentation entry.)\n   <em>\n    Derecho Registral Inmobiliario Puertorrique\u00f1o\n   </em>\n   , 2nd ed., Jur\u00eddica Editores, 2002, p. 326.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Trustee argues that even if the court determines that Banco Popular had a valid pre-petition lien, it cannot rely on Sections 362(b)(3) and 546(b)(1) of the Code to perfect or continue to perfect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputable that, as of the commencement of the Debtors' bankruptcy case, it appeared from the Registry that the notification of Segregation Deed No. 56 lapsed and the defects stood uncorrected. Thus, purchase deed no. 97 and mortgage deed no. 315 could not be recorded and would have to be notified with defects by the Registrar due to lack of track. Thusly, Defendant cannot use Sections 546(b)(1) and 362(b)(3) for the post-petition perfection of its lien. Defendant's inability to perfect its lien is what gives rise to the Trustee's assertion that he is entitled to seek the avoidance of said lien under Code Section 544(a)(3) as a bona fide purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Position\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that it does not contest that Deed 56 was subject to a notice of defect. However, as highlighted in its motion to dismiss, on April 23, 2018, Lujan Developer, Inc. executed Deed 13 before Notary Yelitza G. Vega Castro, whereby the defects notified by the Registrar as to Deed No. 56 were corrected pursuant to Puerto Rico Law. Defendant goes on to state that there is no reason to presume that Deed 13 will not be recorded on the main property, Lot no. 500,029.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant disagrees with the Plaintiffs' position and sustains that it has a secured interest over the Debtors' property. Defendant's mortgage deed is filed and pending recordation at the Registry and pursuant to applicable law, the ultimate date of recordation of its interest will relate back to the date in which the deed was originally presented in the Registry. In context, the mortgage deeds in question were filed with the Registry back in 2012, well before the commencement of the instant bankruptcy proceeding. The deeds whereas Debtors purchased a lot and executed the mortgage have not been notified of defects by the Registrar and are still pending recordation. Moreover, there exists no reason to assume that a defect notice will be issued by the Registrar. Consequently, BPPR's interest should be properly deemed as secured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant goes on to explain that nevertheless, in the unlikely event that a subsequent notice of defect is issued as to the purchase and mortgage deeds, Art. 238, supra, provides an alternative to correct any notification of defects by the Registrar. Art. 238 reads, in pertinent part, that \"the correction of the defects notified [by the Registrar] shall be made within sixty (60) days of the date of said notification.\" As such, the notary that receives the notification will have sixty days to correct the notification. Under Section 546(b)(1) of the Code this would be considered a pre-petition interest that could be perfected and does not constitute a violation of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Court's Ruling\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We start where we began.

A chapter 13 debtor filed an adversary proceeding to challenge the secured status of mortgagee (assignee) FirstBank's claim on the grounds that the deed of purchase in which the owners, prior to debtor's purchase of the property, was not registered and lapsed without the defects being cured. Further complicating the case, FirstBank had no facts to prove that it was the successor in interest of the original mortgagee. In light of these facts,\n   the court in\n   <em>\n    Mujica\n   </em>\n   affirmed the bankruptcy court's conclusion that there was a missing link with titleholders of real property which impaired assignee's ability to perfect the alleged lien,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for purposes of the statutory exception to the automatic stay in order to perfect interest in debtor's property. Specifically, where all that FirstBank had was an undated, unsupported endorsed mortgage note from mortgagee, and it failed to take action to correct defect in title upon notice of same from the Registrar within 60 days of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nonetheless, this court finds that\n   <em>\n    Mujica\n   </em>\n   can be distinguished from the case before us. At the outset, the\n   <em>\n    Mujica\n   </em>\n   court considered a deed of purchase which had not been registered due to the fact that there were defect(s) notified by the Registrar that had not been timely corrected. Moreover, the creditor, Firstbank, did not have the necessary documents to support the assignment from the original mortgagee. Neither of these facts are present in this case. The Trustee nor the Debtors have claimed that Banco Popular is not the rightful assignee. Also, and more to the point, the complaint includes as exhibit 3 a notification of default, which appears to be dated November 13, 2015. This notice was sent to the notary responsible for the presentation of Deed 56. However, the certification from the Registry dated February 2, 2017, (attached to the complaint as exhibit 4) contains, at Entry number 1316-846-AR01 regarding the presentation of Deed 56, that it is still pending recordation. Although the Trustee argues that this is an error given the lapse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   there is no documentation provided to support this assertion. The facts as presented in the complaint do not \"... allow[s] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable ...\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The facts contained in the complaint do not demonstrate that Trustee is entitled to relief. Debtors' and Banco Popular's Deeds 97 and 315 are still pending recordation.
