(the \"Plaintiff\") requesting a determination that the Defendants' claims and liens are invalid, in\n   whole or in part. The Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment because (1) the Plaintiff's claims are barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and (2) the Plaintiff does not allege facts establishing it has an injury in fact to support standing to challenge the extent, validity, or amount of the Defendants' secured claims. For the reasons discussed below, the Court will deny the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 19, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\"), The Weinstein Company Holdings, LLC, and its affiliates (collectively, the \"Debtors\"), filed for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Weinstein Company Holdings (\"Holdings\") is the parent company of Weinstein Television, LLC (\"TV\"), The Weinstein Company, LLC (\"Company\"), and TWC Borrower 2016, LLC (\"Borrower 2016\"). Weinstein Global Film Corporation (\"Global Film\") and TWC Domestic, LLC (\"Domestic\") are subsidiaries of Company. The Plaintiffs lent $45 million to Borrower 2016, which was secured by Company's interests in the stock of Global Film, by Global Film's interest in distribution and exploitation rights to certain Foreign Film Collateral, and by Holdings' membership interests in TV. The Plaintiff filed proofs of claim asserting a secured claim in excess of $46 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendant MUFG is the administrative agent under a pre-petition credit agreement between MUFG and Domestic, which was guaranteed by Company. Domestic scheduled MUFG as a secured creditor with a claim of approximately $156 million; Company scheduled MUFG as a secured creditor in an unknown amount. UBE is the administrative agent of a pre-petition security agreement with Domestic, which scheduled it as a secured creditor in the amount of approximately $15 million. Neither MUFG nor UBE have filed any proofs of claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court entered a final order authorizing the Debtors to obtain post-petition financing on April 19, 2018 (the \"Final DIP Order\"). (Adv. D.I. 1-13, Ex. M.) The Final DIP Order authorized a DIP loan of up to $25 million between the Debtors and MUFG, as administrative agent for itself and the other DIP lenders. The Final DIP Order also allowed all non-debtor parties in interest seventy-five \"days from the petition date to investigate the validity, perfection and enforceability of the Pre-Petition Liens and the Pre-Petition Obligations ... and to assert any other claims or causes of action against the Pre-Petition Secured Parties or UBE Secured Parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) The Order stated that \"nothing contained in the DIP Loan Documents or this Final Order shall be deemed to confer standing on any party-in-interest to commence a challenge\" of the Defendants' claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Order also allowed the Defendants to receive the proceeds of the sale of the Debtors' assets \"subject to disgorgement to the extent any Challenge asserted in accordance with the terms of this Final Order is ultimately sustained by the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Early in the case, the Debtors sought approval to sell substantially all of their assets to Lantern Capital (\"Lantern\") for $310 million. (APA Ex. P, Adv. D.I. 1-16.) On April 6, 2018, the Court approved the Debtors' proposed bidding procedures, but when no overbid was received, the Court entered a Sale Order on May 9, 2018, confirming the sale to Lantern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 2, 2018, the seventy-fifth day from the Petition Date, the Plaintiff filed an adversary complaint objecting to the Defendants' claims and seeking, inter alia, a determination of the extent of the Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   security interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Defendants filed an answer on August 27, 2018, and a Motion for Summary Judgment on September 7, 2018. The Plaintiff filed a response to the Motion on October 5, 2018. A notice of completion of briefing was filed on October 31, 2018. The matter is ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (K), (N), (O) and 1334. Further, this proceeding requires the interpretation and enforcement of certain terms of the Sale Order and the Final DIP Order previously entered in this case. \"Bankruptcy courts have subject matter jurisdiction to interpret and enforce their own orders.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Insilco Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451808\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/351/313/#p319\">\n    351 B.R. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319 (Bankr.

They contend that the Court specifically authorized the allocation of the sale proceeds to the Defendants under the Sale Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, the express language of the Sale Order belies that argument. Paragraph 8 of the Sale Order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The DIP Agent is hereby authorized to distribute the amount received by the DIP Agent, which amount shall be deemed indefeasible, to the DIP Lenders in accordance with the terms of the DIP Loan Documents. The Pre-Petition Agent is hereby authorized to distribute the amount received by the Pre-Petition Agent, which amount shall be deemed indefeasible following the Investigation Termination Date (subject to the immediately succeeding sentence), to the Pre-Petition Lenders in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Petition Loan Documents.\n   <em>\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts paid to the Pre-Petition Agent and, as applicable, distributed to the Pre-Petition Lenders pursuant to the terms of this Order and the Final DIP Order, shall be subject to disgorgement to the extent any Challenge asserted in accordance with the terms of the Final DIP Order is ultimately sustained by the Court.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Adv. D.I. 1-16, Ex. P (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Defendants assert nonetheless that paragraph 62 of the Sale Order precludes the Plaintiff's challenge. That paragraph reads in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Notwithstanding paragraph CC of this Order and\n   <em>\n    except as expressly set forth in section 2.7(i) of the APA\n   </em>\n   , the Final DIP Order or this Order, the allocation of the Cash Purchase Price set forth in section 2.7 of the APA shall not be binding on any party in interest other than as between the Debtors and the Purchaser and shall not bind the Court in\n   determining the allocation of the remaining proceeds of the Sale Transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Adv. D.I. 1-16, Ex. P (emphasis added).) Section 2.7 of the APA states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Each of Buyer and each Seller Party hereby acknowledges and agrees\n   </em>\n   that the Cash Purchase Price shall be allocated such that (i) the value of the Purchased Assets that comprise the TWC Domestic Collateral is greater than the sum of (v) the TWC Domestic Debt (in the amount, as of the date hereof, of approximately $175 million (inclusive of the Pre-Petition Agent's financial advisor's deferred fee) ), plus (w) the principal amount outstanding under the DIP Financing Agreement, in the form filed on the Petition Date for approval by the Bankruptcy Court ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Adv. D.I. 1-16, Ex. N (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By its very language, however, Section 2.7 states only an agreement between the buyer of the assets, Lantern, and the sellers, the Debtors. It does not by its terms bind all other parties to that allocation. The Court concludes, further, that paragraph 62 cannot be interpreted in isolation, because the terms of the Sale Order are \"nonseverable and mutually dependent.\" (Adv. D.I. 1-16, Ex. P at \u00b6 63.)\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Trico Marine Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757189\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/450/474/#p483\">\n    450 B.R. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (Bankr.

D.I. 1-16 at \u00b6 8.) To interpret section 2.7(i) of the APA and paragraph 62 of the Sale Order to prevent a party from raising a proper challenge pursuant to the Final DIP Order would violate the traditional canons of contract construction by nullifying paragraph 8 of the Sale Order and would indirectly modify the terms of the Final DIP Order, without notice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Energy Future Holdings Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349660\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/540/96/#p104\">\n    540 B.R. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 (Bankr.

S.D.N.Y. Jan. 12, 2016) (concluding that an exculpation provision in a final financing order protected the DIP Lender and consequently\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precluded a third party from asserting claims against the DIP Lender which were\n   known at the time of entry of the financing order). This, they contend, precludes the Plaintiff's challenge to their liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In response, the Plaintiff argues that it properly asserted a challenge in accordance with the terms of the Final DIP Order, and therefore\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   cannot preclude the Plaintiff from challenging the Defendants' claims. The Plaintiff distinguishes the cases cited by the Defendants, noting that in each case cited by the Defendants the challenging party either did not raise a challenge within the time period contemplated by the order or the order did not allow for a challenge to be brought at all. Here, on the other hand, the Final DIP Order expressly allowed for a challenge to be raised, and the Plaintiff raised such challenge within the specified time limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court agrees that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   does not prevent the Plaintiff from asserting its challenge. The plain language of the Final DIP Order specifically provides for such a challenge in paragraph 16, which states that a non-debtor party-in-interest has \"[75] days from the Petition Date ... to investigate the validity ... of the Pre-Petition Liens ... and to assert any other claims or causes of action against the Pre-Petition Secured Parties.\" (Adv. D.I. 1-13 at \u00b6 16.) The Plaintiff's complaint was filed within that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Defendants assert, however, that the Plaintiff did not bring a challenge in accordance with the terms of the Final DIP Order because the Plaintiff did not follow a three-step process. According to them, that process required that the Plaintiff (a) investigate the validity, perfection, and enforceability of the pre-petition liens and obligations; (b) be granted standing and authority by the Court to file an objection; and (c) file an objection. The entire process, the Defendants argue, must have been completed prior to the Investigation Termination Date. The Defendants contend that because the Plaintiff failed to do so, they did not comply with the Final DIP Order requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Plaintiff responds that nothing in the Final DIP Order requires it to investigate, but merely preserves that right. The Final DIP Order allows a non-debtor party in interest a time period to raise a challenge, and that is what the Plaintiff did. The Plaintiff contends, in particular, that it would have been impractical to require a complete and detailed analysis and valuation of the film rights collateral before the challenge deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court agrees that the Final DIP Order did not require an investigation prior to raising an objection. The Court does not think it is reasonable to interpret the Final DIP Order to require that a non-debtor party-in-interest conduct an investigation prior to asserting a challenge to the pre-petition creditors' liens, particularly given the short time (75 days from the Petition Date) within which to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Defendants also argue, however, that the Plaintiff did not comply with the terms of the Final DIP Order because it did not seek and obtain an order from the Court granting it standing to file its challenge. The Defendants argue that sections 506 and 502 of the Bankruptcy Code do not confer standing on an individual creditor to challenge the liens or claims of another secured creditor. They contend that the Plaintiff's claims are estate causes of action which require derivative standing to bring them. They further argue that Plaintiff's recovery is far too attenuated for the Plaintiff to allege any individual injury capable of redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Plaintiff responds that it is scheduled as a creditor and filed proofs of claim against Holdings, Company, Global Film, and TWC Borrower in a secured amount of $46 million based on its pre-petition loan. The Plaintiff asserts that its proof of claim is prima facie evidence of its claim. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(f) (\"A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with these rules shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.\"). Thus, the Plaintiff argues that sections 502 and 506 of the Bankruptcy Code grant it standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Standing under the Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court agrees with the Plaintiff.

The parent argued that it was a party in interest with standing under \u00a7 1109(b) because it was a creditor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-13. Its creditor status, however, was premised on a possible contribution and indemnity claim against the debtor (a) if certain asbestos personal injury claimants sued and recovered from the parent on an alter ego theory, and (b) if the parent had to remediate the debtor's environmental contamination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113. The\n   <em>\n    Flintkote\n   </em>\n   court held that the parent had no standing, because it had not filed a timely proof of claim and could not establish excusable neglect for failing to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the court concluded that standing premised on a possible future lawsuit founded on alter ego liability was far too remote.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court finds the facts and circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Flintkote\n   </em>\n   are inapposite. Here, there is no dispute that the Plaintiff is a creditor; it filed a timely filed proof of claim. (Adv. D.I. 28, Ex. A.) Further, the Plaintiff's status as a creditor is not based on any remote contingency, such as being held liable on an alter ego theory. Instead, it is based on the fact that the Plaintiff lent funds to the Debtors. Thus, the Plaintiff has standing under section 1109(b) to \"appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter.\" Since that standing is co-extensive with Article III standing, the Court concludes that the Plaintiff also has Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    Glob.
