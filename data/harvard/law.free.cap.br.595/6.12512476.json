Specifically, the bankruptcy court ruled that the schools were not \"the initial transferee[s]\" of the payments within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) but rather subsequent transferees that took in good faith from the debtor's children, and thus that the schools were entitled to the protections of \u00a7 550(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The bankruptcy court's analysis of this thorny issue was sound, but because the bankruptcy court appears not to have grappled with a key factual question, I vacate the decision below and remand the cases for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 30, 2008, a lawsuit was filed against the debtor in these bankruptcy actions, alleging that the debtor had \"bilk[ed]\" his friend out of \"millions of dollars\" by encouraging the friend to buy coins from the debtor at inflated prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at 1,\n   <em>\n    Marini v.

On August 17, 2016, that trustee, the appellant here, initiated adversary proceedings in the bankruptcy court against the three schools to avoid and recover from them all the above-mentioned tuition payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069545\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/995/155/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at TA0004-05.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 28, 2018, on cross-motions for summary judgment in the three adversary proceedings, the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to the schools in a single opinion, ruling that \"the undisputed facts establish that the Debtor's children were the initial transferees of the Debtor's transfers, and that the [schools] are entitled to the good faith defense provided by \u00a7 550(b).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069545\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/995/155/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at TA0005.

Feb. 2, 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the schools were mere conduits or initial transferees of the tuition payments depends on when the payments were made.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Tuition for an undergraduate or law degree is not owed all at once. Rather, it is\n   typically collected on a periodic basis, such as per semester.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Appellant App. Pt. IV, at TA0751 (stating that, at Fairfield, \"[t]uition invoices are sent out in July for the following Fall Semester and in December for the following Spring Semester\"). And, at least in the case of the appellee schools, students who withdraw from their program may be entitled to a refund of tuition payments already made on their behalf, depending on how early in the school year they withdraw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant App. Pt. I, at TA0010. Whether the schools exercise dominion and control over tuition payments immediately upon receipt thus depends on when each particular payment is made. As explained below, in the case of any tuition paid early enough that the recipient school would have been obligated to refund it to the student if he or she then withdrew, the school must be classified as a mere conduit and the student an initial transferee, regardless of whether the student actually withdrew from school. But as for tuition paid so late that the student could never have had any right to obtain it, even had he or she withdrawn from school immediately, the school had dominion and control from the outset and thus is properly considered the initial transferee. For clarity, I refer to payments of the first type as \"refundable\" and payments of the second type as \"nonrefundable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1. As to refundable payments, the bankruptcy court found that the Seventh Circuit's landmark decision in\n   <em>\n    Bonded\n   </em>\n   was \"exactly on point\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at TA0021). Although the fact patterns can be differentiated, I agree with the bankruptcy court that\n   <em>\n    Bonded\n   </em>\n   shows why the schools cannot be considered initial transferees of these payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bonded\n   </em>\n   , a debtor \"sent [a] Bank a check payable to the Bank's order ... with a note directing the Bank to 'deposit this check into [a third party]'s account.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bonded\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310368,6125533\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/890/\">\n    838 F.2d at 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once the money was routed into the account, the third party \"instructed the Bank to debit the account $200,000\" as repayment of a loan that he owned the bank.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310368,6125533\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/890/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trustee in that case argued that the bank was the initial transferee of the debtor \"because [the bank] was the payee of the check it received,\" but the court rejected this argument, ruling that the bank \"acted as a financial intermediary\" and \"received no benefit\" from the initial transfer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310368,6125533\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/890/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310368,6125533\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/890/\">\n    at 891, 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit's reasoning is instructive, as the facts are reminiscent of this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [The bank] received nothing from [the debtor] that it could call its own .... The Bank had no dominion over the $200,000 until ... [the third party] instructed the Bank to debit the account to reduce the loan; in the interim, so far as the Bank was concerned, [the third party] was free to invest the whole $200,000 in lottery tickets or uranium stocks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310368,6125533\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/890/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1310368,6125533\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/890/\">\n    at 893-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Just so here: even though the schools received the tuition payments directly from the debtor and eventually applied those payments toward his children's incurred tuition charges, the schools did not have dominion over the tuition payments until the children no longer had any legal right to a refund. Before then, the schools' retention of the payments was subject to the possibility that the debtor's children would withdraw from school and take the money with them, and thus the schools had insufficient dominion and control at that point to be considered initial transferees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meoli v.
