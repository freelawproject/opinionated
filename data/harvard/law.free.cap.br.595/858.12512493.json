On the same day, the Court entered an order authorizing joint administration of the PostRock Debtors' chapter 11 cases for procedural purposes pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 1015(b) ; however, the bankruptcy estates were not, and are not, consolidated. On April 7, 2016, the Court entered an order granting an agreed motion to appoint a trustee, and, on April 8, 2016, Trustee was appointed the chapter 11 trustee in these jointly administered cases [Doc. 75].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this adversary proceeding, Trustee originally sought to avoid and recover certain transfers as either preferential or fraudulent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 550, and to disallow claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) &amp; (j).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court previously dismissed the Original Complaint as not meeting the \"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   plausibility standard\" of pleading, finding the Original Complaint \"omit[ted] critical information and ma[d]e numerous legal conclusions without facts to support them,\" but granted Trustee leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The substantially altered and fleshed out Amended Complaint has now been filed addressing the deficiencies previously identified by the Court.

The Amended Complaint fairly apprises Defendant of the nature of the claims against him, raises allegations which, if proven at trial, would establish Trustee's right to recover, and moves the claims from merely conceivable to plausible. Trustee is not required, nor expected, to state specific facts proving each element of his claim so long as fair notice of the claims and the grounds upon which they rest are set forth.\n   <em>\n    Higginbottom v.

But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 does not impose an onerous pleading standard. In fact, Rule 8(a)(2) requires only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Further, the philosophy of Rule 8(a)(2) is reinforced by Rule 8(d), which permits alternative statements and inconsistent claims and defenses, and Rule 8(e), which requires pleadings to be construed so as to do justice. Therefore, federal courts have repeatedly emphasized that pleadings are to be construed liberally in accordance with the justice mandate in Rule 8(e) and the general spirit of the Federal Rules.

Defendant was, at or around August 1, 2014, the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of PostRock and an \"insider\" within the meaning of Section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Defendant was an individual for whose benefit certain of the recoverable transfers alleged in this Amended Complaint were made, and/or an immediate or mediate transferee of such recoverable transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   4. Although separate general ledgers were maintained for each PostRock Debtor, financial statements for PostRock were issued on a consolidated basis for book, audit, SEC reporting, and tax purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   5. The general ledgers maintained for each PostRock Debtor are unreliable due to intercompany accounting inaccuracies, including the recording of\n   certain assets and liabilities under the wrong entity's general ledger and not allocating expenses to each entity. As such, the PostRock Debtors' separate entity general ledgers, trial balances, and other accountings may not report correct balances in either balance sheet or income statement accounts until consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   6. On December 20, 2012, the PostRock Debtors refinanced their existing revolving credit facility (the \"Borrowing Base Facility\"), with PESC and PostRock MidContinent Production, LLC, as borrowers, secured by a first lien on substantially all of the PostRock Debtors' assets. The Borrowing Base Facility is guaranteed by all of the subsidiaries of PostRock other than non-debtor CEPM. As of the Petition Date, the principal amount outstanding under the Borrowing Base Facility was approximately $ 65 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   7. The PostRock Debtors struggled financially due to the sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices. The low price for oil and natural gas significantly affected the PostRock Debtors' revenues from sales of its oil and gas production. Consequently, in February 2015, PostRock sought to sell substantially all of its assets, but was unable to locate a buyer willing to make an offer sufficient to fully satisfy the outstanding financial obligations under the Borrowing Base Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   8. In February 2016, the PostRock Debtors defaulted under the Borrowing Base Facility, and in March 2016, the lender accelerated the balance of indebtedness rendering the entire principal balance plus all accrued interest immediately due and payable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   9. The PostRock Debtors' financial difficulties leading to the filing of the Bankruptcy Cases are attributable to a combination of factors, all of which placed significant stress on the PostRock Debtors' liquidity position in the years leading up to the Petition Date. PostRock's financial statements included in its publicly filed SEC Form 10-Q and 10-K filings, for the periods ended September 30, 2012, through September 30, 2014, show PostRock maintained negative total book equity between negative $ 17.2 million and negative $ 40.1 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   10. In the fourth quarter of 2014, PostRock's financial statements indicated positive equity of approximately $ 18.2 million; however, PostRock's Forms 10-K for the year ended 2014 stated the value of oil and natural gas properties were calculated under the full cost method, which is a book value. Book value is not considered a fair value for solvency purposes. The book value using full cost method of accounting requires write downs and impairments to book value based on reserve pricing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   11. Additionally, on December 31, 2014, PostRock converted over $ 41 million in Series A Cumulative preferred stock and other items to equity. By the second quarter of 2015, PostRock's total book equity had decreased to negative $ 38.6 million and continued decreasing to negative $ 105 million by December 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   12. PostRock reported operating losses for each of the five years ending before the Petition Date - 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. PostRock's annual SEC Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2014, filed on March 31, 2015, reported a net loss from operations of $ 67,000. However, the operating loss for the fourth\n   quarter 2014 was $ 1.07 million as compared to 2014's first quarter operating income of $ 703,000. Per PostRock's quarterly SEC 10-Q's, the operating losses were $ 7.8 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2015, $ 47.4 million for the quarter ending June 30, 2015, and $ 41.3 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2015. The unaudited financial statements for the quarter ending December 31, 2015, shows an operating loss of $ 22.8 million, resulting in a FY 2015 total operating loss of approximately $ 119.4 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   13. PostRock's annual SEC Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed on March 31, 2015, and as reflected in the 2014 audit report, reported the White Deer transactions had been mischaracterized and that the Series A Preferred Stock should have been recorded as a liability from the outset, not equity. As a result, PostRock was required to restate its consolidated financial statements for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. These mischaracterizations have to be taken into account in the solvency analysis as far back as 2010 and the effect on the company's financial condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   14. PostRock's stock price continued to fall from $ 12.40 at April 1, 2014, to $ 0.30 at December 31, 2015, or an approximate 96 percent decrease in stock price during the same period. Also, for the period December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, the stock price decreased approximately 85 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Transfer to or for the Benefit of Defendant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   15. At various times between 2010 and 2015, even when commodity prices were falling, PostRock was laying off employees, and PostRock's financial situation was increasingly dire, PostRock implemented bonus and retention incentive plans for certain PostRock employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   16. The effect of these plans was to reward certain officers, directors, and/or employees with financial incentives and bonus payments even when PostRock was failing (or, at the very least, was in the \"zone of insolvency\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   17. Based on the PostRock Debtors' records, during the two years preceding the Petition Date, PESC made a certain payment to Defendant.

The difficulty facing Trustee in correcting such allegations in the Amended Complaint are the facts that: (i) the PostRock Debtors maintained consolidated books and records for book, audit, SEC reporting, and tax purposes; (ii) while separate ledgers were maintained for each PostRock Debtor, the entity ledgers have proven to be unreliable and inaccurate; and (iii) Trustee was not in control of, and had no input in, the preparation of the consolidated books and records or the entity ledgers at the time of the Transfer, having been appointed chapter 11 trustee only after the cases were filed and having no connection to the PostRock Debtors prior to his appointment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While these facts and circumstances may ultimately make proving insolvency on an entity basis difficult, they should not be a barrier to Trustee seeking relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is settled law that the determination of insolvency is a fact question, and fact questions are not determined on motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    LaMonica v.

E.D. Ky. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court finds Trustee has done an adequate job of plausibly stating that PESC was insolvent. First, Trustee alleged that PESC was insolvent for the period between April 1, 2014, and the Petition Date (Amended Complaint \u00b6 31). Additionally, PESC was a wholly owned subsidiary of PostRock and was one of two primary obligors under the $ 200 million Borrowing Base Facility with Lenders. On the Petition Date, the outstanding indebtedness was approximately $ 65 million. When oil and gas prices sharply declined in 2014, the PostRock Debtors faced declining asset values, as reflected by negative book equity of $ 17.2 million in September 2012, to negative $ 40.1 million in September 2014. Revenues also declined, operating losses mounted, and stock prices declined 413 percent from April 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015. From these facts, Trustee paints a plausible picture of insolvency for the PostRock Debtors\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     as a whole and separately\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because the Amended Complaint states that PESC was primarily liable on the $ 200 million Borrowing Base Facility with a balance of $ 65 million on the Petition Date and at a level exceeding the combined asset base of the PostRock Debtors and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     far exceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the asset base of PESC by February 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trustee has plausibly stated that PESC was insolvent at the relevant times. At trial, as opposed to on a motion to dismiss, Trustee will be required to prove PESC's insolvency at the relevant times on an entity basis - as the PostRock Debtors' estates remain separate, having not been substantively consolidated but only jointly administered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     THE AMENDED COMPLAINT PLAUSIBLY STATES THAT PESC DID NOT RECEIVE REASONABLY EQUIVALENT VALUE\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Similar to insolvency, courts also liberally review claims for constructive fraud based on a lack of reasonably equivalent value because of the trustee's position as a third party to the debtor and its transactions.\n   <em>\n    PennySaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511937\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/587/445/#p456\">\n    587 B.R. at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On its face, the Amended Complaint plausibly states that no reasonably equivalent value was received in exchange for the Potential Fraudulent Transfer for a very simple reason. The Amended Complaint alleges that the Potential Fraudulent Transfer was made by PESC. However, Defendant was not employed by PESC, but rather by PostRock. Yet, the Potential Fraudulent Transfer was made by PESC, plausibly suggesting the absence of reasonably equivalent value in exchange.

Additionally, Defendant recognizes that Trustee plausibly, albeit incorrectly\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   according to Defendant, alleges that Defendant was an insider of PostRock but not PESC. Defendant is wrong on both counts for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, the Amended Complaint clearly states that Defendant was the Executive\n   Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer of PostRock at or around August 1, 2014, the date the Transfer was made. Amended Complaint, \u00b6 14 (on p 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Section 101(31)(B) (ii and iii), an officer and a person in control of a debtor are considered insiders. Thus, per the facts set forth in the Amended Complaint, Defendant is an insider of PostRock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, PostRock is the ultimate owner of PESC's stock. Amended Complaint, \u00b6 16 (the first \u00b6 16 on p. 4). Under Section 101(31)(E), an affiliate or insider of an affiliate is considered an insider of the debtor. An affiliate is defined as \"an entity that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the debtor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). As PESC is owned by PostRock, and Defendant is an insider of PostRock, the Amended Complaint plausibly states that Defendant is also an insider of PESC as he is an insider of an affiliate of PESC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Motion is DENIED.

The Court is, however, bound to accept the facts as alleged in this Amended Complaint. While the Court recognizes the difficulty in wrangling the fact allegations in ten separate adversary proceedings, it is not an impossible task and both Trustee and Defendants could have done a better job proofing and ensuring that their pleadings were complete and accurate, and the Court's task was made more difficult as a result of the parties' failure to focus on the details.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Trustee's Amended Complaint clearly states \"PESC made certain payments to Defendant\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 28), and further focuses on PESC as the transferor in its stated claims. However, the Amended Complaint also alludes to avoidance and recovery of all transfers \"made by the PostRock Debtors\" (Amended Complaint, \u00b6 37). Additionally, Trustee's Response states \"Trustee will seek to avoid and recover from defendant for whose benefit transfers were made by any of the PostRock Debtors,\" and alleges \"Trustee has sufficiently stated a claim on behalf of all Debtors.\" (Response, p. 5). The Court strongly disagrees. In its September 6, 2018, order dismissing Trustee's Original Complaint, the Court found it deficient, in part, due to failure to identify the transferor, stating \"because the 'PostRock Debtors' consist of six different entities, which have been joined for procedural purposes only, the Complaint does not adequately identify the transferor.\" Having emphasized that Trustee's identification of the specific PostRock Debtor making the transfers was necessary and critical, the Court construes the Amended Complaint as identifying only PESC as the transferor. Absent Trustee being granted leave to amend, the Court will not consider the transfer as being made by any other PostRock Debtor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Verified Statement of Stephen J.
