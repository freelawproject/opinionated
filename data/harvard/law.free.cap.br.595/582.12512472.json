Creditor equality was given a ringing endorsement in the influential 1807 case of\n   <em>\n    Locke v. Winning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2005719\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/3/325/\">\n    3 Mass. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mass. 1807). The concept of recovery of preferential transfers was found in the 1841, 1867 and 1898 Bankruptcy Acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Atna Liquidating Trust, Kenneth J. Buechler, Liquidating Trustee (\"Trustee\"), sued to avoid and recover certain transfers made by CR Briggs Corporation (the \"Debtor\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Defendant Black\n   Diamond Blade Company d/b/a Cutting Edge Supply (\"Cutting Edge\") as preferential transfers pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 550 on April 25, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Trustee seeks to avoid and recover three transfers aggregating $ 49,979.50 identified in Exhibit A to the Complaint (the \"Transfers\"). The Transfers were payments Debtor made to Cutting Edge during the ninety day period prior to the filing of the petition on November 18, 2015 (the \"Preference Period\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After discovery, Cutting Edge timely moved for summary judgment, arguing the Transfers were made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the Debtor and Cutting Edge. Therefore, Cutting Edge contends it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that the Transfers are excepted from avoidance pursuant to \u00a7 547(c)(2)(A). The Trustee responded to the Motion and asserted a Cross Motion for summary judgment. Cutting Edge then filed a response in which it requested denial of the Trustee's Cross Motion as untimely, or, alternatively, denial on the merits. However, at the hearing, the parties stipulated that there were no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the matter was ripe for determination by the Court on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cutting Edge is a distributor of products, tools, and equipment for the mining, construction, materials processing, and waste and recycling industries. The Debtor was engaged in mineral exploration and mining operations in California. In December 2013, Debtor and Cutting Edge entered into a Consignment Agreement (\"Agreement\"), under which Cutting Edge sold products needed for mining operations to Debtor. The Transfers were payments made to Cutting Edge in payment for products purchased by the Debtor under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to the Preference Period, Debtor paid twenty-two Cutting Edge invoices issued between January 2014 and March 2015. During this time period, Debtor paid each and every invoice in full. The Agreement was silent on payment terms. While the invoices called for payments to be made in thirty days of the date of each invoice, Debtor made payments from 43 days to 127 days after the date of the corresponding invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Preference Period, Debtor made three payments to Cutting Edge. Cutting Edge issued one invoice on May 28, 2015, in the amount of $ 34,979.40, and a second invoice on June 30, 2015, in the amount of $ 33,871.90. Debtor did not pay either of these invoices in full. Instead, Debtor paid $ 17,489.70 on August 31, 2015 (95 days after the first invoice date), $ 17,489.70 on September 9, 2015 (104 days after the first invoice date), and $ 15,000 on October 9, 2015 (101 days after the second invoice date). Cutting Edge did not engage in any usual collection activities related to the Transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Trustee filed a Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on December 13, 2017. Cutting Edge responded and opposed the Cross Motion on December 27, 2017. A review of Cutting Edge's response to the Cross Motion for Summary Judgment reflects it admitted the elements of a preferential transfer claim under \u00a7 547(b). Cutting Edge admitted paragraphs 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and does not contest (which this court views as an admission) paragraphs 20 and 24 of the Cross Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Specifically, Cutting Edge admitted the allegations set forth in the aforementioned paragraphs that it received transfers of the Debtors' property totaling $ 49,979.50 on account of antecedent debt with ninety days of the Debtor's bankruptcy case made while the Debtor was insolvent and which enabled Cutting Edge to receive more than it would have had the transfers not been made and it received payment of its debt in a chapter 7 case of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Cutting Edge argues the Transfers are excepted from avoidance pursuant to the \"ordinary course of business\" (\"OCB\") defense in \u00a7 547(c)(2). To prove an exception to avoidance under \u00a7 547(c)(2), Cutting Edge bears the burden of proof of establishing the exception by a preponderance of the evidence. \u00a7 547(g) ;\n   <em>\n    Jubber v.

Neither side focused on the amount of the payments. The amount of the payments made by the Debtor within the preference period differed markedly from the amount of the payments made by the Debtor before the preference period. The Debtor paid each invoice amount in full before the preference period. However, the Debtor's payment practices differed within the preference period. Here, two of the three payments made within the preference period were split payments in identical amounts ($ 17,489.50) paying one-half of the invoice amount in one case and almost one-half the invoice amount in the other case, and the third payment ($ 15,000) was in a round dollar amount which did not correspond to the amount of any of the invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a one-time payment of $ 200,000, arising from a first-time transaction between the parties, was within the ordinary course of business in\n   <em>\n    C.W. Mining.\n   </em>\n   In that case, there was not a pattern of prior dealings with which to compare the single payment. However, when the terms of payment deviate from prior dealings, the OCB defense may not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The bankruptcy court in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re Ewald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6551823\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/45/52/#p58\">\n    45 B.R. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58-59 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1984), held that split payments were outside of the ordinary course of business of the parties. In\n   <em>\n    Ewald\n   </em>\n   , the debtor made split payments within the preference period and had never made split payments before the preference period, and the court found that as a result of splitting the payments only within the preference period, such payments were not ordinary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The bankruptcy court in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re Radnor Holdings Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202004226\">\n    2009 WL 2004226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Del. 2009), reached a similar result where the amount of the payments and full versus partial payments were different within the preference period. The\n   <em>\n    Radnor\n   </em>\n   court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Further, during the Preference Period, as to the payments at issue, Debtors paid Defendant exclusively in multiples of $ 5,000 and always in partial payment of the applicable invoice. During the Historical Period, Debtors paid Defendant the exact applicable invoice amount as to all but one invoice and never in multiples of $ 5,000. The significant discrepancies evident in these differing payment practices-spanning timing, payment amount, and full versus partial payment-demonstrate convincingly that the disputed payments during the Preference Period were not in the ordinary course of business. That Defendant did not take advantage of Debtors' deteriorating financial condition or otherwise take unusual action as to collecting its debts does not negate the fact that Debtors' payment practices as to these four payments differed markedly from the payment practices during the Historical Period. Accordingly, I find that the four payments at issue were not in the ordinary course of business, and thus do not fall within \u00a7 547(c)(2)(A). The four identified payments are avoidable and recoverable as preferential transfers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Debtor's split payments and payment of a round dollar amount were markedly different than the amounts of the payments made within the preference period. These \"significant discrepancies....demonstrate convincingly that the disputed payments were not in the ordinary course of business\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Thus, based upon this conclusion, the Court need not address the timing of the\n   payments question. Since Cutting Edge has failed to satisfy its burden of proof to prove the OCB defense under \u00a7 547(c)(2)(A), the Trustee's cross motion for summary judgment (docket number 13) be and hereby is GRANTED and judgment shall enter in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant in the amount of $ 49,979.50 under \u00a7\u00a7 547(b) and 550(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    CR Briggs Corporation (15-22850) is one of the Debtors in cases jointly administered under Atna Resources, Inc.
