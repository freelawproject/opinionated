Thorne, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Introduction &amp; Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This matter conies before the court upon the motion of the trustee to have default judgments entered against various defaulted Defendants in these proceedings. Namely, the trustee seeks the entry of a default judgment against Zig Zag Corporation (Zig Zag), ZZC, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Michael Wolf, Scott Wolf, Peter Wolf, SHBM, Inc. (SHBM), Hound Ventures, Inc. (Hound Ventures), and MMQB, Inc (referred to throughout as MMQB, Inc. so as not to\n   confuse the entity with the underlying \"MMQB business\" allegedly held by this entity and others). All have been defaulted either for failing to answer or for having disregarded this court's discovery orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For reasons given more fully below, the court finds for the trustee and against Scott Wolf on Counts 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 of the complaint. The court also finds for the trustee and against ZZC, Inc. on Counts 1, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the complaint. The court further finds for the trustee and against Michael Wolf on Counts 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the complaint. The court would find for the trustee and against MMQB, Inc. on Counts 1, 7, 8, and 9 of the complaint but for constitutional concerns, so the court will issue a separate order delineating Parts II, III, IV, VI.a, VI.g.1, VI.h.1, VI.i.1, and VI.r.2 of this opinion as its proposed findings of fact and conclusions law, with one of the court's ultimate proposed conclusions of law being that judgment be entered in favor of the trustee and against MMQB, Inc. on Counts 1, 7, 8, and 9 of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trustee's theory, in the main, concerns the alleged transfer of a family publishing business, the Monday Morning Quarterback (MMQB business), in late 2011 or early 2012 from one corporation (Zig Zag) wholly owned and controlled by the Debtor, Michael Wolf, to another corporation (ZZC) initially wholly owned and controlled by the Debtor. Allegedly, 51% of the stock in ZZC was, at the time that ZZC still owned the MMQB business, transferred from Michael to Scott Wolf, Michael's son, as well. The MMQB business was then transferred to another corporation (MMQB. Inc.) wholly owned and controlled by Scott Wolf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Then, as alleged,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   MMQB, Inc. funneled income from the business to various other related entities, including Hound Ventures and SHBM, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as to Scott Wolf and Michael Wolf. This type of income-transferring happened when the MMQB publishing business was earlier held by the ZZC entity, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Allegedly, the Debtor's marital problems precipitated these transfers. He wanted the value of the business kept out of the hands of his then-existing and potential future creditors, most prominently his then-wife Elizabeth Wolf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In December of 2013, divorce proceedings commenced. In July of 2014, the Debtor filed for bankruptcy. In early 2016, the trustee filed the present adversary proceeding seeking, in substance, to recover the value of the MMQB business for the benefit of the Debtor's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Some Defendants failed to answer; others failed to comply with discovery orders. These Defendants were then held in default. The trustee's request for default judgment against these Defendants has now followed. This opinion concerns that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

On the facts of this case, the constructive/resulting trust counts are also statutorily core,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   since these trust counts both concern an alleged transfer of property for no consideration (or consideration supplied by the Debtor) in fraud of creditors' rights giving rise to an equitable ownership interest in favor of creditors the\n   <em>\n    enforcement\n   </em>\n   of which would effectively unwind (avoid and recover) the fraudulent transfer; that is, the trust counts' strong substantive resemblance in this case to true statutory UFTA/548 fraudulent conveyance actions makes them statutorily core.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic Credit Corp.

A state law alter ego action would not seem to fit this definition, and nowhere is such an action listed in section 157(b)(2). Nevertheless, perhaps because this type of action normally seeks a declaration that certain property only nominally held by third-parties is really property of the estate, it has been said that such an action is statutorily \"core.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matrix IV, Inc. v.

Hence Counts I-IX, those dealing with alter ego, constructive and resulting trust, and fraudulent transfers, should, according to Scott, be dismissed with prejudice. Similarly, the tortious interference counts (XIII-XIV) should be dismissed with prejudice due to the fact that the marital home (and/or the proceeds of its sale) is no longer estate property, and the claims arise out of the interference with the estate's contract to sell that property. Likewise, the fiduciary duty / corporate waste claim (Count XII) should be dismissed because, according to Scott, the stock in ZZC out of which such claim arises has been awarded entirely to Elizabeth Wolf, rendering the trustee without standing to assert a claim based on the estate's ownership of that stock, which is derivative of Michael Wolf's ownership on the petition date. Scott then also argues that counts XIX-XXIV should be dismissed for essentially the same reason as the other fraudulent transfer counts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   the property that was transferred was not property of the Debtor (either because it was corporate property or because any recovery would now inure to the benefit of Elizabeth Wolf due to the marital division), and in the case of section 549 count (Count XXIV), the property transferred post-petition (if any) was not, as a matter of law, estate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, Scott Wolf has asked this court for a final judgment as a matter of law in his favor on Counts 1-9, 12-14, and 19-24.

No final judgment will be entered\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   Hound Ventures and SHBM at any rate; the business was never transferred to them (per the complaint), and the factual material in the record is not sufficient to allow a judgment to be liquidated against them based upon their receipt under section 550(a)(2) of the proceeds/products/profits of the MMQB business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MMQB, Inc., owing to the trustee's alter ego theory and his fraudulent transfer theories, however, would be held liable by this court as a subsequent transferee of the business.

As seen below, many if not most of the trustee's causes of action are not strictly derivative of the Debtor's pre-petition property rights in any event. If Elizabeth Wolf believes that the marital property division in her favor allows her to assert an ownership interest or other property interest in any recovery gained by the trustee on any cause of action asserted in these proceedings, she is free to make that argument to this court. Otherwise, any proceeds actually recovered from these causes of action will be distributed to the estate's creditors, with any surplus going to the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (3), (7), 726(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The story generally is one of a web of artificial legal entities, all alleged to have been used as part of an elaborate scheme to defraud Michael Wolf's creditors, most prominently his then-wife Elizabeth Wolf, by transferring the family business out of a corporation owned and controlled by Michael Wolf to an entity (or entities) owned and controlled by his sons, most prominently Scott Wolf. According to the allegations in the complaint, the family business was transferred from an entity known as Zig Zag to one by the name of ZZC and then ultimately came to rest in an entity known as MMQB, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (owned and controlled by Scott Wolf), with the proceeds of the business then being funneled to various persons, including the Debtor, through the use of other, separate corporate entities.

Michael Wolf started MMQB in the 1980s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-29. From 1987 to 2011, the business's income was attributed to one of the Defendants, Zig Zag Corp. (Zig Zag), \"an Illinois corporation wholly owned by the Debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 18, 33-34. MMQB had income of over $1,000,000 by 2010-11.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Though the income belonged (at least for tax purposes) to Zig Zag, Michael Wolf used that income to pay his and his family's\n   personal creditors hundreds of thousands of dollars, in addition to paying himself a \"lavish salary,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 35, and in addition to paying his sons a salary for work performed on behalf of the business,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. The expenses paid on behalf of his family included the Debtor's credit card bills as well as those of Elizabeth, Scott, and Peter Wolf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. This income was not reported on the Debtor's or his sons' tax returns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. The business remained very profitable and, up through late 2011, the entire Wolf family \"benefitted handsomely from the income it generated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This changed in 2011 when Michael and Elizabeth Wolf's marriage \"began to fall apart,\" with Michael Wolf moving out of the marital residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Around this time, Michael Wolf began taking action to transfer his interest in the MMQB business to others, the design being to prevent Elizabeth Wolf and other creditors from reaching it and its value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Specifically and importantly, Michael Wolf caused the transfer of the MMQB business from his wholly owned and controlled entity (Zig Zag) to entities owned and/or controlled by Scott Wolf, including two defaulted Defendants in this proceeding, MMQB, Inc. (not to be confused with the underlying MMQB \"business,\" which has allegedly changed hands between corporate entities multiple times) and Hound Ventures, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. The Debtor still enjoys the fruits of MMQB's income, as it continues to fund his living and legal expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Michael Wolf and/or his sons created two entities named ZZC, one an Illinois Corporation and the other a Delaware Corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. In 2012, income from the MMQB business (presumably derived from accounts receivable owed on account of subscription agreements and/or advertising agreements) ceased being attributed to Zig Zag and began to be attributed to, and deposited into the accounts of, ZZC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. The court takes this to mean that there was an effective, if perhaps informal, assignment of Zig Zag's receivables (intangible rights to payment arising from the subscription/advertising agreements) to ZZC in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   No consideration was ever received by Zig Zag for this transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. The Debtor, according to ZZC's 2012 tax return, owned 100% of the stock of ZZC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. The substance of the business did not change; Michael, Elizabeth, Scott, and Peter Wolf all continued to perform in their former roles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. Just as with Zig Zag, Michael Wolf disregarded the corporate formalities and used ZZC's income to pay his and his family's personal creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As discussed above, Michael and Elizabeth's marriage began breaking down in 2011. On December 5, 2013, Elizabeth Wolf filed a petition for divorce in Lake County, Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Shortly thereafter, ZZC's Board of Directors (Michael and Scott) fired Elizabeth from ZZC (she had previously handled advertising for the business).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. Michael Wolf was then also tired by ZZC,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55-56, in an attempt to make it appear as though he had no income to pay to Elizabeth Wolf for temporary support and maintenance,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55-57. Around that time, Michael Wolf also issued a promissory note to ZZC in the amount of $128,781.73.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As noted above, the Debtor claimed to own 100% of ZZC's stock on his 2012 tax return. During the divorce proceedings, and in his bankruptcy schedules (and in testimony to the bankruptcy court), he claimed, however, to own only 49% of ZZC's shares, the other 51% belonging to Scott Wolf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60-61. To the court,\n   one of four plausible things may have happened. Scott Wolf could have owned 51% of the stock from the beginning, and Michael lied on his tax return. Second, Michael could still own 100% of ZZC, and he simply lied to the family court and to the bankruptcy court. Third, Michael could have transferred 51% of the stock to Scott at sometime between 2012 and the date that he filed his bankruptcy petition. Fourth, Michael (and/or Scott) could have caused ZZC to issue new shares to Scott such that Scott would own 51% of the company. Scott Wolf, at any rate, never paid anything for his interest in the company, to the extent that he in fact does have an interest in the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. Moreover, the income of the business, regardless of ownership, continued to go to Michael Wolf either directly or indirectly, such as when ZZC paid for Michael Wolf's apartment in Chicago.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In January of 2014, around the time of the divorce petition, Michael and/or his sons formed and incorporated MMQB, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 67-68. Scott Wolf is listed as the sole director of MMQB, Inc., and Scott Wolf has claimed that he elected himself as all of the officers of MMQB, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69-70. Scott Wolf owns all of the shares of MMQB, Inc., which he purchased for $7.51.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. Around January of 2014, ZZC transferred its receivables to MMQB, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73. No purchase agreement exists for either the assets of ZZC or its stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Wolf's incorporated another entity in February of 2014: \"Hound Ventures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. Scott Wolf claims to be the sole director, officer, and shareholder of the entity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78. Peter Wolf claims to be an employee of Hound and receives a salary many times larger than that which he received at Zig Zag or ZZC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80-81. Nominally at least, Hound Ventures has provided services to MMQB, Inc., for which it has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation from MMQB, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 82-84. The facts alleged, such as that MMQB, Inc. had an \"infinite amount of time\" to pay Hound Ventures, tend to show that this arrangement did not reflect the economic substance of the two entities' commercial relationship with one another (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , MMQB, Inc. was funneling money to Hound Ventures).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-89. In 2014, MMQB, Inc. transferred approximately $300,000 of income attributable to the underlying MMQB business to Hound Ventures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90. Part of that money went to Scott Wolf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. MMQB, Inc. was Hound Ventures' sole source of income.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Going back in time, Michael Wolf and his sons incorporated another entity in September of 2009: \"SHBM.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 94-95. Scott Wolf is allegedly the sole director, officer, shareholder, and employee of SHBM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96. Much in the same fashion as with Hound Ventures, Scott Wolf arranged for MMQB, Inc., to pay SHBM \"whatever was necessary to be charged\" in order to publish the MMQB publication, and through such arrangement caused the transfer of hundreds of thousands of dollars from MMQB, Inc. to SHBM, which was then largely transferred to Scott Wolf's girlfriend, Melissa Skolnick.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98-104. These transfers to Melissa Skolnick were carried out through an intermediary entity known as \"Four Legs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 105-112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   During the divorce proceedings, Michael Wolf was ordered to sell his Aston Martin to pay Elizabeth Wolf's attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115. Scott Wolf created an entity, \"Ma Cherie,\" which then purchased the car and in turn sold it to a car-dealership and then re-purchased it from the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 116-121. Michael Wolf never turned over the proceeds of the sale and was held\n   in contempt by the family court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 123-124. Michael Wolf then filed for bankruptcy rather than face jailing for his contempt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 124-126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As of the filing of the bankruptcy, The Debtor owed and owes the IRS, credit card companies, and Elizabeth Wolf over $ 1,000,000, and the largest creditor is Elizabeth Wolf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127. During the bankruptcy, Michael Wolf hindered the trustee's attempts to sell the marital home by disseminating and publishing defamatory, derogatory, and threatening e-mails and flyers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Michael Wolf's sons and/or the entities described above have provided Michael Wolf with funds to pay for legal expenses, for which Michael has created and signed promissory notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 133-37. Those funds are attributable to the MMQB publication/business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 138-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   With the complaint's general allegations having been laid out, the court now turns to the legal sufficiency of those allegations. Do they, in conjunction with the specifically pleaded material in each count, suffice to support the entry of default judgments against the named Defendants?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Rule 9(b) Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Wolf's make arguments premised on Civil Rule 9(b), which generally requires fraud to be pleaded with particularity.

Ill. Nov. 4, 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Here, the plaintiff is a bankruptcy trustee, asserting claims based on violations of third parties' legal rights (rights either of the Debtor or of his creditors). Also, all of the alleged transfers took place between family members and those family members' closely held corporations (thus indicating that specific knowledge regarding the particulars of the transfers would neither be generally known nor readily discoverable by outsiders). Those defendants' lack of cooperation in discovery has been at the heart of these proceedings. Thus, the court will not strain to apply Rule 9(b) rigorously against the trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   With those qualifications in mind, Rule 9(b) is met in this case. There are essentially three transfers alleged. First, there is the allegation that the MMQB business was transferred from Zig Zag Corporation to ZZC at a time when both corporations were wholly owned by the Debtor. The MMQB business has been described in the complaint in some detail. This transfer was allegedly made sometime in early 2012. Again, it was made by Zig Zag corporation to ZZC. The circumstances, as alleged, were essentially that the Debtor was attempting to transfer assets between corporations so as to shield them from his then-wife, Elizabeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Second, there is the allegation that 51% of the stock in ZZC was transferred by Michael to Scott Wolf no earlier than in 2013, at a time when ZZC still held the MMQB business. The circumstances are the same as for the transfer from Zig Zag Corporation to ZZC (attempting to shield property from the Debtor's then-wife Elizabeth).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Third, the trustee alleges that the MMQB business was transferred from ZZC to MMQB, Inc. roughly in January of 2014. At that time, as alleged, Scott Wolf owned 51% of ZZC and 100% of MMQB, Inc. The circumstances surrounding the transfer were the same: Michael and Scott Wolf were attempting to prevent the business from falling into the hands of Elizabeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, and apart from the main transfers of the business itself, there is the multitude of secondary \"income\" transfers detailed in the complaint. These transfers of income through closely held corporations were, according to the complaint, made in order to allow Michael and Scott Wolf to clandestinely enjoy the fruits of the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The complaint alleges fraud with the requisite particularity. The Wolfs' argument to the contrary is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. The Legal Theories\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Count I: Alter Ego / Reverse-Piercing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The first count is for declaratory relief. It asks for the court to declare that the assets and income of the \"Monday Morning Quarterback\" (the business) are property of the estate, no matter which legal personality actually owns the assets of the business, because maintaining the fiction of separate legal personalities for the \"sham corporations\" described above would sanction a fraud and promote injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Based on a review of the balance of the complaint, the court takes this count to be asking for relief in the form of treating the entity-Defendants as the alter egos of Michael Wolf, and thus disregarding their separate existence apart from him, for the purposes of asserting the substantive legal theories to follow in the complaint (including turnover, constructive/resulting trust, and fraudulent transfer theories); it does not take this count to be asking to hold those entity-Defendants vicariously liable for Michael Wolf's (or the estate's) debts, such as, for example, Michael Wolf's (or the estate's) credit card debt, tax debt, or any debt owed to Elizabeth Wolf. The court finds that the allegations establish that Zig Zag may properly be treated as Michael Wolf's alter ego under Illinois law for the purposes of asserting the substantive legal theories found in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   State law, pertinently both Illinois and Delaware law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   governs the trustee's alter ego theory.

Also, the fact that Michael Wolf, as alleged, continues to run the MMQB business and continues to receive income from it, along with the fact that he built and ran the business for nearly three decades, points to Zig Zag having been used as a mere fa\u00e7ade for the operation of its\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   stockholder, Michael Wolf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20N.E.3d%20696\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Thus, because Michael Wolf was Zig Zag's sole stockholder, because funds were commingled and used for personal expenses, because Zig Zag's business assets were diverted to related entities for no consideration, and because Michael Wolf is the dominant personality behind the MMQB business originally held by Zig Zag, there is such unity and interest of ownership that Zig Zag and Michael Wolf should be treated as the same legal personality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The allegations, taken as true, also show that Zig Zag's assets (the MMQB business) were drained from Zig Zag for no consideration and as part of an actually fraudulent scheme to hinder Michael Wolf's creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago-Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=199%20N.E.2d%20295\">\n    199 N.E.2d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Essentially, instead of intending an outright gift of the business, Michael Wolf intended that it be held in trust for him, and the fact that he caused its gratuitous conveyance (by causing himself or his alter ego to be paid with his own money) is evidence of this (because if he had really wanted to relinquish ownership and control of the MMQB business, he would only have done so for a valuable consideration,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   for free).

Transfer of ZZC Stock from Michael to Scott Wolf\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Here, the transfer alleged is of Michael Wolf's stock in ZZC. The trustee's theory is that Michael Wolf owned 100% of the stock in ZZC at one point in time and then caused a direct or indirect transfer of 51% that stock to Scott Wolf. This theory is supported by the well-pleaded facts in the complaint, including that Michael Wolf recorded on his tax return that he owned 100% of ZZC in 2012 and then later told two courts, including this court, that he only owned 49% of that same company. Based on the Debtor's tax return showing full ownership in 2012, the trustee alleges that 51% of the stock was transferred to Scott Wolf no earlier than in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Stock is undoubtedly considered the property of the stockholder; thus, the transfer of it is a transfer of an \"interest of the debtor in property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reddy v.

Here, the transferee was Scott Wolf, Michael Wolf's son. Michael Wolf received no consideration for the stock. The transfer had and has been concealed - as evidenced by the factual conflict between the Debtor's tax return and the Debtor's and Scott Wolf's later contradictory assertions, as alleged in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The rest of the badges generally are not supported by any well-pleaded facts. First, there is nothing indicating that the Debtor, at the time, retained possession or control of the 51% of stock transferred. That he\n   continued to receive business income is not necessarily relevant; he may have been receiving it on account of his position as employee or officer rather than on account of his equity holdings, or on account of gifts from his family members. Further, the transfer was not of\n   <em>\n    substantially all\n   </em>\n   of the debtor's assets, since he retained at least 49% of his equity in the ZZC entity, which at that time, according to the allegations, still owned the MMQB business. There is nothing to indicate that Michael Wolf \"absconded\" in 2013 on or around when the transfer happened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trustee's Amended Complaint, Docket No. 95, at \u00b6 17 (noting that,\n   <em>\n    more recently\n   </em>\n   , the Debtor had moved to Washington state) (filed in 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   As to being threatened with suit by creditors, Elizabeth Wolf filed a divorce petition in December of 2013, and it might fairly be inferred that Michael was under at least some threat of that suit throughout 2013 (due him allegedly moving out of the marital residence well before 2013, namely in 201 1) or after December 2013 when the suit was actually commenced. Elizabeth Wolf, however, was not a\n   <em>\n    creditor\n   </em>\n   of Michael's, at least not until she obtained an order for temporary maintenance and support in the divorce court, if she obtained such an order. That is, one spouse is not the creditor of another merely based on their status as spouses, and there is nothing showing that they had a debtor-creditor relationship (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Elizabeth Wolf had a claim against Michael Wolf) based on some other body of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Even if spouses could be considered contingent creditors of one another once a divorce petition is filed (due to the possibility of either (1) an alimony award or (2) a property division order that establishes a debtor-creditor relationship between the ex-spouses rather than simply making a proprietary determination as to their respective interests in marital property), that petition was not filed until December of 2013. The transfer of stock allegedly happened\n   <em>\n    no earlier\n   </em>\n   than 2013. It is possible, based on the trustee's theory, that the stock was transferred after the divorce petition had been filed and therefore after Elizabeth Wolf could plausibly be said to be a creditor of Michael. It is also possible that it was transferred earlier, sometime between January and November of 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   This badge, therefore, rather than not being present, counts somewhat in favor of the trustee. The same is true of the \"insolvency\" badge. The Debtor filed for bankruptcy in July of 2014. If the transfer happened in January of 2013, that bankruptcy filing (and his schedules showing balance-sheet insolvency as of that date) is not good evidence of his insolvency at the time of the transfer (over a year separates the two temporal events). Conversely, if the transfer happened in June of 2014, the bankruptcy filing is rather good evidence of his insolvency at the time of the transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6109283\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/50/510/#p517\">\n    50 B.R. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (Bankr.

Thus, Michael Wolf, as alleged, received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the stock, because if the MMQB business was still being operated through the ZZC entity (as it was), then the value of Michael Wolf's stock would not have been $0 (due to the fact that the MMQB business, as alleged, is and was profitable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The complaint also sufficiently alleges insolvency ( section 548(a)(1)(B)(ii)(I) ), even though it does so in general terms only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CF/SPC NGU v.

Count XII: Corporate Waste\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   This count alleges that Scott Wolf, as an officer and director of ZZC, owed Michael Wolf a duty based on Michael Wolf's status as a shareholder of ZZC and breached that duty by causing the transfer of ZZC's assets - the MMQB business - to MMQB, Inc. for no consideration as part of Michael and Scott Wolf's overall fraudulent scheme to defraud Michael Wolf's creditors. The court will treat this as a corporate waste claim. This transfer allegedly happened in early 2014 and came after 51% of the stock in ZZC had been transferred from Michael to Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   First, recall that ZZC was incorporated both in Delaware and Illinois, and the complaint does not specify which ZZC is being discussed. The trustee succeeds on this theory under Illinois law, however, so Delaware law will not be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The trustee's rights on this cause of action are necessarily derivative of the\n   Debtor's, because the trustee has not argued (and this court's research has not found) that the officers/directors of a corporation owe any duty whatsoever (fiduciary or otherwise) to the creditors\n   <em>\n    of a shareholder\n   </em>\n   of that corporation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caulfield v.

Hence, even if the trustee could step into creditors' shoes under section 544 and assert this cause of action, it would fail on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   The trustee's action for corporate waste provides a direct basis for recovery. Transferring the assets of a corporation to another corporation for no consideration, as is plausibly alleged here, can easily be considered corporate waste.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3A FLETCHER CYCLOPEDIA OF THE LAW OF CORPORATIONS \u00a7 1102 (\"Corporate waste has been defined as an exchange of corporate assets for consideration so disproportionately small as to he beyond the range at which any reasonable person might be willing to trade.\"). Under Illinois law, since ZZC is a non-public corporation, Michael Wolf, and hence the trustee, may recover directly from Scott Wolf for any damages caused by the waste:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   Section 12.56 [of the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983] gives a shareholder in a non-public corporation access to remedies when the corporation assets are being misapplied or wasted.

But this is an action for damages, and the court has no duty to raise affirmative defenses\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , though it may raise them if they appear plainly and serve to make the action facially frivolous (such as, perhaps, a clearly applicable statute of limitations).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

But on this cause of action, the application of the defense is far from clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   For instance, while the overall, general scheme was allegedly to defraud Michael Wolf's creditors, the transfer of\n   <em>\n    corporate property\n   </em>\n   from ZZC to Zig Zag (the basis for this cause of action) was not itself a fraudulent transfer of the\n   <em>\n    Debtor's\n   </em>\n   property, because ZZC was not the Debtor's mere alter ego at the time of the transfer. Hence the defense of\n   <em>\n    in pari delicto\n   </em>\n   , which bars a plaintiff from recovering damages resulting from\n   <em>\n    wrongdoing\n   </em>\n   where the plaintiff participated in\n   <em>\n    wrongdoing\n   </em>\n   , has no\n   <em>\n    clear\n   </em>\n   application to the facts of this transaction, since the transfer of ZZC property was not itself wrongful as to Michael Wolf's creditors, who have no conceivable\n   interest in the property of a corporation not Michael Wolf's alter ego.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Hence, there is no affirmative defense of clear application making the trustee's Debtor-derivative corporate waste theory frivolous on its face. It would therefore be improper for this court to consider any defenses\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . Even if the court could consider them, they would not readily apply to the facts of the particular transaction out of which the cause of action derives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   Thus, because Michael Wolf could recover directly under Illinois law for corporate waste against Scott Wolf on the allegations here if taken as true, so can the trustee based on section 541(a)(1). A default judgment may be entered on this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   <strong>\n    m. Count XIII: Tortious Interference with Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   This count asserts a state law cause of action against the Debtor that allegedly accrued to the trustee due to the Debtor's having tortiously interfered with a contract entered into by the trustee on behalf of the estate to sell estate property (the marital home). The merits will not be discussed, because the damages sought are not for a sum certain or otherwise capable of ready ascertainment, and the trustee has offered no proof as to the proper amount of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Catt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9247192,9245822\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/789/\">\n    368 F.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793 (7th Cir. 2004).

Counts XV-XVIH: Denial of Debtor's Discharge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   These counts ask the court to deny the Debtor's discharge under various parts of section 727(a). The court finds that the Debtor's discharge should not be granted based on the operation of section 727(a)(5). Pertinently,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n   [t]he court shall giant the debtor a discharge, unless- (5) the debtor has failed to explain satisfactorily, before determination of denial of discharge under this paragraph, any loss of assets or deficiency of assets to meet the debtor's liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Here, the facts alleged in the complaint plausibly show, if taken as true, that the Debtor caused a deficiency in his assets to meet his liabilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the alleged facts, if taken as true, show that the deficiency\n   was caused by a fraudulent design, it is difficult to conceptualize how such a deficiency could ever be \"explain[ed] satisfactorily.\" In any event, the court concludes that it has not been. For that reason, the trustee is entitled to a default judgment stating that the Debtor shall not receive a discharge in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Additionally, the remaining counts operate to bar the Debtor's discharge. Under section 727(a)(2), the trustee has adequately pled that the Debtor, with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors, transferred his Aston Martin within one year of the petition (and was allegedly sentenced to jail by the family court for having done so). Under section 727(a)(3), the trustee has adequately pled that the Debtor failed to keep adequate records relating to business transactions. Similarly, the trustee has adequately pled, based on the contradictory information in the Debtor's tax return, that the Debtor knowingly lied under oath in this proceeding regarding his ownership of ZZC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   Hence a final judgment will be entered denying the Debtor his discharge in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   <strong>\n    p.

Thus, as it enjoys a separate legal existence, the transfer of its property (the MMQB business) to MMQB, Inc. is not remediable under either the Illinois UFTA and section 544(b) or section 548, because the application of either statute requires the transfer to have been of the Debtor's property. For that reason, no default judgment may be entered based on these counts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   <strong>\n    q. Count XXIV: Section 549 Post-Petition Transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   This count asks for damages based on alleged transfers of property of the estate (the MMQB business and/or its proceeds) post-petition. No default judgment will be entered on this count because the MMQB business could not possibly have become property of the estate prior to its transfer having been avoided as fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re ABC-Naco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8919471\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/331/773/#p780\">\n    331 B.R. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780-81 (Bankr.

The trustee's valuation report values the business as of late 2011. Nonetheless, due to the many issues with discovery in this case, and due to the fact that Scott Wolf, by having been held in default, has forfeited his right to contest the valuation (and introduce evidence as to a depreciation in the value of the business by the time of the transfer in early 2014),\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court deems the trustee's report sufficient evidence of the value of the MMQB business (and hence of Michael Wolf's stock in ZZC) as of the time of the transfer from ZZC to MMQB, Inc. in early 2014.

The avoidance of the transfer of ZZC\n   <em>\n    stock\n   </em>\n   from Michael Wolf to Scott Wolf gives the trustee a second legal basis to recover $1,071,000 from Scott Wolf, this time under section 550(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Scott Wolf's pre-bankruptcy state law liability to Michael Wolf (and hence to the trustee - see section 541(a)(1) ) for corporate waste gives the trustee a third legal basis to recover $1,029,000 from Scott Wolf. But it is obvious that, in substance, no matter the legal theory, the underlying injury precipitating each recovery is the loss, in each legal scenario, of the value of the MMQB business (whether that value is represented directly or derivatively by way of stock value). Hence the trustee may not recover more than $2,100,000 from Scott Wolf, though Scott Wolf's liability to the trustee for that amount ultimately rests on three separate legal grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   A money judgment will be entered against ZZC, Inc. for $2,100,000 based on its status as an initial transferee of the MMQB business under section 550(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   As regards MMQB, Inc., this opinion shall serve as this court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, with the court's recommendation and ultimate proposed conclusion of law being that judgment be entered against MMQB, Inc. in the amount of $2,100,000 based on its status as a subsequent transferee of the fraudulently transferred MMQB business under section 550(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   A separate money judgment will be entered against ZZC, Inc. for $234,395.68 based on its status as the initial transferee of preference payments in that amount.

Due to that uncertainty in state law, the court finds it appropriate to err on the side of caution and treat\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    Zig Zag Corporation as Michael Wolf's alter ego under Count I of the complaint due to the fact that there is no doubt in the allegations that Michael Wolf owned 100% of the stock in Zig Zag Corporation at all relevant times and, as is especially important, at the time of the allegedly fraudulent transfer of the corporation's assets to ZZC. The same cannot be said of ZZC, especially at the time of the alleged transfer of ZZC's assets to MMQB, Inc. As for MMQB, Inc., that corporation was\n    <em>\n     never\n    </em>\n    owned by Michael Wolf, and this court can discover no Delaware cases (MMQB, Inc. is a Delaware corporation) indicating that a corporation may be treated as the alter ego of someone who owns no shares in that corporation in the manner in which the trustee seeks to use the doctrine (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , to collapse the separate legal personalities such that the property of one is simply the property of another).

But one clearly cannot transfer property to oneself. It is a conceptual absurdity. Similarly, the court in\n    <em>\n     Coggin\n    </em>\n    considered the possibility that debtors might benefit in a real and substantial way from their fraudulent transfers by retaining control of the assets transferred but keeping those assets out of the reach of the bankruptcy process, as allegedly happened in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coggin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117954,10535988\" index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1443/\">\n     30 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1453 (citing this as one of two ways in which a debtor might benefit from its own fraudulent transfer). Nonetheless, the court concluded that \"there is no cause of action created by section 550(a)(1) in a trustee to recover the value of an avoidable conveyance from a transferring debtor.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6117954,10535988\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1443/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1454 This reasoning seems to place debtor-transferors beyond the reach of section 550(a)(1) even where they intend to receive and in fact achieve real economic benefit from the transfer.

This court opts for the latter date of measure in this case, which is closer in time to the trustee's forensic valuation report. In any event, as seen in the main text, if MMQB, Inc. is indeed liable as a subsequent transferee only for the value of the business at the time that it was transferred to MMQB, Inc., the court finds that, under the circumstances of this case, the trustee's valuation report suffices to reliably establish the value of the business at the time of that years-later transfer in early 2014.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"45\">\n   <p id=\"p-429\">\n    MMQB, Inc. is a Delaware corporation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"46\">\n   <p id=\"p-430\">\n    There is no allegation that, and this court does not conclude that, either Scott Wolf or MMQB, Inc. was the intended beneficiary of, or actually received any benefit from, the\n    <em>\n     initial transfer\n    </em>\n    of the MMQB business front Zig Zag to ZZC (indeed MMQB, Inc. was not even in existence, per the allegations, at the time of that initial transfer).

To the extent that the trustee would rely on the exhibits showing bank transfers attached to his initially-separate complaints against Hound Ventures, SHBM, and MMQB, Inc., the court finds that those are an insufficient basis upon which to liquidate a judgment against any defaulted Defendant for receiving proceeds or profits from the fraudulently transferred MMQB business under section 550(a)(2). Just as one example, on several pages the transferee is listed as \"Customer Wolf.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Trustee's Complaint, Docket No. 1, 16ap00483, Ex. A, at 12-17.

Hence this court's conclusion that Scott Wolf consented (by filing a summary judgment motion) to this court's authority to enter final judgment on Count 1 applies to this court's determination that MMQB, Inc. is merely Scott Wolf's alter ego under Delaware law such that Scott Wolf is as much a subsequent transferee as MMQB, Inc. is.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"49\">\n   <p id=\"p-433\">\n    This is separate from his liability as a subsequent transferee of the MMQB business (because of MMQB, Inc.'s alter ego status vis-\u00e0-vis Scott). The trustee's success on this theory (the stock transfer theory to Scott Wolf) does not depend on the success of his alter ego/reverse-piercing claim regarding Michael Wolf and Zig Zag.

For instance, can the trustee \"avoid\" the first transfer of the MMQB business to ZZC and then also separately avoid and recover based on the transfer of stock in ZZC from Michael to Scott Wolf using values the stock would have had had the business actually been transferred from Zig Zag to ZZC (despite\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    transfer having been avoided under the trustee's first basis for relief)? The court does not answer this question because it need not. The first basis for relief, if it is legally mutually exclusive of the second and third bases for relief, alone provides the trustee with the basis for a $2,100,000 recovery from Scott Wolf. The second two theories, which are not legally mutually exclusive of\n    <em>\n     one another\n    </em>\n    , provide that same basis as well ($1,071,000 + $1,029,000 = $2,100,000). Hence the potential inconsistency of the trustee's theories does not, in the final analysis, affect his ability to have a money judgment entered against Scott Wolf in the amount of $2,100,000.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
