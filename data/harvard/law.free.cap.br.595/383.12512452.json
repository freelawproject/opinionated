INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, defendant Nelli Markushevska was employed as a bookkeeper at plaintiff Allure Labs, Inc. (\"Allure\"). While she was employed there, she embezzled $137,000 (the \"Embezzlement\"). When Allure discovered this, it sued her and her husband Marlon J. Aviles (collectively, with Nelli Markushevska, \"Defendants\") in state court and obtained an order freezing some $67,000 held in bank accounts in their names. While the state court case was still essentially in its pleading stage, Defendants filed this chapter 13 case. They have filed a chapter 13 plan through which they propose to repay Allure. Allure has objected to the confirmation of this plan on the ground that it is proposed in bad faith because it does not adequately repay the amount Allure believes it is owed. Confirmation of the plan has been postponed due to Allure's objection and this Adversary Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2016, Allure filed its complaint seeking a determination that the debt of roughly $137,059 arising from the Embezzlement, trebled under the provisions of California Penal Code \u00a7 496(c), plus attorney's fees and costs, is not dischargeable. While the complaint ostensibly states claims based on Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6), its allegations are a blend of statements that reflect an imprecise understanding of these different Bankruptcy Code sections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to trial, Ms. Markushevska stipulated that the $137,059 she embezzled from Allure is a nondischargeable debt under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(4). Therefore, the issues to be decided are whether the debt owed to Allure is nondischargeable as to Ms. Markushevska under \u00a7 523(a)(2) or (a)(6) ; whether it is nondischargeable as to Mr. Aviles; and whether the debt includes treble damages, attorneys fees, and costs based on California Penal Code \u00a7 496(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court held a one-day trial on August 15, 2018. The court made several pretrial rulings on the record which are incorporated herein by this reference. The parties also entered a stipulation regarding certain facts and the admissibility of certain exhibits. As appropriate, the court also takes judicial notice of the docket in this adversary proceeding and in the underlying chapter 13 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court has heard and considered the testimony of Allure's witness and the testimony of both Defendants. It has considered the documents admitted into evidence and the post-trial briefs it requested on the California Penal Code \u00a7 496 issues. These are the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) made applicable in this adversary proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the court finds that Allure's debt is dischargeable\n   as to Mr. Aviles and nondischargeable as conversion under \u00a7 523(a)(6) as to Ms. Markushevska. Allure's nondischargeable debt includes prejudgment interest at the California rate of 10% and the $11,000 it expended to reconstruct its books and records when it discovered the Embezzlement. The court also finds that California Penal Code \u00a7 496(c) does not apply and Allure is therefore not entitled to treble damages, attorney's fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This court has jurisdiction based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pre-Petition Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After it discovered the Embezzlement, Allure sued Defendants in state court and obtained a temporary restraining order freezing the funds in Defendants' Technology Credit Union accounts. A preliminary injunction hearing was set for October 2015 and Defendants claim they notified Allure they had no opposition to issuance of the injunction. Approximately $67,000 remains frozen in these accounts. Defendants' state court counsel made multiple settlement offers to Allure in September and October 2015, all of which were rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Post-Petition Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants filed their chapter 13 case on November 14, 2015. Their schedules listed their principal residence valued at $462,000, and personal property valued at approximately $134,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also listed secured claims of $274,000, and unsecured claims of $152,000. Their combined monthly income was $8,505\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and their monthly household expenses were $5,621. Defendants filed their first amended chapter 13 plan on December 11, 2015. The plan provides for monthly payments of $2,876 for 60 months. The plan proposes direct monthly payments of the contract amounts totaling approximately $2,245 on the non-delinquent secured claims of Technology Credit Union for the deed of trust on their house and a 2012 Toyota Camry. The plan also states that Defendants will pay 100% of the unsecured claims that total approximately $152,364. The bulk of this is the principal amount of the debt owed to Allure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Allure filed a timely objection to confirmation of the plan. Allure claimed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the chapter 13 case had been filed in bad faith to thwart its efforts to collect and to discharge its nondischargeable debt. A confirmation hearing was set for February 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Allure also filed a proof of claim stating it was owed at least $524,552 based on the allegations in its state court complaint. Claim No. 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aside from Allure's claim, the claims register shows two unsecured claims totaling approximately $6,600 and the two secured claims of Technology Credit Union. Accordingly, this case is essentially a two-party dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Allure timely filed its complaint commencing this adversary proceeding. The complaint states a claim for relief under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), alleging that Ms. Markushevska made false representations to Allure in creating and cashing the fraudulent checks and Allure relied on these representations. It also states a claim for relief under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(4), alleging Ms. Markushevska committed fraud and defalcation as a fiduciary and embezzlement with Mr. Aviles acting in concert with her, plus larceny and receiving stolen property. The third claim for relief alleges that Allure's damages arise from Defendants' fraudulent acts causing willful and malicious injury under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(6). Defendants filed an answer generally denying these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Allure filed a motion for relief from stay in order to obtain permission to continue its state court litigation. The motion was granted in March 2016; at that point, confirmation of the plan was taken off calendar, and this adversary proceeding was stayed. (In state court, Allure then filed its first amended complaint adding the cause of action predicated on California Penal Code \u00a7 496(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Six months later, Allure informed this court that no progress had been made in state court. In response, this court vacated the order granting relief from stay and vacated the order staying the adversary proceeding. After a failed attempt at mediation, the case was finally set for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Testimony at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Renu Dhatt, vice president of Allure, testified as to how the Embezzlement was actually accomplished. Between August 2014 and August 2015, Ms. Markushevska created false invoices, entered them into QuickBooks, then wrote checks showing \"M. Aviles\" as the payee of the checks rather than the entity on the false invoices entered into QuickBooks. Using this technique, 63 checks - each in an amount of less than $3,000 - were made payable to \"M. Aviles\" and deposited by Ms. Markushevska into a checking account at Technology Credit Union in the names of both Nelli Markushevska and Marlon Aviles (the \"Joint Account\"). Exhibit 44. Ms. Dhatt testified, and the documentary evidence shows, that the funds were then moved, almost immediately after being deposited into the Joint Account, into an account at Technology Credit Union in Ms. Markushevska's name only (the \"Markushevska Separate Account\"). Exhibit 46. The documentary evidence also showed that Mr. Aviles maintained his own separate checking account into which he deposited his paychecks and from which he periodically transferred funds to the Joint Account (the \"Aviles Separate Account\"). Exhibit 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Dhatt testified that the Embezzlement was discovered when Ms. Markushevska went on vacation and another employee began to inspect Allure's books. From this point, several employees spent a considerable amount of time reconstructing what had actually occurred which she estimated took three weeks for three employees working full time with some additional overtime. She testified that these employees were regularly paid $30-$35 per hour with an increase to $45-$52 for overtime. She did not give a total cost for this\n   effort but her counsel stated it was at least $11,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Technology Credit Union records show that between August 2014 and August 2015, Defendants (1) spent approximately $9,000 on home improvements (some of these funds taken from the Markushevska Separate Account); (2) used approximately $23,000 to pay off the loan on one car, purchase a used BMW and for other car related expenses (some of these funds taken from the Markushevska Separate Account); and (3) withdrew approximately $13,500 in cash from the Joint Account and the Markushevska Separate Account. It is unclear how the balance of the $137,000 was used. The Technology Credit Union records also show that roughly $127,000 of the money taken from Allure was deposited into the Joint Account and roughly $110,000 of this was transferred to the Markushevska Separate Account shortly after each check cleared the Joint Account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Aviles testified that he had no knowledge regarding the Embezzlement while it was taking place and that the signature that appears on the back of each of the checks was not his.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claimed that he did not use the Joint Account other than to electronically transfer money to it for paying a child's school tuition and other minor household expenses. While he testified that he did this on a monthly basis, Exhibits 44 and 48 do not show this to have been the case. For example, he transferred no money from the Aviles Separate Account to the Joint Account in June, July, or September 2014 and none between February and July 2015. He claimed he did not review any monthly statements for the Joint Account - either on paper or online - and did not have a debit card for the Joint Account. His paychecks were not deposited into the Joint Account but went into the Aviles Separate Account which he also used for various household expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Aviles also testified that Ms. Markushevska had told him that Allure had loaned her the money to pay off their existing car loan and purchase the used BMW in June 2015. He explained that he did not find this unusual as his employer had programs to provide such financial assistance to its employees. Once he learned that she had embezzled funds from Allure and that these had been used to purchase the BMW, he had insisted that it remain parked in their garage and it had been driven only once a month to ensure that the battery remained charged to avoid damaging the car's computer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ms. Markushevska was also called as a witness but essentially did not testify. Her counsel attempted to ask a question regarding Exhibit 51, the check written to Acura of Concord on the Markushevska Separate Account which was used to purchase the BMW. Allure's counsel objected on the ground that she had refused to answer discovery requests based on her Fifth Amendment rights. Colloquy between the court and counsel for both parties ensued and she was then excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Burden of Proof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A plaintiff in a nondischargeability case has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

The preponderance of the evidence requires the court to\n   believe the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before it may find in favor of the party with the burden to persuade the court of the fact's existence.\n   <em>\n    Concrete Pipe &amp; Prods. of Cal., Inc. v.

Lansford (In re Lansford\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126832,1723550\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/822/902/\">\n    822 F.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904-05 (9th Cir. 1987) (evidence showed debtor wife participated in creating fraudulent financial statement on which creditor relied, debt was therefore nondischargeable as to both spouses under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) );\n   <em>\n    Tsurukawa v.

Defendants are incorrect that a higher standard of proof is required for liability under Penal Code \u00a7 496(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Embezzlement and Larceny - Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(4) excepts from an individual debtor's discharge debts arising from embezzlement or larceny. For purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4), federal law, as opposed to state law, governs the definition of embezzlement.\n   <em>\n    First Delaware Life Ins. Co. v.

BAP 1997). The elements are (1) property owned by another is rightfully in the possession of debtor; (2) debtor appropriates it for a use other than the use for which the property was entrusted to debtor; and (3) circumstances indicate fraud.\n   <em>\n    Transamerica Commercial Fin.

Its elements are (1) the fraudulent and wrongful taking and carrying away of the property of another; (2) with the intent to convert it to the taker's use; and (3) without the consent of the owner. The difference between larceny and embezzlement is that the larcenous debtor takes possession unlawfully.\n   <em>\n    Lucero v. Montes (In re Montes)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6102379\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/177/325/#p331\">\n    177 B.R. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Ms. Markushevska has stipulated that the Embezzlement constitutes a nondischargeable debt under \u00a7 523(a)(4), the definition of larceny is relevant as to Mr. Aviles. Based on his testimony at trial and the documentary evidence, the court finds Allure did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Aviles committed larceny. He credibly testified that he did not know Ms. Markushevska was stealing and that he did not use the Joint Account in a way that would have shown him the influx of cash, her transfers to the Markushevska Separate\n   Account, or her withdrawals of significant amounts of cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conversion - Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Allure's complaint includes a vague claim based \u00a7 523(a)(6) as to both Defendants. In a total of three paragraphs, Allure alleges Defendants \"orchestrated a fraudulent scheme\" and engaged in \"a pattern of outrageous conduct\" and the damages Allure suffered arose from \"fraudulent acts causing willful and malicious injury.\" Allure did not develop this claim at trial. However, the court believes it warrants a brief discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Section 523(a)(6) excepts from discharge debts for \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\" Conversion, as defined by state law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   a willful and malicious injury but it may be covered by \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   <em>\n    Peklar v.

This language was added by Statutes 1972, chapter 963, section 1, pages 1739-1740. It was the result of Senate Bill No. 1068 (1972 Reg. Sess.).

Allure refers to other decisions from state and federal courts involving other statutes providing for treble damages but\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   is the only case Allure cites in which a\n   <em>\n    judgment\n   </em>\n   awarding treble damages based on Penal Code \u00a7 496(c) was in fact entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff sued defendant for fraud, breach of contract and violation of Penal Code \u00a7 496(a). The evidence at the default prove-up hearing showed that defendant induced plaintiff to loan him money on false pretenses and, when plaintiff asked for her money back, defendant gave her a litany of excuses and never repaid her. The trial court found that the fraud and breach of contract damages were $202,500. On the Penal Code \u00a7 496 cause of action, the trial court reluctantly trebled the damages to $606,500 and awarded prejudgment interest on the breach of contract and fraud causes of action. The appellate court affirmed. Giving effect to the plain meaning of the statute's words, what it saw as the legislative intent, and the statute's purpose, the court rejected defendant's argument that a criminal conviction was a prerequisite to civil liability. The court reasoned that \u00a7 496(a) says \"every person\" who engages in certain described conduct violates that section and the consequence of that violation is imprisonment. In addition, \u00a7 496(c) says that \"any person\" injured by that violation may recover treble damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Referring to the bar on dual criminal convictions added to \u00a7 496(a) in 1992, the court explained that, in the civil liability context, defendant would not be liable for damages under the breach of contract and fraud causes of action\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   treble damages under \u00a7 496(c) and noted that the trial court had written \"no double recovery\" on the judgment. However, the evidence established that the defendant had violated \u00a7 496(a) not only by obtaining money from the plaintiff by false pretenses, but also by withholding it by false pretenses when she asked for it back. Because of this, it was appropriate to award treble damages on the \u00a7 496(a) cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Prior to\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , in\n   <em>\n    Citizens of Humanity, LLC v.

The court found that the theft based on fraud in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   was wholly different from the fraud alleged in this case.

The present case obviously differs in that Ms. Markushevska admittedly committed theft within the definition of Penal Code \u00a7 484 and this theft did not arise in a commercial context. In addition, Penal Code \u00a7 496(a) states that a principal in a theft may be convicted under \u00a7 496(a). However, the court is persuaded that the approach taken by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Grouse River Outfitters\n   </em>\n   and its interpretation of the dual-liability concept is appropriate in the context of this case. As the court explained there -\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [I]n\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , the defendant had engaged in additional conduct beyond the underlying theft. The apparently decisive ground for permitting a \u00a7 496(c) claim in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   was that the defendant had violated \u00a7 496(a) not only by receiving property from Bell by false pretense, but also by withholding that property when she asked for it back. That small additional conduct was enough, in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   view, to avoid \u00a7 496(a)'s dual-liability bar. For purposes of this case, it is enough to notice that there is no similar \"extra conduct\" here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Grouse River Outfitters, Ltd\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205930273\">\n    2016 Wl 5930273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The same is true here as to this sort of \"extra conduct.\" There was no evidence at trial which would support a finding that Defendants - either alone or together - took any extra steps to conceal or withhold the stolen funds once the Embezzlement came to light. The record in Defendants' chapter 13 case also shows that once Allure discovered the Embezzlement and sued Defendants in state court, Defendants' attorney promptly notified Allure that Defendants did not oppose issuance of an injunction and began serious efforts to settle the case by offering to repay Allure and by trying to resolve the case in a way\n   that would have minimized attorney's fees for both sides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Louis J. Willett, Main Case Docket No. 23. This Declaration explains these efforts and the settlement offers made to Allure - all of which were rebuffed. The Defendants' chapter 13 plan also shows a reasonable effort to repay Allure in a way that would, if the plan were confirmed and performed, achieve a compensatory measure of damages. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , Defendants here made serious efforts to compensate Allure once Allure filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. de la Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/\">\n    523 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"168136\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/118/1212/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503450\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/213/\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), the Supreme Court held that the nondischargeable debt in a \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) case included the treble damages provided by the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act that the trial court found applicable to the debtor's conduct. The Supreme Court rejected the debtor's argument that Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) only allowed a restitutionary measure of damages rather than a compensatory one. Because the court finds that the record here does not support application of Penal Code \u00a7 496(c), awarding treble damages is not appropriate and, unlike\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , the amount of Allure's nondischargeable debt does not include them. Allure is entitled to compensatory damages only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In its post-trial brief, Allure cites a number of cases from outside the Ninth Circuit for the proposition that other state's statutes providing for treble damages have been used in establishing damages in nondischargeability cases and this court should follow suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Krupka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142277\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/317/432/\">\n    317 B.R. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

To the contrary, the evidence showed only that each Defendant was employed and was paid a salary that was directly deposited into their respective separate accounts. Accordingly, the question here is whether Mr. Aviles knew of the Embezzlement, actively participated in it, aided her commission of it, or was reckless in failing to understand the Embezzlement was taking place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   At trial, Mr. Aviles established with credible testimony that he did not know that Ms. Markushevska was stealing from Allure and depositing the stolen funds into the Joint Account. He testified that he did not access it to review it on a monthly basis, did not withdraw funds from it on a routine basis, and on only one occasion were funds transferred to the Aviles Separate Account from the Joint Account. While a version of his name - \"M. Aviles\" - appears as the payee on the checks, the difference in the signatures on his own checks and the \"M.Aviles\" signature written on the fraudulent checks supports a finding that he did not write on the fraudulent checks. And Allure failed to prove that he acted in any way other than as he described. Thus, there are no facts from which to draw any contrary inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In addition, to the extent the record includes such information, it appears the Defendants continued to live as they had before Ms. Markushevska began the Embezzlement. Other than the purchase of the used BMW and the modest home improvements, their lifestyle did not change in any dramatic or ostentatious way. In short, the court found credible Mr. Aviles' testimony that he did not know Ms. Markushevska was embezzling from Allure until Allure sued the Defendants in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As Defendants acknowledged at trial, Allure's debt is dischargeable as to Mr. Aviles's except as provided in Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 541 and \u00a7 524(a)(3).

However, to the extent it exists, Allure may not reach Mr. Aviles' separate property to satisfy its nondischargeable claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Amount of Allure's Debt and its Allowed Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(4) and \u00a7 523(a)(6), Allure's nondischargeable debt consists of the $137,059.10 embezzled by Ms. Markushevska, plus the $11,000 Allure expended researching the theft and reconstructing its books and records, plus prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In its post-trial brief, Allure requested prejudgment interest based on California Civil Code \u00a7 3287. That provision is not applicable here. For federal claims for relief such as the \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (a)(6) claims involved here, the determination of prejudgment interest is governed by federal law which leaves it to the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Sunclipse, Inc. v.

Based on the egregiousness of Ms. Markushevska's actions, the court finds that the equities of this case allow it to employ the California rate of 10% provided in California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 685.010 rather than the lower federal rate. Because the Embezzlement took place over roughly a twelve month period, the court will use the date that is thirty days before Allure sued Defendants in state court - August 15, 2015 - as the date of the loss for interest accrual purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7054(b), the court has discretion as to whether to award costs\n   to a prevailing party in an adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Young v.

BAP 1988). Allure is the prevailing party as to the dischargeability of its debt. It is not the prevailing party on the Penal Code \u00a7 496(c) issue. Allure does not need to be completely successful to be deemed the prevailing party.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Even if it is considered to be the prevailing party, the court retains discretion to deny costs. After review of the docket in the main case and in this adversary proceeding, the court exercises its discretion to deny Allure its costs. The court reaches this conclusion because the record shows that Allure unnecessarily prolonged this litigation and unnecessarily delayed confirmation of the Defendants' chapter 13 plan apparently because it assumed it was entitled to treble damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As explained above, Allure's debt is nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (a)(6) as to Ms. Markushevska. Allure's debt is dischargeable as to Mr. Aviles except as provided in Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 524(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Allure shall submit a proposed judgment in accordance with this decision which shows its calculation of prejudgment interest.

Defendants also proposed to sell the BMW purchased with embezzled funds from which they thought they would net $15,000. They estimated that the total available to pay Allure upon confirmation of the plan, sale of the BMW, and release of the frozen funds would be approximately $162,000.
