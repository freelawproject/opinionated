TAYLOR, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The debtors, Freddy and Amber May, filed a\n   <em>\n    Class Action Complaint\n   </em>\n   (\"Complaint\") on May 4, 2018. The defendants, Midland Funding, LLC and Midland Credit Management, Inc. (\"Midland\"), filed\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Strike Class Allegations and Memorandum in Support\n   </em>\n   (\"Motion\") on June 25, 2018, which drew\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and Strike Class Allegations\n   </em>\n   (\"Response\") on July 25, 2018, each supplemented by sur-replies. Reserving all other matters, the court heard the Motion and Response solely as to the request for arbitration on August 30, 2018, and took the matter under advisement. In its\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Opinion and Order\n   </em>\n   (\"Order\"), entered on October 3, 2018, this court denied Midland's request for arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, in its\n   <em>\n    Order Denying Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , entered on November 1, 2018, this court denied the\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Memorandum in Support\n   </em>\n   filed on June 25, 2018, at docket entries 7 and 9, and directed Midland to file an answer within twenty-one days. Midland filed\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Answer and Defenses to Plaintiffs' Class Action Adversary Complaint\n   </em>\n   (\"Answer\") on November 23, 2018. Therein, Midland reasserted that \"[p]laintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   claims are subject to the binding arbitration provision and class-action waiver included in the credit card account agreement that governs the Account, which Midland is entitled to enforce by virtue of its purchase and assignment of the Account from Synchrony.\" (Answer, Nov. 23, 2018, ECF No. 51, at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thus, left unresolved is the class action issue raised in Midland's original Motion and renewed in their Answer. Between the Motion and Answer, this court, on November 7, 2018, issued its\n   <em>\n    Order Setting Motion for Summary Judgment Deadlines\n   </em>\n   indicating that Midland's request to strike the class action allegations contained in the original Complaint would be treated as a request for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056. Pursuant to that order, all parties filed supplements on November 5, 2018. Specifically, Midland supplemented their original Motion and Answer by filing\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Supplemental Letter Brief in Support of Motion to Strike Class Allegations\n   </em>\n   at docket 46; the debtors filed their letter response at docket 45. The debtors expanded their initial letter response by filing\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Response to Motion to Strike Class Allegations\n   </em>\n   on December 3, 2018, at docket 55. Completing the pleadings, Midland filed\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Reply Brief in Support of Motion to Strike Class Allegations\n   </em>\n   on December 12, 2018, at docket 56. The court took this matter under advisement. For the reasons stated herein, Midland's request for summary judgment solely as to the issue of the enforceability of the agreed contractual class action waiver is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Background and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Freddy May opened a Lowe's credit card account financed through Synchrony Bank (\"Synchrony\") on May 5, 2013. According to the debtors, Synchrony received notice of their bankruptcy filing and then \"transferred data about those debts to Midland under a written agreement.\" (Complaint, May 4, 2018, ECF No. 1, at \u00b6 15.) Thereafter, Midland filed a proof of claim for an amount in excess of the scheduled debt. Despite representations that the proof of claim amount did not include interest or other charges, the debtors assert that Midland \"knows that interest and fees are in the claim amount, [but] Midland direct[s] its employees to file Proofs of Claim that assert no interest or fees are in the claim amount.\" (Compl., at \u00b6 25.) The debtors contend that this practice violates three provisions of Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 3001 : (1) section (a) for \"failing to file a Proof of Claim that conform[s] substantially to the Official Form because it failed to accurately disclose that interest, fees, expenses, or charges were included in the claim amount\"; (2) section (c)(1) based on the alleged failure of Midland to adequately provide the written document underlying its claim;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) section (c)(2) for failure \"to file with its Proof of Claim an itemized statement of the interest, fees, expenses or charges that were incurred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl., at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 55-56.) Further, debtors assert that the aggregate of these alleged transgressions violate the\n   Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The debtors seek relief primarily in the context of statutory damages and fees attendant to a class action. (Compl., at 11.) The bankruptcy specific prayer is in the nature of injunctive relief preventing inaccurate proofs of claim being filed in the future, requiring an amended proof of claim with supporting documentation in the instant case, and disallowing the claim if not properly amended. (Compl., at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Contained in the debtors' Complaint is a request for class action certification. In its Order, the court denied Midland's effort to compel arbitration. That left outstanding the severable but somewhat intertwined issue of whether the class action waiver contained in the account agreement is enforceable. The debtors seek certification as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Midland interposes waiver language that they argue is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs \"\n   <strong>\n    AGREE[D] NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US IN COURT OR ARBITRATION\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and that they also \"\n   <strong>\n    MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ON BEHALF OF ANY ACCOUNTHOLDER WHO IS NOT AN ACCOUNTHOLDER ON YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU AGREE THAT ONLY ACCOUNTHOLDERS ON YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Motion to Compel Arb., June 25, 2018, ECF No. 8, at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Contextually, this waiver language is included in the full arbitration section.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This\n   section of the contract is clear. It contains: a contractual waiver of the right to seek or enjoy class action status in arbitration or court; the debtors/account holders have the right to opt out; the arbitration clause\n   <em>\n    in its entirety,\n   </em>\n   including the waiver clause, is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"); only a court \"will decide disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this section or any part thereof\"; and Utah law is applicable \"to the extent state law is relevant under the FAA.\" (Lowe's Agreement, at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Lowe's Credit Card Account Agreement, June 25, 2018, ECF No. 8-1, at 4-5) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The debtors chose not to opt out and do not contest Midland's assertion that Utah law permits clauses of this nature, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a7 70C-4-105. Class actions\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) In accordance with this section, a creditor\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   contract with the debtor of an open-end consumer credit contract for a waiver by the debtor of the right to initiate or participate in a class action related to the open-end consumer credit contract. (2) To contract for the waiver described in Subsection (1), the creditor shall disclose the waiver: (a) to the debtor; (b) in the open-end consumer credit contract; and (c) for an open-end consumer credit contract entered into on or after August 1, 2006, in: (i) bold type; or (ii) all capital letters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   UTAH CODE ANN. \u00a7 70C-4-105 (West 2018) (emphasis added). The debtors now seek to be excused from their contract and from their failure to opt out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Were the inquiry to end here, it might be simple. Utah law permits class action waivers, and the parties contracted accordingly. However, we are in federal court with a class action prayer that drew a request to compel arbitration and enforce a class action waiver directly in the shadow of the FAA. Accordingly, Midland and the debtors principally cited cases dealing with arbitration clauses that included class action waivers. Yet, in this instance, the court has already denied Midland's request for arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Memorandum Opinion and Order, Oct. 3, 2018, ECF No. 33.) The cases cited by the parties, however, retain their efficacy both in the context of a class action waiver conjoined with an arbitration clause and a waiver contractually separated by a severability clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Further complicating-or perhaps simplifying-matters, the class action waiver, even if severed, is contractually still governed by the FAA. Fortunately, the inquiry and analysis along all trails independently and collectively compel the same result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The debtors contend that the class action waiver is unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   While arbitration agreements have been subject to recently-developed federal \"pro-arbitration policy,\" no such policy exists for class waivers. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a state rule was unenforceable when it conflicted with a valid federal procedural rule ( Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , 59[559] U.S. 393,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (2010). Under a similar analysis, federal district courts have refused to enforce contractual bars to class actions, holding that whether a private contractual agreement binds or constrains a federal court's procedures is a question of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martrano v. Quizno's Franchise Co., L.L.C.,\n   </em>\n   Civ.

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals considered the former in\n   <em>\n    Torres v. Simpatico, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075618\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/963/\">\n    781 F.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2015). The appellants in\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   were franchisees who entered into agreements that contained arbitration clauses restricting complainants to arbitration on an \"individual, not a class-wide, basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres v.

The lower court enforced the arbitration provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075618\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/963/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075618\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/963/\">\n    at 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In affirming, the Eighth Circuit noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Because \"arbitration is a matter of contract,\" whether an arbitration provision is valid is a matter of state contract law, and an arbitration provision may be \"invalidated by 'generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability,' but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.\" If a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists under state-law contract principles, any dispute that falls within the scope of that agreement must be submitted to arbitration. We ask only whether the arbitration agreement is valid and whether the dispute falls within the terms of that agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Torres,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075618\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/963/\">\n    781 F.3d at 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). Congruently,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Under [state] law ... \"arbitration agreements are tested through a lens of ordinary state-law principles that govern contracts, and consideration is given to whether the arbitration agreement is improper in light of generally applicable contract defenses ... such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.\" But \"no state-law rule that is 'an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA's objectives' should be applied to invalidate an arbitration agreement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075618\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/963/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The debtors have not raised or interposed law or supporting facts suggesting the applicability of any general contractual defenses to the class action waiver under Utah law, including that the formation or\n   execution of the account agreement was unconscionable. The entirety of the debtors' causes of action relate to an alleged improperly filed proof of claim, not any infirmity or defense related to the account agreement's formation or performance thereunder. Further, no state law or rule exists that attempts to adversely impact or impede the FAA. Here, the Utah statute does the opposite, permissively validating such waiver clauses if agreed to by the parties. The debtors simply declined their affirmative right to opt out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The U.S. Supreme Court recently considered and upheld a contractual class action waiver in light of seemingly contradictory federal legislation. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   led with the issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Should employees and employers be allowed to agree that any disputes between them will be resolved through one-on-one arbitration?

The Supreme Court reversed, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Not only did Congress require courts to respect and enforce agreements to arbitrate; it also specifically directed them to respect and enforce the parties' chosen arbitration procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3 (providing for a stay of litigation pending arbitration \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\"); \u00a7 4 (providing for \"an order directing that ... arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement\"). Indeed, we have often observed that the Arbitration Act requires courts \"rigorously\" to \"enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms, including terms that specify\n   <em>\n    with whom\n   </em>\n   the parties choose to arbitrate their disputes and\n   <em>\n    the rules\n   </em>\n   under which that arbitration will be conducted.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   On first blush, these emphatic directions would seem to resolve any argument under the Arbitration Act. The parties before us contracted for arbitration. They proceeded to specify the rules that would govern their arbitrations, indicating their intention to use individualized rather than class or collective action procedures. And this much the Arbitration Act seems to protect pretty absolutely. You might wonder if the balance Congress struck in 1925 between arbitration and litigation should be revisited in light of more contemporary developments. You might even ask if the Act was good policy when enacted. But all the same you might find it difficult to\n   see how to avoid the statute's application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/#p1619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/#p1619\">\n    at 1621-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Additionally, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   drew little distinction between forums when it comes to the parties agreed procedures.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The NLRA secures to employees rights to organize unions and bargain collectively, but it says nothing about how\n   <em>\n    judges and arbitrators\n   </em>\n   must try legal disputes that leave the workplace and enter the\n   <em>\n    courtroom or arbitral forum\n   </em>\n   .

Or why we should read the NLRA as mandating the availability of class or collective actions when the FLSA expressly authorizes them yet allows parties to contract for bilateral arbitration instead. While the dissent is no doubt right that class actions can enhance enforcement by \"spread[ing] the costs of litigation,\" it's also well known that they can unfairly \"plac[e] pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritorious claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.A. v.

The respective merits of class actions and private arbitration as means of enforcing the law are questions constitutionally entrusted not to the courts to decide but to the policymakers in the political branches where those questions remain hotly contested. Just recently, for example, one federal agency banned individualized arbitration agreements it blamed for underenforcement of certain laws, only to see Congress respond by immediately repealing that rule. This Court is not free to substitute its preferred economic policies for those chosen by the people's representatives.\n   <em>\n    That,\n   </em>\n   we had always understood, was\n   <em>\n    Lochner\n   </em>\n   's sin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1632 (some internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Also,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Consider a few examples.

That decision, however, dealt with a conflict between Rule 23 and a specific New York state rule that restricted class actions in specifically enumerated circumstances. The majority concluded that Rule 23 superseded the New York rule because both dealt with the same issue, the ability to maintain a class action, and that the federal rule was proper under the Rules Enabling Act.\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    559 U.S. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, no such conflicting or intrusive state rule exists. The Utah statute is permissive and merely sanctions a waiver if the parties contractually agree.

The\n   <em>\n    Martrano\n   </em>\n   court concluded that it was entitled to apply Rule 23 on the basis that the procedural rule, appropriate under the Rules Enabling Act, would apply as \"federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *20 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

Further, in considering the express prerequisites contained in each specific federal rule, the court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   These controlling standards make no mention of whether a class action is preferred by the parties. Likewise, as long as actions involve a common question of law or fact, Rule 42(a) contemplates issuance of consolidation orders \"to avoid unnecessary cost or delay\" -a standard that also does not call for consideration of the parties' preferences. Under both Rule 23 and Rule 42, the ultimate governing standard is furtherance of efficient judicial administration, which leaves no room for enforceability of private agreements among litigants to forego the efficiencies potentially afforded by consolidated or class adjudication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   With respect for a well-reasoned opinion, the fact that the prerequisite language in both Rules 23 and 42 specifically \"make[s] no mention of whether a class action is preferred by the parties\" should not be given dispositive effect.\n   <em>\n    Martrano,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201704469\">\n    2009 WL 1704469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *21. The parties' preferences are seldom contemplated in most rules or statutes. Further, this court absolutely concurs that Rule 23 governs procedural matters before this court. That conclusion, however, does not resolve whether a class action can be appropriately waived by the parties. The line of cases culminating in\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   suggests it can, independently or when intertwined with an arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable as involving a state statute that prohibited class action waivers in specified instances whether or not the parties, particularly the defendant, had agreed or contracted otherwise.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    559 U.S. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The New York statute under consideration in\n   <em>\n    Shady Grove\n   </em>\n   told federal courts they could not use Rule 23, a procedural rule, in their court while applying New York substantive law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447674,3582260\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1431/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, no such obstacle or intrusion exists.
