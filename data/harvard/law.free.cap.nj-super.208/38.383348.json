Accordingly, we treat the judgment herein, which dismissed plaintiffs complaint only with respect to the Township of Pennsauken, as a final judgment and consider the merits of the appeal. <em>But see Frantzen v. Howard, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226 (App.Div.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b70-11\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Plaintiff appeals from an order dismissing its complaint against the Township of Pennsauken, which order also dismissed the third party complaint of the Township against the Insurance Company of North America. We affirm, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Talbott in her opinion in the trial court. 204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79 (Law Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Whether the observation of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>239, 245, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2979, 2983, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>605 (1983) that \u201c[i]f, of course, the governmental entity can obtain the medical care needed for a detainee only by paying for it, then it must pay,\u201d is considered to be dictum (as Judge Talbott believed and as we think it is) or not, the fact is that that situation was not here present. Accordingly, we need not here decide the particular issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The same result is reached respecting the argument that payment to plaintiff is mandated by state constitutional law, briefed for the first time here. The trial judge was not asked to determine that issue since the point was not briefed there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need not and will not consider it here. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Ind. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The several policy arguments addressed to this court by plaintiff are not without some persuasion.
