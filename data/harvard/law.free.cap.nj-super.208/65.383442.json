Those licenses were suspended or revoked upon plaintiff\u2019s criminal indictment and conviction in 1972. In 1975, plaintiff\u2019s real estate license was restored upon his application made pursuant to the Rehabilitated Convicted Offenders Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:168A-1 <em>et seq. </em>On February 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>19S4 plaintiff was granted the expungement order. He forwarded copies of the order to defendants and asked that they \u201ccorrect\u201d their records to show the absence of any criminal conviction. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed the present action, in which he alleged that \u201cthe defendants have refused and continued to refuse to obey [the expungement order], and have made public the records pertaining to the plaintiff and certain records concerning the plaintiff.\u201d His complaint was dismissed upon the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that, because they are not law enforcement agencies, defendants are beyond the reach of the expungement order. We find that conclusion to be correct and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-1a defines expungement to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">the extraction and isolation of all records on file within any court, detention or correctional facility, law enforcement or criminal justice agency concerning a person\u2019s detection, apprehension, arrest, detention, trial or disposition of an offense within the criminal justice system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Consistent with that definition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-10 requires copies of a petition for expungement to be served</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJA\">upon the Superintendent of State Police; the Attorney General; the county prosecutor of the county wherein the court is located; the chief of police or other executive head of the police department of the municipality wherein the offense was committed; the chief law enforcement officer of any other law enforcement agency of this State which participated in the arrest of the individual; the superintendent or warden of any institution in which the petitioner was confined; and, if a disposition was made by a municipal court, upon the magistrate of that court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">If the petition is granted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-15 directs that the records specified in the expungement order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">shall be removed from the files of the agencies which have been noticed of the pendency of petitioner\u2019s motion and which are, by the provisions of this chapter, entitled to notice, and shall be placed in the control of a person who has been designated by the head of each such agency which, at the time of the hearing, possesses said records. That designated person shall, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, insure that such records or the information contained therein are not released for any reason and are not utilized or referred to for any purpose, in response to requests for information or records of the person who was arrested or convicted, all noticed officers, departments and agencies shall reply, with respect to the arrest, conviction or related proceedings which are the subject of the order, that there is no record information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In keeping with those provisions, the February 27, 1984 order of expungement directs that \u201cthe Clerk of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex County, remove from the court records all information\u201d concerning plaintiff\u2019s arrest and conviction and further that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">any law enforcement agency which possesses records which include information relating to the arrest which is the subject of this Order, remove from its records all such information, including any evidence of related detention, and place such information in the control of a person within the law enforcement agency designated to retain control over expunged records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Although plaintiff argues that \u201call persons and all entities must comply\u201d with the expungement order, both the order and the enabling legislation clearly have a more limited reach. The expungement order here is directed solely to the Clerk of the Superior Court and \u201cany law enforcement agency\u201d which possesses relevant records. That focus of the order is consistent with the statutory definition of expungement, <em>i.e., </em>the extraction and isolation of records on file within \u201cany court, detention or correctional facility, law enforcement or criminal justice agency.\u201d Plaintiff does not contend, nor do we find any reason to conclude, that either of the defendants is a law enforcement or criminal justice agency. <em>Cf. Maietta v. N.J. Racing Com\u2019n., </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8-10 (1983); <em>In re Schmidt, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>344, 354-55 (1979). Plaintiff argues, rather, that there is an inequity in permitting a State licensing agency to maintain and use records of an occurrence which is elsewhere \u201cdeemed not to have occurred\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-27). If that result is inequitable, the remedy must be a legislative one.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In light of our conclusion that defendants were not subject to the expungement order, we need not determine whether plaintiff\u2019s damage claim for defendants\u2019 alleged violation of the order was supported by a sufficient notice of claim pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
