The offenses occurred on May 18 and June 1, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">At the time of sentencing in 1982 the trial judge merged all counts into counts four and seven. On motion by the State pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-29, the court imposed consecutive terms of seven years with three years to be served before parole eligibility. The conviction and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Defendant subsequently moved to correct the sentence, contending that it was illegal, and he appeals from the denial of his motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">Defendant argues that the sentencing judge erred in imposing two \u201cextended\u201d term sentences. He contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-29 is subject to the general sentencing provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5a(3), now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5a(2), which restricts multiple sentencing for more than one offense to not more than one extended term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">. The sentencing provisions of the Code (subtitle 3) are generally applicable to Title 24 offenses. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-5b; <em>State v. Sobel, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 476 (App.Div.1982). However, the classification provisions of the Code by which degrees of crime are created for purposes of sentencing do not apply to Title 24 offenses. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1b; <em>State v. Sobel, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 478-479 <em>See also State v. Delts, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 463, (App.Div.1982) where the court, quoting <em>State v. Sobel, supra, </em>noted that, \u201cThe only sentencing provisions of the Code that are inapplicable to <em>Title </em>24 offenses \u2018are those provisions which are specifically and expressly applicable solely to degree-classified offenses and those provisions which prescribe specific terms of imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d Extended terms relate specifically to degree-classified offenses. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7. Thus, Title 24 offenses are not subject to extended terms, <em>see State v. Selvaggio, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 332 (App.Div.1985), and therefore the bar to imposition of multiple extended terms is likewise inapplicable. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Defendant also contends that imposition of the parole ineligibility terms was illegal. Despite several amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b, that provision has at all times since February 12, 1981 permitted the imposition of a parole ineligibility term for \u201cany crime,\u201d including one embodied \u201cin any statute other than this code.\u201d An offense with a maximum sentence above six months is a crime, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4a, and this, provision of the Code applies to sentencing under Title 24. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-5b. <em>See also State v. Guzman, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 351, n. 3 (Law Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Accordingly, the sentences imposed are legal and the denial of defendant\u2019s motion is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-13\">The State apparently filed no cross appeal from the merger of the possession with intent count into the distribution count. <em>But see State v. Jester, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>87 (1975); <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>69 (1975); <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>54 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Only the legality of the sentence, as opposed to excessiveness, can be challenged on the post-appeal application. <em>See R. </em>3:21-10(a) (as amended effective September 13, 1982); <em>R. 3:22-2; State v. Pierce, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346 (App.Div.1971), certif. den. 59 <em>N.J. </em>362 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
