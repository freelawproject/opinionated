Plaintiff is an insurance agent that issued the endorsement and paid the counsel fees here involved \u2014 and is subrogated to whatever rights the Board may have under the policy. The operative facts are not in dispute and the parties agreed that the matter was ripe for final determination on their cross motions for summary judgment. In our view there was coverage under the policy; hence we reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Luther Burnette was an employee of the Board who was indicted on May 6, 1980 for 10 counts of misconduct in office <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:85-1) and unlawfully obtaining school district funds <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:135-3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was acquitted of four counts at a trial on July 23, 1981 and also found not guilty of the other six counts at a trial on December 16, 1981. Plaintiff seeks to recoup about $28,000 paid on behalf of the Board towards Burnette\u2019s counsel fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s multi-peril, comprehensive general liability insurance policy was amended, effective July 1, 1981, with the following endorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">In consideration of the premium charged, it is agreed that such coverage as is provided by this policy shall be extended to include the liability imposed upon the named insured by sections 18A:16-6 and 18A:16-6.1 of the revised statutes of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The statutes are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">18A:16-6. Indemnity of officers and employees against civil actions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEE\">Whenever any civil action has been or shall be brought against any person holding any office, position or employment under the jurisdiction of any board of education, including any student teacher or person assigned to other professional pre-teaching field experience, for any act or omission arising out of and in the course of the performance of the duties of such office, position, employment or student teaching or other assignment to professional field experience, the board shall defray all costs of defending such action, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses, together with costs of appeal, if any, and shall save harmless and protect such person from any financial loss resulting therefrom; and said board may arrange for and maintain appropriate insurance to cover all such damages, losses and expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">18A:16-6.1 Indemnity of officers and employees in certain criminal actions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">Should any criminal action be instituted against any such person for any such act or omission and should such proceeding be dismissed or result in a final disposition in favor of such person, the board of education shall reimburse him for the cost of defending such proceeding, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses of the original hearing or trial and all appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The question as to coverage arises because the indictment of May 6, 1980 was almost 14 months prior to the July 1, 1981 effective date of the policy endorsement, but the acquittals on July 23, 1981 and December 16, 1981 were within the policy year. The trial court and counsel noted there were no cases on point construing this or similar statutes, but defendant and the judge believed that the analysis in <em>Paterson Tallow Co. v. Royal Globe Ins. Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>24 (1982) and <em>Muller Fuel Oil Co. v. Ins. Co. of No. Amer., </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564 (App.Div.1967) was applicable to the issue presented here. In <em>Paterson Tallow </em>our Supreme Court approved the <em>Muller </em>approach and held that \u201cfor the purpose of determining the existence of coverage under [a comprehensive general liability policy], in the absence of any qualifying exclusion or exception the offense of malicious prosecution occurs on the date when the underlying complaint is filed.\u201d 89 <em>N.J. </em>at 36-37. In <em>Paterson Tallow </em>the factual picture was similar to the situation here, in that an indictment occurred prior to the date of issuance of the policy and the acquittal occurred during the term of coverage. Instead of an <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:16-6.1 reimbursement claim, however, the coverage question related to a civil damages suit for malicious prosecution. There as here, the policy language referred to an \u201coccurrence\u201d as the liability-creating event followed by reference to \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d coverage \u201c... if such offense is committed during the policy period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> The rationale of <em>Paterson Tallow, </em>however, is not applicable to the present case for several reasons. In the first place, as noted in <em>Muller, </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 576 the tort of malicious prosecution is <em>sui generis. </em>Secondly, as also there noted at p. 578: \u201cAs a general rule the time of the \u2018occurrence\u2019 of an accident within the meaning of an indemnity policy is not the time the wrongful act was committed but the time when the complaining party was actually damaged.\u201d See also, Annotation \u201cOccurrence of accident or injury as during, or before or after, time period of coverage of liability policy,\u201d 57 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>1385 (1958); <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>18, 27-28 (1984). Here, the damage to the complaining party, <em>i.e. </em>the Board, was not until the acquittals of Burnette \u2014 because that is when the obligation to reimburse for counsel fees was incurred. Thirdly, as noted in Justice Schreiber\u2019s dissent in <em>Paterson Tallow, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 37-38, the applicable tenets of insurance contract interpretation require coverage where the policy language will support two meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Here, to some extent the \u201coccurrence\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d language may suggest a pre-July 1, 1981 coverage trigger date. However, the endorsement incorporated the statutory language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:16-6.1 which requires a dismissal or \u201cfinal disposition\u201d of a criminal action to trigger the obligation to reimburse for counsel fees \u2014 and that occurred post-July 1, 1981 and during the policy year. Furthermore, the reasonable expectations of the average reader of the policy endorsement point to coverage because of the \u201cfinal disposition\u201d language of the statute incorporated into the policy. <em>Paterson Tallow, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 35, n. 5; Latourette, \u201cThe Role of Public Policy and Reasonable Expectations in Construing Insurance Contracts,\u201d 47 <em>Temple Law Quarterly, </em>748 (1973-1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Finally, the judge and defendant suggested a public policy consideration in that coverage under the facts of this case could lead, hypothetically, to coverage by purchase of a policy just before the return of a jury verdict of acquittal. An insurance company can always decline to issue a policy or endorsement under such circumstances. At oral argument counsel stipulated that the Board did not volunteer information that Burnette was under indictment and defendant did not inquire as to any such contingent liabilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the \u201cfinal disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tion\u201d language of the statute permits myriad possibilities. Burnette could have been found guilty and there would have been no liability for counsel fees. There might have been one or more appeals and possibly a retrial \u2014 which might well have gone beyond the initial year of coverage. The statute itself provides the most workable and readily ascertainable date to fix liability and coverage, to wit: dismissal (of the criminal action) or final disposition (in favor of the Board\u2019s employee) including all appeals. Since the acquittals in this case occurred during the policy year and constituted final dispositions, there was coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\">The policy in question was written by The Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania which was incorrectly designated in the pleadings as the National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The offenses were apparently alleged to have been committed prior to the September 1, 1979 effective date of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-1.b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Another $45,000 was paid by another carrier under a different policy not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We recognize that defendant, in its answer to the complaint, had raised as a separate defense an allegation that plaintiff is estopped because of the Board\u2019s failure to disclose the pendency of the criminal charges against Burnette \u2014 presumably based on a duty of an insured to reveal information which is material to the risk. <em>Pioneer Nat. Title Ins. Co. v. Lucas, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332 (App.Div.1978), aff'd o.b. 78 <em>N.J. </em>320 (1978). However, defendant did not press this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>below or on appeal, nor did it affirmatively seek relief below by way of rescission or reformation. <em>R. </em>4:5-4; <em>Harr v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>287, 303-304 (1969); <em>R. </em>4:7-1. Hence, we do not address the question of what effect such assertions would have on the principles herein set forth and the result reached. <em>Merchants Indem. Corp. v. Eggleston, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>114 (1962); <em>Oradell Village v. Township of Wayne, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>403 (App.Div.1968), aff'd o.b. 53 <em>N.J. </em>496 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
