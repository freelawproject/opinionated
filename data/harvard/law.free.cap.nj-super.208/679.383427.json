In the interest of clarifying the parties\u2019 evident confusion over what has been adjudicated, however, we now grant plaintiff leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. Stigliano v. St. Rose High School, </em>198 <em>N.J. Super. </em>520, 523, n. 1 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Plaintiff brought this action for damages based on claims that her former employer, defendant Township of Dover, and the other five defendants, Township officers and employees, underpaid her and otherwise harassed and discriminated against her at work because of her sex and unmarried status. She rests her claims upon the protection afforded under the state constitution and state statute. <em>N.J.Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">The order appealed from summarily dismissed all claims against the Township contained in the first six of the seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>counts of plaintiff's verified complaint. The basis for the dismissal is plaintiff\u2019s failure to present the timely notice of claim required by the Tort Claims Act as a condition to recovering against a public entity. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8 requires that the notice be presented \u201cnot later than the ninetieth day after accrual of the cause of action.\u201d Another trial judge had previously refused to allow late filing of the notice under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9. The order also dismissed the seventh count. That count alleged that all defendants had committed a specific act of discrimination against plaintiff. The trial judge dismissed the seventh count because though the notice of that claim was timely, the claim did not state a separate cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In the appeal from the dismissal of the claims against the Township, plaintiff\u2019s sole argument is that her claims are not governed by the Tort Claims Act because \u201cher complaint alleges [a] cause of action sounding in contract and is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1,\u201d the general six-year statute of limitations for claims not based on \u201can injury to the person.\u201d See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2. The Tort Claims Act applies to claims against public entities for an \u201cinjury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3 broadly defines \u201cinjury\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">death, injury to a person, damage to or loss of property or any other injury that a person may suffer that would be actionable if inflicted by a private person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Essentially plaintiff claims that the Township inflicted personal and monetary injuries on her through sexual harassment and invidious discrimination. Those claims fall within the expansive Tort Claims Act definition of \u201cinjury\u201d that includes \u201cinjury to a person\u201d and \u201cdamage to or loss of property.\u201d <em>Lloyd v. Stone Harbor, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>496, 511-512 (Ch.Div.1981). Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Leese v. Doe, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318 (Law Div.1981), is misplaced. Aside from whether that case was correctly decided, it merely held that claims against a private employer based on sexual harassment and lost wages are not claims of \u201can injury to the person\u201d and therefore may be brought within six years under the general statute of limitations. Applicability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the 90-day notice provision in the Tort Claims Act was not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The other provision in the order appealed from dismissed plaintiffs seventh count \u201cas against all the defendants\u201d because it \u201chas not set forth a claim upon which relief can be granted____\u201d Elsewhere in her verified complaint plaintiff stated that she had been \u201cconstructively discharged from her position\u201d on November 11, 1983, in that the alleged acts of harassment and discrimination forced her to quit. In the seventh count plaintiff alleged a separate claim based on an alleged act of discrimination against her occurring April 3, 1984, when allegedly all defendants hired a married man to replace her and paid him a higher salary than she was paid when she had quit five months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Defendants contend that hiring plaintiffs male replacement at a higher salary was not a separate act of discrimination against her because she did not apply for the position at that time. Plaintiff correctly points out in her brief that her claim in the seventh count is not based on the failure to hire her, but on the failure to pay her the salary a married man would have been paid for the same work. Plaintiff makes the point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">Plaintiff is not seeking to prove that the Defendants did not want to hire her because she is a single female, rather Plaintiff is seeking to prove that she was not equally paid with her married male successor____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument, however, proves defendants\u2019 ultimate point that the act of hiring her male replacement was not an act of discrimination against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">If there was discrimination regarding the level of her salary, the discrimination occurred, as plaintiff says in her brief, when \u201cshe was not equally paid.\u201d That was during her employment, and any claim based on that discrimination is already comprehended by the claims in the first six counts of the complaint. If, as plaintiff contends, her replacement was paid a higher salary than she solely because of his sex and marital status, that would be admissible evidence that she had been discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>nated against during her employment and would also be evidence of damages. <em>See Patkus v. Sangamon-Cass Consortium, </em>769 <em>F.</em>2d 1251, 1260 (7 Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We note in this connection that plaintiff does not contend that her salary discrimination claim accrued when her replacement was hired. She stated in her verified complaint that she had quit \u201cas a result of the repeated and continual acts of sex discrimination by the Defendants,\u201d which included being assigned more responsibility for \u201cless pay than males holding comparable responsibility and position.\u201d Had plaintiff not reasonably known that she was the alleged victim of salary discrimination until she discovered that defendants paid her male replacement a higher salary than they had paid her, her claim would not have accrued until then and her notice of claim would have been timely. <em>Kenney v. Scientific, Inc., </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 245 (Law Div.1985). <em>See Fuller v. Rutgers, The State University, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 423-424 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 75 <em>N.J. </em>610 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Affirmed and remanded for trial of the remaining claims against the remaining defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
