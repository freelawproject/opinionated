Clawans, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>162 (1962). There the Court held that under certain circumstances the failure of a party to produce a witness whose testimony would serve to elucidate the material facts in issue may support an inference that he fears exposure of such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 170-171. The Court also determined that where the appropriate conditions are satisfied, the trial judge may in his instructions apprise the jury of the adverse inference which permissibly flows from the party\u2019s nonproduction of the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 172. At issue here is whether a defendant in a criminal action is obliged to call a witness to the stand in the presence of the jury for the sole purpose of having him invoke his privilege against self-incrimination in order to avoid the inference which might otherwise flow from his non-production. Citing <em>State v. Jamison, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>363 (1974) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>State v. Jennings, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70 (App.Div.1972), certif. den. 60 <em>N.J. </em>512 (1972), the trial judge held that the defense could avoid a <em>Clawans </em>instruction only by presenting the witness and having him assert the privilege in the presence of the jury. We disagree and are constrained to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We need not recount the facts at length. Defendant, a licensed clinical psychologist, was charged with ten counts of Medicaid fraud in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-17(a) and (b). The gist of the charges was that defendant fraudulently misrepresented the nature and extent of the psychological counseling services she had rendered to five youthful patients in obtaining benefits under the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 <em>et seq.). </em>Under the applicable Medicaid regulations, the \u201cprovider\u201d is required to specify whether the counseling services performed were in conjunction with \u201cindividual\u201d, \u201cgroup\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d psychotherapy. (Psychologist\u2019s Medicaid Manual \u2014 Group and Family Psychotherapy Definitions). Apparently, different rates of reimbursement are applicable depending upon the nature of the therapy rendered. In order to qualify as \u201cindividual\u201d psychotherapy, the psychologist must have had \u201cpersonal involvement with [the] patient to the exclusion\u201d of others. <em>Id. </em>It was alleged that defendant submitted claim forms falsely representing that she had performed 160 hours of individual psychotherapy. While the State conceded that the five patients received some therapy, the essential thrust of the charges was that defendant\u2019s involvement in such treatment was minimal and that she had little or no personal interaction with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">This factual question was hotly contested at trial. The State presented evidence indicating that the five patients, all emotionally disturbed children, received little or no therapy during their sessions at defendant\u2019s office. Several of the children testified that they had \u201cconversations\u201d with defendant\u2019s husband, Dr. Felix Del Vecchio, who was also a licensed clinical psychologist. One of the witnesses testified that Dr. Del Vecchio administered several psychological tests and that these sessions lasted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>approximately one-half hour. However, most of the State\u2019s evidence disclosed that the children \u201cplayed pool and other games\u201d and were treated to \u201cice cream or pizza\u201d while at defendant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Defendant elected to take the stand. She testified that she and her husband formed a professional association, the Leander Psychological Institute, and generally worked as a team. According to her testimony, one of the \u201ctreatment modalities\u201d commonly used in counseling children is \u201cplay therapy.\u201d This method is often employed in treating young or seriously disturbed children who have problems with verbal communications. Defendant testified that she employed the play therapy modality in counseling the five patients because of their tender ages and their resistance to other types of treatment. She further stated that two of the patients needed \u201ca stable male figure\u201d to assist them in confronting their problems. Defendant\u2019s husband, thus, took a more active role in providing therapy in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">After the defense rested, the prosecutor requested that the judge include a reference to defendant\u2019s failure to produce Dr. Del Vecchio in his instructions at the conclusion of the case. Specifically, the State argued that defendant\u2019s failure to present her husband as a witness supported the \u201cnatural inference\u201d that his testimony would be unfavorable to her. In response, defense counsel contended that Dr. Del Vecchio was unavailable as a witness because he was charged in a separate indictment with 112 counts of Medicaid fraud and would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Dr. Del Vecchio was present in court, no attempt was made to determine whether he would assert his privilege. Relying upon <em>State v. Jamison, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 373-374, n. 1 and <em>State v. Jennings, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 75-77, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>refused to accept defense counsel\u2019s representation regarding Dr. Del Vecchio\u2019s intention not to testify. Noting that the privilege was personal to the witness, the judge determined that it could be invoked only in the presence of the jury. While acknowledging that the witness\u2019 invocation of the privilege in the presence of the jury might well have a deleterious effect upon defendant\u2019s case, the judge nevertheless concluded that this course was mandated by <em>State v. Jamison </em>and <em>State v. Jennings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Based upon this ruling, defense counsel decided not to call Dr. Del Vecchio as a witness. The State thereafter, in rebuttal, introduced into evidence Dr. Del Vecchio\u2019s appointment book and presented testimony indicating that it would have been impossible for him to have rendered individualized therapy to defendant\u2019s patients because he was treating others at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">During his summation, the prosecutor repeatedly alluded to defendant\u2019s failure to produce Dr. Del Vecchio. In addition, the trial judge emphasized the point in his instructions and advised the jury that they could derive an \u201cadverse inference\u201d by virtue of defendant\u2019s failure to present her husband as a witness. In its verdict, the jury found defendant guilty of eight of the ten counts charged. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">We are firmly convinced that the trial judge erred when he held that defendant could avoid the absent witness charge only by presenting Dr. Del Vecchio and having him invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in the presence of the jury. In <em>State v. Clawans, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 171-172, our Supreme Court enunciated certain guidelines concerning inferences that may be drawn from the failure to produce a witness. One of the conditions precedent to such a charge is that it must appear that it was within the power of the party to produce the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 171. See <em>State v. Carter, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>86, 127 (1982); <em>Wild v. Roman, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 414 (App.Div.1966); <em>Meist</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>rich v. Casino Arena Attractions, Inc., </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 31 (App.Div.1959), mod. 31 <em>N.J. </em>44 (1959); <em>O\u2019Neil v. Bilotta, </em>18 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 86 (App.Div.1952). Obviously, the \u201cinference is not proper if the witness is for some reason unavailable....\u201d <em>State v. Clawans, supra, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>at 171. <em>See also </em>2 <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>(3 ed. 1940), \u00a7 286 at 166-168.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">While the question is one of first impression in New Jersey, we have no difficulty in holding that where a witness invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege and refuses to testify, he is unavailable to both parties and no adverse inference can fairly be drawn by virtue of his nonproduction. This principle is implicit in <em>Evid.R. </em>39 which prohibits the judge and counsel from commenting on the exercise of a privilege and precludes the trier of fact from drawing an adverse inference. Numerous decisions of other jurisdictions also lend support to this rule. See <em>United States v. Brutzman, </em>731 F.2d 1449, 1453-1454 (9 Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>663 F.2d 107, 108 (D.C.Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Sircovich, </em>555 F.2d 1301, 1302 (5 Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Young, </em>463 F.2d 934, 942 (D.C.Cir.1972); <em>Bowles v. United States, </em>439 F.2d 536, 541-542 (D.C.Cir.1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 401 <em>U.S. </em>995, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1240, 28 L.Ed.2d 533 (1971); <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>435 F.2d 1245, 1247 (5 Cir.1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 402 <em>U.S. </em>912, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1392, 28 L.Ed.2d 654 (1971); <em>Bradley v. United States, </em>420 F.2d 181, 186 (D.C.Cir.1969); <em>People v. Banks, </em>98 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>556, 562, 54 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>148, 152, 424 <em>N.E.2d </em>898, 902 (App.Ct.1981); <em>Christensen v. State, </em>274 <em>Md. </em>133, 140-141, 333 A.2d 45, 49 (Ct. of App.1975), rev\u2019d on other grounds 33 <em>Md.App. </em>635, 365 A.2d 562 (Ct.Spec.App.1976); <em>Commonwealth v. Ries, </em>337 <em>Mass. </em>565, 585-586, 150 <em>N.E.2d </em>527, 541-542 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1958); <em>State v. Dachtler, </em>318 N.W.2d 769, 774 (N.D.Sup.Ct.1982); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>243 <em>Or. </em>532, 537-538, 413 P.2d 383, 385-386 (Sup.Ct.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">A more difficult question is whether a party must call the witness to the stand and have him invoke his privilege against self-incrimination in the presence of the jury in order to avoid a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>Clawans </em>instruction. It is now well settled that when the State wishes to call as a witness an accomplice of the defendant or one known to have had some connection with the crime knowing that the witness is likely to plead his privilege against self-incrimination, \u201cit is ordinarily preferable first to examine [him] on <em>voir dire, </em>as otherwise the circumstances may lead the jury to draw unfavorable inferences\u201d against the accused. <em>State v. Jamison, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 373-374, n. 1. See <em>also State v. Cullen, </em>103 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 364 (App.Div.1968); <em>State v. Fournier, </em>91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 480-481 (App.Div.1966). In the court\u2019s discretion, the State may be precluded from calling such a witness before the jury if he declined to testify on <em>voir dire. State v. Jamison, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 373-374, n. 1. In <em>State v. Jamison </em>our Supreme Court specifically declined to decide whether the same rule should apply where the defense desires to call a witness who is expected to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege noting that \u201c[a] proper ruling in any particular case will generally depend on the precise attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We hold that under the facts present here the trial judge should have conducted a hearing out of the presence of the jury to determine whether the witness would testify. Specifically, the witness should have been called to the stand to personally claim the privilege (if that was his intention) with respect to specific questions propounded. In the event of a valid assertion of the privilege, the witness should have been considered unavailable to the defense and the prosecutor\u2019s request to charge should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>State v. Jamison </em>and <em>State v. Jennings </em>do not derogate against this procedure. Both cases merely hold that it is error for a judge to <em>sua sponte </em>conduct a <em>voir dire </em>hearing and accept counsel\u2019s assertion of his client\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. We recognize that the privilege against self-incrimination is personal to the individual claimant, and the election to invoke it must be exercised by the witness himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>on the stand and under oath, after hearing a question or questions addressed to him. <em>State v. Jamison, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 375 <em>quoting State v. Jennings, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 75. <em>See also State v. Williams, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>493, 502 (1971); <em>In re Boiardo, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>599, 604 (1961); <em>State v. Fary, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>431, 435 (1955). It is not invocable by an attorney \u201cas his surrogate.\u201d <em>State v. Jennings, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This much conceded, it is far different to suggest that under all circumstances assertion of the privilege must take place in the presence of the jury. We would be myopic were we to fail to observe that a claim of Fifth Amendment protection is likely to be regarded by the jury as high courtroom drama and a focus of ineradicable interest. It strains credulity to assume that a jury could perform the mental gymnastics required by a cautionary instruction not to derive an adverse inference against the defendant in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We, thus, conclude that the appropriate procedure is for the trial judge to conduct a hearing out of the jury\u2019s presence to test whether the witness will invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. If the witness claims the privilege as to essentially all questions, the defense should not be required to call him to the stand in the presence of the jury. In that event, neither side has the right to benefit from an inference that might otherwise flow from his nonproduction, and neither counsel in their summation nor the judge in his instructions should allude to the parties\u2019 failure to present him as a witness. While we have been unable to find any New Jersey decision dealing with this precise issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the courts of other jurisdictions have uniformly adopted the rule announced here. <em>See United States v. Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31, 96 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 431 <em>U.S. </em>993, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2641, 53 L.Ed.2d 250 (1977), reh. den. 433 <em>U.S. </em>916, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2992, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1103 (1977); <em>United States v. Lacouture, </em>495 <em>F</em>.2d 1237, 1240 (5 Cir.1974), <em>cert. </em>den. 419 <em>U.S. </em>1053, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>631, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>648 (1974); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>488 <em>F.2d </em>1206, 1211 (1 Cir.1973); <em>Bowles v. United States, supra, </em>439 <em>F.2d </em>at 542; <em>People v. Cvetich, </em>73 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>580, 584, 29 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>418, 422, 391 <em>N.E.</em>2d 1101, 1105 (App.Ct.1979); <em>Aubrey v. State, </em>261 <em>Ind. </em>692, 695-696, 310 <em>N.E.2d </em>556, 559 (Sup.Ct.1974); <em>People v. Thomas, </em>51 N.Y.2d 466, 472, 415 <em>N.E.</em>2d 931, 934, 434 N.Y.S.2d 941, 944 (Ct.App.1980); <em>Commonwealth v. Greene, </em>445 <em>Pa. </em>228, 232, 285 A.2d 865, 867 (Sup.Ct.1971). We are satisfied that this practice best reconciles the competing objectives of insuring a full exposition of the facts and protecting the rights of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We conclude that the trial judge erred in his determination that defendant\u2019s failure to produce Dr. Del Vecchio as a witness warranted a <em>Clawans </em>instruction. What gives us pause is the fact that defense counsel did not specifically request a hearing out of the presence of the jury pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>8. Ordinarily, the failure to interpose an appropriate objection on proper grounds or make a timely request would prevent us from vitiating an otherwise valid conviction. <em>State v. Macon, 57 N.J. </em>325, 329 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Our thorough review of the record here, however, convinces us that defense counsel justifiably relied upon the judge\u2019s repeated admonition that the witness must assert the Fifth Amendment privilege in the presence of the jury to avoid the <em>Clawans </em>charge. Moreover, counsel\u2019s vigorous objection was sufficient to alert the judge to the possibility of conducting a hearing under <em>Evid.R. </em>8 to determine whether the witness would invoke his privilege. Under these circumstances, defendant\u2019s failure to request a hearing was excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We are equally convinced that the error seriously prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We, thus, find it necessary to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Defendant challenges the admissibility of a videotaped deposition of a State\u2019s witness. Since the trial of this matter, we have held that such a deposition may be admitted under certain circumstances. <em>State v. Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187 (App.Div.1985). On the retrial, the judge should be guided by the standards established in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Defendant also claims that the trial judge\u2019s instructions concerning <em>mens rea </em>were confusing. In light of our decision, we need not address that issue. We merely note that on the retrial response to this concern should be tailored according to the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is reversed. The matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Defendant did not argue below, nor does she contend here, that her failure to call her husband as a witness was protected by the spousal privilege set forth in <em>Evid.R. </em>23(2). We, thus, have no occasion to address that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In <em>State v. Karlein, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451 (Law Div.1984), the Law Division held that the defense may be precluded from calling a witness to the stand in the presence of the jury for the sole purpose of having him invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 456. <em>See also State v. Cito, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>220 (Law Div.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
