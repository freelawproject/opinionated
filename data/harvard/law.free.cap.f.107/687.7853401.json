It was assessed for duty as a \u201cmanufactured article, not specially provided for, composed wholly or in part of any metal, and whether partly or wholly manufactured, thirty-five per centum ad valorem,\u201d under the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>gions of paragraph 177 of the act of 1894, and was claimed to be free under paragraph 452 of said act, as a \u201ccomposition metal of which copper is \u00e1 component material of chief value, not specially provided for.\u201d It is contended that this merchandise is partly manufactured, because it has been thus made into sheets. This contention is met by proof that these sheets are not available for any purpose until after they have been beaten to one-sixth their present thickness, and then cut into pieces and put into books to be sold, apparently for use in gilding. The invoice consists of kupfermetall, buchmetall, and clippings. It appears that the kupfermetall is all copper, and therefore it is not included under the provisions for composition metal. As to the buchmetall and clippings, I think the question has been disposed of favorably to the contention of the importer by Judge Wheeler in Benedix v. U. S. (G. C.) 99 Bed. 25$, where an article practically identical with this here in question was before him upon a similar contention. The decision of the board of general appraisers is affirmed as to the kupfermetall, and reversed as to the buchmetall and clippings.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b700-4\">D.
