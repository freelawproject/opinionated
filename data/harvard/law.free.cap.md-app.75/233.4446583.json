For each of the two accused, it was the second violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) or (b) within a four year time span. Each defendant had submitted under an agreed statement of facts, and each was found guilty of \u201coperating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">\u201cNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a court <em>may not </em>stay the entering of judgment and place a person on probation for <em>a second or subsequent violation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>of \u00a7 21-902(a) or (b) of the Transportation Article </em>if the second or subsequent violation occurred within 5 years of the previous violation. A person is in violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) or (b) if that person receives probation under this section.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The trial court, after observing that the defendants had been previously placed on probation for similar offenses within the time delineated in the statute, nevertheless imposed probation before judgment. At the disposition of David Wayne Lewis, the second of the two offenders, the trial judge commented: \u201cCourse you realize, you know, if the State decides to appeal, ... [this] will be reversed.\u201d Patently, the State did appeal. We conclude that the judge\u2019s prophecy was right, but his judgment was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>State\u2019s Right to Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Before addressing the applicability of art. 27, \u00a7 641 to the facts of the case, we shall first surmount the hurdle Jeffrey Todd Shilling, one of the appellees and a beneficiary of the trial judge\u2019s largess, has interposed\u2014a motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Shilling argues that, because his first offense was for violating Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(6)\u2014driving while under the influence of alcohol\u2014as distinguished from \u00a7 21-902(a)\u2014driving while intoxicated, he did not commit a second violation of either a <em>or </em>b but rather a <em>and </em>b. That legal nicety, Shilling contends, precludes the automatic application of the mandatory sentence required by Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2). There, as we have seen, it is declared that \u201ca court <em>may not </em>stay the entering of judgment and place a person on probation for a second or subsequent violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) or (b) of the Transportation Article.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The italicized phrase \u201cmay not\u201d has a \u201cmandatory negative effect.\u201d Md.Ann. Code art. 2, \u00a7 26. Whenever a defendant falls within the ambit of Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2), the trial court must sentence that defendant, and it is devoid of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to enter probation before judgment. The Legislature has \u201cspecifically mandated\u201d that probation before judgment is not an option available to the trial judge when Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The State avers that in the instant case the trial judge failed to impose <em>a </em>sentence, despite the pellucid command of Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2). Instead the judge ignored the legislative mandate and imposed probation before judgment, irrespective of the fact that the statute proscribed that disposition. The result is that the imposition of probation is a nullity since the court was devoid of authority to impose it. The \u201csentence\u201d of probation before judgment was illegal, and the State may appeal to this Court pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 526, 325 A.2d 573 (1974), where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201c[The State may] appeal from the imposition of an illegal sentence, since the issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction is involved in the sense of whether it exceeded the powers vested in it by prescribing a penalty contrary to law. A lower court which thus exceeds its power must be bridled by [an appellate court]. Were it otherwise, mandates of the General Assembly could be defied with impunity and the only protection of the public would be the torturous process of judicial removal which would not have the effect of correcting the specific error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\"><em>See also State v. Thurmond, </em>73 Md.App. 686, 536 A.2d 128 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Furthermore, the State may appeal under the authority of Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Art. \u00a7 12-302(c)(2), which provides: \u201cThe State may appeal from a final judgment if the State alleges that the trial judge failed to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code.\u201d That is precisely what the State did in the instant case. As pointed out in <em>State v. Hannah, </em>307 Md. 390, 400, 514 A.2d 16 (1986), Courts Art. \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) \u201cwas undoubtedly inspired by Sonner....\u201d Because the State has alleged that an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d was meted by the trial court, the State is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>entitled to appeal under Courts Art. \u00a7 12-302. Were this not the case, this Court would be powerless to correct the specific illegal probation dispositions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shilling\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal must be denied. We turn now to the applicability, <em>vel non, </em>of Md.Ann.Code \u00a7 641(a)(2) to Shilling and Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Rule in Shilling\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Jeffrey Todd Shilling was found guilty in 1984 of driving while under the influence of alcohol, a violation of Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(6). Two years later, in the matter at bar, he was found guilty of driving while intoxicated, Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(a). Shilling maintains that Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) applies only when the two violations of Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902 are for the same exact offense, that is, both violations are under the same subsection. He reasons that since his first violation was for driving while under the influence of alcohol, Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(6), and his second was for a violation of Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(a), Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) does not apply. We have an entirely different point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) refers to \u201ca second or subsequent violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) <em>or </em>(b) of the Transportation Article if the second or subsequent violation occurred within five years of the previous violation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Through the use of the phrase \u201csecond or subsequent violation of ... (a) <em>or </em>(b),\u201d it is apparent that the Legislature contemplated four possible combinations of violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">1. \u00a7 21-902(a) + \u00a7 21-902(a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">2. \u00a7 21-902(a) + \u00a7 21-902(6)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">3. \u00a7 21-902(6)+ \u00a7 21-902(a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">4. \u00a7 21-902(6) + \u00a7 21-902(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Shilling\u2019s violation of Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(a) was <em>subsequent </em>to his violation of Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(6). The combination of violations accumulated by him is set out above as the third possibility\u2014\u00a7 21-902(6) + \u00a7 21-902(a). Consequently, Shilling\u2019s violations are within the scope of Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2), and probation before judgment is not a permissible disposition of his second offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Shilling also asserts that, even if Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) applies to his situation, the State has, nevertheless, failed to notify him, pursuant to Md. Rule 4-245, of its intention to prosecute him as a subsequent offender. Rule 4-245(a) provides: <em>\u201cA </em>subsequent offender is a defendant who, because of a prior conviction, is subject to additional or mandatory statutory punishment for the offense charged.\u201d Shilling equates his prior probation before judgment disposition with a Rule 4-245 prior conviction. The fallacy in that argument is that probation before judgment under Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 641 is not a prior conviction. <em>Myers v. State, </em>303 Md. 639, 647, 496 A.2d 312 (1985). Hence, since there was no prior conviction, notice under Rule 4-245 by the State to Shilling (or Lewis) was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The Rule in Lewis\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The record discloses that David Wayne Lewis was found guilty of driving while intoxicated on December 20, 1981, a violation of Transp. Art. \u00a7 21-902(a). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>he was adjudged to have committed another violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) by driving while intoxicated on May 26, 1986. Both offenses were violations of \u00a7 21-902(a) and occurred within five years of each other. On the facts before us, we perceive no relevant distinction between Lewis\u2019s situation and <em>State v. Fincham, </em>71 Md.App. 314, 525 A.2d 265 (1987), where we said that a trial judge \u201cis obliged to follow the law, and the law plainly forbids the Court from doing what it did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>We vacate the orders granting probation before judgment and remand the cases to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">MOTION TO DISMISS THE APPEAL IN CASE NO. 1356 DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">ORDERS STAYING ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN BOTH CASES VACATED; CASES REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY FOR ENTRY OF CONVICTION AND IMPOSITION OF SENTENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">APPELLEE SHILLING TO PAY COSTS IN APPEAL NO. 1356; APPELLEE LEWIS TO PAY COSTS IN APPEAL NO. 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">MANDATE TO ISSUE FORTHWITH.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\">.
