(Chevron) and others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By amendment, Bay Oil, Inc. (Bay Oil) was made a co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The several counts of the complaint against Chevron, as amended, alleged: (I) negligence of its actual or apparent agent; (II) strict liability; and (III) breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The several counts of the complaint against Bay Oil alleged: (IV) negligence of its actual agents; (V) strict liability; and (VI) breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Loss of consortium against both Chevron and Bay Oil was alleged under count VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Chevron and Bay Oil filed separate motions for summary judgment. The trial court, by a single order dated August 4, 1987, granted both motions. The order extended final judgments in favor of those two defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Lesches have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The test for our review in such cases was succinctly stated in <em>Washington Homes v. Inter. Land Dev., </em>281 Md. 712, 717-18, 382 A.2d 555, 557-58 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\u201cIn reviewing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action on a motion for summary judgment, the appellate court is concerned with whether there was a dispute as to any material fact, and if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In considering the matter, the duly shown facts which would be admissible in evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom must be considered in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and against the party making the motion. <em>See Rooney [v. Statewide Plumbing &amp; Heating General Contactors, Inc.], </em>265 Md. [559] at 563-564 [290 A.2d 496 (1972)]; <em>Shatzer [v. Kenilworth Warehouses, Inc.], </em>261 Md.

[251] at 255 [272 A.2d 42 (1971)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">So viewed, the \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits\u201d (Maryland Rule 2-501) demonstrate the existence of admissible evidence legally sufficient to establish the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">On July 14, 1985 Dr. Lesch had observed \u201ca metal rod lying in the ... highway ... swerved to avoid the rod but obviously did not. The left rear wheel hit the end of the rod, causing it to elevate, and hit against the gas tank.\u201d He first noted leaking gas after putting the car in the garage that day. The car was pushed from the garage and the driveway and garage hosed down until all luminescence and odor had disappeared. The car was left outside overnight and the garage door left open.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">On July 15, 1985, Dr. Lesch reported by telephone to co-defendant Walker\u2019s Chevron, Inc. (Walker\u2019s Chevron) that gasoline was leaking from the gas tank of his motor vehicle. Co-defendant Malcolm Weeks (Weeks) arranged to have the vehicle towed to the service station. Neither Walker\u2019s Chevron nor Weeks are parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Dr. Lesch talked to Weeks and was informed that repairs \u201cwould involve usually three things. He could repair it, if it was a small hole; it would require welding, if it was a larger hole; and it would need replacement if it was a big large hole.\u201d Weeks later told Dr. Lesch \u201cI have fixed your gas tank.\u201d He had \u201cfixed\u201d the leak by wrapping air conditioner tape around a wood screw and inserting it into the gas tank. He then sealed the area with a mixture of epoxy substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The automobile was returned to Dr. Lesch\u2019s possession on July 16, 1985 and was driven between 50 and 70 miles that day. Checks for gasoline leakage were made on the afternoon and evening of that day at 1:00, 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, 7:30 to 8:00, and 9:30 to 10:00. No leaking had occurred on any of those inspections. The vehicle then was garaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The home of the Lesches was a ranch-style house, with the garage and basement on the first level, the living quarters above. On the morning of July 17, 1985 Mrs. Lesch noticed an odor, told Dr. Lesch, and both descended to the basement area, then moved through a door into the garage. The basement light switch was already on when the descent was made, but there was no light in the garage itself. Dr. Lesch carried a flashlight because he was \u201caware of a faint, but definite, maybe a little greater than faint, but a definite odor of gasoline.\u201d He lifted the garage door to get more light, retraced his steps so he \u201ccould see better under where the tank was\u201d and saw \u201ca little puddling of gasoline in the gas tank area.\u201d He said that \u201c... at that moment the garage door triggered the light going on, and there was an instantaneous explosion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Dr. Lesch sustained second degree burns on 45% of his total body surface. Mrs. Lesch sustained second and third degree burns on 45% of her total body surface. The dwelling and all its contents were destroyed in the ensuing fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\n<em>The Case As To Chevron</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The appellants do not contend that <em>actual agency </em>has been shown as to Chevron. Their claim against Chevron is grounded solely upon <em>apparent agency </em>liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">In the course of an oral opinion, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axe\">\u201cThe case appears to me to fall squarely within the facts as presented by <em>BP Oil Company [Corporation] vs. Mabe, </em>decided by the Maryland Court of Appeals, 279 Md. 632 [370 A.2d 554 (1977) ]. Based upon all facts that I have before me and taking the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, I do not believe there is any basis to conclude Chevron made any representation to the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff did not, in fact, rely upon any representation made by Chevron. A reliance by the Plaintiff upon the facts as presented did not constitute reasonable and justified reliance upon any apparent agency relationship between Chevron and Walker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>\u201cI therefore conclude that the Motion for Summary Judgment as to Chevron should be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We agree that <em>Mabe </em>fixes the standards by which apparent agency liability may attach in this State. We shall hold, however, that the admissible evidence and the reasonable inferences arising therefrom as shown in the documentary evidence required to be considered under Rule 2-501 would <em>permit </em>a trier of facts reasonably to conclude that apparent agency has been shown. In short, we conclude that the deficit of evidence delineated by Judge Smith in <em>Mabe </em>has been supplied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In <em>Mabe, supra, </em>Judge Smith said for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cOne thing upon which the parties here can agree is that the law applicable to such an agency is that stated in Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 267 (1958):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u2018One who represents that another is his servant or other agent and thereby causes a third person justifiably <em>to rely </em>upon the care or skill of such apparent agent is subject to liability to the third person for harm caused by the lack of care or skill of the one appearing to be a servant or other agent as if he were such.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cRestatement of Agency \u00a7 267 (1933) is identical to the above. Two Maryland cases are cited in the annotations to it, <em>Pennsylvania R.R. v. Hoover, </em>142 Md. 251, 120 A. 526 (1923), and <em>Pugh v. Washington Ry. &amp; Elec., </em>134 Md. 196, 106 A. 522 (1919), 279 Md. at 643, 370 A.2d at 560.\u201d Judge Smith thereafter in <em>Mabe </em>cited and commented</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7V\">upon 1 F. Mechem, <em>Law of Agency </em>\u00a7 245 (2nd ed. 1914):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN1\">\u201c \u2018Estoppel is always a matter personal to the individual asserting it and he must therefore show that he was misled by the appearances relied upon. It is not enough that he might have been, or that some one else was, so misled. It must also appear that he had reasonable cause to believe that the authority existed; mere belief without cause, or belief in the face of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>that should have put him on his guard is not enough.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 177-78.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201cThe cases we have examined seem to be uniformly in agreement with the statements in the Restatement and Mechem to the effect that for there to be liability in a case such as this there must be actual reliance upon the part of the person injured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">279 Md. at 644-46, 370 A.2d at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Judge Smith carefully delineated the indicia of authority in <em>Mabe </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201cThe service station in question was painted yellow and green, said to be the BP colors. There was a large BP sign on a pole hanging over the station; BP insignia appeared on the gasoline pumps; there was a tow truck present with a BP sign on it, and the attendant in question wore a uniform with yellow and green BP emblems on his jacket and cap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cThe service station building was leased by the owner to Faison. He leased it to BP who in turn leased it back to Faison. Gasoline tanks, pumps and signs were owned by BP. Under the agreement between Faison and BP, Faison was required to \u201cfurnish, install and display continuously on the exterior of the station at a point visible and accessible to the public, a legible sign showing that [he was] occupying said station under a lease and [was] the sole owner of the business.\u201d Mabe was asked by his attorney whether there was \u201cany sign up that said anything about being operated by anybody other than BP,\u201d to which he replied in the negative. The record is otherwise silent as to such a sign.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">279 Md. at 634-35, 370 A.2d 556.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">\u201cFaison was paid no salary or commission by BP. Any employees were hired, fired, and paid by him. He was required to make no reports to BP relative to his sales and service operation. He paid his own sales and other taxes. BP had no control over the hours of station operation, the hours of operation being fixed by Faison. Faison paid cash on delivery for that which he bought. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>he did not have the money to pay, he did not obtain the product. He provided his own uniforms and said that BP never told him that he had to wear a uniform of any kind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">279 Md. at 635-36, 370 A.2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Judge Smith then detailed the evidence relating to reliance by <em>Mabe:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cMabe\u2019s reasons for entering the station in question were set forth in the following testimony on direct examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u2018Q Why did you choose the BP station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\"><em>\u2018A </em>Because I always buy BP gasoline, always deal with BP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">\u2018Q Had you dealt with BP before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\"><em>\u2018A </em>Yes, up on 29th Street and Greenmount Avenue. I [sic] was right around the corner from where I lived at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB-\">\u2018Q How often had you dealt with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">\u2018A I had been dealing with them for around about a year at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">'Q Was there anything in particular you\u2014attracted you to the BP station on Hilton Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-13\"><em>\u2018A </em>Nothing except for the BP station, had BP signs, BP gas, BP pumps.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-14\">\n<em>\u201cAlthough his brother twice said that reasons for entering this station were \u201cthe happy motoring sign\u201d which he said \u201cis a slogan and it means that there\u2019s good service,\u201d it was not actually established that such a sign, the sign of one of BP\u2019s competitors, was on the premises.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">279 Md. at 636, 370 A.2d 557 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-16\">The Court in <em>Mabe </em>then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-17\">\u201cBecause there is no evidence of any kind of reliance on the part of Mabe and no evidence of actual agency, Judge Dorf properly granted the motion for judgment N.O.V.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFz\">279 Md. at 649, 370 A.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-18\">The procedural history of the appeal in <em>Mabe, supra, </em>demonstrates that the issue whether the evidence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>have permitted a finding by the trier of. facts that the service station operator was the apparent agent of BP Oil was troublesome and difficult of ascertainment. The <em>Mabe </em>case was first argued before a five judge Court but failed to produce a decision. Reargued before a seven judge Court, the case produced a dissent by the late Judge Levine.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In the subject case, we believe that the evidence in this record leaves no ground for doubt that all elements essential to proof of apparent agency may be found by the trier of facts. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\n<em>Indicia of Apparent Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">Determination of the issue whether the decision in <em>Mabe, supra, </em>compels affirmance of the judgment below or whether the evidence would <em>reasonably permit </em>the trier of facts to conclude that this is <em>Mabe </em>revisited and deficit supplied, requires careful consideration of the reasonably permissible findings of facts in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In the subject case there is evidence from which it reasonably may be inferred that Chevron followed a course that was <em>intended </em>to assure that company operated and branded stations would be indistinguishable in the public mind. This is demonstrated by the following excerpt from Chevron\u2019s Station Acquisition Manual of March 1984.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">An important factor in the Company\u2019s willingness to brand a retail outlet is the physical appearance it will present. In our industry, <em>a branded station has become a visual statement to the world about our products and services. </em>Hopefully, each branded station enhances our reputation in the community. Chevron\u2019s retail identification system was conceived and implemented to establish a positive appearance that can be readily associated with the customer good will we enjoy. Consistent application of the system will build on our strengths and enhance our reputation in the sale of our products. Improper or inconsistent application of our identification system will undermine our program and damage our reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The importance of a coordinated, attractive appearance for all branded retail outlets, wherever they are located, deserves the attention of all Marketing employees. This is equally true whether the station is owned and operated by Chevron or owned or operated by a jobber or dealer. <em>The public is often unable to distinguish between a jobber station and one of ours. Accordingly, we must be equally concerned with the appearance of all Chevron branded stations.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Similar indicia of an intentional purpose by Chevron to guide the public mind to the conclusion that the Branded Dealer is Chevron and Chevron is the Branded Dealer is to be found in the Branded Jobber Petroleum Agreement between Chevron and Bay Oil that in part here pertinent reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201c8(c) Jobber recognizes Chevron\u2019s right to use and authorize others to use all trademarks, service marks, tradenames, color schemes and service station designs (collectively \u201cinsignia\u201d) utilized by Chevron (and owned by Chevron\u2019s parent company, Standard Oil Company of California (\u201cStandard\u201d)) to identify products <em>and services, </em>and Jobber agrees not to claim any right, title or interest therein. Jobber acknowledges the need to control Jobber\u2019s use of such insignia in order to maintain the validity of such insignia and to assure the continued recognition of, acceptance by, and high regard of the motoring public and other consumers for the products and <em>services identified by such insignia.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Chevron\u2019s Authorization Letter to Bay Oil for Branded Retail Outlets dated 9/11/84 included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">\u201c1. You shall cause the terms and conditions regarding the use of such insignia set forth in Section B of the Jobber Agreement to be complied with at the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We observe that Chevron used the imperative \"shall\u201d to <em>compel </em>Bay Oil to cause the use of such insignia at branded stations. No other insignia than Chevron\u2019s appeared on the premises of Walker\u2019s Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">During the deposition of the witness Robert George Shurts, identified as a Chevron employee for 36 years who retired as liaison between the company and jobbers in Maryland and other states, it was acknowledged that he had provided Bay Oil with such a document and gave the following testimony concerning it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">\u201cQ. Why did Chevron choose to have its jobbers provide a document of this type to service stations rather than providing it to the service stations directly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201cA. We don\u2019t have anything to do with the stations. The jobber\u2019s stations\u2014jobbers are our only customer. I don\u2019t have anything to do with dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201cQ. With respect to the use of the Chevron trade name and service mark, Chevron expects the jobber to police the use of that mark by the branded service station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A57\">\u201cA. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">This is an example of facts consciously withheld from public knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">The record established beyond cavil that all the insignia Chevron believed assured \u201ccontinued recognition of, acceptance by and high regard of the motoring public and other consumers for the products and services identified by such insignia\u201d were in place at Walker\u2019s Chevron. Bay Oil had carried out Chevron\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The Branded Jobber agreement, <em>supra, </em>included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-12\">\u201c9. Credit Cards, (a) Chevron may, at its option, authorize the acceptance by Jobber or one or more of Jobber\u2019s customers of credit cards approved by Chevron for retail sales of the types of products and services that Chevron may from time to time designate. The honoring of such credit cards by Jobber or Jobber\u2019s customers and Chevron\u2019s acceptance from Jobber of authorized invoices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>or other evidence of debt issued thereon for <em>sales of products and services made to cardholders by Jobber or, at Chevron\u2019s option, one or more of Jobber\u2019s customers, </em>shall be subject to terms and conditions established periodically by Chevron, which shall include, but not be limited to, Chevron\u2019s right to charge back to Jobber or to refuse to accept any invoice pursuant to such terms and conditions. Chevron reserves the right at any time to terminate any such authorization for the acceptance of credit cards.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Except for 12 month warranty periods after new car purchases, all repair work on the two vehicles of the Lesches was performed by Walker\u2019s Chevron, including the ill-fated repair of the gas tank on July 15, 1985. Such repair work of wide ranging character was performed by Walker\u2019s Chevron on 33 separate occasions between May 18, 1982 and July 15, 1985. The cost of such repairs totalled $2,953.66 over that period. All repair charges were paid by way of a Visa charge account approved by Chevron. Printed charge tickets provided by and bearing the imprint of Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., as shown on the following blank form, typically were used for all purchases and repair charges made by the Lesches at Walker\u2019s Chevron:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>These billings in total showed payments by the Lesches of many thousands of dollars during the cited period.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Chevron\u2019s efforts to prevent the public from distinguishing between branded stations and its own outlets were of long standing and were diligently pursued. On January 23, 1976, a letter from E.A. Pfefferkorn, identified as the wholesale manager of Chevron, addressed to Bay Oil, declared, \u201cWe are offering you a new 1976 point-of-sale program incorporating a \u2018We Care\u2019 theme.\u201d Although the letter stated that the program was designed for dealers \u201cwhose business is gasoline and service oriented rather than a dealer whose business might be repair oriented,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the letter declared that <em>\u201cThe \u2018We Care\u2019 program concept centers around the dealer\u2019s concern for his customers\u2019 service needs, not just the selling of his products.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added). The letter enclosed the following slogan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cWE CARE ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">\u201c\u2014for you, our customer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1O\">\u2014for your comfort</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkI\">\u2014for your safety</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXo\">\u2014for your economy!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">\u201cIf at any time our service slips, remind us, because we\u2019re working hard to prove to you...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">\u201cWE CARE!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-10\"><em>\u201cThis station is dedicated to this attitude and we want to take care of your car for you, properly and efficiently, so you are happy, safe and comfortable! </em>Give us a try or tell us when we miss the mark, so we can keep up our promises...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>\u201cWE CARE!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The employees of Walker\u2019s Chevron were clothed in uniforms bearing Chevron insignia. The Chevron \u201cMarketeer\u201d disclosed the purpose intended by Chevron by its encouragement of such uses by branded stations. In an article headed \u201cDRESSED FOR SUCCESS,\u201d the \u201cMarketeer\u201d made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201cThe current Chevron uniform program has been in effect for about 10 years, and while it has been successful, the Company believed it was time to make a change. \u2018We believed we needed something more fashionable and acceptable to dealers and their employees,\u2019 says Ben Smith, manager of Dealer and Consumer Affairs. \u2018We were looking for something that our dealers would want to wear, that would be comfortable and functional, and that would blend in with the Company image.

The image will help build dealers\u2019 business and encourage their recognition as professionals in their communities.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">On the basis of the totality of the above admissible evidence, might the trier of facts reasonably conclude that Chevron had adopted Omar Khayyam\u2019s studied purpose to \u201ctake the cash and let the credit go, nor heed the rumble of a <em>distant </em>drum,\u201d and in consequence have enmeshed itself in Sir Walter Scott\u2019s epigram: \u201cOh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive\u201d?

And I asked [Creighton],<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I said, not knowing that much about Mr. Weeks at the time, and having to adjust to new mechanics, after having years of faith in Mr. Walker, I had mentioned, questioning his ability is he a good mechanic, or does he know what he\u2019s doing. And his answer was, oh, yes, he is sent to courses, or he goes to courses. And by this I assumed or believed that this was a strong implication that he did indeed attend refresher courses or modernization courses, whatever, that were perhaps given by a national organization, most likely the one this gas station was affiliated with by its logo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">\u201cQ Did he tell you which organization he went to these courses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">\u201cA No. He said, oh, yes, he\u2019s a good mechanic, he regularly is sent to, or has to go to, not as if it was his own volition, as if it was a requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201cSo, I felt much more secure at that point in time, knowing that there were requirements or standards to be met by the employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cQ Approximately when was that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cA I would guess it would be shortly after Mr. Walker died, when Mr. Weeks first started to work there. Which I would guess would be sometime in \u201980, \u201981, somewhere in there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In the course of a separate affidavit, Dr. Lesch said, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201cBefore the fire, my wife Margaret and I owned two motor vehicles, a 1977 Buick Regal and a 1973 AMC Hornet. When in Bel Air, Maryland, Margaret and I exclusively bought gasoline products, as well as serviced both of our vehicles at Walker\u2019s Chevron, located at 800 Conowingo Road in Bel Air.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">He went on to explain why he did so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201cMy attorneys have attached to this Memorandum as exhibit 15 copies of my VISA credit card statements for the period July, 1982\u2014July, 1985. Whenever Margaret and I purchased gasoline or had our cars serviced in the Bel Air area, we used our VISA credit cards. We seldom, if ever, purchased gasoline or paid for car services with cash while in Bel Air, and we never used any other credit card besides our VISA card. As these credit card statements show, Margaret and I purchased only Chevron gasoline for our automobiles and had our cars serviced only at Chevron stations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">\u201cWhen Margaret and I traveled outside of Bel Air, we usually paid for gasoline with cash or traveler\u2019s checks. Even when we traveled, however, whenever possible we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>purchased Chevron gasoline, because over the years we developed confidence in Chevron products and services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cMargaret and I have lived in Bel Air since 1959. When we first arrived there, we patronized a service station owned by Ben Walker. In the mid-1970\u2019s, the station, located on Conowingo Road, became associated with Chevron, and became known as Walker\u2019s Chevron.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201cProm the mid-1970\u2019s until I last patronized Walker\u2019s Chevron in July, 1985, it was evident to Margaret and me that Walker\u2019s Chevron was associated with the national Chevron oil company. The station was known as Walker\u2019s Chevron, Inc. There was a large sign bearing the Chevron logo which was located on the parking lot of the station. The gasoline pumps had Chevron decals. The service vehicles had Chevron decals on each door. There was a Chevron emblem and slogan on the door to the service bay. There were other Chevron decals on the poles supporting the canopy over the full service island, as well as on the office desk. The gas station employees wore uniforms with Chevron emblems on them, and the gas station service tickets had the Chevron emblem on them. There was no indication at the service station that it was not associated with Chevron in any respect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>\u201cWhenever we needed repairs done to our vehicles after their manufacturer warranty period expired, Margaret and I took our vehicles only to Walker\u2019s Chevron. At first, we patronized the station because we trusted the mechanic, Ben Walker. We continued to patronize the service station after Ben Walker's death in 1980, however, largely because it was evident to us that Walker\u2019s Chevron was associated with Chevron, a national oil company. The relationship between Walker\u2019s Chevron and Chevron, which we perceived to exist, became critically important because Benny Walker, Ben Walker\u2019s son and the proprietor of the station after his father\u2019s death, had no service station experience. Because of the relationship which we perceived between Walker\u2019s Chevron and Chevron, we felt comfortable that our vehicles would be repaired properly, and we thought that Chevron, together with Walker\u2019s Chevron, would stand behind any repair. We understood such a relationship to exist between Walker\u2019s Chevron and Chevron, the national oil company because the station had Chevron in its name,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> because of the Chevron logos, signs, and trademarks located throughout the service station, and because the mechanics wore Chevron uniforms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Also, Walker\u2019s Chevron identified itself as a Chevron service station in the local yellow pages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u201cOn July 15, 1985, for the above reasons, I contacted Walker\u2019s Chevron to request that a puncture in the gas tank of my 1977 Buick be remedied. Margaret and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>chose to take our vehicle to Walker\u2019s Chevron because we were pleased with the manner in which Walker\u2019s Chevron had performed previous repairs to my vehicle, and because we relied upon Walker\u2019s Chevron and Chevron, the national company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">\n<em>As to Mrs. Lesch</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In an affidavit filed in the proceedings, Mrs. Lesch said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1d\">\u201cI have read the Affidavit of my husband, Warren Lesch, and concur with the statements contained therein. I also observed the Chevron tradename and insignia present at Walker\u2019s Chevron, as described by my husband. Furthermore, as my husband stated, I, too, relied upon what I perceived to be a direct association between Walker\u2019s Chevron and Chevron U.S.A., a large national oil company, in deciding to have our automobiles serviced at Walker\u2019s Chevron. I perceived that the activities of the mechanics and other employees at Walker\u2019s Chevron would be controlled or regulated by Chevron to insure that the repairs which they performed to our vehicles would be done in a competent and safe manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We are persuaded that the evidence submitted below as to both Lesches was sufficient in law to require the issue of reliance to be submitted to a trier of fact for determination and will now pass to the question whether such reliance was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Reasonableness of Reliance</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">As we see it, the reasonableness of the Lesches\u2019 reliance that Weeks, a defendant below and an employee of Walker\u2019s Chevron, was the apparent agent of Chevron is an issue proper for determination by the trier of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">The testimony and exhibits produced during depositions of the witnesses Shurts and McGuire, officials of Chevron described <em>supra, </em>furnish evidence bearing upon this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">An internal memorandum dated September 17, 1982, directed to \u201cField Marketing Management Retail\u201d explicitly stated that Chevron \u201chas taken the position that branded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Chevron dealers * * * are not permitted to use our Chevron or Standard names in their incorporated names. Such use is misleading * * *. <em>If the public would be inclined to view the business as an agent of Chevron, such use would be </em>unacceptable.\u201d (Emphasis added). The memorandum then called for \u201creview of the station files\u201d and \u201cany other sources for branded dealers using \u201cChevron\u201d in their corporate name.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In Chevron\u2019s brief, counsel argue that the memorandum was issued to \u201cprotect its trademark from infringement.\u201d That is a curious position to espouse in light of the fact that Chevron <em>had actual knowledge </em>that Walker\u2019s Chevron used \u201cChevron\u201d in its corporate name at least as early as February 20,1983<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <em>did nothing thereafter to seek a change. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The \u201cmisuse\u201d was permitted to go on and on with its continuing possible influence upon the Lesches\u2019 conclusion that Walker\u2019s Chevron was operated \u201cas an agent of Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We have previously cited, <em>supra, </em>an excerpt from Chevron\u2019s Station Acquisition Manual which declared that the physical appearance of a branded station was an important factor in its selection by Chevron and <em>\u201chas become a visual statement to the world about our products and services </em>\u201d and <em>\u201c[t]he public is often unable to distinguish between a jobber station and one of ours.\" </em>We believe that the efforts of Chevron to produce such a scenario compel submission of the issue of the reasonableness of the Lesches\u2019 conclusion to the trier of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>The trier of facts well could conclude that the above recited affirmative action by Chevron, standing alone, reasonably would justify the Lesches\u2019 expressed belief. There is more.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The uniforms bore the Chevron name and insignia. We have pointed out, <em>supra, </em>that Chevron officials urged the use of uniforms \u201cthat would blend in the Company image * * * The image will help build dealers\u2019 business and encourage their recognition as professionals in their communities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In sum, we are persuaded that the trier of facts reasonably could conclude that this case falls clearly within the principle succinctly stated by the late Chief Judge Sobeloff of the Court of Appeals in <em>Hobdey v. Wilkinson, </em>201 Md. 517, 526, 94 A.2d 625, 629 (1953).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cOne who knowingly permits another to act for him as though authorized, inducing third persons to rely to their disadvantage on the seeming authority, is estopped from later asserting the lack of authority of his apparent agent. This Court has recently said: \u2018As between a principal and his agent, the scope of the agent\u2019s authority may be limited by secret instructions and restrictions; but as between the principal and third persons, the mutual rights and liabilities are governed by the scope of the agent\u2019s apparent authority, which is that authority which the principal has held the agent out as possessing or which he has permitted the agent to represent that he possesses and which the principal is estopped to deny.\u2019 <em>Penowa Coal Sales Co. v.

Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 440, 370 A.2d 1102 (1977), <em>affirmed, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978), Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court of Appeals, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">\u201cThe Maryland Act does not prohibit an oil company from owning a retail service station or having the station operated as a retail outlet for that company\u2019s products.

In response to complaints about inequitable distribution of gasoline among retail stations, the Governor of Maryland directed the State Comptroller to conduct a market survey. The results of that survey indicated that gasoline stations operated by producers or refiners had received preferential treatment during the period of short supply. The Comptroller therefore proposed legislation which, according to the Court of Appeals, was \u2018designed to correct the inequities in the distribution and pricing of gasoline reflected by the survey.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADh\">437 U.S. 116, 121, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 2211.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">We conclude that a statute passed by the Legislature for such a purpose and for such intended effect must not be interpreted as constituting a legislative purpose to excuse \u201crefiners and. producers of petroleum products\u201d from liability for the wrongful acts of their apparent agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The statute was intended to cure what the Legislature conceived to be unfair conduct by refiners and producers. It plainly was not intended to provide an escape from liability for the negligent conduct of others acting under the apparent authority of such refiners and producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Summary as to Chevron</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">We are persuaded that the admissible evidence presented below clearly presents issues for determination by the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>of facts as to all essential legal elements required to be shown before liability may attach to one for the torts of its apparent agent. We summarize:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">A. <em>As to indicia of apparent authority.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">1. Chevron\u2019s studied efforts to prevent awareness in the public mind of any distinction between Chevron and its branded stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">2. Its ostentatious display of Chevron insignia and slogans throughout the service station, including on repair service vehicles and on the service bay door.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">3. Chevron\u2019s expressed belief that the combination of 1. and 2. above creates conditions whereby \u201ca branded station has become a visual statement to the world about our products and services,\u201d so that \u201c[t]he public is often unable to distinguish between a jobber station and one of ours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">4. The use by Walker\u2019s Chevron of \u201cChevron, Inc.\u201d in its corporate title, a fact known to Chevron for some years before the present incident and not protested by it despite its stated position that such use was \u201cmisleading\u201d and tended to incline the public \u201cto view the business as an agent of Chevron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">5. The imprint of the actual Chevron corporate name on charge tickets authorized for all purchases and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">6. The approval by Chevron of Visa charges in general for <em>all </em>purchases and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">7. Its encouragements of and the actual use in Walker\u2019s Chevron of uniforms bearing the Chevron name, hallmark and slogan.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">B. <em>As to reliance of the Lesches upon the representations of Chevron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Contrary to the absence of any evidence of reliance as found in <em>Mabe, supra, </em>the record below contains an abundance of admissible evidence that the Lesches relied upon the representations of Chevron, express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>C. <em>The reasonableness of the reliance of the Lesches.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The course followed by Chevron summarized in A. <em>supra, was recognized by it </em>as making it impossible for the public to distinguish Walker\u2019s Chevron from Chevron. The admissible evidence bearing upon the issue of the reasonableness of reliability compels submission of the question to the trier of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">D. <em>The effect of the Divestiture Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The divestiture act had no effect upon the applicable law of Maryland relating to the liability of a principal or employer for the negligent acts of another causing harm to a third person when such conduct was undertaken under the actual or apparent authority of such principal or employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">As to Chevron, we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The Case as to Bay Oil</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">The action against Bay Oil is predicated upon the proposition that under the facts of this case Walker\u2019s Chevron was the actual agent, of Bay Oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">We think the decision in <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., </em>214 Md. 479, 134 A.2d 296 (1957), controls our decision in this case. Both appellant and appellee cite <em>Keitz </em>as supportive of their respective positions, <em>i.e.:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Appellant: \u201cThe existence of an agency relationship depends upon the factual scenario of each case and the matter is normally not one for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">Appellee: \u201cAbsent any inference of control by Bay Oil over Walker\u2019s operation of the service station, it was proper for the trial court to determine as a matter of law, that no agency relationship existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">' Although the President of Walker\u2019s Chevron disclaimed knowledge of any written lease agreement or Resellers Contract between that corporation and Bay Oil, both such documents, executed by his father in 1976, were admitted below as exhibits. Both documents contained language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>extending the effect of the documents to the successors and assigns of the signatories. Ben Walker, President of Walker\u2019s Chevron, Inc., stated his belief that his occupancy of the station premises was under a \u201cmonth to month lease agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">He acknowledged that he could not have another jobber supply him with oil and gas. He reached that understanding \u201cas being implied at the beginning and then verified throughout subsequent phone conversations.\u201d He added that he traded under the Chevron name because it was a requirement of his oral lease. He said, \u201cI knew that I had to buy my products from Bay Oil and to my knowledge, Bay Oil only supplied Chevron products.\u201d He believed \u201cthat there would be some advantage to having a major brand name with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The question posed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., supra, </em>in its preliminary holding was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201cCan a servant have two masters, not joint employers, at one and the same time? This must be answered in the affirmative. A person may be the servant of two masters, not joint employers, at one time as to one act, provided that the service to one does not involve abandonment of the service to the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">(Citations omitted). The Court then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u201cComing now to the main question involved herein, it has been stated by this Court that there are at least five <em>criteria </em>that may be considered in determining the question whether the relationship of master and servant exists. These are: (1) the selection and engagement of the servant, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power to discharge, (4) the power to control the servant\u2019s conduct, (5) and whether the work is a part of the regular business of the employer. Standing alone, none of these <em>indicia, </em>excepting (4), seems controlling in the determination as to whether such relationship exists. The decisive test in determining whether the relation of master and servant exists is whether the employer has the <em>right to control </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>and direct the servant in the performance of his work and in the manner in which the work is to be done. </em>It will be noted from the above, it is not the manner in which the alleged master actually exercised his authority to control and direct the action of the servant which controls, but it is his <em>right </em>to do so that is important. <em>Sun Cab Co. v.
