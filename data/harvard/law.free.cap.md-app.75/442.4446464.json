BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Joseph Edward Argabright, appellant, was convicted of theft, pursuant to a guilty plea entered on September 5, 1985, and sentenced to one year imprisonment, which was suspended in favor of three years\u2019 probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was subsequently found to have violated several conditions of that probation. His appeal from the latter judgment questions the propriety of his having been tried unrepresented by counsel. He asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">1. Was appellant tried in violation of his constitutional right to counsel and in violation of Md.Rule 4-215?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">2. Did the trial court err in refusing to determine appellant\u2019s eligibility for court appointed counsel and ultimately in refusing to appoint counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">3. Did the trial court err in refusing to allow appellant\u2019s witnesses to testify regarding their observation of appellant relevant to his criminal responsibility and in failing to make a determination that appellant was or was not criminally responsible?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">When appellant appeared for trial on the violation of probation charge, he was represented by an assistant Public Defender. Prior to that appearance, counsel had filed, on appellant\u2019s behalf, a written plea of not criminally respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>sible as well as a petition for a mental examination. Pursuant to the latter, appellant had been examined and found to be criminally responsible and competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On the day of trial, citing a conflict over the summonsing of a witness, appellant requested permission to discharge his attorney. After the attorney informed the court that \u201cif [counsel is] discharged so will the Public Defender\u2019s Office ... that will make Mr. Argabright, of course, fly on his own,\u201d the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">THE COURT: Well, I still don\u2019t know what you mean by go on your own. Are you ... in relation to Mr. Miller. What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: To discharge Mr. Miller and to pursue the proceedings myself and to ask for a continuation today so that I may have the witness called that I wished and the records subpoenaed that I asked for. THE COURT: You want to discharge Mr. Miller?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">THE COURT: And as I understand it Miss Robertson [of the Howard County Public Defender\u2019s Office] from what I\u2019ve been informed, is not going to assign you another Public Defender, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: From ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">THE COURT: That\u2019s entirely up to her. It\u2019s not my decision, that\u2019s her decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: Yes sir, I understand that. I got a letter back from you also about that just recently. You\u2019ve sent me a letter stating that ... I had asked you if you could intervene in the situation because of the situation between me and Mr. Miller and you had sent a letter back stating that Mr. Miller was the Public Defender\u2019s Office and that you had nothing to do with appointing or ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">THE COURT: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">MR.

ARGABRIGHT: <em>I don\u2019t want to represent myself, but if I can\u2019t have another attorney appointed I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019ll have to do.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t have any control over that. You either have to take the attorney assigned by the Public Defender or not. If you\u2019re not satisfied with Mr. Miller you can ask Miss Robertson to assign you another one, but that\u2019s entirely up to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: I\u2019d make that request then, I guess, on record and I\u2019ll also follow up with a letter if this is continued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">THE COURT: You might make the request, but you\u2019re making your request to the wrong individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: Yes sir, I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">THE COURT: I have no control over it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: I\u2019m saying that I\u2019m just stating that I would request ... that I\u2019m stating here that I\u2019ll follow it up with a letter to Miss Robertson if I can get the address and the name that I need to send it to if a continuance is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">THE COURT: Pass that by me again. I was reading something else, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: I will take and send a letter to Miss Robertson asking that another Public Defender be appointed if this is continued. If not then I will have to proceed on my own I guess, but I would hope that the Court ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">THE COURT: Alright, I just ... just want to let you know I don\u2019t want to know anything about the particular case. Who is ... may I ask who Brenda Stacy is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqqv\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: Yes sir she was my spouse for ten years. Not legally married, common-law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-15\">THE COURT: <em>And as I understand it ... what you are asking is that you\u2019re going to write to Miss Robertson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>and ask for another attorney and if she turns you down then you have to go on your own, is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUs\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: <em>Yes sir, and at this time I\u2019d like to state here if ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">THE COURT: <em>But you want ... want an attorney, is that ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: <em>Yes sir, I\u2019d like to have an attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">THE COURT: Well, I guess you have to ask Miss Robertson first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: At this particular point and time, yes sir.

If your attorney refused to and you wanted the witness subpoenaed, I suppose I either have to postpone it or it will just be appealed and you have a post conviction and in either event it would be sent back. Let the record show that Mr. Argabright discharges Mr. Miller, the attorney assigned by the Public Defender\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">THE COURT: <em>Now as I understand, if Miss Robertson doesn\u2019t supply another attorney with you, you come back you\u2019re not going to have an attorney, you understand that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: <em>Yes sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">THE COURT: I think this case has been here at least two times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: It\u2019s been several times, Your Hon- or. It\u2019s been since May of 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>MR. MILLER: [Assistant Public Defender]: Your Honor, please, I might add one final point. I ... I think it should be made clear ... I said this before, I\u2019ll just reiterate it here again, Miss Robertson has no intention of assigning another attorney. It\u2019s not a question that\u2019s open to consideration at this point. So I think Mr. Argabright and the Court should be apprised of that now and whatever letters or contacts he may make with her, they will be to no avail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">MR. ARGABRIGHT: Is there ... I mean, can I ask the attorney here, Your Honor, why Miss Robertson would make a decision like that without even hearing from me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0_\">THE COURT: Well, I don\u2019t know whether he can speak for Miss Robertson. I suggest you ask her personally by letter, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The case was continued. When it was next called for trial, appellant appeared without counsel. At that time, he reported that he had written to Miss Robertson, who had refused to appoint an attorney to replace the one he had discharged. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">THE DEFENDANT [MR. ARGABRIGHT]: May I go on the record referring to some of the rules, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM_\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">THE DEFENDANT: In Maryland Rule 4-214, \u201cDefense Counsel\u201d, it states, \u201cThe Public Defender may relieve appointed counsel and substitute new counsel for the defendant without order of the court____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">THE COURT: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Okay. And in 214 it also states that the Public Defender should provide representation and if the Public Defender declines to do so, the court should appoint counsel; and I would refer to <em>Laquay v. State, </em>[16 Md.App. 709, 299 A.2d 527 (1973) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">THE COURT: Well, if I appoint you counsel, what are you going to do, tell him what to do also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">THE DEFENDANT: I would hope that he would pursue ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>THE COURT: You would hope that he would....

Your dictates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWmB\">THE DEFENDANT: Mr. Miller wanted to plead me guilty, enter into a plea bargain. And there was the requirement as far as witnesses because I had not pled guilty, do not wish to plead guilty; and, therefore, my desires are that and, I think, basically, I have the right to contend my innocence and ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">THE COURT: Well my opinion, sir, is that this matter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">has been dragged on for much too long____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">THE COURT: ... And I think you have abused your rights to have counsel, and I am ready to proceed if the State is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Okay, sir. Exactly how ... I am no attorney, I don\u2019t know how ... Some of the things, I hope ... I\u2019ll be begging the court\u2019s indulgence at ... At times then if I may refer ... I don\u2019t know if I can be heard____ Is it in rebuttal? In regards to the matter and the ruling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">THE COURT: I have made no ruling. What ruling do you speak of, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">THE DEFENDANT: As far as that I have waived my right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">THE COURT: Well it\u2019s not a question that you\u2019ve waived your right to counsel. It\u2019s a question that you want what you want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-16\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-17\">THE COURT: The thing of it is you had Mr. Miller, you fired him; you asked the Public Defender to substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>another attorney; apparently the Public Defender said, \u201cNo,\u201d and that\u2019s what the posture is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">THE DEFENDANT: But on the ground ... I think I stated to the Court the grounds for dismissing the attorney, I felt, at the time, like I said, there was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">THE COURT: Well whether they were appropriate or inappropriate, as far as you\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s up to the Public Defender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">THE DEFENDANT: From what I understand by some of the rules I have here, sir, there would also be a decision to be made by the Court as to whether there was grounds for dismissing the attorney and then if the Public Defender\u2019s Office would not appoint any attorney, the Court could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">THE COURT: You want me to rule upon the fact that you dismissed the attorney, and you want me to rule that that\u2019s appropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">THE DEFENDANT: If I, in fact, had a valid reason for dismissing the attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">THE COURT: If you had a valid reason for dismissal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ7\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t represent you, Mr. Argabright. You have to make certain decisions in your life and that\u2019s your decision. I am not going to look in back of that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-11\">THE DEFENDANT: All right, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Appellant entered a plea of not guilty and the hearing proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Maryland Rule 4-215(e), <em>Discharge of </em>Counsel\u2014 <em>Waiver, </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The procedure set out in the Rule comports with the constitutional requirements regarding the waiver of the right to counsel. <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 606, 536 A.2d 1149 (1988), <em>aff'g, </em>67 Md.App. 102, 506 A.2d 660 (1986). It contemplates that a trial court, as a threshold matter, will determine whether a request to discharge counsel is meritorious. <em>Id., </em>311 Md. at 607, 536 A.2d 1149. This is but the recognition that unless an accused can show, at some point, that his discharge of counsel was meritorious, his or her \u201cknowing and intelligent refusal to proceed with current able counsel ... [will be] deemed to constitute a voluntary waiver of the right to counsel.\u201d 311 Md. at 606, 536 A.2d 1149. Thus, <em>Fowlkes </em>makes clear that when the trial court has determined that a request to discharge counsel is non-meritorious and has informed the accused that the trial will proceed, as scheduled, with the accused unrepresented by counsel if the accused discharges counsel and does not have new counsel available to enter his appearance, and the record discloses that the accused was advised pursuant to Rule 4-215(a)(l)-(4), there has been compliance with the requirements of the Rule. Under those circumstances, the court may appropriately determine that the accused has knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On the other hand, when the court determines that the reason for the discharge is meritorious, compliance with the Rule requires that it follow somewhat different procedures. Not only must the court permit counsel to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>discharged and continue the action, if necessary, but it must also advise the accused that, if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the trial will proceed with the accused unrepresented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant sought to discharge his counsel as a result of a dispute between them concerning whether to subpoena a witness. Appellant also sought a continuance of the trial so that he could subpoena the witness and attempt to have the Public Defender\u2019s office appoint him another attorney. Although he made it clear that he wished to have counsel, he indicated that if the Public Defender\u2019s office would not appoint a different attorney, he would \u201cpursue the proceedings myself\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The trial judge permitted appellant to discharge his counsel. In doing so, he stated his belief that he could not prohibit appellant from subpoenaing a witness and that, should he do so, he would be reversed either on appeal or after post conviction proceedings. The court also continued the proceedings with the admonition that \u201cif [the Public Defender\u2019s office] doesn\u2019t supply another attorney with you, you come back you\u2019re not going to have an attorney, you understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Appellant contends that the trial court \u201capparently found Appellant\u2019s reason for requesting dismissal of Mr. Miller to be meritorious\u201d, and he acknowledges that the court continued the proceedings \u201cso that Appellant could ask Ms. Robertson personally if she would appoint another attorney from the Public Defender\u2019s Office.\u201d In these two respects, appellant admits, the court followed the requirements of the Rule. He argues, however, that the court failed to comply with the Rule in another respect: it did not advise appellant that \u201cif new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel.\u201d From this premise, appellant proceeds to assert that the court\u2019s implicit finding that appellant waived his right to counsel by failing to obtain counsel before the next trial date was error. Among the arguments he makes in support of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>assertion is that the court failed to place on the record the factual predicate which would justify a finding of waiver by inaction, <em>ie., </em>that the court had previously informed him of the \u201cconsequences of his action or inaction.\u201d <em>See Fowlkes v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 102, 120, 506 A.2d 660 (1986), <em>aff'd, </em>311 Md. 586, 536 A.2d 1149 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">There can be no dispute but that the trial court did not advise appellant in the words of the Rule that his appearance at the next trial date without counsel would result in his being tried unrepresented by counsel; however, neither the Rule nor Maryland case law requires that it do so. Because appellant\u2019s intention, as revealed by his colloquy with the court, was to attempt to have the Public Defender\u2019s office appoint another attorney to represent him, and not to obtain, or attempt to obtain, private counsel, the message conveyed by the court was clear: if appellant were unsuccessful in having substitute counsel appointed by the Public Defender\u2019s office, the trial would proceed with him unrepresented by counsel. If, therefore, the Rule does not require appellant to be advised pursuant to Rule 4-215(a), then we would be constrained to conclude that there was sufficient compliance with the Rule in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The last sentence of 4-215(e) is specific in its requirement that \u201c[i]f the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.\u201d Section 4-215(a)(l)-(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">(a) <em>First Appearance in Court Without </em>Counsel.\u2014At the defendant\u2019s first appearance in court without counsel, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>(1) Make certain that the defendant has received a copy of the charging document containing notice as to right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">(2) Inform the defendant of the right to counsel and of the importance of assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">(3) Advise the defendant of the nature of the charges in the charging document, and the allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">(4) Conduct a waiver inquiry pursuant to section (b) of this Rule if the defendant indicates a desire to waive counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Fowlkes, </em>commenting on this section and Rule 4-215(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">These requirements implement the constitutional mandate for waiver of the right to counsel____ Compliance with these requirements is necessary to ensure that the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel____ (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">311 Md. at 609, 536 A.2d 1149, citing <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 130, 406 A.2d 98 (1979) and <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 282, 523 A.2d 597 (1987). Requiring the court to comply with Rule 4-215(a)(1)-(4) thus serves the purpose of ensuring that an accused has sufficient information regarding the consequences of discharging counsel as to be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>waive knowingly and intelligently the right to counsel. In this case, the discharge of counsel was arguably for a meritorious reason, which presents the questions whether compliance is mandated in that situation as well as in the case of a non-meritorious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Ensuring that an accused who discharges counsel for a meritorious reason validly waives counsel, whether expressly, Rule 4-215(b), or by inaction, Rule 4-215(d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is no less important than in the case of an accused who does so for a non-meritorious reason; in fact, it may be more so since, in the former situation, the desire to delay trial is less obvious. And there is nothing in the Rule which would suggest otherwise. Accordingly, we conclude that, whether the court finds that a discharge was for a meritorious reason or for a non-meritorious reason, it may not find either an express waiver of counsel or a waiver of counsel by inaction until it has complied with the requirements of Rule 4-215(a)(1)-(4), if that has not already been done. This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of the Rule, <em>see Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 609, 536 A.2d 1149; <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 281, 523 A.2d 597; <em>State v. Bryan, </em>284 Md. 152, 158-59, 395 A.2d 475 (1978), and, in fact, is mandated by Rules 4-215(b), <em>see </em>note 3 <em>supra </em>and 4-215(d). <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Although he permitted the discharge and continued the case, advising appellant that his failure to obtain substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tute counsel from the Public Defender\u2019s office would result in his being tried without counsel, the trial judge did not comply with Rule 4-215(a)(l)-(4) at that time. Moreover, neither the docket nor file reflects that the court had previously done so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When appellant appeared in court on the next trial date, he did not, nor was he requested to, expressly waive his right to counsel; on the contrary, he specifically asked the court to appoint substitute counsel. Having refused to do so, the court determined that appellant had \u201cabused [his] rights to have counsel____\u201d That determination, of necessity premised upon appellant\u2019s inaction, was made despite the fact that appellant had never been advised by the court pursuant to Rule 4-215(a)(l)-(4). The requirements of the Rule are mandatory, <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 280, 523 A.2d 597; <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 130, 406 A.2d 98 (1979); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 123, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978); <em>Bryan, </em>284 Md. at 154, 395 A.2d 475, requiring strict, rather than \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d, <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 280, 523 A.2d 597, and failure to comply with the requirements, reversible error. <em>Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 122-26, 394 A.2d 597. Since the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>comply with the Rule, we are constrained to reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Appellant\u2019s next argument is, the Public Defender having refused to appoint substitute counsel, the court was under an obligation to conduct an inquiry into appellant\u2019s eligibility for court-appointed counsel. Appellant contends that when the court refused to conduct the inquiry and ultimately refused to appoint counsel, it erred. In support of these propositions, appellant relies upon <em>Thompson v. State, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Baldwin v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 538, 444 A.2d 1058 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Neither of these cases involves the issue presented by the case <em>sub judiee. </em>Both turned upon the court\u2019s responsibility to determine an accused\u2019s indigency in the face of the accused\u2019s allegations that he was and the determination to the contrary by the Public Defender\u2019s office. <em>Thompson, </em>for example, proceeds on the premise that where a defendant is indigent, it is the duty of the Public Defender to provide legal representation for him or her. 284 Md. at 127, 394 A.2d 1190. Thus, when a defendant appears without counsel, contending that he or she is indigent, and the Public Defender declines representation, the court has the obligation of making \u201cits own independent determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>whether a defendant is indigent and otherwise eligible to have counsel provided\u201d. 284 Md. at 129, 394 A.2d 1190. This is no more than recognition of what Maryland Code Ann., art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">Nothing in this article shall be construed to deprive [a circuit court] of its authority to appoint an attorney to represent an indigent person ... where the Office of the Public Defender declines to provide representation to an indigent person entitled to representation under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Baldwin </em>proceeds on a similar premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The broad proposition that appellant espouses is: the court must conduct an inquiry to determine whether to appoint counsel for an accused and, indeed, must appoint counsel whenever the Public Defender has previously appointed counsel, thus finding that the accused is indigent for purposes of appointed counsel; the accused has been permitted to discharge counsel for a meritorious reason; and the Public Defender refuses to appoint substitute counsel. But for the fact that it assumes that a trial judge has found the accused\u2019s request meritorious and, on that basis, permitted counsel to be discharged, appellant\u2019s argument might be easily dismissed. Requiring the court to conduct an inquiry to determine whether to appoint counsel and, perhaps, requiring that it do so, when counsel has been non-meritoriously discharged and the Public Defender\u2019s office has declined to appoint a substitute would directly conflict with a firmly settled principle of Maryland law: \u201c... for indigent defendants unable to retain private counsel, the right to counsel is but a right to effective legal representation; it is not a right to representation by any particular attorney.\u201d <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605, 536 A.2d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The situation is vastly different when a discharge has been determined by the court to have been for a meritorious reason. A request to discharge counsel is ordinarily motivated by an accused\u2019s contention that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>she is not receiving effective assistance of counsel or by his or her desire to enhance the quality of the assistance he or she is receiving; it is, in other words, addressed to the accused\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel. This is consistent with the purpose of Rule 4-215\u2014\u201cto protect that most important fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel, which is basic to our adversary system of criminal justice, and which is guaranteed by the federal and Maryland constitutions to every defendant in all criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 281-82, 523 A.2d 597. When, therefore, a court determines that such a request is meritorious, it presumably legitimizes both the premises on which the request is based and the good faith of the accused in making the request. Thus, such a finding forecloses any contention that an accused has acted in bad faith or with improper motive and, more specifically, that the accused is seeking either representation by a particular attorney or to delay the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>although, as we have seen, not directly on point, present an analogous situation. In both cases, the court was presented with a disputed factual situation bearing upon an accused\u2019s entitlement to have counsel appointed. The disputed issue was whether the accused was indigent, as he alleged, or not, as the Public Defender\u2019s Office alleged. In each case, the Court held that the trial court should have resolved the factual dispute and appointed counsel if the accused was found to be indigent and otherwise entitled to assistance of counsel. In the instant case, appellant was financially and otherwise entitled to have counsel appointed to represent him, the Public Defender\u2019s office having previously so determined. This did not change when appellant requested that appointed counsel be discharged. The request presented, however, a factual dispute for resolution by the court: whether appellant\u2019s request to discharge counsel was meritorious. Since appellant was financially and otherwise entitled to have counsel appointed to assist him, a finding by the court that the request was meritorious would impose upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>court the obligation of appointing counsel to replace discharged counsel, the Public Defender\u2019s office having declined to do so. <em>See Thompson, </em>284 Md. at 128, 394 A.2d 1190. <em>See also </em>Rule 4-215(d), which requires the court to continue the trial if it determines that an accused\u2019s appearance without counsel is for a meritorious reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Although Rule 4-215(e), as interpreted by <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 607, 536 A.2d 1149, requires the trial judge to make a finding concerning the merit of a requested discharge of counsel and, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s assumption that he did so, we are not sure that there was compliance with this aspect of the Rule in this case. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>While the trial judge\u2019s comments at the initial hearing may be susceptible to the inference that the reason for the requested discharge was meritorious, subsequent events, specifically, his comments at the next hearing, indicate that this may not have been so. Since different consequences flow from a finding that the discharge was meritorious than from one that it was not, the issue needs to be definitively resolved. Therefore, on remand, if appellant\u2019s right to appointed counsel is still an issue, the court must specifically address the nature of the discharge and, having done so, determine whether to appoint counsel to represent appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that evidence pertaining to his criminal responsibility should have been admitted into evidence and that the court\u2019s failure to admit it was error. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">When asked to plead at the revocation hearing, appellant pled \u201cnot guilty\u201d; he simply did not pursue his plea of not criminally responsible. Therefore, evidence bearing on his criminal responsibility, because it was not at issue, was irrelevant. Consequently, there was no need for the court to make a finding as to appellant\u2019s criminal responsibility and it properly excluded testimony as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>JUDGMENTS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY HOWARD COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">GARRITY, J., concurs with opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-14\">.

' The accuracy of the conclusion that the trial judge determined that appellant\u2019s request to discharge counsel was for a meritorious reason is brought into question by the colloquy which occurred on the day on which the trial began. At that time, in response to appellant's specific request that the court determine whether his discharge of counsel was meritorious, the court refused to do so, indicating that it did not represent appellant and that it would not look in back of appellant\u2019s decision to discharge his counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-14\">.

If the court finds that there is no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s appearance without counsel, the court may determine that the defendant has waived counsel by failing or refusing to obtain counsel and may proceed with the hearing or trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b477-5\">.

Indeed, the majority embraced its language and reversed the judgment because the trial court did not fully comply with its provisions. On closer reflection, however, I contend that unless its pertinent language is employed in harmony with that of Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f), which allows the court to appoint an attorney when the Office of Public Defender declines to do so, Rule 4-215(e) does not adequately address the problem at bar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Rule 4-215(e) provides, in essence, that if counsel is allowed to be discharged for a meritorious reason, then the court may continue the matter, if necessary, and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the case will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>This rule is logical only if the defendant has the ability to obtain new representation. If the defendant lacks that ability because of indigency, the rule not only becomes illogical, but unconstitutional as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Although adopted by the Court of Appeals, the rule certainly was not designed to mandate that an indigent defendant who happened to have a meritorious reason for requesting dismissal of his counsel, would, upon discharge of counsel by the court, be totally responsible to retain new counsel. In the same vein, the very provisions the majority hold must be followed, i.e., Rule 4-215(a)(l)-(4) (that of making certain the defendant has received a copy of the charging document and is made aware of the importance of assistance of counsel), are utterly superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">While designing the rule to apply to non-indigent defendants, for the most part, the Court of Appeals likely assumed that if an indigent defendant who was represented by the Public Defender\u2019s Office had a meritorious reason for discharging his attorney, that office would appoint a new attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In this case, once Mr. Miller was meritoriously discharged, the Public Defender should have appointed a new attorney. The Public Defender chose not to do so. This left the defendant without an attorney and, because he was indigent, unable to procure one.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Md.Rule 4-215(e) simply does not address the situation presented in this case. I submit that the solution to this problem has been provided by the Legislature in Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f). That statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">Nothing in this article shall be construed to deprive any court mentioned in \u00a7 4(b)(2) of this article of its authority to appoint an attorney to represent an indigent person where there is a conflict in legal representation in a matter involving multiple defendants and one of the defendants is represented by or through the Office of the Public Defender, or where the Office of the Public De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>fender declines to provide representation to an indigent person entitled to representation under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We pointed out in <em>Baldwin v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 538, 553, 444 A.2d 1058 (1982), that this statute placed a responsibility on trial judges to assure that defendants are not denied their right to counsel. Thus, when the Public Defender refuses to represent an indigent defendant, a trial judge may not force the defendant to trial without first deciding whether the court should appoint counsel under Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f). <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 128, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The majority distinguishes the <em>Baldwin </em>and <em>Thompson </em>cases on the grounds that in both of those cases the reason for the Public Defender\u2019s refusal to represent the defendant was that the Public Defender did not believe the defendant was indigent. I believe this is too narrow a reading of these cases. I believe that the rationale of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Baldwin </em>should be applied in all similar situations where the Public Defender\u2019s office has declined representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In the instant case therefore, I believe that after counsel was excused and the Public Defender made known his position that he was not going to represent appellant that Art. 27A, \u00a7 6(f) became applicable. Consequently, the trial judge, as a threshold matter, became responsible to conduct a hearing to decide whether the appellant was eligible as an indigent to receive the services of a court appointed attorney. The trial judge, by failing to do so in this case, denied the appellant of his right to counsel. For that reason, I would vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-13\">. The trial court determined that because of the conflict appellant had with his attorney over the question of whether Ms. Stacy (appellant\u2019s former common-law wife of ten years against whom he had been convicted of committing a fourth degree sexual offense in violation of his probation) should be subpoenaed as a witness, a discharge of counsel was proper. Although the trial judge did not employ the specific adjective \u201cmeritorious,\u201d his comments and actions clearly amounted to such finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
