The agreements, among other things, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\u201cIf any question should arise concerning the interpretation of this Agreement or any matter arising therefrom, said question or matter shall be left to the determination of a Board of Arbitrators. Each party shall appoint one arbitrator and these two shall appoint a third arbitrator. The decision of any two arbitrators shall be binding upon both parties hereto, and the cost of arbitration shall be borne equally between both parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">After completion of the construction work in 1951, appellant refused to account for the profits. After unsuccessful negotiations for settlement, each party appointed an arbitrator, but the two were unable to agree upon the appointment of a third. Thereupon on March 13, 1952, respondent filed a petition herein seeking the appointment of a third arbitrator. Over appellant\u2019s objection the third arbitrator was appointed. On July 14, 1954, the arbitrators\u2019 award was signed and a notice of motion to confirm was filed. The award was confirmed on October 19, 1954. An appeal from the order of confirmation was taken on December 11, 1956. This court affirmed the order. <em>(Downer Corp. </em>v. <em>Union Paving Co., </em>146 Cal.App.2d 708 [304 P.2d 756].) Thereafter appellant unsuccessfully sought a rehearing in this court, a hearing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Supreme Court of the State of California, and a review by the Supreme Court of the United States. The remittitur from this court was filed on February 19, 1957, and on February 20 respondent filed its memorandum of costs and disbursements on appeal and included therein attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount to be fixed by the court pursuant to notice of a motion therefor filed therewith. Upon appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the motion for an order fixing the fees was dismissed but with leave to. respondent to file a supplemental complaint or petition for fees. In accordance with said leave of court, respondent filed a petition for an order fixing attorneys\u2019 fees in accordance with the following provision of the joint venture agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">\u201cIn the event either party finds it necessary to bring an \u25a0 action at law to enforce its rights hereunder, it is agreed that the Court shall award the successful party reasonable counsel fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">After a hearing on the petition and the objections thereto, the trial court made an order fixing attorneys\u2019 fees but only for those services of respondent\u2019s counsel which were rendered after the taking of the appeal from the order confirming the arbitrators\u2019 award. On this appeal from said order appellant\u2019s main contentions are that the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain a petition for attorneys\u2019 fees; that respondent waived its right to attorneys\u2019 fees by proceeding to arbitrate rather than bringing an action at law to enforce its rights; that respondent\u2019s claim is barred by the statutes of limitations; and that respondent\u2019s right to attorneys\u2019 fees is merged in the judgment affirming the award of the arbitrators, and respondent is barred by that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Appellant maintains that respondent could not for the first time assert its right to attorneys\u2019 fees when it filed its memorandum of costs and disbursements on appeal but was compelled to plead the same in its petition for appointment of a third arbitrator which was filed on March 13,1952, and that the statute of limitations commenced to run from that date. There is no merit in this contention. Obviously the respondent could not then know that an appeal would be taken from the order thereafter made confirming the award of the arbitrators. Neither at law nor under the provision for attorneys\u2019 fees contained in the joint venture agreements did respondent at that time have a cause of action for attorneys\u2019 fees for defending against the appeal from the order confirming the award of the arbitrators. It was not until after October 24, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>1954, when appellant filed its notice of appeal from the order of confirmation, that counsel performed any services which were compensable under the agreements between the parties.  The court in <em>Genis </em>v. <em>Krasne, </em>47 Cal.2d 241, 248 [302 P.2d 289], in discussing <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 353 [268 P.2d 799], stated: \u201c[W]hen costs are awarded on appeal, the memorandum of costs on appeal is filed and taxed in the trial court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1034), and if a party is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal, they can be determined by trial court when it determines the costs on appeal. (See <em>Cirimele </em>v. <em>Shinazy </em>(1954), 124 Cal.App.2d 46, 53 [268 P.2d 210]; <em>Oakland, Calif. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland </em>(1949), 93 Cal.App.2d 713, 718-719 [209 P.2d 854].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In the Oakland, Calif. Towel Co. case, <em>supra, </em>the court said, at page 719: \u201cIt was further stated in the Painter case, at page 627: \u2018This authority given the court could only be exercised when the fee, now in dispute, was to be allowed by an order made after final judgment, and allowance is necessarily an incident to such judgment when given against the claimant as plaintiff in the action.\u2019 In accordance with the above, the trial court, if it be so inclined, may allow a <em>reasonable </em>fee for services on appeal. [Paragraph.] The judgment is affirmed. The motion for counsel fees on appeal may be filed within 30 days from the date of the filing of the remittitur.\u201d (See also 14 Cal.Jur.2d, Damages, \u00a7 105, p. 726.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><em>Gerard </em>v. <em>Salter, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 840, 848 [304 P.2d 237], upon which appellant relies, is not in point. There the attorneys\u2019 fees which were sought to be recovered at the time of the confirmation of the award were largely for services rendered in connection with the hearing before the board of arbitrators. No services on appeal were, or could be, then involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Appellant argues that respondent did not bring an action at law to enforce its rights but elected to proceed to arbitration and that, therefore, under the joint venture agreements, he was not entitled to counsel fees, as it was therein provided that \u201cthe cost of arbitration shall be borne equally between both parties.\u201d  It is too well established to require citation of authority that \u201ccosts\u201d do not include attorneys\u2019 fees. In the Gerard case, <em>supra, </em>wherein the contract authorized the arbitrators to \u201cassess costs and charges of the arbitration upon either or both parties\u201d but provided that if suit were brought \u201cin court to \u2018enforce the terms thereof any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>judgment awarded shall include court costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the successful party,\u2019 \u201d it was held that the provision for attorneys\u2019 fees related only to services in the court proceedings and not to those services rendered in connection with the hearing before the arbitrators.  Similarly herein it must be held that the \u201ccosts of arbitration,\u201d which were to be borne equally by the parties, were limited to the actual costs of the arbitration and not to the court costs and fees of counsel thereafter incurred by reason of the court action to enforce the arbitration award. The arbitration ceased and ended with the award. The appeal from the order confirming it was no part of the arbitration. The issue of the right to attorneys\u2019 fees did not arise until' after the arbitrators concluded their hearing and after the award granted by them had been affirmed. Since the parties to this .action in their contract agreed that the court shall award the successful party reasonable counsel fees in the event that either party found it necessary to bring an action at Jaw to enforce its rights under the arbitrators\u2019 award, the [parties themselves invested the court with jurisdiction to allow reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Sehottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b146-6\">VAN DYKE, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZg\">I dissent. Unless speei\u00e1lly provided for by statute attorneys\u2019 fees are an element of damages ancillary to a cause of action to enforce some contractual right. <em>(Genis </em>v. <em>Krasne, </em>47 Cal.2d 241 [302 P.2d 289].) Like any other element of damages they must be pleaded when the party claiming the same first institutes court action to enforce his claims. <em>(Genis </em>v. <em>Krasne, supra.) </em>The right to recover attorneys \u2019 fees depends upon the contract in the particular ease and whether or not the contractual conditions antecedent to a valid claim for attorneys\u2019 fees are present is a proper issue to be submitted when the action is brought to enforce contractual rights. For instance, in the ease before us the agreement as to attorneys\u2019 fees made'it a condition precedent to recovery that the party claiming them had found it \u201cnecessary to bring an action at law to enforce its rights.\u201d It might well have been a disputed issue as to whether the application for a judgment confirming the arbitrators\u2019 award was necessary to the enforcement of the applicant\u2019s rights. Other affirmative defenses might exist. The right to attorneys\u2019 fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ought to have been pleaded and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees ought to have been requested as a part of the relief to be granted in the proceeding. That is the usual procedure and I see nothing in the situation here which justifies any exception to the general practice. As said in <em>Genis </em>v. <em>Krasne, supra, </em>page 246:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">\u201c. . . Such fees cannot be allowed a successful litigant without pleading and proof (or admission) that there is a contract provision for them. This is so whether the successful party is plaintiff [citing eases] or defendant . . .\u201d (See also <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Forington, </em>117 Cal. 219 [48 P. 1073], and <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>91 Cal. 518, 522 [27 P. 755].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I think that in order to recover attorneys\u2019 fees it was necessary for respondent herein to- tender the issue of its right to such fees as a part of the relief it claimed upon making its application to the court for a judgment confirming the-arbitrators\u2019 award. Not having done so it relinquished its right.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The failure of respondent to plead its right to attorneys\u2019 fees and demand appropriate relief in the trial court brings into play another well-settled rule of law, that of estoppel by judgment. A judgment concludes the parties as to all issues that are settled thereby and also as to those issues which might have been settled by the judgment had they been pleaded and presented to the court. <em>(Sutphin </em>v. <em>Speik, </em>15 Cal.2d 195, 202 [99 P.2d 652, 101 P.2d 497]; <em>Dobbins </em>v. <em>Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co., </em>22 Cal.2d 64, 70 [136 P.2d 572]; <em>Brunswig Drug Co. </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>55 Cal.App.2d 444, 449-450 [130 P.2d 758]; <em>De Hart </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>26 Cal.2d 829, 830-831 [161 P.2d 453].) The doctrines of res judicata and estoppel by judgment apply to proceedings in court in respect to arbitration. Section 1292 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides with respect to the judgment confirming the- award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201cThe judgment so entered lias the same force and effect, in all respects, as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in an action; and it may be enforced, as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The doctrine of res' judicata was applied in respect of a judgment rendered in connection with arbitration in <em>Goldkette </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 96, pages 98-99 [160 P.2d 145]. In this case, since the right to attorneys\u2019 fees could have, and as I have said ought to have, been tendered as an issue in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>main action when application was made for a confirmatory-judgment, the right to attorneys\u2019 fees stands as adjudicated against respondent. In that proceeding respondent could not withhold any proper issue nor split its deniands so as to retain the right to litigate in later proceedings. Akin to the foregoing are these further considerations. There was but one \u201caction at law\u201d begun and prosecuted by respondent. The fact that an appeal was taken did not and could not constitute a new action. Section 1049 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201cAn action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal, or until the time for appeal has passed ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As said in <em>Sharon </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>26 P. 337, 346 [11 Sawy. 290] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cThe effect of this provision appears to be that the judgment in the court below is only a step in the proceeding to a final judgment in the appellate court in c\u00e1se of an appeal, . . .\u201d (To the same effect see <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Nakano, </em>12 Cal.2d 711, 714 [87 P.2d 700, 121 A.L.R. 417].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Any suggestion that because a plaintiff does not lmow an appeal will be taken he need not make or cannot make claim thereto until an appeal is in fact taken was rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Genis </em>v. <em>Krasne, supra, </em>at page 248, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c. . . It is lessor\u2019s position that when the litigation concluded in their favor in the trial court they could only present evidence of services which had been rendered up to that time; they could not anticipate whether there would be an appeal and what attorneys \u2019 services would be required if there were. There is no such practical difficulty, for when costs are awarded on appeal, the memorandum of costs on appeal is fixed and taxed in the trial court . . . , and if a party is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal, they can be determined by trial court when it determines the costs on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">I would reverse the judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees with directions to the trial court to enter judgment that respondent is not entitled to recover such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 11, 1959.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
