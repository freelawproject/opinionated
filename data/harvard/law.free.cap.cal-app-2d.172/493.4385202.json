Rogers, from the judgment entered following a verdict for defendant in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>for wrongful death brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. (45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Rogers was an employee of defendant, foreman of a switching crew. On April 13, 1956, while riding on the stirrup of a moving flat car loaded with lumber, he was crushed to death between this car and another flat car located on an adjacent track.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Norman, a switchman on Rogers\u2019 crew, witnessed the accident and testified as to the following facts concerning the switching operation which resulted in the accident. One of respondent\u2019s engines at its Bayshore yards was connected with three flat cars, two containing precut lumber and one containing plasterboard. One of the lumber cars was coupled to the engine and the plasterboard car was the third or last in line. The task for the switching crew was to reverse the order of the cars and to position the plasterboard car next to the engine. To accomplish this the plasterboard car was to be \u201ckicked\u201d into track 89 and the two lumber cars into track 87 (a car is \u201ckicked\u201d when it is pushed by the switch engine until it reaches a desired speed and then uncoupled and permitted to roll). The plasterboard car was kicked and it stopped short of track 89 almost \u201cfouling\u201d or partially blocking passage on track 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Rogers was standing by the track 87 switch approximately 120 feet from Norman. He called to Norman,\u2018 \u2018Will it clear ? \u2019\u2019 and Norman, after checking in the customary manner replied, \u201cYes, but it will be close.\u201d Rogers then gave the \u201ckick\u201d sign which Norman relayed to the engineer, the engine proceeded to back up and the pin was pulled uncoupling the two lumber ears. After the cars passed Rogers at the 87 switch, he threw the switch and then ran about 70 feet after the cars and jumped on the rear end of the first car. At this time the front of the first car had already successfully cleared the \u201cfouling\u201d point. Rogers then stepped on the stirrup of the second car and rode about 25 to 30 feet before the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The two cars were traveling at a speed comparable to that of a fast walk and Norman, whose dut3&gt;- it was to jump on the ears and brake them if they were moving too rapidly, testified that he did not feel that they were moving too fast and that there was no necessity for riding the cars. As Rogers neared the plasterboard car he \u201chugged\u201d the side of the ear and continued the ride. At this point Norman could no longer see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Rogers and he never realized that Rogers would not clear the \u201cfouling\u201d point, although he \u201cknew it would be close.\u201d There was nothing blocking Roger\u2019s line of sight to the plasterboard car and approximately seven seconds elapsed from the time he boarded the car and the time the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Rogers was in charge of the switching operation. His signal \u25a0 started the engine, he threw the switch sending the ears onto the 87 track, he chose to use the \u201ckicking\u201d method rather than a \u201cshoving\u201d procedure which would insure exact placement of the ears; and it was not his duty to jump on the moving cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Norman measured the clearance in the conventional railroad manner by standing next to the nearest rail of the track adjacent to the plasterboard car. He extended his arms, and his hands did not touch the plasterboard car, indicating sufficient clearance for the lumber cars to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The engineer and the pin puller on Rogers\u2019 crew testified that Rogers directed the operation and made the signals and that the manner of conducting such an operation was entirely up to the foreman. The assistant general yardmaster testified that the determination of clearance as made by Norman was only for the purpose of ascertaining whether the cars would collide. It is commonly known throughout the railroad industry that such a measurement would not indicate that there would be sufficient additional clearance for a man hanging on the side of a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Appellant contends that the verdict was against the uncontradicted evidence and was contrary to law. To support this contention she asserts that Norman had the duty to warn Rogers of the danger. She also asserts that Norman was guilty of negligence as a matter of law in failing to warn Rogers of the insufficient clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">There was ample evidence to support an implied finding that the determination of clearance requested by Rogers pertained only to the cars. The procedure Norman used was standard and it was commonly understood by railroad men that such measurement was only for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was clearance for equipment. At the time when Rogers jumped on the moving ears Norman had not yet had the opportunity to make a decision as to whether the ears were traveling too fast. Approximately seven seconds later the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Cases are cited by appellant for the proposition that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act an employer is liable if its negligence played any part in causing the accident. <em>(Grand Trunk Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Boylen, </em>81 F.2d 91; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Suncook Valley R.R., </em>93 N.H. 400 [42 A.2d 733].) As respondent points out, the courts in those eases merely affirmed judgments for plaintiffs. Here the jury was properly instructed concerning the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act and the evidence supports the implied finding of no negligence on the part of respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Several of the claims of error apply only to the defense of contributory negligence. The jury was properly instructed that under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act the contributory negligence of an employee is not a complete defense but is merely a ground for diminishing the amount of recovery. <em>(Springer </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>145 Cal.App.2d 640 [302 P.2d 872] ; 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 53.)  In order to find its verdict for defendant under these instructions the jury must have found that defendant was guilty of no negligence which contributed as a proximate cause to decedent\u2019s death. Under such circumstances any error in the instructions or the admission of evidence relating solely to the decedent\u2019s contributory negligence cannot have been prejudicial to appellant. <em>(Tracy </em>v. <em>Terminal R. Ass\u2019n of St. Louis, </em>170 F.2d 635, 639-640.) This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to determine whether, as claimed by appellant, there was error in allowing one of defendant\u2019s employees to interpret a rule of the company relating to decedent\u2019s duty in performing the switching operation, in instructing that a violation of this rule by decedent would be negligence per <em>se, </em>or in allowing testimony concerning the amount of alcohol in decedent\u2019s blood and the effect thereof upon decedent. All of these matters, conceding they involved error, went only to the question of contributory negligence and could only have reduced the plaintiff\u2019s verdict if the jury had found that defendant was guilty of any actionable negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The jury was instructed that if there were two ways of performing the switching operation one of which was safe and the other fraught with risk of injury to decedent and the decedent voluntarily, without the choice being in any way dictated by the negligence of defendant, chose the unsafe and more dangerous way, \u201cand that such a choice was the sole proximate cause of his injuries,\u201d defendant would not be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The instruction cannot have been prejudicial to appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>In order to make it applicable the jury must find that the choice of the dangerous way was the \u201csole proximate cause of his injuries.\u201d If they found that the defendant\u2019s negligence was one of the proximate causes of the injury the instruction by its express terms would not apply since decedent\u2019s conduct would not then be the sole proximate cause. We must ascribe to the jury a reasonable knowledge of the meaning of the English language.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that certain actions of the trial judge prevented her from having a fair trial are not open to her since no objection was made at the time to the questioned conduct of the trial judge. (48 Cal.Jur.2d, Trial, \u00a7 392, p. 402.)  Alleged errors going only to the question of the amount of damages cannot have been prejudicial since the jury\u2019s verdict was for respondent. <em>(Cucuk </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 881, 887-888 [296 P.2d 7].)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Kaufman, P. J., and Draper, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 22, 1959.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
