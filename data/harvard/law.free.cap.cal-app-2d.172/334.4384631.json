(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 459.) They appeal from the judgments and from the denial of their motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">The evidence shows that on November 24, 1957, at about 12:15 a. m. the night watchman at 111 Sutter Building in San Francisco admitted appellants into the building and when he asked them to sign a register, each man indicated a gun tucked in his trouser band. The watchman was directed to take appellants to the 18th floor. On this floor appellants, using the watchman\u2019s keys, entered an office. The watchman was made to stand in a locker and appellant Warner \u201ccovered\u201d him with a revolver. He could not see Patterson but could hear the sound of drawers being opened and closed. Later the watchman was made to lie face down on the floor, his hands and feet were bound, and he was gagged with a towel. His wallet was taken by Patterson and his money was removed. Later it was discovered that offices on the 18th and 22d floors had been entered, drawers had been opened, and it appeared that someone had attempted to open file cabinets. When the police arrived at 2 a. m. they found appellants inside a walk-in refrigerator in the B-G Restaurant located in the building. At this time the watchman positively identified appellants as the men who forced their way into the building and robbed him. Two guns were found in the refrigerator, an automatic pistol in a mustard crock and a revolver in a pickle crock.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Appellants do not suggest that the evidence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>support the judgments nor do they indicate any <em>errors </em>occurring at trial. They point to the fact that the reporter\u2019s transcript was filed more than six months after the filing of their notice of appeal. The rules on appeal provide that the reporter\u2019s transcript shall be filed within 20 days after the filing of the notice of appeal and that such period may be extended for an additional 60 days. (Pule 35(b) and (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">With no citation of authority appellants assert that they should be released from prison because they have been deprived of their right to a speedy trial and appeal therefrom, \u201c. . . a right which is guaranteed to all citizens under the Constitutional provisions of due process and equal protection. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">There is clearly no merit to the contention. A similar argument was presented in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 197 [276 P.2d 188], and while the delay in filing the transcript was not so long the court said (p. 203): \u201c. . . the fact that there may have been some unjustified delay in preparing the transcript could have no bearing upon the validity of the matters which preceded the filing of the appeal or upon the merits of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Appellants contend also that they were denied due process of law in that their attorney at the trial did not represent their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">A reading of the record indicates that there is no merit to this assertion. Appellants cite the statements of their counsel to Warner, \u201cDon\u2019t be coy with me, Mr. Warner\u201d and \u201cWell, don\u2019t be coy, now.\u201d It is difficult to find anything \u201cdevastating\u201d to appellants in these two comments.  The following statement is cited to indicate prejudicial misconduct. \u201cAnd during that time, you owned bake shops in how many different locations and gone through some\u2014well, no\u2014how much time have you had with this so called robbery business ? \u2019 \u2019 The People objected and the question was stricken. It would seem clear that the attorney was attempting to be sarcastic. The questions prior to and after the one cited elicited testimony that since 1928, appellant Warner had owned and operated legitimate businesses and from 1928 until the day of his arrest he had been off work only three weeks. The statement could not have prejudiced Warner.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Appellants submit that there must have been other instances of misconduct that do not appear in the record. They cite statements of the trial judge, made outside the presence of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u20181 The Court : The motion for mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cAnd, at this time\u2014I do this with extreme regret, Mr. Dana, and with great reluctance\u2014I don\u2019t know what the difficulty is, but the jury has possibly some reason to wonder what causes your mannerisms before the jury. I know that they are blameless and I am not censuring you in any manner, whatever, but I have been bothered about the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\u201cMr. Dana: Has the jury made some comment!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">\u20181 The Court : Pardon!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\u201cMr. Dana : Has the jury made some comment!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">11 The Court : No, there has been no comment, at all, but I' have observed your demeanor, your manner and so forth; whether it is physical ailment or physical disability, or what it is, I do not know and I do not want to pass upon it at this time, but I am very anxious to see it does not prejudice your clients. But, I have to keep the case within bounds and I have to stop unnecessary eruptions of counsel and comments of counsel and I will do that whether the District Attorney is guilty or defense counsel is guilty, and I always have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">\u2018 \u2018 The motion for mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">\u201cMr. Dana: Well, if there is any knowledge of the Judge that the jury are prejudiced at this point-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">\u201cThe Court: There has been no comment, at all, made by the jury at all [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">\u201cMr. Dana: Well, I mean, anything to indicate that, then 1 think-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">\u201cThe Court: No, there is nothing at all, but it is only the impression that I have, myself, and I don\u2019t know, I have no reason to think that the jury shares the impression the Court has, but I am just telling you so I hope you will try and be circumspect, as conditions permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">\u201cMr. Dana: Well, your Honor, I try to be circumspect. I always try to fight my case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t mind your putting up a vigorous battle. You are making a splendid defense for your clients by conducting an able and vigorous cross-examination and direct examination, and I am not criticizing your legal ability, at all, I have the highest respect for you, Paul.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">\u201cMr. Dana: Well, with respect to any mannerism that I have displayed\u2014this could be on or off the record\u2014I would apioreciate you telling me and-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">\u201cThe Court: No, I will let it go. I have characterized it as far as T think is proper, for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-20\">\u201cMr. Dana: All right. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I think we understand one another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The trial judge did not consider that the actions of the attorney warranted the granting of a mistrial; in fact, he stated that \u201cYou are making a splendid defense ...\u201d  As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wein, </em>50 Cal.2d 383, 410 [326 P.2d 457] : \u201cThe handling of the defense by counsel of the accused\u2019s own choice will not be declared inadequate except in those rare cases where his counsel displays such lack of diligence and competence as to reduce the trial to a \u2018farce or a sham.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The proof of defendants\u2019 guilt was positive and complete and it is impossible in the state of this record to find any prejudice to appellants in any of the matters urged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Judgments and orders denying new trial affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Kaufman, P. J., and Draper, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 22, 1959.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
