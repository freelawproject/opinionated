The land of petitioners over which the easement is sought lies within the boundaries of the Los Angeles County Flood Control channel and is subject to an easement for flood control purposes. It is petitioners\u2019 contention that a riding .and hiking trail is neither a highway nor a road nor a park and that therefore is not a purpose as to which the power of eminent domain is given to the county under section 1238 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Petitioners\u2019 contention cannot be sustained.  Section 1238 of the Code of Civil Procedure was originally enacted in 1872. It then granted to counties the power to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property for use as \u201croads, streets and alleys.\u201d The word \u201croads\u201d is a generic term and <em>includes all public ways. (Fischer </em>v. <em>County of Shasta, </em>46 Cal.2d 771 at 774 [299 P.2d 222].) At the time of the original enactment of section 1238 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Webster\u2019s Dictionary Unabridged Edition of 1859 was the standard and accepted dictionary and in that work \u201croad\u201d was defined as <em>\u201can open way </em>or <em>public passage: . . . </em>and as a generic term which includes highways, streets and alleys.\u201d WTe must assume that the Legislature used the word \u201croad\u201d in accordance with its commonly understood meaning as set forth in the standard dictionary of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">We may take judicial notice that at the time the statute was first enacted, many roads and highways were but narrow lanes used exclusively by pedestrians, equestrians and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>horse-drawn vehicles and we cannot \"see how it can logically be maintained that although the motor vehicle has invaded the roads of today forcing the pedestrian and equestrian therefrom it has likewise deprived the governmental bodies of their power to take land for a public use limited to pedestrians and equestrians who were the only users of roads at the time the statute was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The alternative writ heretofore issued is discharged and a peremptory writ denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">White, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
