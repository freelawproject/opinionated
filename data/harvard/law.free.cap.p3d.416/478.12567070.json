Both D.G. and R.G. filed a motion to suppress their post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements regarding the sexual assault to a detective during an interview at their school. The juvenile court held an evidentiary hearing and denied the motion to suppress the post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements. Both interviews with the detective regarding the sexual assault were introduced at trial. D.G. and R.G. were adjudicated delinquent for committing aggravated sexual assault. The court of appeals certified the case to this court; we have jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 We hold that the juvenile court did not err in denying D.G.'s and R.G.'s motion to suppress their post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements. And, considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding their waivers, we hold that D.G. and R.G. knowingly and voluntarily waived their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights during the interview with the detective at their school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Near the beginning of the school year in 2013, two fourteen-year-old boys, D.G. and R.G. went over to another male friend's house after school. After receiving a phone call from R.G., the victim and her friend, also both fourteen years of age, took the bus and joined D.G. and R.G. at the friend's house. D.G., R.G., and the third friend drove to the bus stop to pick up the two girls. While at the house, R.G. held a box cutter to the victim's throat and engaged in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with the victim. D.G., the other boy in the room during the sexual assault, also engaged in nonconsensual oral sex with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 A few months later, the victim reported the sexual assault involving D.G. and R.G. to the West Valley City police. A West Valley City detective conducted individual interviews with D.G. and R.G. at their school in the school resource officer's office without a parent present for either minor. D.G. was interviewed first, and R.G.'s interview followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 At the beginning of D.G.'s interview, the detective told D.G. why he was there and described his role as a detective. He asked D.G.: \"You know what we do, right, police detectives? You know, we investigate things that may be crimes.\" The detective told D.G., \"I just have to let you know that you don't have to talk to me.\" He then recited the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights to D.G. without pausing to check for understanding until after the rehearsed speech. Following the warning, the detective informed D.G. that he could \"stop answering questions at any time and [he could] request counsel at any time during questioning.\" He asked D.G., \"Do you understand those rights?\" Then, the detective informed D.G. that he was not under arrest and he was not telling him anything to make him scared. The detective again asked, \"Having those rights in mind, can I let you know [why] I'm here, you want to talk to me, tell me what is going on?\" D.G. agreed to talk with the detective and eventually confessed to participating in non-consensual sex with the victim at the request of R.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 As R.G.'s interview began, the detective said to R.G.: \"The law makes sure and requires me to tell you what your rights are, okay?\" The detective then recited the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning to R.G. from memory. His recitation was without the intonation and inflections that normally gives meaning and nuance in verbal speech. The volume of his voice lowers, and he speaks quickly in a well-rehearsed speech. The detective then asked R.G. the following questions: \"Do you understand those rights?\" \"Having those rights in mind, can I talk to you?\" and \"Do you want to talk to me?\" R.G. then proceeded to talk to the detective, eventually confessing to actions that amount to aggravated sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 In February 2014, the state filed a petition in juvenile court alleging aggravated sexual assault against D.G. and R.G. based on testimony from the victim and the confessions obtained in these interviews. D.G. and R.G. each filed a Motion to Suppress Statements and Request for Evidentiary Hearing, arguing that their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waivers to the detective during the interviews at the school were not \"made knowingly and voluntarily in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Each later filed an amended motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The juvenile court held an evidentiary hearing regarding the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waivers and the motion to suppress. Both of the boys' mothers and the detective testified at the hearing. The juvenile court denied D.G.'s and R.G.'s motions to suppress their testimony given during their interviews with the detective, and the statements were later introduced at trial. The juvenile court found that the detective asked D.G. and R.G. questions to be sure they understood their rights and that D.G. and R.G. were honors students capable of understanding their rights, and held that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights waivers were valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 After a bench trial, the juvenile court adjudicated both D.G. and R.G. delinquent for committing aggravated sexual assault. D.G.'s sentence included state supervised probation, completion of an early intervention program, a five-day detention, a Sexual Behavior Risk Assessment (SBRA), 150 hours of community service, and a requirement to provide fingerprints, a photograph, and a DNA specimen. R.G.'s sentence included state supervised probation, 150 hours of community service, one day of detention, an SBRA, a requirement to provide fingerprints, a photograph, and a DNA specimen, a no-contact order with D.G., and completion of an early intervention program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.G. and\n   R.G. filed motions to stay their sentence and timely appealed. The record is silent on the court's decision regarding D.G.'s motion to stay. The juvenile court granted R.G.'s Motion to stay the SBRA, DNA sample, and fingerprinting pending appeal, but not the community service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 The issue now before this court is whether D.G. and R.G. knowingly and voluntarily waived their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights during the interview with the detective at their school. We hold that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings given to D.G. and R.G. were sufficient according to the standards this court and the United States Supreme Court have set, and that both D.G. and R.G. knowingly and voluntarily waived their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Accordingly, we hold that the juvenile court did not err in denying the motion to suppress their post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 \"We review for correctness a trial court's ultimate ruling regarding the validity of a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver, while 'granting some degree of discretion to the trial court because of the wide variety of factual settings possible.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The changes in the juvenile court system have led to improvements in constitutional protections for juveniles.

Recognizing the differences in adult and juvenile behavior and culpability, \"we employ a slightly different system of justice\" for each.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.

For example, juveniles are not entitled to a jury of their peers and consequences in the juvenile courts are \"measure[d] in part by the likelihood that a child's pattern of behavior can and will be modified in the direction of proper and acceptable behavior as a result\" of the designated consequences.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    MIRANDA\n   </em>\n   WAIVERS AND MINORS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 In\n   <em>\n    Haley v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that minors can be \"easy victim[s] of the law\" and cannot be \"judged by the more exacting standards of maturity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"365086\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/596/#p599\">\n    332 U.S. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"365086\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/596/#p599\">\n    68 S.Ct. 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%20224\">\n    92 L.Ed. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948). Later, in\n   <em>\n    Fare v. Michael C.\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court imported a totality of the circumstances test regarding whether a minor is able to waive\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, constitutionalizing a standard regarding minors' rights to knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive their rights.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532114\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/707/#p724\">\n    442 U.S. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 724-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532114\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/707/#p724\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532114\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/707/#p724\">\n    61 L.Ed.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 In Utah, the process of determining whether juveniles are capable of knowingly and voluntarily waiving their rights begins with Utah Rule of Juvenile Procedure 27A, which governs the admissibility of statements given by minors without a parent or legal custodian present. When the minors are under 14, the presumption is that they are not capable of waiving their rights without a parent figure present under rule 27A(a)(1). Since both minors in this case were at least 14, we focus on rule 27A(a)(2), which states that \"if the minor is 14 years of age or older, the minor is presumed capable of knowingly and voluntarily waiving the minor's rights without the benefit of having a parent, guardian, or legal custodian present during questioning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only after this determination\n   do we proceed to the totality of the circumstances test to determine whether\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights were validly waived by a minor as outlined in\n   <em>\n    State v.

THE JUVENILE COURT DID NOT ERR IN DENYING THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS THE POST-\n   <em>\n    MIRANDA\n   </em>\n   STATEMENTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21 The juvenile court held an evidentiary hearing on D.G.'s and R.G.'s motion to suppress their post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements. It addressed each of the seven factors to be considered in the totality of circumstances test in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law regarding the evidentiary hearing. We now address each factor for each defendant in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Totality of the Circumstances Supports that D.G. Knowingly and Voluntarily Waived His\n   </em>\n   Miranda\n   <em>\n    Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22 First, the juvenile court found D.G. to be 15 years of age. There is nothing about D.G.'s age alone that overcomes his waiver. Additionally, D.G. affirmed that he understood his rights when asked by the detective. The court further found that there was \"no evidence that [D.G.] did not understand the Detective,\" nor was there any evidence that \"he was confused or scared.\" D.G. did not provide any evidence to rebut his affirmative statement that he understood his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23 Second, as to D.G.'s intelligence, the juvenile court found that D.G. had \"straight A's in school [and was] an honor student.\" The court also found that D.G. was of \"above average intelligence.\" Nothing from these findings weighs against D.G.s ability to intelligently waive his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24 Third, when considering education, the juvenile court found that D.G.'s education level was \"appropriate for his age\" and there was no evidence that \"he ha[d] any learning or mental disabilities.\" D.G. also \"read at a ninth grade or even higher level.\" These\n   facts do not give any cause for concern regarding D.G.'s education that would weigh against his ability to knowingly waive his rights under the totality of the circumstances test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25 Fourth, the juvenile court found that D.G. had no prior experience with law enforcement or the court system. While this weighs against his ability to knowingly waive his rights, this factor alone is not enough to overcome the weight of the other factors that indicate a valid waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 26 Fifth, as to D.G.'s ability to comprehend the meaning and effect of his statements, the juvenile court also found that D.G. \"understood his rights.\" Additionally, there is no evidence that during the interview D.G. was scared or confused or felt intimidated in any way so as to impair his comprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 27 Sixth, no coercive tactics were used by the officer during the interview. The juvenile court found that the detective asked D.G. questions to be sure he understood his rights. Specifically, the detective asked D.G. \"Do you understand those rights?\" \"Does that make sense?\" \"Can I let you know why I'm here? You want to talk to me, tell me what is going on?\" The detective also informed D.G. that he could stop answering questions at any time and request an attorney at any time during the interview. Additionally, the detective told D.G. that he was not telling him his rights \"to make him scared\" and that he was not under arrest. We find no evidence in the record that any intimidation tactics or coercion by the detective would invalidate D.G.'s waiver. The interview was relatively short and occurred at a place that was familiar to D.G.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no evidence of any threats or promises in exchange for speaking to the detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 28 Last, we consider the fact that D.G. did not have a parent, legal guardian, or attorney present during the interview with the detective. D.G. did not ask for a parent or attorney to be present during the interview even though D.G. was informed he could have an attorney present. As we have previously stated, \"while the presence of a parent or an attorney is a factor that should be considered by the court, it is not determinative, and the lack thereof does not make the waiver invalid per se.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

D.G. did not offer adequate evidence that would counter a finding that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights. Considering the totality of the circumstances including D.G.'s age, intelligence, ability to comprehend the questions asked by the detective after giving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and lack of coercive tactics used by the detective, we hold that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 30 Further, D.G. did not \"overcome by a preponderance of the evidence\" the presumption in rule 27A that D.G. is \"capable of knowingly and voluntarily waiving [his] rights without the benefit of having a parent, guardian, or legal custodian present during questioning.\" UTAH R. JUV. P. 27A. The juvenile court did not err in denying D.G.'s motion to suppress his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements to the detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Totality of the Circumstances Support that R.G. Knowingly and Voluntarily Waived His Miranda Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31 First, the juvenile court found that R.G. was 15 years of age, and that \"the\n   law clearly provides that a juvenile 14 or older can be interviewed without a parent,\" (citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Bybee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11506853\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/1/1087/\">\n    2000 UT 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11506853\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/1/1087/\">\n    1 P.3d 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly, without further evidence to the contrary, R.G.'s age by itself does not overcome the finding by the juvenile court that his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 32 Second, as to R.G.'s intelligence, \"all the evidence would indicate that R.G. is of average intelligence.\" No evidence was presented to indicate that he had any learning disabilities or was failing any classes. Nothing about R.G.'s intelligence weighs in favor of invalidating his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33 Third, we consider R.G.'s education. All evidence indicates that he has the \"appropriate education level of a fifteen-year-old.\" There is nothing in the record to indicate that he is in any resource or special classes or that there is any cause for concern regarding his education level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 34 The fourth factor is R.G.'s experience with law enforcement or the court system. R.G. has had no prior experience with law enforcement or the court system. However, this alone does not outweigh the other factors that favor a holding of validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 35 Fifth, as to R.G.'s ability to comprehend the meaning and effect of his statements, the juvenile court found that R.G. \"understood his rights.\" There is no evidence that R.G. was confused or scared during the interview. As the juvenile court found, R.G. answered the detective's questions affirmatively, that he understood his rights, and that he indicated that he wished to speak with the detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 36 Sixth, no coercive tactics were used by the officer during the interview. The juvenile court found that the detective asked R.G. four questions to be sure he understood his rights. Specifically, the detective told R.G.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The law makes sure and requires me to tell you what your rights are, okay? Not to scare you. It doesn't mean you're under arrest. You're not going anywhere. The law just says if I want to talk to you, I just have to tell you that, I'm required to do that. So that's what I'm going to do first, okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Then after giving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, the detective asked, \"Do you understand those rights?\" \"Having those rights in mind, can I talk to you?\" \"Do you want to talk to me?\" Nothing in the record indicates that the detective threatened R.G. in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 37 Seventh, we consider the fact that R.G. did not have a parent, legal guardian, or attorney present during the interview with detective. R.G. did not ask for a parent or attorney to be present during the interview even though R.G. was informed he could have an attorney present. The state also met its burden of showing that the waiver was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given in R.G.'s case. R.G. did not provide evidence that would counter a finding that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights. Considering the totality of the circumstances including R.G.'s age, intelligence, ability to comprehend the questions asked by the detective after giving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and lack of coercive tactics used by the detective, we hold that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 38 The State met its burden of showing that the waiver was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given in this case. R.G. did not offer adequate evidence to counter a finding that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights. Considering the totality of the circumstances including R.G.'s age, intelligence, ability to comprehend the questions asked by the detective after giving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, and the lack of coercive tactics used by the detective, we hold that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 39 Further, R.G. did not \"overcome by a preponderance of the evidence\" the presumption in rule 27A that R.G. is \"capable of knowingly and voluntarily waiving [his] rights without the benefit of having a parent, guardian, or legal custodian present during questioning.\" UTAH R. JUV. P. 27A. The juvenile court also did not err in denying R.G.'s motion to suppress his post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements to the detective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 40 Although the interviews conducted by the detective might not be a model of best practices regarding the delivery of\n   the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to a minor and the inquiry into the juvenile's understanding of his rights,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   we hold that under the totality of the circumstances including the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were sufficient in these cases. The juvenile court did not err in denying D.G.'s or R.G.'s motions to suppress their post-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements to the detective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence surrounding the totality of the circumstances shows that both D.G. and R.G. knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights during their interviews with the detective at their school.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We emphasize that although our conclusion that the waiver in these cases was knowing and voluntary, this holding should not be read to foreclose the ability of juveniles in future cases to advance both case-specific and general evidence and argument, including expert testimony, to show either that they did not knowingly and voluntarily waive their rights or that the test we employ to assess the validity of a juvenile waiver is scientifically flawed and in need of modification or overhaul.

However, antithetical policy issues arise when juveniles are bound over to criminal court and tried as adults or receive consequences that last beyond their juvenile years (such as mandatory sex offender status).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 78A-6-602(3), -701 through -704 (describing when juveniles may be or must be removed from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and transferred to a district court in Utah);\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . \u00a7 77-41-102(17)(f) (describing juveniles who qualify as \"[s]ex offender[s]\"). Without the protective umbrella of the juvenile court in these cases especially, \"admissions and confessions of juveniles require special caution,\" because \"a mere child\" is \"an easy victim of the law.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Gault\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333627\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/1/#p45\">\n     387 U.S. 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 45,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333627\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/1/#p45\">\n     87 S.Ct. 1428\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333627\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/1/#p45\">\n     18 L.Ed.2d 527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1967) (citation omitted).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Pierce,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 2, at 205-11, 217 (noting the research supporting the inability of children to voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive their\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    rights and advocating for \"a fixed procedural requirement that juveniles must first consult with an attorney before making a valid waiver\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
