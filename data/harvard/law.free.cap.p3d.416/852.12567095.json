We hold under the Arizona Child Support Guidelines, Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 25-320 app. (\"Guidelines\"), if a parent requesting a modification of child support under the simplified procedure presents a colorable claim that application of the Guidelines results in a fifteen percent variation from the current child support order, claim preclusion does not prevent a superior court from addressing the request on the merits. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mother and Damian Birnstihl (\"Father\") divorced in 2011. They have four children in common. In the divorce decree, the superior court awarded Mother and Father joint legal decision-making and equal parenting time of their two younger children. However, the court awarded Mother sole legal decision-making of their two older children, with no parenting time awarded to Father. Consistent with the Guidelines, the superior court ordered Father to pay Mother $1850 per month in child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In April 2016, Father petitioned to modify child support (\"April 2016 petition\") under the Guidelines \u00a7 24(B) (Simplified Procedure), seeking a downward modification of his child support obligation to $939.62 per month due to: (1) the oldest child's emancipation; (2) Father's satisfaction of his spousal maintenance obligation; and (3) Mother's\n   change in income. Mother did not request a hearing or otherwise respond to Father's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guidelines \u00a7 24(B) (\"If the requested modification is disputed, the parent receiving service must request a hearing within 20 days of service.\"). In June 2016, the superior court modified Father's child support obligation to $939.62 per month (the \"Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Ten days after the court entered the Order, Mother, representing herself, requested a hearing and counter-petitioned requesting that Father pay $1160.15 per month in child support. The court never ruled on Mother's untimely request for a hearing, nor the counter-petition, meaning they are deemed denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mother argued the Order was based on incorrect information regarding Father's gross income and his parenting time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 5, 11. She claimed Father had no parenting time with the oldest of the remaining minor children; therefore, he did not have equal parenting time as stated in the April 2016 petition. Mother also claimed Father's gross monthly income was $24,703.17, not $16,175.83 as listed by Father. Father responded to Mother's Rule 85(C) motion arguing that \"Mother had ample time to request a hearing if she did not agree to Father's calculations.\" The superior court denied the motion and Mother did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The same day Mother moved to correct the Order under Rule 85(C), she separately petitioned to modify child support using the simplified procedure per Guidelines \u00a7 24(B). Mother's petition to modify mirrored her arguments in the Rule 85(C) motion, namely, that the Order was premised on incorrect information concerning Father's income and parenting time. Mother requested that Father be ordered to pay $3005.27 per month in child support. Father moved to dismiss Mother's petition arguing that \"Mother's failure to comply with the rules and request a timely hearing bar her from the relief she now requests.\" Father further argued that incorrect information used in a child support calculation cannot support a finding that there has been a \"showing of changed circumstances that is substantial and continuing\" under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-503(E). The court dismissed Mother's petition, finding \"the allegations contained in [Mother's petition] do not allege a sufficient 'showing of changed circumstances that is substantial and continuing' as is required by A.R.S. \u00a7 25-503(E).\" Mother did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 In October 2016, Mother again petitioned to modify child support using the simplified procedure (\"October 2016 petition\"), requesting Father pay $2268.94 per month. In an attached child support worksheet, Mother listed Father's income as $20,000 per month based on Father's 2015 income tax return, which she attached as an exhibit to her petition. Mother listed Father's parenting time as 121 days. Father moved to dismiss Mother's petition, arguing there was no change of circumstances warranting modification from the Order or from the previously filed motion to modify filed in August.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. After oral argument, the superior court dismissed Mother's petition. Mother timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

She contends the superior court should have held a hearing because her petition \"contained allegations sufficient to show the difference between the [Order] and the amount as calculated and alleged in [her] petition differed by more than 15%.\" To support her claim, Mother points to Father's 2015 tax returns that were attached to her petition that show a discrepancy between Father's gross income and that used to calculate the Order. Also, Mother claims the superior court incorrectly calculated Father's parenting time because the amount credited to Father in the Order differed from the amount of parenting time awarded to Father in the parties' divorce decree. The parenting time order in the decree has not been modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 Father argues the superior court made findings in the Order on all relevant child support factors, including his income and parenting time, and that Mother cannot now argue there has been a substantial and continuing change in circumstances based on the numbers \"she prefers.\" Father maintains that, even if the factors listed in the Order are incorrect, no circumstances have changed since the court entered the Order and when Mother petitioned to modify child support, and thus the superior court correctly dismissed the petition. We construe Father's argument to be that Mother's petition to modify child support is barred by claim preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Accordingly, the parent seeking modification must present a colorable claim that there has been a change in relevant factors, or that an error occurred in determining the relevant factors, such that applying the Guidelines results in a fifteen percent variation from the current child support order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21 We acknowledge Mother failed to object or respond to Father's April 2016 petition, and we do not question the superior court's decision to enter the Order without holding a hearing or receiving evidence from Mother. We also note any modification to Father's child support obligation would be prospective only, as \"[m]odifications ... are effective on the first day of the month following notice of the petition for modification.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-327(A) (unless the court \"for good cause shown\" orders the modification to be effective at a different date not earlier than the date the petition was filed). Consequently, by not responding to Father's April 2016 petition or appealing the superior court's dismissal of Mother's earlier petitions to modify, Mother may receive less child support than she was entitled to for the months between when the superior court entered the Order and when Mother filed the October 2016 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22 Mother's subsequent petition sufficiently raised a colorable claim that application of the Guidelines results in a fifteen percent variation in Father's child support obligation. Therefore, the superior court erred by not holding a hearing to determine Father's correct income, parenting time, and whether his child support obligation should be modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Attorney's Fees and Costs on Appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23 Both parties request an award of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure (\"ARCAP\") 21(a) and (c) and A.R.S. \u00a7 25-324. Section 25-324 affords a court discretion to award a party reasonable attorney's fees based on the \"financial resources of both parties and the reasonableness of the positions each party has taken throughout the proceedings.\" In exercising our discretion, we award Mother her reasonable attorney's fees on appeal. As the prevailing party on appeal, Mother is also entitled to costs upon her compliance with ARCAP 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 24 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the superior court's dismissal of Mother's October 2016 petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Under the Guidelines in effect at the time Mother petitioned to modify child support, and under the Guidelines effective April 1, 2018, Father's child support obligation should reflect that he and Mother have multiple children with different parenting plans.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Guidelines \u00a7 11; Adoption of Revisions to the Arizona Child Support Guidelines, Administrative Order No. 2018-08, Guidelines \u00a7 16 (adopted Jan. 24, 2018).
