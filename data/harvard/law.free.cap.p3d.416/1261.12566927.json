Mr. Scholz challenges whether the labor arbitration presented an issue identical to any issue presented by his disability discrimination claim, argues that applying preclusive effect will work an injustice, and argues that the arbitrator's decision reveals an erroneous finding on a material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 As a matter of first impression, we hold that with one modification, three special considerations applied in determining whether facts determined in an administrative hearing have preclusive effect should also apply to facts determined in an arbitration hearing. Finding that all of the elements required to apply collateral estoppel are present, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Paul Scholz sued the Washington State Patrol (Patrol) for terminating his employment based on the results of an investigation of his involvement in a semitruck pileup on a winter morning in January 2012. Then-Officer Scholz had stopped his patrol vehicle in the right lane of westbound Interstate 90 (I-90) on Snoqualmie Pass in bad weather and had been speaking with the driver of a semitruck parked in the lane to his left. When he found himself at the front end of what quickly became a six-semitruck pileup, Officer Scholz was in fear for his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In his complaint for damages, Mr. Scholz alleges that within hours of the accident and despite his obvious emotional distress-later described by his expert as an acute anxiety disorder-he was taken to the Patrol's scale house and was questioned about the accident. His answers led to an accusation that he lied and to a formal investigation by the Patrol's Office of Professional Standards. Following completion of the Patrol's investigation, his employment was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mr. Scholz's complaint asserted a claim for disability discrimination in violation of chapter 49.60 RCW. A little less than a year after it was filed, the Patrol moved for summary judgment, contending that his discrimination claim was precluded by a 2014 labor arbitration determination that the Patrol terminated Mr. Scholz's employment for just cause. Mr. Scholz responded that the 2014 arbitration decision should not be given preclusive effect because the issue decided in the arbitration was not identical to issues presented by the lawsuit, and applying preclusive effect would work an injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 With the context framed, we delve into more detail about the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The labor arbitration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 At the conclusion of the Patrol's investigation of the pileup, it terminated Mr. Scholz's employment based on untruthfulness and violations of other Patrol rules. The Professional and Technical Employees Local 17 (Union) and Patrol's collective bargaining agreement (Agreement) provides in article 29 that permanent employees shall only be disciplined for \"just cause.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 77. \"Discipline\" as used in the Agreement includes discharges. Mr. Scholz's Union grieved the termination, which was denied. The Union and the Patrol then requested arbitration under the Agreement and mutually selected an arbitrator. Arbitration was conducted over four days. The following facts are taken from the arbitrator's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 In Mr. Scholz's position as a commercial vehicle officer for the Patrol, his main responsibility was to inspect and weigh vehicles at the Cle Elum scale house. In winter months, when snowy conditions required the use of tire chains, he was authorized to enforce chain requirements in the Snoqualmie Pass and Blewett Pass areas. As a limited authority officer, he was not empowered to enforce the rules of the road, such as citing drivers for speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Bad weather and bad road conditions existed on the morning of the pileup. Officer Scholz was sent out to conduct chain enforcement on I-90 in an area east of Snoqualmie Pass. He was specifically directed to watch\n   for drivers of trucks parked and chaining up improperly on the right shoulder of the westbound lanes and to instruct them to move a few miles ahead to a safer, designated chain-up area. He encountered two large semitrucks parked on the shoulder at a location that was a particularly dangerous place to chain up because it was approached on a curve, making it difficult for an approaching driver to see the semis until the driver was almost upon them. He turned on his emergency lights and came to a stop in the right lane next to the two stopped semis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 What happened as Officer Scholz approached the two semis and stopped was disputed. A semitruck with double trailers being driven by Rigoberto Flores-Garcia was traveling westbound at the same time as Officer Scholz, and there is some evidence that upon stopping and getting out of his vehicle, Officer Scholz flagged Flores-Garcia to stop. For whatever reason, Flores-Garcia did stop in the lane to the left of, and next to, Officer Scholz's vehicle, thereby blocking the second lane for westbound traffic. Leaving his motor running and his emergency lights flashing, Officer Scholz walked around the cab of the Flores- Garcia vehicle to tell him the road was extremely icy and he needed to slow down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 As Officer Scholz started to walk back toward his patrol vehicle, a fourth semitruck came along at high speed and crashed first into the patrol vehicle, and then into the two semitrucks on the shoulder before coming to a stop mostly in the right lane. Within moments or even seconds, two more westbound commercial vehicles came upon the scene and crashed into the four stopped vehicles, creating a massive pileup that totally blocked westbound traffic. Hearing the crashing sounds but with his visibility blocked by the cab of the Flores-Garcia truck, Officer Scholz-afraid of being hit and killed-ran to the safety of a snowbank in the median.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Trooper Darren Wright arrived on the scene within minutes of the collision and was told by Officer Scholz that he had parked in the right lane, next to the semitrucks parked on the shoulder, and that he had flagged the Flores-Garcia vehicle down for speeding. Asked how he was doing, Officer Scholz told Trooper Wright and other arriving officers that he was \"okay,\" \"not hurt,\" and was not injured, but the officers described Scholz as shaken up and \"kind of\" or \"a little bit\" in shock. CP at 35. When his immediate supervisor arrived, Officer Scholz was upset and crying and hugged her-an unusual gesture for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 Sgt. Kevin Overbay was dispatched from Wenatchee to investigate and arrived at the Cle Elum scale house a couple of hours after the accident, where he interviewed Officer Scholz. When Sgt. Overbay asked what had happened, Officer Scholz told the sergeant he had parked on the shoulder, behind the two semitrucks whose drivers were chaining up. He also told the sergeant that he had not flagged down Flores-Garcia but had merely signaled for Flores-Garcia to slow down by pumping his arms up and down, palms down. When Sgt. Overbay pressed Officer Scholz on whether he had stopped in the right lane of traffic, Officer Scholz said he had been \"completely on the shoulder.\" CP at 53. Officer Scholz's statements to the sergeant were overheard by others. Later that day, investigators at the scene reported to Sgt. Overbay that based on the tire marks, Officer Scholz's vehicle had been parked in the right lane, not on the shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 Within a few days after the pileup, Officer Scholz went to a medical clinic and saw a physician's assistant and a counselor. He had three counseling sessions with the counselor and within a few weeks of the pileup saw a psychologist, Dr. James W. Cole, who treated him for acute stress disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 Officer Scholz was placed on special assignment at home and an extensive investigation ensued. Officer Scholz was reinterviewed in May and September 2012. In the May interview, which took place after the investigation called into question his statements to Sgt. Overbay, Officer Scholz denied ever having told the sergeant that he parked on the shoulder. He admitted parking in the right lane. But he insisted that his position relative to Flores-Garcia had left ample room for travel between their vehicles, drawing a sketch to support his explanation. The arbitrator characterized Officer Scholz's description and depiction of I-90 and the vehicles'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   positions as \"clearly untruthful.\" CP at 58. Officer Scholz also insisted in the May interview that he was still inside his patrol vehicle when he merely motioned with a finger for Flores-Garcia to slow down, telling interviewers that Flores-Garcia decided to stop in a traffic lane on his own. He claimed not to recall having told Sgt. Overbay that he motioned Flores-Garcia to slow down by pumping his arms up and down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 In his final, September interview, Scholz stuck by his statements in May.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Investigators found violations by Officer Scholz of four regulations, the most serious being the prohibition of untruthfulness. Following a\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   predetermination hearing, the Patrol issued a final determination letter citing the same violations and terminating his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 Other matters were factually and legally at issue in the labor arbitration, but relevant for our purpose is only whether in deciding there was \"just cause\" for Officer Scholz's termination, the arbitrator necessarily determined that he had been intentionally untruthful in making false statements and that his evidence of a mental disorder did not explain or excuse the untruthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Since the parties' Agreement did not define \"just cause\" and the Patrol's process for determining just cause had not been negotiated with the Union, the arbitrator relied on labor arbitration common law, citing a currently favored four element test for just cause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. That the grievant had notice of the rules to be followed and the consequences of noncompliance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. That the grievant engaged in the misconduct of which he/she is charged;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. That there was procedural regularity in the investigation of the misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. That the employer applied the discipline in a reasonable and even-handed manner, considering the seriousness of the proven offense(s), the employee's disciplinary record and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, using progressive discipline when appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CP at 48 (emphasis omitted). The arbitrator explained that where untruthfulness was alleged, she would apply the standard of clear and convincing proof, \"because of the serious consequences of being accused of untruthfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 As summarized by the arbitrator, the Union's defense to the charge that Scholz was untruthful was that \"[his] state of mind after the traumatic event caused him to be unclear or mistaken in his explanations about what had happened.\" CP at 43. The arbitrator's decision recounts Dr. Cole as diagnosing acute anxiety disorder because of the trauma:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   He said such trauma can impact the individual's perception of the traumatic incident itself as well as his ability to communicate about the trauma. A traumatized individual may say things they wish they had been able to do or they may be somewhat confused about what had happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CP at 44. With a citation to the transcript of the arbitration hearing, she said that according to Dr. Cole, \"for Scholz, the intense anxiety symptoms lasted about a month. His condition finally abated just short of the point at which the diagnosis would have changed to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\" CP at 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 Mr. Scholz testified during the hearing that he had always dealt with a learning disability, dyslexia, and that it impaired his communication when under stress, which\n   might explain inconsistencies between what he told officers at the scene of the pileup and what he later told Sgt. Overbay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 Based on this evidence, the arbitrator concluded \"it was possible Scholz was still suffering from emotional trauma and confusion during the meeting at the scale house. It is possible that his memory was unintentionally inaccurate or he misspoke because of a life-long communication difficulty that became aggravated at that time because of stress.\" CP at 57. But the arbitrator found that self-serving inaccuracies in Officer Scholz's later interviews were not caused by anxiety, stress, or PTSD:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Clearly, however, the Grievant was no longer suffering from the stress of the incident on May 31, 2012, when he was interviewed. ... Dr. Cole had released him as a patient at least two months earlier without diagnosing long-term PTSD, because the Grievant's symptoms had ended within 30 days of the January 19 incident. In spite of the passage of time and the improvement in his emotional condition, however, Scholz seemed to dig in his heels and defend the inaccurate statements he had made to Sgt. Overbay on January 19, though he had had ample opportunity to reflect about the events and explain the entire incident truthfully to the interviewers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CP at 57-58 (citation omitted). She characterized his claim in May and September that he merely signaled with a finger from his patrol car that Flores-Garcia should slow down as \"carefully calculated to show that driver Garcia was responsible for the eventual roadblock and that Scholz did nothing that contributed to such blockage.\" CP at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 Among the arbitrator's articulated reasons for finding the Patrol had just cause for terminating Officer Scholz's employment were her factual determinations that Mr. Scholz had been intentionally untruthful in making statements and that his evidence of a mental disorder did not explain or excuse his untruthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    The summary judgment decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24 Having reviewed the parties' submissions on the matters addressed in the labor arbitration and heard the argument of counsel, the trial court granted the Patrol's motion to dismiss the disability discrimination claim. Mr. Scholz moved for reconsideration, arguing that the trial court mistakenly believed he was not suffering from PTSD at the time he gave his May and September statements. He pointed to the following statements made in a declaration he filed in opposition to summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Immediately following the incident I was disabled and suffering from PTSD, and continued to suffer during the investigation. I treated with Dr. James Cole, Ed.D. for one year due to the trauma I suffered and diagnosed me with Acute Stress Disorder and Anxiety Disorder. I was diagnosed with PTSD in October of that year by Dr. Freedman, and he recommended additional counseling for more months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [At the arbitration hearing, t]here was never any questioning or statements regarding the state of my disability during the times I was providing the statements, and whether the employer considered my disability at the time it adjudged me untruthful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   CP at 103-04. This is the only mention in the record on appeal of a \"Dr. Freedman.\" No evidence of Dr. Freedman or his opinions was presented in the labor arbitration hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25 The court considered but denied the motion for reconsideration. Mr. Scholz appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 Collateral estoppel, modernly referred to as issue preclusion, bars relitigation of an issue in a subsequent proceeding involving the same parties.\n   <em>\n    Ullery v.

Mr. Scholz concedes that only the first and fourth required elements are at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 Additional factors are considered when issue preclusion is based on the decision of an administrative agency, and Mr. Scholz argues they should also be considered when issue preclusion is based on the decision of an arbitrator. They are (1) whether the agency acted within its competence, (2) the differences between procedures in the administrative proceeding and court procedures, and (3) public policy considerations.\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217444\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/152/299/#p307\">\n    152 Wash.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20P.3d%20957\">\n    96 P.3d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Patrol disputes the factors' application to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 The three additional factors do not increase the showing required before applying issue preclusion, so much as they point to considerations relevant to the fourth required element (the \"injustice\" element) when the earlier proceeding was a nonjudicial administrative determination. Given relevant similarities between administrative hearings and arbitration, we largely agree that the factors should be considered here. In\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Hamed\n   </em>\n   , which held for the first time that a party to an arbitration proceeding may be precluded from relitigating the same issue in a subsequent lawsuit, this court described the preclusive effect of issues decided by an administrative agency as a \"closely analogous situation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1712165\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/62/92/#p98\">\n    62 Wash.

What matters is whether\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   established in the first proceeding foreclose the second claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20P.2d%20607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 33 Mr. Scholz also contends that the arbitrator \"\n   <em>\n    merely\n   </em>\n   found [he] was untruthful.\" Br. of Appellant at 17 (emphasis added). This is not true. Elements of \"just cause\" applied by the arbitrator called on her to assess whether the untruthfulness was culpable or excusable. The second and third elements of \"just cause\" required a finding of \"misconduct,\" and the fourth required a \"reasonable\" application of discipline, taking into account the seriousness of the offense and any mitigating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 34 Mr. Scholz attempts to persuade us that we cannot know whether the arbitrator affirmed his discharge based on innocent untruthfulness, arguing that she could have-whereas discharging him for an innocent, disability-caused, falsehood would be actionable discrimination. He points to the arbitrator's familiarity with the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 35 The\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rule requires prosecutors to disclose exculpatory evidence to criminal defendants, and exculpatory evidence includes whether an involved officer has a record of dishonesty. The arbitrator was familiar with the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rule and why it makes truthfulness especially important to the Patrol. Her decision even refers to an aphorism reportedly common in the Patrol workforce, \" 'If you lie, you die.' \" CP at 42. But despite the importance of the regulation forbidding untruthfulness, the arbitrator did not treat untruthfulness as an automatic basis for discharge, nor has it been treated as an automatic basis for discharging law enforcement officers in other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 36 In\n   <em>\n    Kitsap County Deputy Sheriff's Guild v. Kitsap County\n   </em>\n   , a case involving the discharge of a Kitsap County law enforcement officer, Division Two of this court vacated a labor arbitrator's determination, holding that ordering reinstatement of a mentally disabled officer who lied was contrary to public policy.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091993\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/140/516/#p526\">\n    140 Wash.

The Supreme Court reinstated the arbitrator's \"return to duty\" order, holding that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rule provides neither an explicit nor a well-defined public policy against reinstating an officer found to be untruthful.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 438,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=219%20P.3d%20675\">\n    219 P.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 37 Here, neither the parties nor the arbitrator treated untruthfulness as an automatic basis for being discharged from the Patrol. The Union advanced the defense that Officer Scholz was blameless for any untruthfulness resulting from trauma-induced anxiety. The arbitrator carefully weighed the evidence of mental disability and found that it could excuse the officer's untruthfulness when first questioned by Sgt. Overbay. Whether Officer Scholz's untruthfulness was intentional or whether it was the result of a mental disorder was not only material, it was the most material disputed issue in the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 38 Turning to the proof required for Mr. Scholz's disability discrimination claim, he would have to show that he was (1) disabled, (2) subject to an adverse employment action, (3) doing satisfactory work, and (4) discharged under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Brownfield v. City of Yakima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347944\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/178/850/#p873\">\n    178 Wash.

CP at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 40 And Mr. Scholz failed to present prima facie evidence of the fourth element: that he was discharged under circumstances raising a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination. His discharge for untruthfulness cannot raise such an inference given the\n   binding determination that he was discharged for just cause. He offered no other evidence that his mental health disorder gave rise to a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 41 Because facts determined in the arbitration make it impossible for Mr. Scholz to establish essential elements of a disability discrimination claim, the required identity of issues is present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 42 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 43 The remainder of this opinion has no precedential value.

We are concerned only with the arbitrator's final, binding factual determinations. Our reason for noting citations to the transcript is that Mr. Scholz argues on appeal that the arbitrator's decision is ambiguous as to whether Dr. Cole diagnosed him with PTSD. Her decision is not ambiguous. Her use of only the single citation to the transcript contributes to the clarity of her finding that Dr. Cole never diagnosed PTSD.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <em>\n     Brady v.
