A confidential informant (CI) told a police officer that he had bought marijuana from a man he knew only as \"Mike\" in Mike's house. In exchange for leniency on pending criminal charges, the CI agreed to make a controlled buy. After the CI completed the controlled buy, the officer submitted an affidavit to establish probable cause for a warrant to search Mike's house. The warrant was signed by a magistrate and executed by police. Mike's house was occupied by defendants Michael Rowan and Rebecca George. The police found drugs, drug paraphernalia, buy-owe sheets, firearms, and a large amount of cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mr. Rowan and Ms. George moved under the state and federal constitutions to suppress the result of the search, challenging the magistrate's probable cause determination. The district court found that there was no probable cause, but it also determined that the federal good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied. Defendants moved again to suppress the evidence, this time arguing that it should be excluded under article I, section 14 of the Utah Constitution. The court suppressed the evidence under the state constitution, concluding that the state constitution contains an exclusionary rule, but does not include a good faith exception. The State dismissed the charges due to lack of evidence and appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 3 On appeal, we are asked to consider (1) whether there was a substantial basis for the magistrate's probable cause determination; (2) whether this court recognized an exclusionary rule under article I, section 14 of the Utah Constitution in\n   <em>\n    State v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v. Larocco\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) if we did recognize an exclusionary rule under the Utah Constitution, whether there should be a good faith exception. Because we conclude that there was a substantial basis for the magistrate's\n   probable cause determination and that therefore the evidence should not have been suppressed, we do not reach the questions of whether we have recognized an exclusionary rule under article I, section 14 of the Utah Constitution or whether there should be a good faith exception to such a rule. We therefore reverse the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 A confidential informant (CI) reported to a Springville City police officer that a man whom the CI knew only as \"Mike\" was in possession of marijuana and would sell it to the CI. The CI told the officer that he had been in Mike's home and purchased drugs from Mike before. The CI also told the officer that Mike sold marijuana in bulk and \"his product [was] vacuum sealed\"; that Mike traveled to California to obtain marijuana to sell in Utah; that Mike kept the marijuana inside his house, although the CI did not know where; that Mike was a master of martial arts; and that the CI had heard Mike talking about firearms and he believed Mike had a firearm in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5 The police officer tried to determine Mike's identity, but record checks on the residence, registration checks on vehicles, and inquiries to other agencies were unsuccessful. He then proposed that the CI assist in a controlled buy of marijuana from Mike, in exchange for leniency on the CI's pending criminal charges. The CI agreed to participate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6 Before the controlled buy, police searched the CI and found no illegal items. Then, in the presence of the police, the CI called Mike and arranged to buy a specific amount of marijuana for a specific amount of money. After receiving the money for the buy from the police, the CI drove in his own car to Mike's residence. The police did not search the CI's car, but kept the car and the CI in \"visual sight at all times.\" The CI drove directly to Mike's house and went inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 After a short time had passed, the CI left the residence and drove to a predetermined location to meet with the affiant police officer. The CI reported that after he entered Mike's house, he used the money given to him by the police to buy marijuana from Mike. The police searched the CI and found the agreed-upon amount of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8 The police officer prepared an affidavit, which presented both the information about \"Mike\" conveyed to him by the CI and the details of the controlled buy. Relying on the police officer's affidavit, a magistrate issued a warrant authorizing the search of a Provo residence, the home of defendants Michael Rowan and Rebecca George.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 After securing the warrant, police searched the defendants' home and found over four pounds of marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, drug paraphernalia, buy-owe sheets, more than $3,600 in cash, an assault rifle, and a handgun. The drugs and related paraphernalia were found throughout the home and were easily accessible to the defendants' minor child, who was living in the home and present when the police entered the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 Mr. Rowan was charged with (1) distributing marijuana in a drug-free zone, a second degree felony; (2) possessing marijuana with intent to distribute in a drug-free zone while having a prior drug-related conviction, a first degree felony; (3) possessing or using psilocybin mushrooms in a drug-free zone while having a prior drug-related conviction, a first degree felony; (4) possessing a firearm as a restricted person, a third degree felony; (5) possessing drug paraphernalia in a drug-free zone, a class A misdemeanor; and (6) endangering a child, a third degree felony. Ms. George was charged with endangering a child, a third degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 At the district court, Defendants argued under the Fourth Amendment that the warrant was not supported by probable cause and moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search of their home. In response, the State argued that the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause, but even if he did not, that the evidence should not be suppressed under the federal good faith exception, which allows for admission of evidence when police reasonably rely on a magistrate's incorrect finding of probable cause. The district court concluded that the magistrate incorrectly determined\n   that the warrant was supported by probable cause, but the court applied the federal good faith exception and did not suppress the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 Defendants filed a \"motion to address [the] good faith exception under [the] Utah Constitution,\" arguing that the federal good faith exception \"is prohibited by the Utah State Constitution.\" The State argued in response that there is no basis for an exclusionary rule under the Utah Constitution and, even if there were, a state exclusionary rule should include a good faith exception analogous to the federal exception. Relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court concluded that a state exclusionary rule is required under the state constitution, but that \"there is no good faith exception to the exclusionary rule under article I, section 14\" of the Utah Constitution. The court granted Defendants' motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search of their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 On the State's motion, the district court dismissed the charges against Defendants on the ground that the suppression of evidence substantially impaired the State's cases. The State timely appealed both cases. This court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(i) in Mr. Rowan's case and Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(b) in Ms. George's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 We review a district court's assessment of a magistrate's probable cause determination for correctness and ask whether the court erred in concluding that the magistrate did not have a substantial basis for a determination of probable cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 The State argues that the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause and that the district court did not afford the magistrate's probable cause determination \"great deference,\" but \"reviewed the probable cause affidavit de novo.\" Defendants argue that the district court correctly concluded that the affidavit did not establish a substantial basis for probable cause, pointing to the court's consideration of the \"CI's lack of credibility, the officer's failure to corroborate any of [the CI's] claims, and the complete lack of control over the buy.\" We agree with the State that the district court did not give the magistrate appropriate deference and that the affidavit provided a substantial basis for the magistrate's determination of probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 \"Where a search warrant supported by an affidavit is challenged as having been issued without an adequate showing of probable cause, our review focuses on the\n   magistrate's probable cause determination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"We afford the magistrate's decision 'great deference' and consider the affidavit relied upon by the magistrate 'in its entirety and in a common[ ]sense fashion.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court has \"consistently employed\" the totality of the circumstances analysis set forth by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Gates\n   </em>\n   to evaluate probable cause:\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \"veracity\" and \"basis of knowledge\" of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[A]n informant's 'reliability' and 'basis of knowledge' are but two relevant considerations, among others, in determining the existence of probable cause under 'a totality-of-the-circumstances.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The indicia of veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge are nonexclusive elements to be evaluated in reaching the practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances, there is a fair probability that the contraband will be found in the place described.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 \"[W]hen a search warrant is issued on the basis of an affidavit, that affidavit must contain specific facts sufficient to support a determination by a neutral magistrate that probable cause exists.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Probable cause cannot \"be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant's or an informer's belief that probable cause exists without detailing any of the 'underlying circumstances' upon which that belief is based.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But \"where [underlying] circumstances are detailed, where reason for crediting the source of the information is given, and when a magistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining whether an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, \"the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 In this case, the district court did not afford the magistrate \"great deference\" and instead read the affidavit \"in a hypertechnical, rather than commonsense, manner.\" The court began by finding that the buy was not controlled, because police failed to search the CI's car before and after the buy. Based on this finding, the court concluded that the police had failed to corroborate the CI's information. This in turn negated the CI's personal knowledge of Mike and his implication of himself in criminal activity, as the court reasoned, \"these factors standing alone-without independent corroboration-cannot in this Court's view give rise [to] a finding of probable cause.\" Accordingly, the district court concluded that the affidavit did not establish probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 We disagree. When considered \"in its entirety and in a common sense fashion,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the affidavit is sufficient to support the magistrate's determination of probable cause that contraband would be found at Mike's house. The affidavit was not conclusory, but contained specific facts, detailing both the underlying circumstances and the affiant officer's reasons for crediting the CI's information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The underlying circumstances included the following: the affiant officer had met the CI within 72 hours of preparing the affidavit; the CI had told the officer that an individual known to the CI as Mike sold marijuana in bulk and \"his product [was] vacuum sealed\"; Mike traveled to California to obtain marijuana to sell in Utah; Mike kept the marijuana inside his house, although the CI did not know where; the CI had heard Mike talking about firearms and he believed Mike had a firearm in the house; Mike was a master of martial arts; and Mike lived with his girlfriend and their minor child. The officer credited the information given to him by the CI for these reasons: the CI had \"made drug purchases\" from Mike; the CI was \"familiar with drug distribution and drug practices\"; and the CI would receive leniency for pending charges for participating in the controlled buy. The affiant officer further concluded that by implicating himself in criminal activity, the CI bolstered his reliability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 The affidavit also detailed the affiant officer's attempts to corroborate the CI's information by checking records, vehicle registrations, and requesting information from other agencies. When those attempts to corroborate proved fruitless, the officer arranged the controlled buy to corroborate the CI's information. And although the controlled buy may not have been perfectly executed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   police sufficiently controlled the buy through the following measures: the police searched the CI before the buy; they supervised the CI's call to Mike; the CI arranged to purchase a specific amount of marijuana for a specific amount of money at Mike's residence; the police gave the CI the agreed upon amount of money; the CI drove his own car to Mike's residence, but police followed him, maintaining \"visual sight at all times\"; the CI entered Mike's residence and was shortly seen leaving Mike's residence; the police again followed the CI as he drove his own car; the CI drove to a prearranged location to meet with the affiant officer; the CI had the agreed-upon distributable amount of marijuana in his possession; and the police again searched the CI, finding no additional illegal items. Even if under best practices the police should have searched the car before and after the controlled buy, this does not negate the magistrate's finding of probable cause. The totality of the circumstances, as presented in the affidavit, was sufficient to give rise to probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 We conclude that the magistrate had a substantial basis to determine there was probable cause based on the affidavit's description of the information the CI reported to the police and the results of the controlled buy. The judgment of the district court is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Justice Himonas\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22 I concur in full in Chief Justice Durrant's excellent opinion.

In his view, even when a case can be decided on narrower grounds, there is little reason to avoid revisiting constitutional questions made by past iterations of this court-at least where doing so will \"[de]constitutionaliz[e] a remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. This is because, in the Associate Chief Justice's view, constitutional restraint-what he calls \"constitutional avoidance\"-is premised on concern about insulating \"constitutional decision[s] ... from review or reconsideration by the political branches of our government.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. Put another way, the Associate Chief Justice\n   largely conceives of constitutional avoidance as what we might call \"the presumption against recognizing constitutional rights.\" In his view, courts should avoid taking up constitutional questions only if they think those questions might result in the extension or entrenchment of constitutional rights. But they should not let norms of constitutional avoidance-or restraint-stand in their way if they are tempted to walk back (or not recognize) constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 I disagree. The Associate Chief Justice is surely right that one consideration underlying constitutional avoidance is that, when we take up a constitutional question, we will potentially interfere with the elected branches' policymaking power. But this is not the sole value underlying our reluctance to revisit constitutional issues. We have already reviewed many of these considerations: respect for the wisdom of prior courts (especially when those courts have undertaken the awesome responsibility of interpreting our constitution), a commitment to stability, and judicial restraint. Yet another consideration is simple humility: hard problems call for percolation. Absent an extended process of reflection and analysis, our decision may well \"be the product of initial inadvertence made difficult to dislodge by precedents based upon the initial inadvertence.\"\n   <em>\n    Hinkle v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2101215\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/244/267/\">\n    244 Or. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2101215\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/244/267/\">\n    411 P.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (1966) (Denecke, J., specially concurring). As Justice Brandeis noted in\n   <em>\n    Ashwander\n   </em>\n   , aside from \"[c]onsiderations of propriety,\" \"long-established practice\" militates against \"passing upon the constitutionality of an act ... unless obliged to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashwander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929479\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/297/288/#p346\">\n    297 U.S. at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929479\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/297/288/#p346\">\n    56 S.Ct. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Brandeis, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is yet another reason to avoid revisiting our constitutional precedents unless necessary. When a practice of restraint is durable-when it has survived several turns of the wheel-a wise humility counsels against discarding it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 The Associate Chief Justice accepts much of my framework for the exercise of judicial restraint.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. But he thinks\n   <em>\n    Larocco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thompson's\n   </em>\n   recognition of a state exclusionary rule was such an egregious misstep that this is the rare case in which we should revisit our precedent notwithstanding the fact that this case presents an uncontroversial alternative basis for decision. In the Associate Chief Justice's view, open questions about the scope of the state exclusionary rule are \"fostering uncertainty and litigation in the lower courts\" to such a degree that we should reach out and repudiate our precedents unnecessarily.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 The Associate Chief Justice's position collapses on itself. If the state exclusionary rule really does present that rare case where there is such a pressing need to revise our doctrine that we ought to bypass a clear, narrow, alternative basis for decision to reach it, then there will surely come a case soon that we will have to resolve on state exclusionary grounds. And that will present the proper occasion for reconsidering our precedent. And if that case doesn't come before us soon? Then that is strong reason to think that the Associate Chief Justice's urgent workability concerns are overblown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 30 Finally, consider what would happen if we did reach out and repudiate the state exclusionary rule here. If we were to repudiate the state exclusionary rule, we would create a policy void: a void that would have to be filled by our courts' exercising their common law authority unless and until the legislature chose to intervene. Thus, absent quick and comprehensive legislative intervention, we would, at best, be exactly where we were before we rejected the state exclusionary rule. And litigants (and the police) might be in an even worse position from the perspective of predictability: uncertain of both the nature of the remedy for search-and-seizure violations (suppression, monetary damages, something else?)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the applicability of any exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31 In my view, prudence, practice, and humility all argue against revisiting our constitutional precedents unnecessarily. The Associate Chief Justice is certainly right that revisiting those precedents would promote\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   interest here-freeing up space for policymaking by the elected branches. But it would do so at the cost of judicial norms and judicial humility. Therefore, I believe it would be imprudent for us to reach the constitutional question in this case. The state\n   exclusionary rule was first recognized over twenty-five years ago in\n   <em>\n    State v. Larocco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10381656\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/794/460/\">\n    794 P.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1990), and it was then reaffirmed, a year later, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   is \"a cornerstone of Anglo-American jurisprudence that is crucial to the predictability of law and the fairness of adjudication,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But that time and case should arise organically and within established norms. And, in my view, proper respect for the principles underlying judicial restraint, constitutional avoidance, and\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   tells us that today is not the time and this is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Associate Chief Justice Lee\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 33 The majority reverses the district court's decision suppressing evidence secured under a search warrant signed by a magistrate and executed by the police. It does so on the ground that there was a substantial basis for the magistrate's determination that there was probable cause for issuance of the warrant in question. And for that reason the court stops short of reaching broader constitutional questions presented by this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 I concur in the majority opinion. I am persuaded by the Chief Justice's analysis of the grounds for finding probable cause sufficient to justify the issuance of the warrant in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 I write separately, however, to articulate an alternative ground for reversal. That ground was briefed by the parties and squarely presented for our decision. It concerns the appropriate remedy for a violation of the search and seizure provision of the Utah Constitution-by way of an exclusionary rule or some other remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 36 The majority is right to say that its decision on the probable cause issue makes it unnecessary for us to reach the question of the proper remedy for an unconstitutional search. But appellate courts retain the discretion to reach alternative grounds for decision. And I would reach this question here for reasons set forth in part in my opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985176\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/210/\">\n    2011 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 27-69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985176\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/210/\">\n    267 P.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lee, J., concurring), and elaborated further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 37 I would hold that article I, section 14 of the Utah Constitution does not require the imposition of an exclusionary remedy for a violation of this provision. Instead I would conclude that this clause does not speak to the required remedy, but leaves that matter to be resolved and adapted by policymaking branches of government over time. In so doing I would repudiate the reasoning contained in our contrary precedents, such as\n   <em>\n    State v. Larocco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10381656\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/794/460/\">\n    794 P.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1990), and\n   <em>\n    State v.

These cases are entitled to a presumption of correctness under our doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eldridge v. Johndrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    2015 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    345 P.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The briefing in that case, as here, raised the question of whether article I, section 14 enshrines an exclusionary remedy for a violation of the state guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. And, as in this case, we stopped short of reaching that issue because we found probable cause sufficient to sustain the reasonableness of the search in question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985176\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/210/\">\n    2011 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985176\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/210/\">\n    267 P.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 In the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   case I wrote separately to \"articulate an alternative ground for affirmance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 (Lee, J., concurring).

I continue to maintain that (a) \"the text and history of article I, section 14\" do not \"incorporate the sweeping remedy of an exclusionary rule\" as a requirement of state constitutional law,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-58 ; (b) our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Larocco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   endorsed an exclusionary remedy without analyzing the text or history of article I, section 14,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-46 ; and (c) \"there is little ground for an argument that the [exclusionary] rule is so settled that it is beyond reconsideration on reliance grounds,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. And for these reasons, as in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , I would urge this court to \"reconsider\" the idea of an exclusionary rule as a matter of state constitutional law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 41 I would do so here.

If the Utah Constitution does not speak to the appropriate remedy, but leaves that question up to the common law (or legislative adjustment), then we should open the door to adaptation of the remedy or remedies available for unreasonable searches or seizures.

And that regime would leave the door open to ongoing adjustment by this court or the legislature going forward.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spackman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106892\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/533/\">\n    2000 UT 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106892\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/533/\">\n    16 P.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In general, the legislative branch has the authority, and in many cases is better suited, to establish appropriate remedies for individual injuries,\" so the courts should \"use their common law remedial power cautiously\"). This would allow policymakers to determine whether the exclusionary rule is the most effective remedy to protect the rights of Utah citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 49 A move in that direction could address concerns about the current state of search and seizure law. There is an irony in our modern search and seizure law: Because the\n   sole remedy for an unlawful search or seizure is exclusion of evidence, the protections of the constitution are reserved for those found in possession of illegal contraband; the purely innocent are left without an effective remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 50 There is a further downside to the exclusionary rule: It imposes societal costs unnecessary to the goal of remedying the effects of the unlawful search. Those disproportionate external costs distort the law of search and seizure in ways that further undermine its full protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this problem has led to a patchwork of exceptions to the exclusionary rule-exceptions that are often ill-defined and difficult to predict,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that effectively remove the protections supposedly guaranteed by our federal and state constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 51 The approach suggested here could avoid these problems. A remedial regime that includes a damages award would have the important virtue of extending protection against unreasonable search and seizure to all members of the public, not just those found in possession of illegal contraband. And it would allow us to reform a body of law that is riddled by a set of contradictory exceptions that contribute more confusion than clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 52 The exclusionary rule is both under-and over-inclusive. Its under-inclusiveness lies in its failure to provide a remedy for any but those who are found in possession of contraband. Its over-inclusiveness is in affording relief that goes well beyond that necessary to restore an injured party to his \"rightful position\"-the position he would have been in but for the infringement of his constitutional rights. Both features are troubling. The former means that some of our citizens have no effective means of securing their right against unreasonable search and seizure. And the latter is also troubling, because the exclusionary rule \"almost always requires courts to ignore reliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Yet that precedent leaves litigants and lower courts in the dark on the practical implications of our precedent for disputed cases. The ultimate effect of the exclusionary rule is dictated by the application or availability of any of a number of \"exceptions\" established in the case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

And the parties addressed that question extensively in their briefing to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 62 In these circumstances I do not think that humility counsels avoidance. Our case law, as it stands, gives an incomplete answer to the question of the appropriate remedy for a violation of article I, section 14 of the Utah Constitution. This is not constitutional territory we have left uncharted. It is territory we have mapped partially-in a manner leaving the important questions unresolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 63 Justice Himonas says that there is no pressing need for us to intervene to resolve the question presented.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.

We do not advance the cause of judicial humility by painting a partial picture\n   of the constitutional doctrine in this important field. In fact our decision to do so affirmatively undermines a core premise of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. By leaving the exclusionary rule in place we are actively foreclosing policy judgments by the democratically elected branches of our government. We do so, moreover, without ever engaging in any careful constitutional analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
