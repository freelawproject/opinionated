We affirm the convictions and remand to strike an award of restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case revolved around allegations by M.V., 14 years old at trial, that Mr. Yallup had licked her vagina on multiple occasions when she was 10 and 11. After a late decision to waive jury trial, the matter proceeded to a bench trial in the Klickitat County Superior Court before the Honorable Brian Altman on October 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Investigation revealed that Mr. Yallup lived with M.V. and her mother in three different locations in Goldendale. The child reported that incidents of sexual abuse occurred at all three locations. The prosecutor charged two counts of first degree child rape occurring between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. At trial, M.V. testified that the first incidents of abuse occurred when she was 10 and finishing the fourth grade. The abuse ended shortly before her 12th birthday. Since she was born in August 2002, and her fourth grade year ended in 2013, there was a comparatively narrow window (last 16 months) of the charging period in which the offenses occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 At the conclusion of trial, Judge Altman explained his decision in detail:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [M.V.] who is now fourteen, testified that the Defendant had sexual intercourse with her as it's defined in Washington law at least ten times she said and fewer than fifteen times during an approximate three year period. The incidents of intercourse ended ... when her mother, [L.J.], finally kicked the Defendant\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   out of the house where he had been staying off and on as her paramour for a period of a couple of years at least.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Regarding] issues that reasonably go to doubt, the Court has to analyze those issues in the context of [M.V.]'s testimony. Thus, the three year old timeframe of the charging instrument is not dispositive. Victims this age subjected to multiple assaults rarely remember exact times and dates. Especially when, as in this case, at least initially, she couldn't understand what was actually going on. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   My finding was that her entire story from her testimony here today, her interview, the reaction of the troubled alcoholic mother, Ms. [W]'s participation as a friend, all have a heft as a fact finder and determiner of credibility and feel and patina of the truth. I believed [M.V.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The very graphic details of her narrative had those idiosyncratic details that ring of truth. An invented tail [sic] does not sound like this. She told it consistently without variation, without coercion, with embarrassment and reluctance, but she told it. In my view, she was victimized by the Defendant consistently and repeatedly and the statutory elements of the crime have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Report of Proceedings at 114-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 5 A mandatory presentence investigation (PSI) was completed and sentencing occurred November 21, 2016. Included in the criminal history was a 1996 federal offense of Abusive Sexual Contact. Clerk's Papers at 99. The court and PSI both calculated an offender score of 10 that included 3 points for the federal offense. No comparability analysis was conducted on the record. The court used the offender score of 10 to impose a minimum term of 318 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Yallup timely appealed to this court. Judge Altman retired the following month. The findings of fact required by CrR 6.1 had not been entered at that time. Counsel for Mr. Yallup filed the brief of appellant in early May 2017. Judge Altman filed findings of fact on August 24, 2017. The brief of respondent was filed the following day. A reply brief was timely filed. A panel of this\n   court considered the matter without hearing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 7 The appeal raises four substantive issues: (1) whether the evidence supported the conviction for two counts within the charging period, (2) whether the untimely entry of findings prejudiced Mr. Yallup, (3) whether counsel performed ineffectively by failing to urge a comparability analysis of the federal conviction, and (4) whether the court erred in directing that restitution be made as a condition of community custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address those contentions in the order listed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8 Appellant contends that because his victim could not identify the particular dates on which she was abused, it is unclear if both of the events occurred during the charging period.

Third, the alleged victim must be able to describe the general time period in which the acts occurred.

As to the first element, M.V. described acts of sexual intercourse (committed with the tongue or by penetration with a finger)-the essential component of a rape charge. She testified that these acts occurred more than 10 times; only two counts were charged. Third, the victim provided specific testimony about location and age to adequately describe the time period when the acts occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 The\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   factors are satisfied. More specificity from the victim was not required. Judge Altman applied the correct factors and was satisfied that two counts occurred within the charging period. The evidence supported that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 The evidence was sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Late Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 Mr. Yallup next challenges the trial court's entry of late findings, arguing that they were tailored to answer his appellate challenges. We are unhappy with both the late findings-a problem that seems to be increasing of late\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and the way they were addressed to this court. Ultimately, we conclude that Mr. Yallup has not established that the findings were tailored to prejudice his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18 Court rules and statutes mandate that trial courts enter written findings in several different circumstances, including bench trials in civil and criminal cases, along with specific findings required for termination trials, marriage dissolution proceedings, etc. Criminal rules mandating the entry of written findings include CrR 3.5, CrR 3.6, and CrR 6.1(d). Although the obligation is placed on the trial judge to enter the findings, we recognize the near universal practice of delegating the drafting of findings to the prevailing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 19 Here, Judge Altman's pending retirement (and desire to spend much of that time at sea) was well known, even to the bench of this court. Trial was held more than two months before his departure from the bench. In an ideal world, the findings necessitated by CrR 6.1(d) would have been entered at the time of sentencing when Judge Altman would be sitting in Goldendale and the parties would be present. When that did not occur, the prosecutor should have proceeded to bring the matter to the judge's attention before his retirement and departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 20 Some time prior to the filing of appellant's brief, counsel for the appellant discovered that the findings mandated by CrR 6.1(d) were not present. Our record does not reflect what efforts, if any, the parties made to resolve that situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court's records\n   carry no indication that either party brought it to the attention to our clerk of court or our commissioner's office. Instead, appellant filed a brief and attempted to use the absence of findings for his own benefit. Respondent made efforts to get the findings entered and delayed its own briefing to accomplish that fact. Appellant filed a reply brief challenging the findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 This process ultimately served no one. The purpose of findings of fact is to facilitate review.\n   <em>\n    State v. Head\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"867938\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/136/619/#p621\">\n    136 Wash.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621-22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=964%20P.2d%201187\">\n    964 P.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Instead, our focus here was turned to the process by which the findings were created rather than the merits of the findings. Accordingly, and with the knowledge that this is not the only recent case where similar events occurred, we set forth how the parties\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have behaved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 The initial failure is with the respondent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prevailing party must make efforts to get findings entered in a manner that facilitates timely review of an appeal. Although the ultimate responsibility rests with a trial judge, the reality is that the prevailing party has the most at risk and should make sure that a busy trial judge is presented with the opportunity to enter appropriate findings in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23 When that initial responsibility is not met, the appellant should, as counsel did here, make best efforts to alert respondent that action is needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Basic principles of civility and professionalism dictate that all counsel should attempt to resolve problems before they grow into bigger issues. If informal methods fail, then appellant should enlist this court's assistance. Notification that required findings are missing and an indication that a continuance of the briefing obligation is necessary would be one way to approach the problem. Another would be to file a motion to compel entry of findings. In either instance, notifying this court and obtaining its assistance should lead to a timely resolution of the finding issue so that counsel can obtain the necessary record to address the client's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This approach should lead to a speedier consideration of the case than attempting to address the issue by the briefing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24 However, that did not happen here, so we must consider the issue of the late findings. Mr. Yallup argues that the late findings were tailored to address his appeal. They were not. The written findings address exactly what would be expected from a bench trial and are not an expansion of Judge Altman's oral ruling. There is no mention of the issue actually raised by appellant's brief-whether the testimony placed the two counts within the charging period or not. The findings do not address the issue. Instead, the findings simply reflect that the two events occurred within the charging period rather than within the specific period described by the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 25 The findings were not tailored. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 26 Mr. Yallup next argues that trial counsel was ineffective by failing to demand a comparability analysis.
