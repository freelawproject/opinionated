As relevant here, a person is eligible for a DOSA sentence if \"[t]he offender has not received a drug offender sentencing alternative more than once in the prior ten years before the current offense.\" ROW 9.94A.660(1)(g). We are asked to decide whether \"before the current offense\" means \"before commission of the current offense\" or \"before sentencing on the current offense.\" The plain language of the statute indicates that the former reading is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Steven Van Noy was taken into custody after committing a series of crimes in Pierce, King, and Snohomish Counties. He was sentenced separately in each county. In Pierce and King Counties, Van Noy received DOSA sentences. When he was sentenced in Snohomish County, the court ruled that it did not have discretion to consider a DOSA because of Van Noy's Pierce and King County sentences. But because the Pierce and King County sentences were imposed after Van Noy committed the Snohomish County offenses, they did not render Van Noy ineligible for a DOSA sentence. We reverse and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Van Noy became addicted to opioids and methamphetamine in 2014. In 2015, he committed several criminal offenses in Pierce, King, and Snohomish Counties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2015, Van Noy pleaded guilty to residential burglary, second degree identity theft, and unlawful possession of a firearm in Snohomish County. He sought a DOSA and the court ordered a risk assessment and chemical dependency evaluation. Van Noy did not participate in the assessments and he failed to appear for sentencing. A warrant was issued for his arrest. Van Noy was taken into custody in Pierce County at the end of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In March 2016, Van Noy was sentenced in Pierce County on three cases involving forgery, identity theft, burglary, and possession with intent to deliver. He received a prison-based DOSA sentence for these convictions. In June 2016, Van Noy pleaded guilty to one count of second degree burglary in King County. He was sentenced to a prison-based DOSA to run concurrently with the Pierce County sentence. The judgment and sentence includes the following handwritten finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The court finds that A is eligible for DOSA, because this DOSA was imposed\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Pierce Co. causes (above), but\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   before treatment has commenced. The court finds that this is not a separate DOSA for purposes of statutory provision against no more than 2 DOSA's per 10-yr. period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Van Noy appeared for sentencing on his Snohomish County offenses in October 2016. He requested a prison-based DOSA to run concurrently with the Pierce and King County sentences. He argued that all of his offenses occurred within a short period of time and were caused by his recent addiction to heroin and methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The sentencing court ruled that Van Noy was statutorily ineligible for a DOSA sentence. The court noted that, if the parties had agreed to sentence Van Noy's Pierce, King, and Snohomish County offenses in the\n   same court, he could have received a DOSA for all of them. But the court ruled that, because Van Noy had received DOSA sentences in Pierce County and King County in the previous ten years, it did not have discretion to consider a DOSA. The court imposed a non-DOSA sentence running concurrently with Van Noy's Pierce and King County sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 Van Noy appeals his sentence, contending the trial court erred in ruling that it did not have discretion to consider a DOSA. He asserts that the ruling rests on an erroneous interpretation of the DOSA statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

RCW 9.94A.660(1). The condition at issue in this case limits eligibility to offenders who have \"not received a drug offender sentencing alternative more than once\n   <em>\n    in the prior ten years before the current offense\n   </em>\n   .\" RCW 9.94A.660(1)(g) (emphasis added). The parties dispute whether \"before the current offense\" means before the offender\n   <em>\n    committed\n   </em>\n   the current offense or before\n   <em>\n    sentencing\n   </em>\n   on the current offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Van Noy contends \"current offense\" generally refers to the commission of an offense. He asserts that, where the date of conviction or the date of sentencing is at issue, the legislature expressly states \"before conviction of the current offense\" or \"before sentencing on the current offense.\" The State's position is that the phrase \"current offense\" refers to the date of sentencing, not the date of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 We first look to the language of the statute. Because the SRA does not define \"offense,\" we use the ordinary meaning of the word. An offense is \"an infraction of law.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1566 (2002). Synonyms are \"crime\" and \"misdemeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20P.3d%201183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   An offense thus occurs when a person commits an act that violates the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 This meaning is clear in three of the eligibility conditions set out in RCW 9.94A.660(1), which require the court to consider the type or circumstances of the crime for which the offender is being sentenced. A person is eligible if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (a) The offender is convicted of a felony that is not a violent offense or sex offense and the violation does not involve a sentence enhancement under RCW 9.94A.533 (3) or (4) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (b) The offender is convicted of a felony that is not a felony driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug under RCW 46.61.502(6) or felony physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug under RCW 46.61.504(6) ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (d) For a violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act under chapter 69.50 RCW or a criminal solicitation to commit such a violation under chapter 9A.28 RCW, the offense involved only a small quantity of the particular controlled substance as determined by the judge upon consideration of such factors as the weight, purity, packaging, sale price, and street value of the controlled substance; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   RCW 9.94A.660(1)(a)(b)(d). In each of these provisions, the SRA directs the sentencing court to consider the nature of the act that violated the law. To do so, the court must consider the commission of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 The statute continues by setting out the condition at issue in this case, under which an offender is eligible for a DOSA if he or she \"has not received a drug offender sentencing alternative more than once in the prior ten years before the current offense.\" RCW 9.94A.660(1)(g). In context, this condition also directs the sentencing court to consider the commission of the current offense to determine whether it occurred despite prior DOSA sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 This reading is consistent with the statutory scheme as a whole. While DOSA serves to provide meaningful substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation incentives, opportunities for rehabilitation are not unlimited.\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5628812\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/333/#p343\">\n    154 Wash.2d at 338, 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20P.3d%201183\">\n    111 P.3d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An offender's inability or unwillingness to comply with conditions imposed as part of a DOSA sentence is evidence that the alternative sentence is not in the best interest of the offender or the community. A DOSA sentence may thus be revoked for noncompliance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 338,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20P.3d%201183\">\n    111 P.3d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the commission of a drug-related offense despite more than one DOSA sentence in the prior ten years is evidence that DOSA is not appropriate. The limitation on eligibility in ROW 9.94A.660(1)(g) addresses this scenario and makes such an offender ineligible. We conclude that, in determining eligibility under ROW 9.94A.660(1)(g), the relevant date is when the offender committed the offense, not when he was sentenced for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 The State contends, however, that the SRA uses the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   offense\" to refer to the date of sentencing. The State points to the offender score statute, ROW 9.94A.525(1), which distinguishes between current and prior offenses for sentencing purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A prior conviction is a conviction which exists before the date of sentencing for the offense for which the offender score is being computed. Convictions entered or sentenced on the same date as the conviction for which the offender score is being computed shall be deemed \"other current offenses\" within the meaning of RCW 9.94A.589.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   RCW 9.94A.525(1). Under this statute, all convictions entered or sentenced on the same day are \" 'other current offenses.' \" The statute also references RCW 9.94A.589, under which \"other current offenses\" are treated as prior convictions for purposes of calculating the offender score and generally run concurrently with each other rather than consecutively. RCW 9.94A.589(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 Washington courts have addressed these statutes in challenges to consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Finstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131395\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/177/501/#p507\">\n    177 Wash.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=301%20P.3d%20450\">\n    301 P.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (discussing RCW 9.94A.525(1) in a challenge to consecutive sentences);\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State relies on these cases to assert that the phrase \"current offense\" necessarily refers to the date of sentencing. Thus, according to the State, \"ten years before the current offense\" in RCW 9.94A.660(1)(g) means \"ten years before sentencing on the current offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 We reject this argument. The authority the State relies on considers the phrase \"current offense\" in a different context. Whether Van Noy's Pierce, King, and Snohomish County offenses were \"other current offenses\" for the purpose of calculating the offender score or determining concurrent or consecutive terms is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b619 Contrary to the State's assertion, the phrase \"current offense\" in the SRA does not\n   necessarily refer to the date of sentencing. Expressly or through context, the SRA frequently requires the sentencing court to look to the commission of the current offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RCW 9.94A.345 (the governing law is that \"in effect when the current offense was committed\"); RCW 9.94A.535(3)(a) (an aggravating factor exists where the court finds that \"the defendant's conduct during the commission of the current offense manifested deliberate cruelty\"); RCW 9.94A.030(32) (for purposes of determining aggravating factor in a crime of domestic violence, \"[m]inor child\" is one \"who is under age eighteen at the time of the offender's current offense\"); RCW 9.94A.535(1)(j) (mitigating factor exists where \"[t]he current offense involved domestic violence\" and the defendant acted in response to a pattern of abuse by the victim); RCW 9.94A.535(3)(m) (aggravating factor where the current offense involved a high degree of planning). RCW 9.94A.670(2)(c) (an offender is eligible for a Special Sex Offender Sentencing Alternative if he has no prior convictions \"for a violent offense that was committed within five years of the date the current offense was committed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 In contrast, where the relevance of the current offense is the date of sentencing or the date of conviction, the SRA expressly instructs the sentencing court to consider those dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RCW 9.94A.660(1)(c) (no prior convictions \"within ten years\n   <em>\n    before conviction\n   </em>\n   of the current offense\") (emphasis added); RCW 9.94A.525(1) (prior conviction is one that exists \"\n   <em>\n    before the date of sentencing\n   </em>\n   \" on the current offense) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 The DOSA statute itself contains two different uses of the phrase \"current offense.\" The condition of eligibility set out in RCW 9.94A.660(1)(c), like the provision at issue in this case, ties eligibility to previous convictions. But the two provisions use different language. Under .660(1)(c), an offender is ineligible if he has any convictions for a violent offense \"within ten years\n   <em>\n    before conviction of the current offense\n   </em>\n   ....\" Under RCW 9.94A.660(1)(g) an offender is ineligible if he has received more than one DOSA sentence \"in the prior ten years\n   <em>\n    before the current offense\n   </em>\n   .\" The different language in .660(1)(c) and .660(1)(g) signals a different legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is incorrect. As we explain below, the statute provides that DOSA eligibility is determined by the number of DOSA sentences a person has received before commission of the current offense. Whether the offender has commenced treatment on a DOSA sentence is irrelevant to the issue of DOSA eligibility.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The parties point to no instance in which, absent express language, context requires the court to look to the date of sentencing or the date of conviction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
