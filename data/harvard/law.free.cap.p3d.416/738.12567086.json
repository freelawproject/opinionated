We agree, however, that there was insufficient evidence to support the alternative means and reverse Joseph's conviction for felony violation of a court order. We also agree that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the domestic violence aggravator required proof beyond a reasonable doubt and unanimity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We affirm Joseph's conviction for felony harassment, but reverse for resentencing with a lesser offender score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Joseph and Katlong temporarily lived together at a friend's home despite a no-contact order prohibiting Joseph from contact with Katlong. On August 30, 2016, Joseph accused Katlong of infidelity and threatened to kill her. Joseph pushed Katlong to the couch, picked up a hammer, waived it around, and tapped Katlong's forehead with the flat end. Joseph's niece, Nekky, was present and watching. Nekky asked Joseph to stop because he was scaring her and then left the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Joseph was charged by amended information with domestic violence felony violation of a court order (count one), felony harassment (count two), and misdemeanor harassment (count three). All charges stemmed from the August 30, 2016, incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Joseph had previously pleaded guilty to a charge of assault in the third degree, domestic violence, for a separate assault of Katlong. The parties stipulated at trial that this charge had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The State relied on this prior conviction of assaulting Katlong to elevate the harassment allegation to a class C felony under RCW 9A.46.020(2)(b)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The jury found Joseph guilty on all charges. The jury was then reconvened to consider special verdict forms that asked whether Joseph and Katlong were members of the same household for purposes of elevating Joseph's offender score. The special verdict form was answered \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Based on a joint motion by Joseph and the State, the trial court agreed that the convictions for misdemeanor harassment (count 3) and felony harassment (count 2) violated double jeopardy. The court vacated the conviction on count 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 For the purposes of sentencing, the parties and court agreed to treat the convictions for felony violation of a no-contact order (count one) and felony harassment (count two) as the same criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Joseph appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Alternative Means for Conviction of Felony Violation of a Court Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Joseph argues first that his conviction for felony violation of court order (count 1) should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence of one of the charged alternative means of committing the crime.

While the crime of harassment is ordinarily a gross misdemeanor, when the \"person who harasses another\" has \"previously been convicted ... of any crime of harassment, as defined in RCW 9A.46.060,\n   <em>\n    of the same victim\n   </em>\n   \" the crime is elevated to a class C felony. RCW 9A.46.020(2)(b)(i) (emphasis added). The State elevated Joseph's charge to a class C felony under RCW 9A.46.020(2)(b) based on Joseph's prior conviction of assault in the third degree against Katlong. The question before us is whether Joseph's prior conviction for third degree assault is a \"crime of harassment\" under RCW 9A.46.060.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    There is some discrepancy in the record regarding Nita Katlong's name.

We reject this contention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 20 Washington courts have consistently interpreted the statutory language, \"including but not limited to,\" to indicate the legislative intent to create an illustrative, not exhaustive, list.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Larson\n    </em>\n    , 184 Wsah.2d at 849,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n     365 P.3d 740\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Joseph provides no authority to support a claim that the mere inclusion of a nonexhaustive list renders a statute ambiguous. And we do not so find. Here, the plain language of this statute unambiguously creates an illustrative and nonexhaustive list that does not specifically exclude any crimes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    \u00b6 21 Washington courts have a recognized method for interpreting such lists within a statute.

Accordingly, the question is whether Joseph's conviction of assault in the third degree is \"of a similar nature\" or \"comparable\" to the crimes specifically listed in the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b6 22 In determining whether assault in the third degree is \"of a similar nature\" to those included in harassment, we look to the clearly\n    stated legislative intent behind the anti-harassment act, chapter 9A.46 RCW:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    The legislature finds that the prevention of serious, personal harassment is an important government objective. Toward that end, this chapter is aimed at making unlawful the repeated invasions of a person's privacy by acts and threats which show a pattern of harassment designed to coerce, intimidate, or humiliate the victim.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    RCW 9A.46.010. A person is guilty of assault in the third degree where, among other alternatives, the person, \"[w]ith criminal negligence, causes bodily harm accompanied by substantial pain that extends for a period sufficient to cause considerable suffering.\" RCW 9A.36.031(1)(f). A crime where the defendant has caused \"substantial pain\" and \"considerable suffering\" to the same victim, falls squarely within the stated legislative intent.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b6 23 Joseph argues assault in the third degree is not comparable to the other crimes of \"harassment\" under RCW 9A.46.060, because the other crimes require intent, or at least a higher mens rea than the criminal negligence mens rea required for assault in the third degree. This argument also fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 24 There is no uniform expression of mens rea within the other crimes listed in RCW 9A.46.060. The listed crimes included in the statute rely on different levels of intent. Some require intentional conduct, others require recklessness, and a few include no mens rea at all. For example, rape in the first degree ( RCW 9A.44.040 ),\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    rape in the second degree ( RCW 9A.44.050 ), rape in the third degree ( RCW 9A.44.060 ),\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    rape of a child in the first degree ( RCW 9A.44.073 ), rape of a child in the second degree ( RCW 9A.44.050 ), and rape of a child in the third degree ( RCW 9A.44.079 ) do not have a mens rea element. Because there is no indication within the plain language of the statute that the legislature intended to differentiate crimes based on criminal intent, we will not assume such an exclusion exists.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00b6 25 We hold that assault in the third degree, where the defendant has caused \"substantial pain\" and \"considerable suffering\" to the same victim, is \"of a similar nature\" to the other crimes listed in RCW 9A.44.060, and falls within the legislature's intent to punish \"harassment.\" Accordingly, although the crime was not specifically listed in RCW 9A.44.060, the crime is a qualifying predicate crime under RCW 9A.46.020(2)(b)(i).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     Domestic Violence Aggravator\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    \u00b6 26 Joseph argues finally that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that a finding that Joseph's crimes were domestic violence offenses required proof beyond a reasonable doubt and a unanimous verdict. \"The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that a jury must unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt any aggravating circumstances that increase a defendant's sentence.
