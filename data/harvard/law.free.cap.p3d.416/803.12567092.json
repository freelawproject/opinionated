The term \"lawfully present\" also appears in \u00a7 1621, which, like \u00a7 1623, governs eligibility for postsecondary education public benefits.

That section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   For purposes of this paragraph, an alien is deemed to be unlawfully present in the United States if the alien is present in the United States after the expiration of the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General or is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9)(B)(ii). MCCCD contends that because DACA recipients' stays in the United States are authorized by DHS while they are in the DACA program, they are \"lawfully present\" under this definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 But this argument ignores that the INA definition of \"unlawfully present\" is qualified \"[f]or purposes of this paragraph\" only. That limiting clause is emptied of meaning if, as MCCCD contends, the definition extends to benefits eligibility under \u00a7 1623(a). Furthermore, \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(ii) operates in the specific context of tolling admissibility so that an alien who is permitted to remain in the country for a period of time is not penalized for having spent that time in the country. And although this definition addresses how an alien's presence should be \"deemed\" after expiration of a stay, the statute suggests that these individuals would otherwise be unlawfully present during the stay period. Nothing in the statutory framework suggests that Congress intended for this definition to be applied in the benefits-eligibility context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 MCCCD's position highlights the fact that Congress and agencies use the phrase \"lawfully present\" as a technical term that takes on different meanings in different circumstances. In other words, an alien can be \"lawfully present\" for one purpose, but not another.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201611\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (permitting aliens who are \"lawfully present ... as determined by the Attorney General\" to receive Social Security benefits);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.3\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(vi) (stating that an alien \"currently in deferred action status\" is \"lawfully present\" for purposes of Social Security benefits \"only\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20152.2\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 152.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that an alien \"currently in deferred action status\" is \"[l]awfully present\" for purposes of Affordable Care Act benefits but explicitly excluding DACA recipients).

That statute permits states to offer in-state tuition to aliens such as DACA recipients who are not lawfully present, as long as the state makes \"a citizen or national of the United States ... eligible for such a benefit ... without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.\" Arizona has not made in-state tuition available to all U.S. citizens and nationals without regard to residence, nor has it attempted to provide in-state tuition to students \"not lawfully present.\" Indeed, the voters attempted to do just the opposite when they enacted A.R.S. \u00a7 15-1803, which provides that \"a person who was not a citizen or legal resident ... or who is without lawful immigration status is not entitled to classification as an in-state student.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 15-1803(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18 Congress has the ultimate say in immigration matters and Arizona is bound under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution to follow federal law. U.S. Const. art. VI. DACA recipients are not \"lawfully present\" for purposes of \u00a7 1623(a), which governs in-state tuition benefits. That section allows a state to provide in-state tuition to students who are not \"lawfully present\" only under certain conditions, and Arizona has not met those conditions. We therefore must conclude that DACA recipients are not eligible for in-state tuition, even if we agree on the desirability of affording them access to college education as a matter of public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 19 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate paragraphs 12 through 35 of the court of appeals' opinion, and we remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion and the portions of the court of appeals' opinion that we did not review, including the instructions to enter a judgment enjoining MCCCD from granting in-state tuition to DACA recipients.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
