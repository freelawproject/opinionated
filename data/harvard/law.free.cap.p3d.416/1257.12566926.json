Concluding that she lacked standing to pursue this case under these facts, we affirm, although on different grounds, the trial court's decision to dismiss the case on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 This litigation centers on residential developments at Snoqualmie Pass. Ms. Jevne is a resident of one such development, a planned unit development known as The Village at the Summit. Respondent is The Pass LLC, developer of a community adjacent to The Village. At issue is a surface water retention pond, allegedly belonging to the homeowners association (HOA) of The Village, but used by both The Village and The Pass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 When The Village was platted in 1990 by Snoqualmie Summit Inn, Inc. (Snoqualmie), the property that Ms. Jevne ultimately acquired was listed as Lot 31. Across the street from Lot 31 is Tract A, the retention pond. Tract E on that plat map, a portion of The Village, was reserved for subsequent development. An easement granted Tract E the right to drain its surface water into Tract A. Snoqualmie subsequently sold Tract E to The Pass, which then began developing the property. Whether or not there are any individual property owners of lots within Tract E, and whether they or The Pass are also members of the HOA, is not clear in our record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2013, operating with the permission of Snoqualmie, The Pass removed three trees from Tract A, ran a drain pipe into that lot, and made other efforts to improve the tract's ability to hold surface water. In the fall of 2014, Ms. Jevne purchased Lot 31 and became a member of the HOA. The following year, she filed the current action in her own name against The Pass LLC and its manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The complaint alleged that the HOA owned Tract A and stated claims for damages and injunctive relief resulting from trespass, water drainage trespass, nuisance, and overburdening an easement. The complaint contained no allegations that Ms. Jevne had been authorized to sue on behalf of the HOA or that she had requested permission of the HOA to act. The Pass answered the complaint and alleged that Snoqualmie owned Tract A and that it had acted with permission of Snoqualmie. It also asserted that Ms. Jevne lacked standing to pursue the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Pass subsequently brought a motion to dismiss pursuant to CR 12(b)(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that Ms. Jevne lacked standing for several reasons, including (1) neither Ms. Jevne nor the HOA owned Tract A, (2) Ms. Jevne did not allege any damage to her own property, and (3) Ms. Jevne acquired her land after the actions she complained about. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 231, 234. In response, Ms. Jevne claimed that Tract A had been conveyed to the HOA by the 1990 plat documents and that as a member of the HOA, she had a contingent interest in the property that gave her standing to act. CP at 18-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Believing that there were unresolved factual questions that needed to be determined, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss and a subsequent motion for reconsideration. Several months later, respondents brought a motion for summary judgment on several theories. The trial court ultimately granted that motion and dismissed plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Ms. Jevne then appealed to this court from the summary judgment ruling. The Pass cross appealed from the denial of its motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The parties presented oral argument on the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 The sole issue we address is the dispositive matter of standing asserted in the cross appeal. Ms. Jevne failed to establish her authority to bring this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 \"Every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\" CR 17(a).

She does not qualify under CR 23.1. Despite her standing having been challenged in the trial court, she neither pleaded her compliance with rule 23.1 nor answered the motion with proof that she qualified under the rule to represent the interests of the HOA. She also does not appear to satisfy the requirements of the rule since she was not a member of the association at the time of the events giving rise to this litigation and our record does not reflect whether the HOA was even contacted about the concerns that gave rise to this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Standing is not conferred by CR 23.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 Ms. Jevne also fails to establish first party standing in her own right or third party standing to assert the rights of the HOA.

Even assuming that\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   still has validity under the modern statutes governing corporation and homeowner's association litigation authority, a close reading of that decision undercuts Ms. Jevne's argument. There a neighborhood had formed a social club opened to all property owners within the vicinity. The club eventually became incorporated and certain members purchased a building that they held in trust for the use of the club.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 927,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20P.2d%20544\">\n    221 P.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court noted that under the governing corporate laws, a nonstock corporation holds property for the benefit of its members, each of whom would be entitled to a pro-rata share of the proceeds upon dissolution of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 930,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=221%20P.2d%20544\">\n    221 P.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based on these statements from\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Jevne claims standing due to the possibility that she will still be a member of the HOA at the time it might dissolve.

This interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   puts it in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Timberlane\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Primark\n   </em>\n   , both of which recognized that a contingent interest fails to grant standing. Initially, it is easy enough to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   on its facts from Ms. Jevne's situation. The corporation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   was undergoing dissolution.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Here, the HOA was not dissolving, so there was no current expectancy that ripened the otherwise contingent interest into an enforceable present interest. Secondly, the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   even assuming that Washington's corporate laws were the same on this topic in 1950 as they are today, technically was\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   since none of the nontrustee plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   were current members of the club. The issue of whether corporate members have an enforceable current property interest when the corporation was not undergoing dissolution was not before the\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   court. Ms. Jevne's claim that she has standing under that decision simply is not supported by the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Instead, we believe that the rule of\n   <em>\n    Timberlane\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Primark\n   </em>\n   governs these facts. Ms. Jevne has not established standing to assert the rights of the HOA under either CR 23.1 or the alternative tests for standing. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss should have been granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Fearing, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Pennell, A.C.J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Pass answered the complaint and acknowledged it was not a member of the HOA and was uncertain if its property was intended to be included within the HOA.

If those plaintiffs lacked standing despite their direct relationship to the property, a mere member plaintiff certainly would lack standing under\n    <em>\n     Schroeder\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
