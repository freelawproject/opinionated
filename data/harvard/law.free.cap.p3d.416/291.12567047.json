At the time of his commitment, he was held in county jail. On appeal, he challenged his commitment on all three grounds. Concerning his ability to provide for his basic needs, petitioner argued that, because he had been in jail at the time of the commitment hearing, it must be presumed that he was receiving adequate care, and the state failed to establish that he would be released from incarceration any time in the near future. The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had failed to preserve that argument.\n   <em>\n    State v. K. J.

And, because his inability to provide for his basic\n   needs established sufficient grounds to support the commitment order, it declined to address the sufficiency of the evidence as to the other grounds for the order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412955\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/862/#p867\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412955\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/862/#p867\">\n    at 869-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412955\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/862/#p867\">\n    387 P.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On review, petitioner does not dispute that he did not present to the trial court precisely the same argument that he advances on appeal. He nevertheless contends that he raised the sufficiency of the evidence to support his commitment on the ground that he could not provide for his basic needs and that such a general objection was adequate to preserve the more particular argument he now asserts. The state, meanwhile, argues that the case is now moot because the underlying order of commitment has long since expired. In the alternative, it argues that petitioner did not preserve the argument that, to establish a basic-needs commitment when an individual is currently incarcerated, the state must prove the date when an individual will be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the case is not moot, given the collateral consequences of an order of civil commitment. We also conclude, however, that petitioner failed to preserve his contention that the state was obliged to establish the expected date of his release from custody to establish the elements of a basic-needs commitment. We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The relevant facts are not in dispute. Petitioner has suffered from schizoaffective disorder for more than 30 years and is intermittently homeless. He was arrested in October 2015 for setting a fire near an apartment complex and thereafter held in county jail. While in jail, petitioner blocked the toilet in his cell and urinated on his sleeping mat and clothes. He refused to go to court and demonstrated bizarre and disorganized behavior during a video arraignment on another, unrelated, charge. At that point, the trial judge entered a notice of mental illness, triggering the civil commitment process under ORS 426.070 to ORS 426.415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the civil commitment hearing, the state asserted that petitioner should be committed on the grounds that he was dangerous to himself, dangerous to others, and unable to provide for his basic needs. A precommitment investigator who had met with petitioner in jail testified that petitioner exhibited disorganized speech and appeared to be quite paranoid. She stated that, although she did not believe him to be a danger to himself or others, she did believe him unable to meet his basic needs \"because of the level of psychosis that I was seeing within the jail setting\" and because of the fire incident. She reported that petitioner had explained that he had set the fire in order to keep warm. She also reported he refused medication for his mental disorder. On cross-examination, the investigator testified that she was not aware of any report that petitioner had not been eating or drinking while in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner's case manager and therapist also testified. She stated that, over the previous year, petitioner had experienced trouble finding a place to live and finding access to food. She said that problems with medications \"ha[d] been an ongoing thing\" and that, when he does not take his medications, he becomes highly disorganized and delusional. She said that her understanding from jail staff was that he was continuing to refuse medication and that, when released from jail, he has a difficult time obtaining necessary resources. On cross-examination, she said that she had no reason to think that petitioner was not eating or drinking while in jail, but she noted that she had observed\n   that petitioner had lost about ten pounds while in jail. When asked about his resources outside of jail, she reported that she was aware of the existence of family members, but that petitioner was hesitant to rely on them for assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A criminal justice behavioral health specialist testified as well. She stated that, although petitioner had not given jail staff much trouble, \"he's not taking very good care of himself in the fact that he's urinating all over everything, and his mat and his clothes and-and he just is very incoherent, [and] disorganized.\" She said that petitioner had refused psychiatric care while incarcerated. On cross-examination, she said that she had reports that petitioner had occasionally\n   refused to eat while in jail, but that he was generally eating enough to remain healthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, petitioner's probation officer testified concerning the circumstances leading to his most recent arrest. On cross-examination, she testified that, during the previous six months, she had no reason to believe that petitioner was not taking care of himself, not feeding himself, or not drinking water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the close of the evidence, counsel for petitioner argued that the state had not met its burden of establishing any of the grounds for an involuntary civil commitment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[T]his is one of those very difficult cases where I-I do think that the state has met its burden to show that [petitioner] suffers from a mental illness, *** but I don't believe that they have sufficient evidence to allow the court to find by clear and convincing evidence that he is unable to provide for his basic needs, or that he poses a risk to himself or to other people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Basic needs, of course, refers to accessing food, accessing water, accessing necessary medical care to prevent imminent physical-well, a serious harm to the individual. And I don't think that the State has shown that today. All of the witnesses today have testified that-that [petitioner] has experience as a homeless individual, that he has struggled in getting into shelters, that he has struggled maintaining his housing for sure, but at the same time he's been resourceful. He has located food, he has located water, he\n   has not refused food, not refused water. And he has shown himself capable of locating sufficient shelter when needed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"As far as medical care, there's been a lot of talk about an amputated toe from July, but there's been no evidence that that continues to-to be an ongoing medical concern that he is ignoring. ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"So, your honor, I just don't think we have enough here for the court to conclude that [petitioner] is unable to meet his basic needs.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court concluded that the state had met its burden of establishing the requirements for commitment on all three grounds-dangerous to himself, dangerous to others, and unable to provide for his basic needs. As to the basic-needs showing, the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[I]f [petitioner] were released right now he would find himself in a life threatening condition because, although he's experienced as a homeless person, right now he doesn't known what month it is *** and has dropped some weight and is refusing to take medications, is clearly delusional, not able to do what it takes to get into the shelters, even though he knows where they are. And, under these circumstances, what I've heard, *** I do find that the high threshold is *** met as far as his inability to *** meet his basic needs. *** I was particularly troubled by [the jail liaison's] description of the occurrences in the jail with the plugging of the *** toilets and walking through the sewage and with a toe that may or may not need continued medical attention. And covering your personal belongings in urine ***-I mean, all that to me seems like he's dangerous to himself and his own welfare by doing that to his living situation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court committed petitioner to the Oregon Health Authority for a period not to exceed 180 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Petitioner appealed the order of commitment to the Court of Appeals, asserting that the record was insufficient to support commitment on any of the three grounds. Concerning the basic-needs ground, petitioner argued that, because he was in jail at the time of the commitment hearing, it must be presumed that he was receiving care adequate to meet his basic needs. To establish a basic-needs commitment under those circumstances, he argued, the\n   state must prove that his release from incarceration was \"impending.\" In this case, he argued, \"the record does not support a basic-needs commitment as the record lacks any evidence as to when [petitioner] would be released from his criminal incarceration.\" For support, petitioner relies on the Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Jensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4463173\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/141/391/\">\n    141 Or.

In that case, the court reversed an order of commitment based on the petitioner's inability to meet his basic needs. The\n   court noted that the petitioner was in custody at the time of the commitment hearing; that local correctional facilities are statutorily required to provide adequate care for those in custody; and the state had not established that his release was impending and that, on release, he would be incapable of providing for his basic needs.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 394-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4463173\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/141/391/\">\n    917 P.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As we have noted, the Court of Appeals in this case concluded that petitioner failed to preserve that argument drawn from Jensen, and it affirmed petitioner's commitment on the basis that he was incapable of meeting his own basic needs. Petitioner sought this court's review. After we allowed review, the state moved to dismiss the appeal as moot, given that the 180-day commitment period had long ago expired. We reserved that issue until the appeal had been fully briefed and argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin with an overview of the law governing civil commitment for persons with mental health and developmental disabilities. Under ORS 426.070(2)(c), civil commitment proceedings may be initiated through a notice of mental illness stating that the person sought to be committed \"is a person with mental illness and is in need of treatment, care, or custody.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, the petitioner was found guilty, but for a mental disease or defect, of burglary and theft, and he was committed to the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board. Later, he sought release from PSRB jurisdiction on the ground that he no longer suffered a mental disease or defect. PSRB refused to release him, and he sought judicial review. While review was pending, however, PSRB decided to release him unconditionally. It then moved to dismiss the review proceeding on\n   the ground that it had become moot. The petitioner argued that, even though he had been released, a judicial determination of the lawfulness of the commitment order to the jurisdiction of PSRB remained a live controversy because, under ORS 179.620, he was liable to the state for the costs of his care. The state replied that there was no evidence that it had taken any steps to require the petitioner to pay for his costs of care.

Petitioner responds that the appeal remains justiciable because of two collateral consequences. First, he contends that, under ORS 179.620, he remains liable to the state for the costs of his care during commitment. Second, he contends that an order of civil commitment carries with it a continuing social stigma that has long been recognized in this state's case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The state rejoins that petitioner's first argument is defeated by\n   <em>\n    Brumnett\n   </em>\n   , which held that, in the absence of evidence that the state was taking active steps to collect from the petitioner, his liability for the costs of care does not amount to a collateral consequence sufficient to defeat a mootness claim. As to\n   the second argument, the state\n   argues that petitioner relies on \"purely speculative notions of social stigma.\" According to the state, societal attitudes about mental health generally have changed, largely eliminating any stigma that once may have been associated with involuntary commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The state is correct that, as to the first argument,\n   <em>\n    Brumnett\n   </em>\n   controls. There is some question whether\n   <em>\n    Brumnett\n   </em>\n   was correctly decided. The court in that case concluded that, even though the petitioner was correct in asserting that he remained liable to the state for the costs of his care while committed to the jurisdiction of the PSRB, the state nevertheless met its burden of persuasion by an absence of evidence that it had taken any steps to require the petitioner actually to pay.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2191266\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/315/402/#p407\">\n    315 Or. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2191266\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/315/402/#p407\">\n    848 P.2d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It certainly could be argued that the state could not defeat the petitioner's existing statutory liability with an absence of evidence of an intention to collect (which is different from affirmative evidence that the state did not intend to collect). But we need not address that question, because petitioner's second argument, concerning the social stigma associated with involuntary mental commitment, is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This court has not had occasion to address whether a social stigma attaches to an order of involuntary of civil commitment. The Court of Appeals has, however. In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state alleged that the case was moot as a result.

It suffices to say for the purposes of this case that the state simply has not met its burden. As we have noted, the burden rests with the state to establish that any collateral consequences that petitioner has identified either do not exist or are legally insufficient. In this case, the state has done neither. It has simply asserted-without support of any kind-that the social stigma of which petitioner complains does not exist. That is not adequate to establish that there are no collateral consequences of the order of civil commitment.

According to petitioner, evidence of his ability to care for his needs outside of jail is pertinent only if the state establishes that his release from custody is imminent. In this case, he contends, the state offered no such proof of a release date. The state responds that petitioner failed to preserve that argument, and the Court of Appeals agreed.
