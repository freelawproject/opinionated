Based on undisputed material facts, the district court determined that, with respect to the \"jet skis\" exclusion, Fire Insurance \"was faced with a fairly debatable question\" of coverage. The court of appeals affirmed, concluding that the term was debatable as a matter of law. And we affirmed the decision of the court of appeals. Put differently, and perhaps more plainly, the trial court, the court of appeals, and this court have all concluded that whether the \"jet skis\" exclusion clearly and unambiguously applied to Mr. Oltmanns's claim was fairly debatable, making summary judgment for Fire Insurance appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   We would ordinarily stop here and refrain from making any additional comments regarding the Petition. But the rhetoric Mr. Oltmanns's counsel chose to employ in the Petition takes this case out of the ordinary. Counsel accuses us of being biased for insurers: \"for some reason, since it involved the filing of a declaratory judgment action by an insurance company, the normal rules of contract interpretation-and civil procedure-did not apply.\" He then goes on to charge that we \"unfairly meted out\" \"savagery\" on his client's case. This sort of language, which questions motives rather than ideas, reflects an insufficiency of thought and ineffective advocacy and has no place in filings before the trial or appellate courts of this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   We admonish counsel for his use of such language. And we take this opportunity to remind him of paragraph 3 of the Utah Standards of Professionalism and Civility-\"Lawyers shall not, without an adequate factual basis, attribute to other counsel or the court improper motives, purpose, or conduct.\"\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-12\">\n   Justice Himonas, amended opinion of the Court:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b61 Robert Oltmanns was named as a defendant in a personal injury case. He filed a claim with his insurer, Fire Insurance Exchange, who questioned whether the claim was covered under the policy. Rather than deny the claim outright, Fire Insurance brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether the claim was covered under Mr. Oltmanns's policy. The court of appeals ultimately held that it was covered, and Mr. Oltmanns filed a counterclaim seeking attorney fees for the declaratory judgment action, arguing that it was brought in bad faith. The question presented for this court is whether the court of appeals erred in concluding that Fire Insurance's denial of Mr. Oltmanns's insurance claim was \"fairly debatable,\" thus negating Mr. Oltmanns demand for attorney fees and expenses for the coverage dispute and appeal. We affirm the court of appeals' decision to uphold the summary judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b62 In 2006, Mr. Oltmanns was piloting a Honda F-12 AquaTrax personal watercraft that was towing Mr. Oltmanns's brother-in-law, Brady Blackner. Mr. Blackner sustained injuries, and filed a lawsuit against Mr. Oltmanns. Mr. Oltmanns tendered the defense to Fire Insurance Exchange under his homeowner's insurance policy. The insurance policy contains the following provision under Section II-Liability, Coverage E-Personal Liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   We pay those damages which an\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   becomes legally obligated to pay because of\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury, property damage\n   </strong>\n   or personal injury resulting from an occurrence to which this coverage applies.... At our expense and with attorneys of our choice, we will defend an\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   against any covered claim or suit. We are not obligated to pay defense costs, including attorneys' fees of any claim or suit where you select an attorney not chosen by us because there is a dispute between you and us over coverage. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we consider proper. Our obligation to defend any claim or suit ends once we have paid our limit of liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the same liability section of the insurance contract, in a subsection titled \"Additional Coverages,\" Fire Insurance agrees to pay \"[i]n addition to the limits of liability ... all costs we incur in the settlement of a claim or defense of a suit with attorneys of our choice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b63 Fire Insurance conducted an in-house review of Mr. Oltmanns's claim and then submitted his claim to outside counsel for a coverage opinion. Whether the accident was deemed covered was uncertain because of the following exclusion in its liability coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We do not cover bodily injury [that]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7. results from the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a. aircraft\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   b. motor vehicles\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   c. jet skis and jet sleds or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   d. any other watercraft owned or rented to an insured and which:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) has more than 50 horsepower inboard or inboard-outdrive motor power; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) is powered by one or more outboard motors with more than 25 total horsepower; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) is a sailing vessel 26 feet or more in length.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Exclusions 7c and d do not apply while jet skis, jet sleds or watercraft are stored.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b64 Fire Insurance also asked Mr. Oltmanns's attorney to continue to represent him, indicating that Fire Insurance\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   reimburse him for his fees and expenses should the accident be deemed a covered occurrence. Fire Insurance's outside counsel advised Fire Insurance that he believed there was a high probability that the incident would not be covered, but that Fire Insurance should authorize him to file a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of its responsibility to Mr. Oltmanns under the policy. He advised this course of action because \"[u]nder Utah law, a liability insurance carrier's duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify,\" and \"[i]t would be dangerous to simply deny coverage because Mr. Blackner and Mr. Oltmanns may enter into an agreement to stipulate to a large judgment and Mr. Oltmanns could then assign his claims against Fire Insurance Exchange to Mr. Blackner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b65 Fire Insurance filed the action and then moved for summary judgment. The district court ruled in favor of Fire Insurance, finding that the exclusion precluded coverage. Mr. Oltmanns appealed and the court of appeals reversed, holding that the term \"jet ski\" as used in the exclusion was ambiguous and construed the contract against the insurer in favor of the insured.\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins. Exch. v. Oltmanns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803574\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/566/\">\n    2016 UT App 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803574\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/566/\">\n    370 P.3d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fire Insurance then settled with Mr. Blackner for the policy limit of $300,000 and paid Mr. Oltmanns's attorney fees and expenses for his defense of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b66 Fire Insurance did not pay for Mr. Oltmanns's costs of defending the declaratory judgment action. Mr. Oltmanns then filed a counterclaim against Fire Insurance in the still open declaratory judgment action seeking \"damages for breach of the implied covenant [of good faith and fair dealing], which include his attorney fees for prosecuting this coverage action and the successful appeal\" as well as \"damages for the severe emotional distress that was caused by the coverage denial and his self-defense of a significant personal injury claim.\" Fire Insurance once again moved for summary judgment and for a motion to dismiss. The district court granted summary judgment finding that Fire Insurance's actions were reasonable because the coverage issue was \"fairly debatable.\" Fire Insurance then withdrew its motion to dismiss. Mr. Oltmanns appealed and the court of appeals affirmed the district court, holding that \"when an insurance company proceeds in a reasonable way to resolve a difficult coverage question, its eventual loss at the appellate level does not foreclose a determination that an issue of interpretation was fairly debatable, as was the case here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b67 This case comes before us on certiorari review from the court of appeals decision. \"[W]e review the court of appeals' decision for correctness.

As Mr. Oltmanns has put it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Fire Insurance] relied on the advice of counsel [that an Aquatrax would be encompassed by the \"jet ski\" policy exclusion] in refusing the tender of defense. However, the advice was patently flawed. Therefore, the claim was not \"fairly debatable,\" and [Fire Insurance] breached the insurance contract and the implied duty of good faith [and] fair dealing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b69 On Mr. Oltmanns's account of the governing law, then, whether Fire Insurance breached its duties to Mr. Oltmanns turned entirely on whether the \"jet ski\" exclusion's applicability to an Aquatrax was fairly debatable: If it was fair for Fire Insurance to argue that the \"jet ski\" exclusion encompassed an Aquatrax then there was no breach; otherwise, according to Mr. Oltmanns, there was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b610 Mr. Oltmanns's argument fails on its own terms. It was more than fair for Fire Insurance to argue that its policy's \"jet ski\" exclusion applied to bodily injuries resulting from the use of an Aquatrax. In litigating whether the \"jet ski\" exclusion encompassed Aquatrax accidents, Fire Insurance put forward substantial usage evidence suggesting that the term \"jet ski\" is, in Fire Insurance's words, a \"genericized term for any type of personal watercraft.\" Fire Insurance's argument is bolstered by the fact that \"jet ski\" is frequently treated as a generic term in cases, ordinances, and dictionaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The cited dictionaries, ordinances, and cases show that the public uses the trademarked term \"jet ski\" generically, at least on occasion. That\n   suggests that the scope of the term may be fairly debatable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b611 That conclusion is also confirmed by the context of the \"jet ski\" exclusion in the insurance policy. The governing language excludes injury resulting from \"the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of aircraft, motor vehicles, jet skis and jet sleds, or any other watercraft owned or rented to an insured.\" (numbering omitted). With the exception of jet ski, each of the excluded terms unambiguously refers to the generic name for a category of items. None refers to a specific brand. This supports a generic reading of \"jet ski\" under the\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   canon of construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Third Nat'l Bank in Nashville v. Impac Ltd., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178765\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/312/#p322\">\n    432 U.S. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178765\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/312/#p322\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178765\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/312/#p322\">\n    53 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (\"[W]ords grouped in a list should be given related meaning.\" (footnote omitted) ). And that further indicates that the scope of \"jet ski\" is at least fairly debatable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b612 True, in a decision from an earlier phase of this case-a decision not currently before us-the court of appeals concluded that the \"jet ski\" exclusion did not apply to injuries resulting from the use of an Aquatrax, apparently declaring the term \"jet ski\" irredeemably obscure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins. Exch. v. Oltmanns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982026\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/285/802/\">\n    2012 UT App 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982026\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/285/802/\">\n    285 P.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even discounting the bizarre possibility that [Fire Insurance] meant to refer only to one Kawasaki watercraft model, it still cannot be definitively said what the insurer intended....\"). But, candidly, the correctness of the court of appeals' decision is as open to debate as the issue it resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b613 The concurrence, however, doesn't affirm the court of appeals on the basis that Mr. Oltmanns's argument fails on its own terms. Instead, the concurrence concludes that Mr. Oltmanns waived his argument that he was entitled to attorney fees because Fire Insurance breached its duties when it sought a declaratory judgment that it did not have to defend Mr. Oltmanns in connection with the Aquatrax accident. It then devotes many pages of dicta to its view that Mr. Oltmanns's \"fair debatability\" argument analyzed the problem the wrong way. According to the concurrence, Mr. Oltmanns should have characterized his claims against Fire Insurance as \"third-party claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. Under this characterization of Mr. Oltmanns's lawsuit, the concurrence tells us that \"fair debatability\" is irrelevant. Instead, because it arose in the third-party context, the appropriateness of Fire Insurance's decision to file a declaratory judgment action turned not on whether the \"jet ski\" coverage question was fairly debatable, but on whether Fire Insurance's position was \"reasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b614 The concurrence then proceeds to outline the entire syndrome of duties and obligations that an insurer owes an insured in the third-party context. Because Fire Insurance's declaratory judgment action arose in the third-party context, the concurrence says that Fire Insurance was operating under a \"heightened duty\" to act as an agent or fiduciary for Mr. Oltmanns.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. It therefore owed Mr. Oltmanns four duties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) [T]he duty to defend an action brought against [Mr. Oltmanns] that could conceivably fall within the scope of the policy coverage (as defined by the insurance contract), (2) the duty to be fair and reasonable in diligently investigating the validity of claims, (3) the duty to indemnify [Mr. Oltmanns] for valid claims, and (4) the duty to settle claims within the policy limits where possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b615 And, despite concluding that Mr. Oltmanns failed to preserve his argument that Fire Insurance breached its duty to defend him in the underlying lawsuit arising from the Aquatrax accident, the concurrence also details the scope and nature of the duty an insurer owes an insured to defend against a third-party lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b616 We have two problems with the concurrence's analysis. First, we don't agree that Mr. Oltmanns \"waived his argument that Fire Insurance breached the implied covenant of good faith by bringing the declaratory judgment action\" because he somehow \"conceded that [Fire Insurance's decision to file that action] was merited in his brief to the court of appeals and his brief to this court.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The court of appeals certainly didn't see it this way. It understood Mr. Oltmanns to have argued that Fire Insurance breached its fiduciary duties in seeking declaratory judgment because the\n   coverage question-whether an Aquatrax was covered by the term \"jet ski\"-was not \"fairly debatable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b617 We see this same argument in Mr. Oltmanns's brief to this court. It's true that there are stray comments in Mr. Oltmanns's supreme court briefing to the effect that Fire Insurance \"had the right to seek declaratory relief.\" But the obvious thrust of Mr. Oltmanns's argument is that he is entitled to attorney fees in connection with the declaratory judgment action because \"[t]here was no good basis for [Fire Insurance's decision to] fil[e] the declaratory judgment action\"-and this because whether the term \"jet ski\" encompassed an Aquatrax was not a \" 'fairly debatable' coverage question.\" We therefore consider this argument on its own terms. And we conclude that, even accepting Mr. Oltmanns's premises-i.e., even accepting that Mr. Oltmanns would be entitled to attorney fees if the coverage question was not fairly debatable-Mr. Oltmanns loses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b618 We are also concerned by the concurrence's decision to explain, in detail, the differences between first-party and third-party insurance claims. On its own terms, the concurrence's opinion is good stuff. It's, as Judge Chamberlain Haller might put it, \"lucid, intelligent, [and] well thought-out.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And it may very well be entirely correct. But this isn't the case for it. Mr. Oltmanns framed his claim as a first-party claim: Fire Insurance is liable because it could not fairly argue-it wasn't \"fairly debatable\"-that an Aquatrax was a \"jet ski.\" Fire Insurance then responded to this argument on those same terms. As a consequence, nobody-not the parties, not the insurance industry, not the plaintiffs' bar-is fairly on notice that this is the case in which we intend to announce that an insurer's decision to seek a declaratory judgment in connection with a third-party lawsuit must be analyzed under third-party insurance law. Nor, needless to say, has anybody been put on notice that we're prepared to announce an overarching framework for the analysis and resolution of third-party claims-a framework that, on its face, purports to occupy the field, controlling a vast array of possible insurance lawsuits. We need adversarial briefing before we can fairly do this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b619 To be clear, we don't mean that we're categorically bound by litigants' decision to litigate a case under the wrong legal principles (if wrong legal principles they be). We agree with the concurrence that our court will not \"be forced to ignore the law just because the parties have not raised or pursued obvious arguments.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kaiserman Assocs. v.

Courts around the country take different approaches to the issues the concurrence resolves. Some courts part ways with the concurrence's repudiation of the \"fairly debatable\" standard in the third-party context, denying bad faith claims in this context as long as the coverage question on which the insurer sought a declaratory judgment is \"fairly debatable.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Universal-Rundle Corp. v.

But we've never held that an insurer must defend against all third-party liability claims that could \"conceivably\" fall within insurance coverage. Nor have we considered whether an insurer may, consistent with its fiduciary obligations, stay the underlying proceedings until any dispute over coverage is resolved. Nor, in our view, have we squarely repudiated any role for the \"fairly debatable\" standard in the third-party insurance context. And because there are a variety of possible approaches to the issues the concurrence explores, we won't take a stand on any of them until after they have been put squarely before us. Here, the parties have litigated this as a first-party insurance dispute, and we therefore lack the benefit of adversarial briefing on the principles the concurrence elucidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b622 We certainly agree with the concurrence that we shouldn't bind ourselves to a \"confuse[d] ... distinction between first-party insurance claims and third-party insurance claims\" just because the litigants have potentially misapplied this law.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Nor do we need to commit ourselves to a third-party insurance framework in a case where nobody has asked us to. Instead, we chart a middle ground. We affirm the court of appeals on the basis that Mr. Oltmanns's argument isn't persuasive on its own terms-the coverage question was fairly debatable.

Relationships Between Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b638 Third-party cases involve liability, not just coverage. In these cases, a person who is not a party to the insurance contract sues the insured for the losses that are covered by the insurance contract. Insureds seek coverage under their insurance contract for their responsibility for the losses of the third party up to the coverage limit in the policy, tendering the defense of the claim to the insurer. The insurer's duty lies in defending and indemnifying the insured in good faith. An insurer is not in privity of contract with the third party who has made a claim against the company's insured, so the contractual duty to deal fairly and in good faith does not extend to an injured third-party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pixton v.

In third-party claims, the insureds look to the insurers to defend and indemnify them. In essence, the insurer and the insured are on the same side and the third party is the adversary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b639 In first-party cases, insureds suffer a loss and then make claims for reparations from their insurers, arguing that the loss is covered by the policy. For example, if a hailstorm damages an insured's roof, she would make a claim under her homeowner's policy for repairs. In these cases, the relationship between the insured and the insurer is more adversarial. They have conflicting interests. The insured wants to get the most compensation possible, and the insurer wants to cover as little as permissible under the contract. \"In the [first-party] situation, the insured and the insurer are, in effect and practically speaking, adversaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck v.

MR. OLTMANNS' COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST FIRE INSURANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b666 Where Mr. Oltmanns-either through negligence, inexperience, or a combination of the two-caused injury to his brother-in-law while operating a personal watercraft and his brother-in-law sought to recover his expenses associated with the event, Mr. Oltmanns was potentially liable for those injuries. Mr. Oltmanns turned to his insurer, tendering his defense pursuant to the contract. The insurer diligently investigated the claim, but did not defend Mr. Oltmanns in the personal injury case during the investigation. \"Fire Insurance asked Mr. Dalton to continue defending Robert Oltmanns and told him that in the event coverage was extended for the July 2006 accident, Fire Insurance would reimburse him for the costs and fees incurred by Robert Oltmanns.\" Fire Insurance admits that they \"did not offer or propose to defend the claim.\" Mr. Oltmanns argues that the insurer should not have requested a declaratory judgment action because the ambiguity in the contract is presumed to be interpreted in his favor. Mr. Oltmanns claims that the Fire Insurance inappropriately relied on outside counsel in its decision to file a declaratory judgment. Mr. Oltmanns also claims that Fire Insurance breached its duty of good faith by failing to assume the defense while deciding whether the incident was covered. We address each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    A. Mr. Oltmanns's Claim for Attorney Fees for the Declaratory Judgment Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b667 One remedy that Mr. Oltmanns seeks here is a right to recover attorney fees in the declaratory judgment action under contract law, claiming that Fire Insurance should not have requested a declaratory judgment action.

Because of the potential liability that is at stake for insurers in third-party cases, insureds face a very high bar in proving that an insurer filed a declaratory judgment in bad faith or to be stubbornly litigious. In this case Fire Insurance relied on the advice of outside counsel. Even though outside counsel believed that Fire Insurance would prevail, he advised Fire Insurance to file a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage. Fire Insurance was \"entitled to seek a declaratory judgment as to its obligations and rights,\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Call\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412194\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/712/231/#p237\">\n    712 P.2d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (Utah 1985) (citation omitted). Attorney fees for a declaratory judgment action brought in compliance with Utah Code section 78B-6-401 and Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 11, and not provided for in Mr. Oltmanns's insurance contract, are unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-5-825(1) (not awarding \"reasonable attorney fees\" unless \"the court determines that the action or defense to the action was without merit and not brought or asserted in good faith\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b669 Additionally, Mr. Oltmanns waived the right to argue that Fire Insurance acted in \"bad faith or fraudulently or was stubbornly litigious\" when it brought a declaratory judgment action for whether the \"jet ski\" exception applied in his situation. He did so by stipulating in its brief to the court of appeals and to this court that \"Fire Insurance was within its rights to file for declaratory relief. For this, it had the advice of counsel,\" noting that \"no one contended\" in the district court that \"Fire Insurance [did not have] the right to seek declaratory relief.\" In fact, in Mr. Oltmanns's briefing, his main contention is that Fire Insurance breached its duty because \"[a] reasonable response would have been to assume defense of the Blackner action.\" Failure to assume the defense does not mean that Fire Insurance breached its duty by filing a declaratory judgment. \"What Fire Insurance got [from counsel] was a recommendation to file for declaratory judgment. Fire Insurance argued over-and-over in the trial court that it had the right to seek declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    No one contended otherwise\n   </em>\n   . However, it never occurred to Fire Insurance that it could argue the coverage question while at the same time defending its insured.\" (Emphasis added.) Mr. Oltmanns's briefing shows that he seeks a remedy for breach of duty to defend through an award of attorney fees for the declaratory judgment action. This is not how the law works. Mr. Oltmanns therefore waived the argument that Fire Insurance brought the declaratory judgment action in bad faith and seeks damages pertaining to the attorney fees for defending the declaratory judgment action only under contract law; this request is without merit. There are no disputed material facts that indicate that Fire Insurance acted in bad faith in filing the declaratory judgment. Thus, summary judgment was appropriate for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    B. Mr. Oltmanns's Claim of Bad Faith for Relying on Opinion of Outside Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b670 Mr. Oltmanns also claimed that Fire Insurance impermissibly relied on the allegedly flawed advice of outside counsel. Thus, he argues, Fire Insurance did not fairly evaluate his claim and unreasonably rejected it. We agree with the court of appeals that \"[a]n insurance company may reasonably and fairly rely, at least initially, upon a coverage opinion from qualified outside counsel, received in the course of careful investigation and evaluation of a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins.

Fire Insurance would reimburse him for the costs and fees incurred.\" In Mr. Oltmanns's memorandum in opposition to Fire Insurance's motion for summary judgment, Mr. Oltmanns does not use these facts to raise a breach of the duty to defend claim as an additional fact in dispute. Although Mr. Oltmanns raised this claim in his operative counterclaim, this does not nullify the mandate of rule 7(c)(3)(B) to restate controverted claims and raise \"additional facts in dispute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b674 Because the claim was not raised as a disputed material fact in Mr. Oltmanns's opposition memorandum, it was not preserved. The claim for failure to defend was not properly presented to the district court in its opposition to summary judgment motion, so the court was not properly put on notice that it should rule on the failure to defend claim separately from the claim regarding the declaratory judgment action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donjuan v.
