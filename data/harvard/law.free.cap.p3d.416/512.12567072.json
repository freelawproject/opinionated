But Ms. Baumann failed to designate any expert on the applicable standards of care until the day on which the district court had scheduled the summary judgment hearing. Even then, she only designated an expert on the pharmacy's standard of care, not the physician's. Applying the standard in rule 26 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court excluded the late-designated expert. It then awarded summary judgment to both defendants based on its determination that without expert testimony Ms. Baumann would be unable to show that either the physician or the pharmacy had violated the applicable standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 On appeal to the court of appeals, Ms. Baumann argued that the district court should have applied rule 16, instead of rule 26, in assessing whether to exclude the expert that she designated. She also argued that the district court erred in failing to give her more of an opportunity to procure and designate an expert on the physician's standard of care-even though she did not ask for more time and did not otherwise give any indication that such an expert would be forthcoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The court of appeals correctly held that Ms. Baumann had failed to preserve her argument that the district court ought to have given her more time to find an expert on the physician's standard of care. The court of appeals also upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment to the pharmacy. But even though the pharmacy had argued that Ms. Baumann had failed to preserve her argument that the district court should have applied rule 16, the court of appeals resolved this issue on the merits. It also reached out and decided an issue that had not been briefed to it-whether the district court had abused its discretion under rule 26-reaching the right result but announcing an erroneous rule of law in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 We correct the court of appeals' legal error and affirm the court of appeals on the alternative ground that Ms. Baumann failed to preserve any of the issues she appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Kari L. Baumann sued her physician (Dr. Gregory P. Tayler) and her pharmacy (Smith's,\n   <em>\n    nom de guerre\n   </em>\n   of The Kroger Company), accusing them of overprescribing drugs. But she did not designate any experts on the applicable standards of care for physicians or pharmacies until after the discovery deadlines had all passed and the defendants' summary judgment motion-rooted in the proposition that the standards of care related to prescribing and dispensing blood pressure medication could only be proved by expert testimony-had been fully briefed. Indeed, it was not until the day originally set for the summary judgment hearing that Ms. Baumann attempted to designate an expert on the pharmacy's standard of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She never designated an expert on the physician's standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the physician and the pharmacy. Based on established Utah law, it ruled that Ms. Baumann could not make out a prima facie case without expert testimony about the applicable standards of care.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dalley v. Utah Valley Reg'l Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10381055\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/791/193/#p195\">\n    791 P.2d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195-96 (Utah 1990) (\"To establish the standard of care required of a physician in a particular field, breach of that standard, and proximate cause, the plaintiff is generally required to produce an expert witness who is acquainted with the standards of care in the same or a similar field as the defendant doctor.\" (citations omitted)). Based on this law, the court awarded summary judgment to both the pharmacy and the physician. It awarded summary judgment to the physician because Ms. Baumann had never submitted an expert report on the physician's standard of care. And it awarded summary judgment to the pharmacy because, even though Ms. Baumann had submitted an expert report on the pharmacy's standard of care, she had submitted it late for no good reason-which, the district court ruled, meant that she could not rely on it at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. CIV . P. 26(d)(4) (\"If a party fails to disclose or to supplement timely a disclosure or response to discovery, that party may not use the undisclosed witness, document or material at any hearing or trial unless the failure is harmless or the party shows good cause for the failure.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Ms. Baumann made two arguments why the district court erred in excluding her late-designated expert and granting summary judgment on that basis. First, citing our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Coroles v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869100\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/739/\">\n    2015 UT 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869100\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/739/\">\n    349 P.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , she argued that the appropriate\n   sanction for late discovery is the more forgiving standard set forth in rule 16 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure instead of the sanction for late discovery articulated in rule 26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding the fact that she had never asked the district court to apply rule 16-and, indeed, attempted to lodge her expert report \"under URCP 26\"-Ms. Baumann argued that the district court erred when it applied the sanction for late discovery in rule 26 instead of the sanction in rule 16. Noting that she had been proceeding pro se, Ms. Baumann also argued that the district court abused its discretion in finding that no good cause excused Ms. Baumann's decision to file her expert report late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 In addition to challenging the district court's decision to exclude the late-designated expert on the pharmacy's standard of care, Ms. Baumann also argued that the district court should have\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   postponed ruling on the\n   <em>\n    physician's\n   </em>\n   motion for summary judgment and extended the discovery deadlines to allow Ms. Baumann the opportunity (if she were so inclined) to find and designate an expert on the applicable physician's standard of care. Even though the district court had not applied rule 26 to exclude an expert on the physician's standard of care-there was, after all, no expert to exclude-Ms. Baumann argued to the court of appeals that the district court abused its discretion because it failed to consider whether postponing the summary judgment hearing and allowing Ms. Baumann to locate an expert on the physician's standard of care would have been harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. CIV . P. 26(d)(4) (exclude late-disclosed discovery \"unless the failure is harmless or the party shows good cause for the failure\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Both the pharmacy and the physician filed response briefs. The physician argued, among other things, that Ms. Baumann's challenge to the district court's \"exclusion\" of a nonexistent expert on the physician's standard of care was unpreserved-a textbook example of an issue that has not been \"presented to the [district] court in such a way that the ... court has an opportunity to rule on\" it.\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Baby E.Z.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    2011 UT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    266 P.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The pharmacy likewise argued preservation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In this case, the only issue that Ms. Baumann seeks review of on appeal with regard to ... her claims against Smith's Pharmacy is whether 'the District Court abused its discretion under Rule 16(d) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure by excluding an untimely expert report submitted by a pro se party when the Court decided the Defendants-Appellees' motion for summary judgment.' However, Ms. Baumann ... does not provide any citation to the record showing that this issue was preserved in the district court. Ms. Baumann also fails to set forth a statement of grounds for seeking review of this unpreserved issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 In the event that the court of appeals reached the merits, the pharmacy further argued that the district court had not abused its discretion in applying rule 26 instead of rule 16. It argued that\n   <em>\n    Coroles\n   </em>\n   required the application of the more forgiving sanctions in rule 16 only when discovery, even though disclosed late, is nonetheless disclosed well before trial or a hearing on a dispositive motion (not the case here). And it argued that, regardless of whether rule 16 or rule 26 applied, the court had ample justification for excluding the expert report under the circumstances of the case; Ms. Baumann had agreed to an extended discovery schedule and still failed to make the requisite disclosures until the very day that the summary judgment hearing was first scheduled-months after the applicable discovery deadlines and after a summary judgment motion predicated on Ms. Baumann's failure to designate experts had been fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 The court of appeals upheld the district court's decision. It first agreed that Ms.\n   Baumann's appeal was unpreserved as it pertained to the physician.\n   <em>\n    Baumann v. Kroger Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193057\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1135/\">\n    2016 UT App 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193057\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1135/\">\n    381 P.3d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court of appeals then turned to the district court's refusal to consider Ms. Baumann's late-filed expert report on the pharmacy's standard of care. Leaping over the pharmacy's preservation argument, the court of appeals held that the district court did not err in applying rule 26, instead of rule 16, reasoning that, under\n   <em>\n    Coroles\n   </em>\n   , \" rule 26 is controlling\" where a litigant \"fail[s] to disclose her expert witness until the day of the hearing on\" a dispositive motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 While the court of appeals did not address the pharmacy's preservation argument, it did consider an argument that Ms. Baumann had not made-the argument that the district court erred in failing to make an explicit finding that allowing Ms. Baumann to offer the late-designated expert would have been prejudicial to the pharmacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reaching out beyond the briefing before it, the court of appeals held that the district court was not required to make this finding: \"[i]t is well settled that a district court's exclusion of materials may be supported if the court makes a finding that there is either no good cause for the failure or that the failure is harmful.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 n.8 (emphases omitted) (citations omitted). Thus, because the district court had found that there was no good cause for Ms. Baumann's violation of the discovery schedule, the court of appeals held that it did not need to consider whether that violation was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 We granted certiorari and now affirm the court of appeals, but on different grounds.

It also turns on whether it correctly assessed preservation of the issues before it.\n   <em>\n    Prinsburg State Bank v. Abundo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977383\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/709/\">\n    2012 UT 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/709/\">\n    296 P.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 But for a set of procedural irregularities that we address below, this is among the simplest of cases for an appellate court to resolve. On certiorari to this court, Ms. Baumann argues (1) that the district court erred in applying rule 26 instead of rule 16 to the expert report on the pharmacy's standard of care and (2) even if rule 26 applies, that the district court abused its discretion in failing to consider whether allowing the late-designated expert would have been harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 First, Ms. Baumann's argument that the district court erred in applying rule 26, instead of rule 16, to the expert report on the pharmacy's standard of care is unpreserved. Ms. Baumann never asked the district court to admit the late-designated expert report under rule 16. Instead, she virtually invited the court to apply rule 26. In a document styled \"Plaintiff's URCP 26 Expert Report in Response to Reply to Memorandum in Support of Statement Opposing Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment,\" Ms. Baumann submitted the expert report \"under URCP 26.\" This submission arguably invited the district court to apply rule 26 instead of rule 16.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828567\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/365/699/\">\n    2016 UT 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828567\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/365/699/\">\n    365 P.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under the doctrine of invited error, an error is invited when counsel encourages the trial court to make an erroneous ruling.\"). And this error is not excused by Ms. Baumann's pro se status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Friel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201799\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/194/903/\">\n    2008 UT 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201799\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/194/903/\">\n    194 P.3d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing that, \"[a]s a general rule, a party who represents himself will be held to the same standard of knowledge and practice as any qualified member of the bar\" (alteration in original) (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 At minimum, Ms. Baumann did not preserve her argument that the district court erred in applying rule 26 's sanctions instead of the more forgiving standard set forth in rule 16. And, on appeal, she does not argue that the plain error doctrine or exceptional circumstances warrant our reaching this unpreserved issue.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman ex rel. Schefski v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11131463\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/17/1122/\">\n    2000 UT 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11131463\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/17/1122/\">\n    17 P.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ecause Mr. Coleman did not properly raise these three issues in the trial court and thereby preserve them for appellate review, and because he argued plain error or manifest injustice for the first time in his reply brief, we decline to review them.\"). Therefore, even if the invited error doctrine does not apply,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828567\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/365/699/\">\n    2016 UT 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828567\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/365/699/\">\n    365 P.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (purpose of invited error doctrine is to discourage \"intentionally\"-not inadvertently-\"misleading\" the district court) (citation omitted), Ms. Baumann has waived this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 Second, Ms. Baumann did not argue to the court of appeals that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to consider whether allowing the late-designated expert to testify would have been harmless-i.e., when it failed to expressly hold that exclusion was appropriate under rule 26 because allowing the expert to testify would have prejudiced the pharmacy. Instead, Ms. Baumann argued that the district court abused its discretion in applying rule 26 to exclude \"an additional expert report applicable to the doctor,\" not the pharmacy. At one point, she (somewhat confusingly) argued that this decision was error because the district court's \"sole basis ... was that Ms. Baumann ... did not establish good cause that excused her failure to file\"-when, in fact, this was the basis for the court's decision to exclude the late-designated expert on the\n   <em>\n    pharmacy's\n   </em>\n   standard of care. But it is clear in context that Ms. Baumann's argument to the court of appeals was that the district court's conclusion that \"an additional expert report [, i.e., an expert report on the physician's standard of care,] should be excluded ... constitute[d] an abuse of discretion.\" Indeed, in her court of appeals reply brief, Ms. Baumann conceded that this portion of her argument focused on the undisclosed expert on the physician's standard of care, and she asked the court of appeals to apply the exceptional circumstances doctrine to reach this issue-a request she does not renew before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 In any event, Ms. Baumann made no attempt to show that admitting the late-designated expert evidence on the pharmacy's standard of care-evidence on whose absence the pharmacy relied in briefing multiple trial court memoranda in support of summary judgment-would have been harmless. Indeed, as we have explained, Ms. Baumann makes the argument that the district court should have applied rule 26 to find that allowing expert testimony on the pharmacy's standard of care would have been harmless for the first time before this court. And she does not ask us either to apply the plain error doctrine or to find that exceptional circumstances exist. Accordingly, this point, too, is waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Finally, there is no question that the court of appeals got it right when it affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the physician in this case. As the court of appeals put it, \"the district court could not have abused its discretion in not making a ruling it was never asked to make.\"\n   <em>\n    Baumann v. Kroger Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193057\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1135/\">\n    2016 UT App 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193057\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1135/\">\n    381 P.3d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Ms. Baumann's brief to this court does not ask us to accord any relief that would require the district court to exhume the cause of action Ms. Baumann pleaded against her physician. We therefore affirm the court of appeals on this ground; the district court was right to grant summary judgment in favor of Dr. Tayler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 In a clean case, this would be the end of the matter. The problem is that the court of appeals looked past the pharmacy's preservation arguments to the merits of whether the district court should have applied rule 16 instead of rule 26 in deciding to exclude the late-designated expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193057\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17 -22. The court of appeals also chose to address an issue that neither party had briefed-whether a litigant must show both good cause and harmlessness before his or her discovery violation is excused under\n   rule 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12193057\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/381/1135/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 n.8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, on appeal, the pharmacy does not expressly argue that the court of appeals erred in disregarding the preservation requirement or in resolving an issue that had not been briefed to it-a failure that raises the specter of inadequate briefing, given that, on certiorari, our court sits to review the court of appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butterfield v.

It has cogently explained why the issues were unpreserved at the district court level, and it has pointed out deficiencies in Ms. Baumann's appellate briefs-thereby giving Ms. Baumann ample opportunity to respond. Moreover, unlike in a case where a party ignores analysis undertaken by the court of appeals, here the court of appeals simply did not analyze the preservation problems that had been put before it.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

While that was the misstep around which the pharmacy should have oriented its brief to this court, in this case neither judicial economy nor fairness would be advanced by declining to resolve this case on preservation grounds-especially given that the preservation issue is otherwise squarely briefed to us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fort Pierce Indus.

And while the court of appeals ultimately reached the merits of Ms. Baumann's unpreserved argument, it did not explain why. Because of this, Ms. Baumann has consistently born the burden of persuasion throughout her appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broderick v. Apartment Mgmt.

But she has never sought to argue that we should reach the obviously unpreserved issues in this case under either our plain error or exceptional circumstances doctrine. An appellant can hardly carry her burden of persuasion on an unpreserved issue if she does not do a plain error or exceptional circumstances analysis because, in failing to do such an analysis, she will have necessarily failed to explain why we should reach the issue of which she complains.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, we do not believe it would be prudent to follow the court of appeals' lead and reach the unpreserved issue in this case. One of the most important purposes of preservation is that it allows an issue to be fully factually, procedurally, and legally developed in the district court. The preservation rule thus enables us to analyze both the application of a legal rule or principle to a concrete and well-developed dispute and, nearly as important, the effect of the district court's ruling on the overall course of the proceedings below. The preservation rule also gives the appellate court the benefit of a trial judge's reasoning and analysis on the issue at hand. This is especially helpful in a case, like this one, involving the correct interpretation and application of precedent interpreting the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure-rules that our district courts live and breathe every day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 On the merits, this case calls for a clarification of\n   <em>\n    Coroles v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869100\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/739/\">\n    2015 UT 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869100\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/739/\">\n    349 P.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue is under what circumstances\n   <em>\n    Coroles\n   </em>\n   requires district courts to apply the sanctions set forth in rule 16 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure as opposed to those articulated in rule 26. This is the kind of procedural issue on which it would be helpful for this court to have a full record developed below-one that illustrates the thinking of our district courts on this question and contains factual development bearing on what range of sanctions might fall within the appropriate exercise of a district court's discretion. Such a developed record will naturally sharpen the issues and help us reach a wiser and better considered opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 Ms. Baumann did not preserve her claims that the district court ought to have applied rule 16 instead of rule 26 and that it abused its discretion in declining to find, on the record, that admitting a late-filed expert report whose absence had been the very predicate of all summary judgment proceedings would have been harmless. The court of appeals' decision is affirmed on these alternative grounds; footnote 8 is vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Associate Chief Justice Lee, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 28 I concur in every element of the majority opinion except for footnote 4. That footnote, as the court concedes, \"reache[s] out\" to decide an issue \"that we have found unpreserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 n.4. We are doing so, moreover, in a case in which we are reversing the court of appeals for improperly reaching an unpreserved issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 29 This strikes me as a double standard. We are an appellate court. And we are as subject to the law of preservation as is the court of appeals. We should heed the lessons of our own opinions. When we fail to do so we create the impression that we have confused the finality of our decisions with the infallibility of our decisionmaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 Our court does have power to \"superintend the proper interpretation of the procedural rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 n.4. But our authority to do so is hardly unbounded. We \"superintend\" the rules through the proper exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Or by the promulgation or amendment of our rules of procedure. But not by dropping a footnote\n   resolving an issue that is not properly presented for our decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The district court initially scheduled oral argument on defendants' summary judgment motion for November 17, 2014. At the hearing, Ms. Baumann's husband sought to speak for her.
