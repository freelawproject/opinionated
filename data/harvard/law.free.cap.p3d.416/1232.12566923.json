First, were the e-mails exchanged between the Kittitas County and the Department of Ecology work product? Second, if the e-mails are work product, are they discoverable under the\n   Public Records Act (PRA), chapter 42.56 RCW? We hold that the e-mails are work product because they were prepared by or for Kittitas County in anticipation of litigation. Second, we hold that Kittitas County did not waive its work product protection because disclosure of the e-mails to Ecology never created a significant likelihood that an adversary would also obtain the information.

RESTATEMENT \u00a7 91 cmt. b. First, RCW 70.105.005 obliges Kittitas County and Ecology to cooperate on hazardous waste regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 70.105.005(10) (stating that \"local government is the appropriate level of government to plan for and carry out programs to manage moderate-risk waste,\n   <em>\n    with assistance and coordination provided by\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Ecology\n   </em>\n   ]\" (emphasis added) ). Pursuant to this statutory direction, Kittitas County and Ecology worked together throughout the investigation into Chem-Safe's facility and throughout the appeal. CP at 2002-08. Kittitas County shared litigation strategy with Ecology and asked for its technical assistance on matters relating to the litigation. This common interest between Kittitas County and Ecology was more than a general interest in environmental standards or a mere shared desire to see a similar outcome in a legal matter. Instead, Kittitas County and Ecology shared a common\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   interest to ensure that Chem-Safe\n   complied with both local and state regulations regarding its operation of a hazardous waste facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 38 Second, Kittitas County and Ecology cooperated over a period of several years. From 2008 to 2010, Kittitas County employees and Ecology employees visited the Chem-Safe facility together, e-mailed one another about the matter, and met to discuss the progress of bringing Chem-Safe into compliance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2002-08. After the NOVA was issued and throughout 2011 and 2012, Kittitas County deputy prosecutors e-mailed Ecology employees to discuss litigation strategy and to request technical support on relevant factual matters related to the NOVA litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 781, 2724. The fact that Kittitas County and Ecology cooperated on the NOVA over a period of several years weighs in favor of a finding that they shared a common interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 39 Third, Kittitas County and Ecology engaged in considerable sharing of work product. Although Kittitas County and Ecology did not have a formal confidentiality agreement, no written agreement to maintain confidentiality is required. Kittitas County employees e-mailed Ecology employees several times to discuss litigation-related technical, factual, and regulatory issues and the risks of different litigation positions in the Chem-Safe lawsuit. They also drafted declarations for the litigation, exchanging edits and notes on different versions. Such significant sharing of work product affirms Kittitas County and Ecology's intent to develop a common strategy to defend the NOVA in the related litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 40 Beyond the sharing of work product, there is evidence of other significant cooperation between Kittitas County and Ecology. Kittitas County employees and Ecology employees visited the Chem-Safe facility together several times while working to bring Chem-Safe into compliance with local and state hazardous waste regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2002-08. Kittitas County employees and Ecology employees e-mailed one another and met together to discuss the\n   ongoing issues at\n   Chem-Safe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2002-08. The two also shared relevant information with one another regarding issues with Chem-Safe's compliance, such as a letter from the Idaho State Department of Environmental Quality about Chem-Safe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2008. The NOVA cover letter referenced the participation of both Kittitas County and Ecology in investigating and working with Chem-Safe to resolve issues at its facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1265. This significant level of cooperation between Kittitas County and Ecology further evinces their common interest in the NOVA litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 41 As parties \"similarly aligned on a matter of common interest,\" Kittitas County and Ecology had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality and thus did not waive work product protection by sharing e-mails back and forth.

Waiver of Work Product under the PRA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 42 Despite the common interest between Kittitas County and Ecology, Chem-Safe argues that the PRA entitles it to obtain the e-mails from Ecology. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 43 As public agencies, both Ecology and Kittitas County are subject to required disclosures under the PRA. But, the PRA does not give an adversary the presumptive right to obtain work product.

Ecology's public records officer agreed to refrain from disclosing the disputed e-mails so that the County could seek a court order enjoining disclosure.

The attorney for the County responded that Ecology \"is not my client (Kittitas County is), therefore, these e[-]mails are not attorney-client privileged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776. The County's attorney referred Peck to an assistant attorney general (AAG) for more information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 63 Peck then e-mailed the following to both the County's attorney and the AAG:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   I'm not sure I've encountered this particular situation before viz attorney-client privilege.... I would like to get greater clarity on the question of whether, when advising or discussing with the county in matters bearing on legal issues[,] there\n   exists\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   privilege.\n   <em>\n    This discernment will likely impact content in some communications, as some may bear on legal strategies.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776 (emphasis added). The AAG responded to both Peck and the County's attorney in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   In general terms, I do not think the county would be viewed as part of the state in this instance, particularly because the [Attorney General's Office] is specifically identified as providing legal services to state officials and state agencies, and we do not provide legal assistance to counties. The exception to this is in the criminal context when our office does on occasion take on a criminal matter.\n   <em>\n    Thus, I think the starting assumption should be that if an Ecology staff person shares privileged information with the county sharing that information would likely result in a waiver of any associated privilege.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   That is not to say that there are no options here for keeping information privileged. If there is a particular matter that Ecology and county are working on together and there is likely to be enforcement, there may be an ability for the two entities to enter a joint prosecution agreement-our office has assisted in such agreements in other matters. I don't know enough about the current situation to know whether it might work here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 775 (emphasis added). Peck thanked the AAG for her advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 64 From this exchange, we know that both Ecology and the County expected to share information regarding mental impressions and legal strategies in the underlying litigation and that Ecology, at least, was interested in keeping some of that information confidential. We also know that both Ecology and the County were aware that any materials sent via e-mail might be subject to the PRA because the e-mail exchange specifically includes a notice that \"[a]ll email sent to this address will be received by the Kittitas County email system and may be subject to public disclosure under Chapter 42.56 RCW and to archiving and review.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 777. We further know that both Ecology and the County were specifically advised that the attorney-client\n   privilege was, at best, a questionable basis for protecting confidentiality. And finally, we know that both Ecology and the County were told that there may be options for protecting confidentiality in the context of a specific case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 65 However, there is no indication that either Ecology or the County actually made any further efforts to determine whether or how to protect confidentiality in this specific case. In fact, the record shows precisely the opposite. If the County and Ecology truly had a mutual understanding at the time of disclosure that each would take reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of the other's work product, then there would have been no reason for Ecology to ask whether the unrelated attorney-client privilege would also provide confidentiality. And even if Ecology's nonattorney employee was uncertain, surely the attorney for the County would have at least\n   <em>\n    mentioned\n   </em>\n   the work product or common interest doctrines when responding to his question (unless, of course, the County did not formulate that basis for resisting production until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the disclosures were made). And finally, as noted above, Ecology was prepared to produce the disputed e-mails in response to Allphin's PRA request and was prevented from doing so only because\n   the County filed this declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 66 Ecology thus clearly did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have a mutual understanding with the County that both agencies would maintain the confidentiality of the disputed e-mails. Without such an understanding, the County evinced \"[i]ndifference to\" the substantial likelihood that an adversary could obtain the materials, which \"indicates that protection of the immunity was not important to the person claiming the protection\" at the time of the disclosure.
