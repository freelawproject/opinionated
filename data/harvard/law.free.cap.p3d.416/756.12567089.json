RCW 36.01.050(1) states \"All actions by any county shall be commenced in the superior court of the county in which the defendant resides, or in either of the two judicial districts nearest to the county bringing the action.\" In 2015, the legislature amended the statute to add a new subsection, RCW 36.01.050(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 36.01.050(3) states, \"Any provision in a public works contract with any county that requires actions arising under the contract to be commenced in the superior court of the county is against public policy and the provision is void and unenforceable.\" In February 2015, King County awarded a public works contract to Frank Coluccio Construction Company (FCCC). The contract included a provision that states venue \"shall vest solely in the King County ... Superior Court.\" On December 7, 2016, King County filed a breach of contract lawsuit against FCCC in King County Superior Court. FCCC's principal business office is in Seattle. On December 15, FCCC filed a lawsuit against King County in Snohomish County Superior Court. Citing the 2015 amendment to RCW 36.01.050, FCCC argued the right to venue in Snohomish County. Snohomish County Superior Court dismissed the lawsuit. FCCC filed a counterclaim in the King County lawsuit and a motion to transfer venue to Snohomish County. King County agreed the public works contract venue provision is void but argued it filed the lawsuit in the county where FCCC resides. The court denied the motion to transfer venue. FCCC appeals the Snohomish County Superior Court order granting the motion to dismiss its lawsuit against King County and the King County\n   Superior Court order denying the motion to transfer venue to Snohomish County. We hold the 2015 amendment renders the public works contract venue provision unenforceable but does not abrogate the mandate under RCW 36.01.050(1) that a county shall file a lawsuit against a contractor in the county in which the contractor resides. We affirm the order granting the motion to dismiss and the order denying the motion to transfer venue to Snohomish County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    North Creek Interceptor Sewer Improvement Project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In 2014, King County approved the request for proposal and bidding requirements and contract for the North Creek Interceptor Sewer Improvement Project. The contract required the contractor to use \"Open Face Shield Tunneling\" (OFST) and a specific dewatering system for the project. The contract set milestone dates for the completion of certain stages of the project.

FCCC is a Washington corporation with its principal office located in Seattle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b64 King County awarded the North Creek Interceptor Sewer Improvement Project contract to FCCC in February 2015. The contract required completion of the first milestone by September 23, 2016. FCCC started work on the project on April 26, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b65 In September 2016, FCCC suspended tunneling operations. On October 6, King County notified FCCC its work did not meet the requirements of the contract. King County\n   demanded a \"Corrective Action Plan\" that identified \"specific steps, methods and modifications that FCCC will adopt to make its performance compliant.\" FCCC requested a change in the project specifications to allow the use of a different type of tunneling method and a \"different type of tunnel boring machine, with the added costs to be borne by the County.\" King County did not agree to change the project specifications. FCCC and King County scheduled a mediation for early December 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    King County Lawsuit Against FCCC in King County Superior Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b66 On December 7, King County filed a lawsuit against FCCC in King County Superior Court for breach of contract. The complaint alleged, \"Venue is proper in King County Superior Court pursuant to RCW 36.01.050 and RCW 4.12.025 because defendant FCCC resides in King County, Washington.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lawsuit sought a declaratory judgment that FCCC was in default and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b67 On December 8, King County issued a notice of default. The notice states King County will terminate the contract unless FCCC provides a Corrective Action Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    FCCC Lawsuit Against King County in Snohomish County Superior Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b68 On December 15, FCCC filed a lawsuit against King County for injunctive and declaratory relief and damages in Snohomish County Superior Court. FCCC alleged breach of contract because the OFST method was not feasible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Dismissal of Snohomish County Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b69 King County filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed in Snohomish County Superior Court. FCCC argued because the venue provision in the contract was void and unenforceable under the 2015 amendment to RCW 36.01.050,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   FCCC had the statutory right to file the lawsuit against King County in Snohomish County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b610 King County agreed the venue contract provision was void under the recent amendment to the statute. But King County asserted it filed the lawsuit against FCCC in the county where FCCC resides as mandated under RCW 36.01.050(1). \"FCCC resides (has its home office and does business) in King County, so a suit against FCCC in King County was perfectly proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b611 The Snohomish County Superior Court granted the motion to dismiss. The order states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612 The Court hereby ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. This matter is hereby DISMISSED without prejudice to Plaintiff's right to pursue its claims and remedies against King County in the first-filed lawsuit in King County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. The Snohomish County court is willing to hear this matter if the King County court concludes that venue is proper here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b613 FCCC filed an appeal on January 6, 2017 of the Snohomish County Superior Court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    FCCC Counterclaim and Motion To Transfer Venue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b614 On January 6, 2017, FCCC filed a counterclaim to the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court. The counterclaim seeks breach of contract damages, a declaratory judgment that FCCC is not required to use the OFST method, and an injunction to prevent King County from terminating the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b615 FCCC filed a motion to transfer venue to Snohomish County Superior Court. RCW 4.12.030 permits a change of venue where it appears:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) That the county designated in the complaint is not the proper county; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) That there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein; or\n   (3) That the convenience of witnesses or the ends of justice would be forwarded by the change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b616 FCCC argued the 2015 amendment prohibited venue in King County. FCCC argued venue in King County Superior Court was not proper because \" RCW 36.01.050 grants public works contractors an unqualified right to have their claims against a county heard by an adjoining county's superior court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b617 King County conceded the contract venue provision was void under RCW 36.01.050(3). But King County pointed out the legislature did not modify the mandatory language of RCW 36.01.050(1). Because there is no dispute FCCC resides in King County, King County asserted venue was proper under RCW 36.01.050(1).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   FCCC resides (has its home office and does business) in King County, and as such, the County's choice of venue in King County was authorized (indeed mandated) by the applicable venue statute.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b618 The court denied the motion to transfer venue to Snohomish County Superior Court. The court ruled the contract provision that venue \"shall vest solely in the King County ... Superior Court\" is unenforceable under RCW 36.01.050(3). The court rejected the argument that FCCC had the statutory right to determine venue in the lawsuit filed by King County against FCCC. The court ruled RCW 36.01.050(1) authorized King County to file the lawsuit against FCCC in King County Superior Court because FCCC is a resident of the county. The court also notes that FCCC's right to file a lawsuit against King County is subject to the contract condition precedent.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Under RCW 36.01.050(1), FCCC has a right to elect to file in Snohomish County but this right is restricted by Paragraph 9.2(A)(2) and (3) of the contract. In other words, FCCC's statutory right to select the venue does not exist until it has received a certificate of completion for the entire contract. FCCC argues that it had no option but to accept this language because public works contracts are \"take-it-or leave-it\" agreements. But FCCC has provided no legal authority for the proposition that these provisions are unenforceable or unconscionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   FCCC accepted these provisions when it chose to bid on this project-knowing full well how risky underground tunneling projects can be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b619 On reconsideration, FCCC argued the decision was contrary to RCW 36.01.050(3) and public policy. The court denied the motion for reconsideration but entered an order for certification under RAP 2.3(b)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We granted discretionary review of the order denying FCCC's motion to transfer venue and ordered consolidation with the appeal of the Snohomish County order dismissing the lawsuit filed by FCCC against King County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Order Denying Motion To Transfer Venue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b620 FCCC contends the King County Superior Court erred in denying the motion to transfer venue to Snohomish County Superior Court. FCCC asserts RCW 36.01.050(3) gives public works contractors the absolute right to have their claims heard in an adjoining county. The Associated General Contractors of Washington and National Utility Contractors Association of Washington filed an amicus brief in support of FCCC's argument. King County asserts the 2015 amendment does not change the plain and unambiguous language of RCW 36.01.050(1) that authorizes a county to file a lawsuit against a public works contractor in the county where the contractor resides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b621 The meaning of a statute is a question of law we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Ecology v.
