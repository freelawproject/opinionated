Goins.\n   </em>\n   On September 6, 2017, we issued an opinion in\n   <em>\n    Goins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2061\">\n    2017 UT 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- P.3d ----. After\n   <em>\n    Goins\n   </em>\n   issued, we requested supplemental briefing and asked the parties to address the impact that our holding in\n   <em>\n    Goins\n   </em>\n   may have on Pham's appeal. After reviewing the supplemental briefing and conducting oral argument, we conclude that we improvidently granted the petition for certiorari for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   First, unless and until Utah Rule of Evidence 804 is amended, we believe a Confrontation Clause challenge, like the one Pham presses here, is unlikely to arise again in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Second, a majority of the court, motivated by principles of constitutional avoidance, would have been inclined to bypass the Confrontation Clause question and likely conclude that even if we were to assume a Confrontation Clause violation, any error resulting from the admission of the preliminary hearing testimony would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Because this would have yielded a fact-intensive analysis with little precedential value, we conclude that we improvidently granted the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for certiorari to the Utah Court of Appeals is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FOR THE COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    /s/ John A. Pearce\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   John A. Pearce\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Justice\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
