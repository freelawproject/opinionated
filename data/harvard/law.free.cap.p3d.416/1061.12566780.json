In the 1960s, Bob began working in the nursery business in Tahlequah, and in the early 1970s, he founded Midwestern Nursery. Bob grew and developed Midwestern Nursery, which later became American Nursery Products, and eventually took the company public. Upon his departure from American Nursery Products in the early 1990s, Bob and his son, Burl Berry, who also lives in Tahlequah, formed Tri-B Nursery. The Berrys purchased land near Hulbert, Oklahoma, and began operations in 1992. Wal-Mart was Tri-B Nursery's first customer in the spring of 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In the late 1990s, Tri-B Nursery purchased its first out-of-state nursery, Judkins Nursery, with one location in Tennessee. The Berrys then acquired a nursery in Quincy, Florida, and subsequently bought Zelenka Nursery out of bankruptcy, thereby acquiring another nursery in Tennessee and nurseries in both Michigan and North Carolina. The Berrys then purchased an Oregon nursery, Zelenka West, out of bankruptcy. With such acquisition, Tri-B Nursery, or Berry Family Nurseries as it became known, emerged as one of the largest, if not the largest wholesale nursery business in the United States. Berry Family Nurseries specialized in the sale of trees, shrubs, rose bushes, and perennials to national and regional retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowe's, Sam's Club, K-Mart, ShopKo, Rural King, and Meijer, and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. Berry Family Nurseries maintained offices in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and Grand Haven, Michigan, and employed more than 400 people at seven nurseries in six states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The Berrys also owned Sanders Nursery and Distribution Center, a retail nursery business with locations in Wagoner County and Rogers County, Oklahoma. Bob also owned an interest in a California wholesale nursery, Rosetree Nursery, that specialized in rose sales. In 2009, the Berrys purchased Park Hill Nursery (Park Hill), a nursery located in Tahlequah. At the time of the purchase, Park Hill was roughly 300-350 acres, and the Berrys paid just over $3 million for the sale. Park Hill was a supplier to Berry Family Nurseries and employed about 150 people. Until recent events, Park Hill was not a competitor to Berry Family Nurseries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In early 2010, Berry Family Nurseries was heavily indebted and facing pressure from its lenders to infuse more than $20 million of equity into the business. The Berrys engaged a business broker to find an investor for Berry Family Nurseries. In the spring of 2010, the broker for the Berrys approached Insight Equity, a Texas investment company with headquarters in Southlake, Texas, about investing in Berry Family Nurseries. Insight Equity, a private-equity firm specializing in the acquisition of middle-market companies, was interested in Berry Family Nurseries because of its national scope and customer base. Insight Equity saw the opportunity to expand Berry Family Nurseries by acquiring other wholesale nurseries and to make Berry Family Nurseries more profitable by strengthening management and consolidating decentralized administrative functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In mid-2010, Insight Equity sought to purchase Berry Family Nurseries and negotiations began. The Berrys were represented by counsel from both Oklahoma and Texas, and Insight Equity was represented by counsel from Texas. Negotiations were conducted primarily by phone calls and email exchanges and took the better part of six months to\n   finalize. During Insight Equity's due diligence efforts, Insight Equity partners traveled to each of the nurseries owned by Berry Family Nurseries in Oklahoma, Florida, Michigan, Oregon, Tennessee, and North Carolina. In August of 2010, the Berrys met with Insight Equity partners at their Southlake, Texas office and signed a Letter of Intent regarding the eventual purchase of Berry Family Nurseries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In November of 2010, Insight Equity formed BFN Properties and BFN Operations (BFN) to make the acquisition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of BFN's officers were Insight Equity partners who lived, worked, and maintained offices in the Insight Equity Southlake, Texas office. BFN opened and maintained bank accounts with several Dallas-area banks, and although BFN registered to do business in Oklahoma, BFN's Application for Employer Identification Number, filed with the federal government shortly after BFN's formation, listed Tarrant County, Texas, as BFN's principal place of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On December 7, 2010, the deal closed with BFN electronically signing the Purchase Agreement (Agreement) in Texas and the Berrys electronically signing the Agreement in Oklahoma. Pursuant to the Agreement, BFN purchased Berry Family Nurseries for $160 million. Park Hill was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   included in the sale, but the Agreement included a three-year option allowing BFN to purchase Park Hill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sanders Nursery and Rosetree Nursery were also\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   included in the sale. The $160 million purchase price included assets of the business, debt assumption by BFN, and the Park Hill Purchase Option. The Berrys received millions of dollars in cash at closing, an \"earn out\" pursuant to which they could have earned tens of millions of dollars more based on BFN's financial performance, and the right to receive a portion of the proceeds from any profitable sale of BFN. At closing, BFN also paid millions of dollars to the Berrys' creditors, repaid a $30 million term loan, which released Bob and Burl from personal liability, and paid $21 million on a revolver note reducing the Berrys' personal liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The Agreement entered into by the parties contained a choice-of-law provision that provides that the Agreement \"shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Texas....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Agreement also contained a five-year non-compete provision, prohibiting the Berrys from owning a company anywhere in the United States that competed with the business acquired by BFN, i.e., the wholesale nursery business, until December 7, 2015. The non-compete allowed the Berrys to continue to own and operate Park Hill, Sanders Nursery, and Rosetree Nursery so long as such entities did not compete with BFN\n   <em>\n    while being owned by the Berrys\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Agreement also contained a five-year non-solicit provision, prohibiting the Berrys from soliciting the customers acquired by BFN in the purchase until December 7, 2015. Pursuant to separate Employment Agreements, Burl stayed on with BFN as the Chief Operating Officer, and Bob stayed on as the Chief Executive Officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 For the next three years, both BFN and the Berrys performed under the terms of the Agreement, and business continued as usual for the Berrys. Burl remained largely responsible for BFN's on-the-ground nursery operations and remained intimately involved in BFN's sales to its largest customers. Burl continued to operate Park Hill as well, and in fact, Park Hill became profitable for the first time in large part because it became BFN's largest supplier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the spring of 2012, pursuant to the terms of the original Agreement, BFN refinanced its revolver loan, which released the Berrys from their guarantees of more than $100 million of bank debt. In June of 2012, the Berrys' employment contracts expired. Bob's contract was not renewed, but he stayed on with BFN as a consultant. Burl renegotiated his employment contract with BFN, and in the fall of 2012, he agreed to remain COO of BFN in exchange for BFN writing off yet another $2.7 million in Park Hill debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The three-year purchase option for Park Hill expired on December 7, 2013, with BFN opting\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to purchase Park Hill. Less than three weeks later, on December 30, 2013, Burl notified BFN he would be resigning from BFN effective January 31, 2014. On February 21, 2014, BFN executives met with Burl to discuss his exit from the company. As we discuss in greater detail below, four days after that meeting, Burl began selling plants, trees, and shrubs, through Park Hill, directly to BFN's largest customers, including Wal-Mart and Home Depot. Upon learning of Burl's actions, BFN sent letters to its customers on or around March 10, 2014, advising them that Bob and Burl Berry \"and entities controlled by either of them\" were subject to a non-compete agreement with BFN and that any business dealings with the Berrys were impermissible under such agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 On March 11, 2014, Burl Berry, Bob Berry, and Park Hill Nursery filed this action in the District Court of Cherokee County, seeking a declaration that the covenants were unenforceable and void under Oklahoma law. BFN filed a counterclaim against the Berrys, seeking damages and to enjoin the Berrys from violating the covenants. The trial court held a five-day non-jury trial beginning on June 29, 2015, and issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on August 19, 2015, wherein the court found that the Texas choice-of-law provision was valid and that the covenants were enforceable under Texas law. The court found the Berrys had violated the covenants and enjoined the Berrys from further violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Final Journal Entry of Judgment was filed on October 15, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Berrys and Park Hill appealed, and BFN filed a counter-appeal. We retained the case, and stayed the enforcement of the trial court's injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Briefing was completed on January 17, 2017, and we held oral argument in the case on June 5, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Texas Choice-of-Law Provision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The trial court determined that the Texas choice-of-law provision was valid and should be enforced.

Nor is there any doubt that the non-compete, as written, applied to the operations at Park Hill. The only concern then is that the non-compete prevents the Berrys from engaging in a competing business anywhere in the United States-as opposed to \"a specified county and any county or counties contiguous thereto, or a specified city or town or any part thereof.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, \u00a7 218 explicitly provides that boundaries \"which exceed[ ] the territorial limitations\" do not render the covenant invalid. Rather, we limit enforcement of the covenant to those areas authorized by the statute. In this case, Tri-B Nursery, one of the nurseries purchased in the Agreement, is in the same county as Park Hill (Cherokee County). Therefore, limiting the enforcement of the non-compete to its permitted extent would still encompass operations at Park Hill, and the non-compete would be enforceable under Oklahoma law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b618 Thus, we conclude that enforcement of the non-compete under Texas law does not violate Oklahoma public policy in this case. We need not address whether enforcement of the non-solicit under Texas law violates Oklahoma public policy because the non-solicit \"was intended to be ancillary to and complement the [n]on-[c]ompete[ ],\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    and the non-compete is enforceable. As we discuss in detail below, the Berrys breached the non-compete, and because the non-solicit was less restrictive than the non-compete, any breach of the non-solicit was also a breach of the non-compete.

Burl met with Wal-Mart buyers at Park Hill less than a week later wherein Wal-Mart purchased more than 250,000 trees and shrubs from\n    Park Hill for its promotion for almost $2 million. The trees and shrubs sold to Wal-Mart that day had previously been offered by Park Hill to BFN to help fulfill its obligation to Wal-Mart for that promotion. In fact, the record indicates that on the same day Burl met with Wal-Mart buyers at Park Hill, Burl received a text message from someone at BFN asking if BFN needed to put in a purchase order with Park Hill to \"hold all the shrubs, roses and other things they usually get from Parkhill,\" indicating that had Burl\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    sold the Park Hill inventory to Wal-Mart for its tree and shrub promotion, BFN would have purchased the inventory and remained the supplier for that promotion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b621 After Wal-Mart purchased the trees and shrubs for that particular promotion, Burl then continued to sell to Wal-Mart.

BFN's expert calculated such lost profits at $8,212,404.00.\n    <footnotemark>\n     41\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Berrys offered no evidence, by way of expert testimony or otherwise, to dispute BFN's calculation of such damages. Rather, the Berrys' sole argument at trial and on appeal is that the Berrys'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    breach was not the cause of BFN's damages with regard to sales to Wal-Mart and Home Depot. The trial court's\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    finding on damages was: \"[B]FN failed to establish it would have continued to sell to Wal-Mart and Home Depot but for the interference of the Berrys or Park Hill. Therefore, no monetary damages are awarded.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     42\n    </footnotemark>\n    For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the trial court's finding that BFN was not entitled to monetary damages for the Berrys' breach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    \u00b630 Much was made at trial about the unique purchasing cycle of the nursery industry. At trial, Burl explained the nursery planting cycle as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    [W]e go through the planting process. We have to plant-we have to plant in the spring of the year our bare root trees. You've got to typically plant the bare root trees in January, February, and March for the whole-for your fall business or for the next spring. So, you've got to plan it out. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    Then, you go to the line review process. ... The line review process is where you go in to basically see a vendor, i.e., be it Wal-Mart or Lowe's. ... Typically it happens in July or August. ... You go in, and you present your prices. You present the products that you have to sell for the next year. And you basically have an idea of the area that you'd like to ship that's compatible to the products you have. And you usually go over for the day, and you make that presentation. And then typically, sometimes it was as late as December before you would hear back from them. ... And that would be the first time that you could take those areas, arrive and write some preliminary orders and know what inventory you're really going to need. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    The next step would be the shipments. Send them back to Wal-Mart. Get PO's. Get hard PO's on them. And plan to ship them in the spring or at the next-at the determined proper time, you know, the next spring.\n    <footnotemark>\n     43\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \u00b631 Wal-Mart's head buyer, Mr. Cowgur, also testified that\n    <em>\n     particularly\n    </em>\n    for a company the size of Wal-Mart, horticulture inventory has to be planned out years in advance to ensure supply is available in the large quantities needed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     44\n    </footnotemark>\n    When asked why Wal-Mart continued to do business with BFN after the March 2014 tree and shrub promotion, Mr. Cowgur responded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    A: We didn't have a choice. We-BFN is a big company, and they were in our top ten as far as volume goes. And when you look at what it takes to plan out the horticulture business specifically in trees and shrubs,\n    <em>\n     long lead times; three, four, five, six, sometimes seven years on product\n    </em>\n    . And quite frankly, you know, so many folks have closed up shop. We-we needed product to be able to sell to our customer. So not that we wanted to, but we did. ...\n    <em>\n     I'm just saying there was no other product available anywhere else, so we didn't have a choice.

When asked if prior to his departure from BFN, whether he \"anticipated that that product would be shipped to Home Depot under BFN[,]\" Burl responded, \"[p]rior to my leaving, yes, that was our plan.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     46\n    </footnotemark>\n    In addition, when asked whether Park Hill anticipated selling inventory already in the ground to BFN for the spring 2014 season so that BFN could then sell it to Wal-Mart, Burl replied, \"[n]ot only Wal-Mart. Lowe's ... Home Depot, any accounts.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     47\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    \u00b633 A claim for lost profits need not be proven with \"absolute certainty,\" and \" '[i]n essence, what a [party] must show for the recovery of lost profits is\n    <em>\n     sufficient certainty that reasonable minds might believe from a preponderance of the evidence that such damages were actually suffered\n    </em>\n    .' \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     48\n    </footnotemark>\n    Upon Burl's departure from BFN on January 31, 2014, Park Hill immediately began selling inventory directly to Wal-Mart and Home Depot-inventory that Burl specifically testified was to be sold to BFN for the spring 2014 season so BFN could sell to Wal-Mart and Home Depot. The question then is not whether the Berrys' breach caused BFN damages-it most certainly did-the question, rather, is what are BFN's damages? On remand the trial court shall determine BFN's damages for lost profits on the Home Depot and Wal-Mart accounts. Although a \"non-breaching party may not receive more in damages than he might or could have gained from full performance\" of the contract, we make no determination whether BFN is entitled to damages beyond December 7, 2015, and leave that question to the trial court to determine on remand.\n    <footnotemark>\n     49\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Tortious Interference\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    \u00b634 BFN also alleged that Park Hill tortiously interfered with BFN's Agreement with the Berrys.\n    <footnotemark>\n     50\n    </footnotemark>\n    BFN argues that \"[b]ecause the sales to Wal-Mart and Home Depot in violation of the Covenants were all made by Park Hill, the damages from the Berrys' breach of the Covenants\n    <em>\n     and Park Hill's interference with them\n    </em>\n    are the same.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     51\n    </footnotemark>\n    The trial court found \"Park Hill tortiously interfered with the Covenants\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     52\n    </footnotemark>\n    because Park Hill \"intentionally and knowingly\" participated in the violation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     53\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, the trial court found BFN \"failed to prove monetary damages.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     54\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Berrys made no claim of error on appeal with regard to the court's finding that Park Hill tortiously interfered with the Agreement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     55\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, the trial court's finding remains undisturbed in that regard, and the only issue on appeal is whether the trial court correctly concluded BFN failed to prove monetary damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    \u00b635 Because we are remanding the case to the trial court to determine BFN's damages for the Berrys' breach, we also remand the case for the trial court to reconsider damages with regard to BFN's tortious interference claim against Park Hill. Although BFN agrees that damages from the Berrys' breach and Park Hill's interference are the same, BFN is entitled to reassert its claim for punitive damages against Park Hill on remand upon the trial court's determination of BFN's damages for lost profits on the Home Depot and Wal-Mart accounts.\n    <footnotemark>\n     56\n    </footnotemark>\n    In addition, on remand, Park Hill is entitled to a reduction of $439,000.00 on any judgment against it as the trial court correctly concluded BFN owed Park Hill $439,000.00 on an open account.\n    <footnotemark>\n     57\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Attorney's Fees\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b636 The Final Journal Entry of Judgment also concluded that BFN, as the prevailing party, was entitled to reasonable attorney's fees with the \"amount [to] be determined by separate application.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     58\n    </footnotemark>\n    Although the trial court did not specify whether it was awarding attorney's fees to BFN under Texas or Oklahoma law, BFN sought attorney's fees pursuant to Section 38.001(8) of the Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code.\n    <footnotemark>\n     59\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Berrys appealed the trial court's finding, asserting that the trial court erred \"in ruling BFN is entitled to attorneys fees and costs ... under \u00a7 38.001(8) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\" because, among other reasons, the court \"erred procedurally in not allowing the issue to be fully briefed by both parties.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     60\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because the trial court did not set an amount for attorney's fees in the Final Journal Entry of Judgment, that portion of the judgment is an interlocutory ruling.

In\n     <em>\n      Florafax\n     </em>\n     this Court addressed the standard for assessment of damages for lost profits in a breach of contract case, and specifically discussed lost profits from a third-party collateral contract. In that case, Florafax International, Inc. sued GTE Market Resources for breaching a contract that required GTE to provide telecommunication and telemarketing services to Florafax. However, part of the damages sought by Florafax was profits lost under a collateral contract Florafax had with a third party that was canceled because of GTE's breach of its contract with Florafax. The jury determined that GTE breached its contract with Florafax, and in addition to other damages, awarded Florafax damages for lost profits Florafax would have earned under its collateral contract with the third party.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-133\">\n     This Court affirmed the jury's award and found that an award in the form of lost profits is \"generally considered a common measure of damages for breach of contract, [and] frequently represents fulfillment of the non-breaching party's expectation interest....

Record on Appeal, Non-Jury Trial Proceedings at 1075. The ledger includes invoices for Park Hill Plants and Park Hill Plants &amp; Trees ranging from August 29, 2013, to June 29, 2014. Other exhibits in the record relied on by BFN, including Exhibit 159 at page 18, do not support BFN's claim for setoff. Page 18 of Exhibit 159 is a chart showing \"YTD Cost of Sales Update/Inventory Bridge,\" and does not reflect any amount owed by Park Hill to BFN. Park Hill did not address BFN's setoff claim in its Combined Reply and Answer Brief on appeal. Regardless, the evidence relied on by BFN is incomplete, at best, with regard to its setoff claim. Thus, we defer to the trial court's finding that BFN failed to prove setoff.
