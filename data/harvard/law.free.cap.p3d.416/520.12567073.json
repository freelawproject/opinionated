Three days before his sentencing hearing and while represented by counsel, Rettig attempted to withdraw his guilty plea by submitting a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   letter to the district court. Rettig later acquired new counsel, who moved to withdraw Rettig's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion. The court subsequently sentenced Rettig to terms of twenty-five years to life for aggravated murder and fifteen years to life for aggravated kidnapping, with the sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Rettig urges us to set aside his guilty plea on direct appeal, contending that the district court erred in accepting his plea because his plea affidavit does not establish the necessary facts to sustain a conviction for his charges. He also asserts a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Recognizing that this court has long held that it cannot review a defendant's guilty plea unless he has complied with Utah's Plea Withdrawal Statute, UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-6, Rettig also challenges this statute as unconstitutional. He argues that section 77-13-6(2) infringes his right to an appeal under article I, section 12 of the Utah Constitution. And he urges us to hold that the legislature lacks the constitutional power to require that he pursue his claim through the Post-Conviction Remedies Act, as set forth in section 77-13-6(2)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 We affirm. We do so substantially on grounds set forth in the concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Gailey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    2016 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    379 P.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lee, A.C.J., concurring). The majority in\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   held that the Plea Withdrawal Statute \"does not on its face violate the constitutional right to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. We confirm\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   's holding and threshold premise. But we also decide an issue that the\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   majority did not reach. We hold that the Plea Withdrawal Statute is constitutional as applied because the statute does not foreclose an appeal but simply sets a rule of preservation and imposes a sanction (waiver of the issue on appeal) for the failure to follow that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In November 2009, Benjamin Rettig and Martin Bond traveled from Vernal, Utah, to the home of Kay Mortensen in Spanish Fork, Utah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mortensen owned a large supply of firearms that were located in a \"bunker\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   behind his home. Bond and Rettig traveled to his home with the intent to steal some of his firearms. The two entered Mortensen's home with a handgun while wearing ski masks and latex gloves. They zip tied Mortensen and demanded that he show them where his firearms were stored. After Mortensen showed them the bunker, Rettig and Bond took him to an upstairs bathroom. Bond ordered Mortensen to kneel down in front of the tub with his back toward Bond and Rettig. At this point Rettig was holding the handgun and pointing it at Mortensen. Bond withdrew a knife from his pocket and then put it back. Bond then went downstairs while Rettig held Mortensen at gunpoint. Bond returned with a larger knife. Rettig then watched as Bond killed Mortensen by slicing his throat multiple times and stabbing him in the base of the neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 A short time later Pamela and Roger Mortensen knocked on Mortensen's door. Rettig ran downstairs and hid behind the front door with the handgun while Bond opened the door. When Pamela and Roger entered the home, Rettig ordered them into the living room where he and Bond placed zip ties on their hands and feet. Bond went into the kitchen and returned with another knife. This time Rettig stepped in front of Bond and told him not to kill Pamela and Roger. Rettig stayed in the living room with the handgun while Bond removed approximately twenty-five firearms along with ammunition and placed them in their vehicle. Bond and Rettig told Roger and Pamela to inform the \"police that three black men had tied them up and [that] if they told the police a different story, [Rettig and Bond] knew where they lived and ... would come back and kill them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 It was not until December 2010 that police arrested Rettig and Bond. Rettig was charged with aggravated murder (a capital offense), two counts of aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated burglary. Rettig obtained counsel and entered a plea agreement whereby he pled guilty to one count of aggravated murder and one count of aggravated kidnapping. As part of the plea agreement the prosecutor dropped the other charges, agreed not to seek the death penalty, and agreed to recommend the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Approximately six weeks later, while still represented by his original counsel, Rettig sent a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   letter to the district court seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. He was concerned that his attorney \"never asked [him for] an entire statement regarding the events\" surrounding the murder. He also raised other concerns. At that point Rettig's counsel withdrew. Rettig then obtained new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 During the sentencing hearing Rettig's new counsel explained to the district court that he had reviewed Rettig's motion to withdraw and had a \"very candid, very open\" discussion with his client about his case with some of his staff present. Rettig's new counsel explained to the court that during their discussion he determined that Rettig's motion was based on a \"misunderstanding of the application of certain legal terminologies-explained to [Rettig by] ... jailhouse lawyers\"-which led Rettig to have \"a false impression on what the law was.\" To address Rettig's concerns, the new counsel had Rettig explain \"at length\" the facts of the case and \"gave him numerous opportunities to adjust his facts.\" His counsel then explained the \"legal issues\" and \"why [Rettig's] arguments weren't wholly accurate.\" He explained to his client \"what the law was and also how those facts that he provided ... fit into the category of\" the charged crimes. Based on these interactions, the new counsel withdrew Rettig's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court proceeded with the sentencing hearing on December 13, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Rettig later filed this appeal. On appeal he seeks to set aside his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Utah's Plea Withdrawal Statute controls the timing and grounds for a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. The statute requires that the \"request to withdraw ... be made by motion before sentence is announced,\" UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-6(2)(b), and that the defendant show that the \"plea of guilty ... was not knowingly and voluntarily made,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(a). A defendant who fails to seek to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing is left to raise the issue in a petition filed under the Post-Conviction Remedies Act (PCRA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 Rettig advances three grounds for establishing that his guilty plea was involuntary. He argues first that his original counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead guilty, second that his later counsel was ineffective for withdrawing Rettig's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and lastly that the facts in his plea affidavit cannot establish sufficient intent for accomplice liability for aggravated murder. We do not reach the merits of these claims because we conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction to address them given that Rettig failed to preserve his claims by not withdrawing his guilty plea until after sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Recognizing our long line of precedents holding that we lack appellate jurisdiction to review untimely withdrawals of guilty pleas, Rettig contends that the Plea Withdrawal Statute is unconstitutional. He advances two principal grounds for challenging the statute. First he argues that the statute violates his right to appeal under article I, section 12 of the Utah Constitution, which provides defendants \"the right to appeal in all cases.\" Second he claims that the legislature lacks the constitutional power to require that he pursue his claim in a PCRA proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-6(2)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 We reject Rettig's constitutional challenges. We conclude that the Plea Withdrawal Statute does not infringe the constitutional right to appeal because it does not foreclose an appeal but simply establishes a rule of preservation. And we uphold the constitutionality of the subsection (2)(c) reservation of a right to file a post-conviction petition under the PCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Rettig first argues that the Plea Withdrawal Statute infringes his right to appeal under article I, section 12 of the Utah Constitution. Section 12 gives criminal defendants \"the right to appeal in all cases.\" UTAH CONST. art. I, \u00a7 12. Rettig asserts that the statute's timing requirement forecloses his right to a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 This court recently confronted this issue in\n   <em>\n    Gailey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    2016 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    379 P.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   held that the Plea Withdrawal Statute \"does not on its face violate the constitutional right to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The court characterized the statute as a \"procedural bar\" on a defendant's right to withdraw a guilty plea after sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We confirm\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   's holding and threshold premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 The\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   majority left open an additional question-whether the Plea Withdrawal Statute could be\n   <em>\n    applied\n   </em>\n   in a manner infringing the state constitutional right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The majority opinion deemed that question unripe because the appellant retained a right to challenge the validity of her plea in a post-conviction review proceeding, complained only about the lack of a right to counsel under the PCRA, and could eventually be entitled to counsel in a future proceeding under the PCRA.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Given the likelihood that Gailey might ultimately be afforded the core element of an appeal that she claimed to be lacking under the PCRA, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   reserved for another day an answer to the question whether the Plea Withdrawal Statute could be applied in a manner infringing the constitutional right to an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 We now reach the question left unanswered in\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   . And we resolve this case on the grounds set forth in the concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Lee, A.C.J., concurring), and reinforced by\n   <em>\n    State v. Allgier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2084\">\n    2017 UT 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567074\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/546/\">\n    416 P.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   concurrence noted that \"[t]he Plea Withdrawal Statute does not foreclose an appeal\" but simply establishes a rule of preservation or waiver.\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    2016 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    379 P.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also observed that this effect of the Plea Withdrawal Statute is hardly novel. \"Rules of this sort are commonplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 35. \"They are embedded in our caselaw under the law of preservation and reflected in our rules of procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (footnote omitted). Such rules establish standards of preservation: They \"require parties to raise issues or arguments at specified times and by certain means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And they establish a sanction for the failure to preserve: \"[T]hey treat a failure to comply [with the preservation standard] as a waiver\n   of the right to raise such issues later in the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 This highlights the core defect in Rettig's argument. Rules requiring preservation of an issue at specific times and by required means \"have never been thought to impinge on the constitutional right to an appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Such rules simply establish the concept of waiver in litigation. And that is uncontroversial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 \"Rules of preservation and waiver or forfeiture\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   foreclose the right to raise an issue on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. \"They cannot be unconstitutional on that basis alone, unless we are prepared to say that such rules are\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And of course we cannot so conclude. Rules of preservation are a longstanding component of the law of procedure in the trial courts. We hold that such rules do not infringe the right to an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 The Plea Withdrawal Statute is like rule 12 of the rules of criminal procedure. Both set timing requirements for the filing of certain motions (a preservation rule). And both prescribe sanctions for the failure to meet the required deadline (waiver, with a bar on even plain error review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Such rules do not \"foreclose an appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. They simply prescribe a sanction for the failure to satisfy the timing deadlines set forth in the rule. And that effect is as wide-ranging as it is commonplace. We would not think to strike down criminal rule 12 as foreclosing the state constitutional right to an appeal. We would reject that claim on the ground that rules of preservation and waiver simply narrow the issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 We reach that same conclusion here. We hold that the Plea Withdrawal Statute is not an infringement of the state constitutional right to an appeal because it does not foreclose an appeal but only narrows the issues that may be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 In so concluding we are not suggesting that no timing requirement could infringe a criminal defendant's right to appeal. A thirty-minute filing requirement for a notice of appeal would undoubtedly infringe the state constitutional right to appeal. And perhaps an \"absurdly short\" time window for withdrawal of a guilty plea would be similarly problematic.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109. If an operative rule of preservation eliminates any meaningful avenue for appellate review then it could certainly be said to infringe the important right to an appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 But Rettig is not challenging the Plea Withdrawal Statute on this ground. The argument here goes not to the length of the time window for filing a motion to withdraw a guilty plea but to the procedural bar imposed for missing that filing deadline. And that effect of the Plea Withdrawal Statute is hardly unusual. We cannot strike it down on that basis unless we are willing to call into question any of a range of case-based or rules-based principles of preservation and waiver. We uphold the Plea Withdrawal Statute on that basis. The statute does not infringe the constitutional right to appeal but only sets the terms and conditions for preservation and waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 The concurrence resists this approach on the ground that rules of preservation or waiver are always subject to exceptions-for plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-90. Because our cases have treated the Plea Withdrawal Statute as establishing a \"jurisdictional\" bar\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to plain error review, the concurrence claims that my approach will unsettle our case law in this field.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 This is a false dichotomy. Not every rule of preservation or waiver is subject to a plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel exception. Some such rules are \"jurisdictional\" in the sense of foreclosing these exceptions. The Plea Withdrawal Statute is unquestionably that kind of rule. But it is also unquestionably a rule of preservation or waiver-not a statute barring an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b627 The standard set forth in the Plea Withdrawal Statute is\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   a rule of preservation and a jurisdictional bar on appellate consideration of matters not properly preserved. This is not unique to the Plea Withdrawal Statute. Some of the preservation standards in our rules of procedure are along the same lines-they prescribe a rule of preservation and establish a waiver sanction that stands as a jurisdictional bar on appellate consideration of matters not properly preserved.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , UTAH R. CIV. P. 12(h) ; UTAH R. CRIM. P. 12(f) ;\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-33 (discussing these rules and explaining that a preservation rule can establish a jurisdictional bar on appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 The law of preservation or waiver is diverse. Some such rules are set forth in common law decisions of this court. Our cases, for example, articulate the general rule that an appellant may not raise an error on appeal unless he has given the trial court a meaningful opportunity to avoid that error below.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Superior Prop. Mgmt. Servs., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955095\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/321/1054/\">\n    2013 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955095\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/321/1054/\">\n    321 P.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is the common law of preservation. And this general rule is subject to exceptions established by our case law-principally in the doctrines of plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    State v. Holgate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11224122\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/10/346/\">\n    2000 UT 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11224122\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/10/346/\">\n    10 P.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plain error);\n   <em>\n    State v.

The criminal rules, for example, require that certain motions (like a motion for a change of venue) be made \"not later than 14 days after the party learns\" of the \"grounds\" for the motion, UTAH R. CRIM. P. 29(d)(5), and that others (such as a request for severance of charges) \"be raised at least 7 days prior to the trial,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12(c). Standards of preservation or waiver also appear in criminal rules 19 and 24.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   19(e) (requiring that a party raise an objection to a written jury instruction \"before the instructions are given to the jury\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   24(c) (mandating that a motion for new trial be made \"not later than 14 days after entry of the sentence, or within such further time as the court may fix\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b630 The operative rule on preservation and waiver in the civil realm is civil rule 12. Rule 12(a) generally requires a defendant to \"serve an answer within 21 days after the service of the summons and complaint is complete.\" UTAH R. CIV. P. 12(a). It also says that this general standard is altered where the defendant files a \"motion under this rule\"-the answer is then due \"within 14 days after notice of the court's action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12(a)(1). Civil rule 12 also says that certain matters must be raised by motion. It says that a defense of lack of jurisdiction, venue, insufficiency of process or service, failure to state a claim, or failure to join an indispensable party, should be raised by a motion filed \"before pleading if a further pleading is permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (12)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b631 Rule 12 also prescribes the consequence-typically waiver-resulting from the failure to follow these rules of preservation. It states that the failure to include in a motion a defense \"then available which this rule permits to be raised by motion\" forecloses the party's right \"thereafter\" to \"make a motion based on any of the defenses or objections so omitted, except as provided in subdivision (h).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12(g). And rule 12(h) sets forth an express sanction of waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12(h) (waiver of certain defenses if not presented by motion or answer or reply).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b632 The above rules may or may not be subject to common law exceptions to the case-based rule of preservation. It all depends on the language and structure of the applicable rule of procedure.

The statute and these rules all do the same thing: (a) they set a time for filing a particular kind of motion (a rule of preservation); (b) they prescribe a consequence for failing to file in time (waiver of the issue); and (c) they preclude consideration of the merits of the issue on appeal (in a manner we treat as jurisdictional).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b644 That shows that the dichotomy advanced by the concurrence is a false one.

The statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   is quite distinct from the one in place now. The 1980 statute \"set[ ] no time limit for filing a motion to withdraw [a guilty] plea.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10413039\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/740/1309/#p1311\">\n    740 P.2d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With that in mind, the\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   court was concerned about the possibility that a motion to withdraw could be filed while the case was pending on appeal-either mooting the current appeal (if the motion were granted) or at least introducing \"the possibility of appeals from two different judgments in the same criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . On that basis the\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   court \"remand[ed] the case to enable the defendant to file a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas\" while \"retain[ing] jurisdiction over the case for any necessary future action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b646 Our cases later viewed\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   as opening the door to consideration of the merits of an unpreserved motion to withdraw a guilty plea \"if plain error or exceptional circumstances exist[ed].\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Gibbons\n   </em>\n   line of cases, in other words, viewed the 1980 Plea Withdrawal Statute as establishing no standard of preservation to begin with (no time limit on filing a motion). Alternatively, these cases can be understood to view the 1980 statute as opening the door to plain error review of the merits of an unpreserved motion to withdraw\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   the statute set no time limit. But that is not because rules of preservation are always subject to plain error review. It is because the court viewed the controlling statute to be open to such review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b647 And that conclusion cannot hold under the current version of the Plea Withdrawal Statute. That statute sets a strict rule of preservation-a requirement that a motion to withdraw be filed before the sentence is imposed. UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-6(2)(b). And it prescribes a strict waiver sanction that forecloses review for plain error on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474732\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/630/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(c) (\"\n   <em>\n    Any challenge\n   </em>\n   to a guilty plea not made within the time period specified in Subsection (2)(b) shall be pursued under\" the PCRA.

Our point in\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   was not that statutory standards for filing plea withdrawal motions go inherently to \"jurisdiction\" and not \"preservation\" (as the concurrence here suggests). It was that the 1989 amendment to the Plea Withdrawal Statute set a strict time deadline\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   for filing a motion to withdraw and that a failure to meet that deadline \"extinguishes a defendant's right to challenge the validity of the guilty plea on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474732\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/630/\">\n    2002 UT 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474732\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/630/\">\n    40 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it was that conclusion-rooted in the language and structure of the statute-that led to the\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   court's determination that the Plea Withdrawal Statute foreclosed plain error review of the merits of an unpreserved motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b649 For these reasons our approach does not overturn the\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.

And in so doing it characterizes various provisions of the statute as either \"procedural\" or \"substantive\" and holds that the only provision challenged by Rettig-subsection 2(c)-is so \"inextricably intertwined\" with substantive elements of the statute that it is \"substantive\" and thus within the legislature's power under article VIII, section 4.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b656 The concurrence's discussion of the \"procedural\" and \"substantive\" elements of the statute is both troubling and unnecessarily confusing.

And it doesn't become quasi-procedural just because we refer to it as a provision that \"manages the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125.

This question is not properly presented, as again the only provision that is challenged by Rettig-subsection 2(c)-is plainly within the legislature's constitutional power. And the \"inextricably intertwined\" analysis in the concurrence at least implies that subsection (2)(b) would withstand scrutiny under article VIII, section 4 even if it is plainly procedural.

The statute establishes a rule of preservation, and such rules do not foreclose an appeal.

The majority holds that he has failed to establish that we have jurisdiction over this appeal. While I agree that Mr. Rettig has failed to establish that we have jurisdiction, I disagree with the majority's analysis of the constitutional right to appeal and of the constitutionality of Utah Code section 77-13-6(2)(c) under article VIII, section 4 of the Utah Constitution.

While the majority attempts to grant this court the authority to limit our own jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the other courts in this state, the language of the Utah Constitution does not support such an interpretation. Article VIII, section 3 governs the jurisdiction of this court, and article VIII, section 5 governs the jurisdiction of every other court in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b671 Article VIII, section 3 provides that this court \"\n   <em>\n    shall have\n   </em>\n   appellate jurisdiction over all ... matters to be exercised as provided by statute,\" and that we\n   <em>\n    \"shall have\n   </em>\n   original jurisdiction to issue all extraordinary writs and to answer questions of state law certified by a court of the United States.\" UTAH CONST. art. VIII, \u00a7 3 (emphases added). There is not much wiggle room in this language. This constitutional provision defines the outer limits of our power, and its use of \"shall\" mandates that this court cannot expand or limit our own jurisdiction. Indeed, the legislature cannot even limit our appellate jurisdiction. It can only require that we exercise our appellate jurisdiction \"as provided by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It typically does so by requiring certain categories of appeals\n   to pass through the court of appeals prior to reaching this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b672 Similarly, the Utah Constitution defines the jurisdiction of our district courts.

VIII, \u00a7 5 (emphasis added). Contrary to the majority's holding, the \"power [of the district court] to reach a certain question presented\" is not, and cannot, be limited by a rule of procedure promulgated by this court.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. The constitution is clear; the district court \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   have original jurisdiction in all matters\" unless the constitution itself, or a statute that complies with our constitution, limits that jurisdiction. UTAH CONST. art. VIII, \u00a7 5 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b673 The constitution clearly establishes and outlines the power of this and the district court and provides the only means whereby this or the district court's jurisdiction may be altered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the majority holds that we, through our rules of procedure, may \"circumscribe our jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.

This does not comport with the plain language of our constitution. It clearly states that district courts \"shall have\" jurisdiction unless the constitution or a statute provides otherwise. The constitution does not draw an arbitrary line between subject matter jurisdiction and particular case jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b674 Indeed, there is no real difference between these two classifications as \"[p]articular case jurisdiction is a subset of subject matter jurisdiction ....\"\n   <em>\n    Hisle v.

I see both the criminal and civil version of rule 12 differently from the majority. I see them, and every other procedural rule we promulgate, as imposing \"rights and obligations\" on the litigants. We are simply warning parties that if they do not comply with our procedural rules, they may be barred from raising a claim or argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b678 I believe this interpretation of our procedural rules is mandated by the constitution. The constitution and statute are the only things that can actually define the limits of a court's power to hear a case or address a particular question. We cannot expand or limit our jurisdiction through rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b679 The rules themselves support this interpretation. Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 1 recognizes that our rules \"govern the procedure in the courts of the state of Utah in all actions of a civil nature.\" These rules-such as the timing requirements for filing a motion under rule 12-are intended to assist us in achieving \"the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" UTAH R. CIV. P. 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are not intended to, nor can they, expand or limit our jurisdiction. Our rules of procedure impose rights and obligations on the parties and inform litigants what steps they must follow in order for us to address a question, i.e. to properly\n   <em>\n    invoke\n   </em>\n   our jurisdiction, with consequences for the litigants if they fail to comply with those rules. They do not abrogate or limit our power to hear a case or an issue. It would be somewhat counterintuitive to say that our rules limit our power to hear a particular issue when we can simply amend those rules tomorrow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b680 Our Rules of Appellate Procedure explicitly acknowledge that we do not have the constitutional power to expand or limit our own jurisdiction. Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 1(d) provides that \"[t]hese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals as established by law.\" I acknowledge that we have classified the timing requirement for filing a notice of appeal in Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) as \"jurisdictional.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

I also note that the majority's discussion of these procedural rules is dicta, as the only question at issue in this case is how the Plea Withdrawal Statute governs jurisdiction. I turn now to how, in my view, a statute governs a court's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b682 I believe that there are at least two categories of statutes that govern jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   One type of statute governs subject matter jurisdiction, which is a court's power to hear a class of cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The other type governs our jurisdiction to render a particular judgment in a particular case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Limehouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3888963\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/404/93/\">\n    744 S.E.2d at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any time a statute limits particular case jurisdiction, it does so as a subset of subject matter jurisdiction. Thus, there may be instances when we have the jurisdictional power to hear a class of cases, but we lack the jurisdictional power to render a particular judgment in a case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b683 I believe the Plea Withdrawal Statue is such a statute. We have the power to hear arguments that a guilty plea should be withdrawn, but the legislature has limited our power to hear such a claim if the motion is not made before sentencing. Obviously, not all statutes containing \"mandatory 'prescriptions, however emphatic, are ... properly typed jurisdictional.' \"\n   <em>\n    Union Pac. R.R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639103\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/67/#p81\">\n    558 U.S. at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639103\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/67/#p81\">\n    130 S.Ct. 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (citation omitted). However, I believe that the Plea Withdrawal statute is clearly jurisdictional. It not only speaks of the defendant's obligation to timely move to withdraw, it also speaks to this court's power by identifying the only route through which we may hear an untimely claim: a civil action under the PCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-6(2)(c) (\"\n   <em>\n    Any\n   </em>\n   challenge to a guilty plea not made\" before sentencing \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be pursued under\" the PCRA. (emphases added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b684 Having clarified how I understand our jurisdiction is defined and controlled, and why the Plea Withdrawal Statute is jurisdictional, I move to the majority's treatment of preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    B. Preservation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b685 The majority holds that the Plea Withdrawal Statute's jurisdictional bar is created through a rule of preservation, thereby insulating it from the protections of the constitutional right to appeal and the associated rights to paid counsel and effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. In doing so, the majority creates a new category of preservation that is not subject to the common law exceptions to preservation. I do not agree that preservation creates a jurisdictional bar. Preservation and jurisdiction are two distinct doctrines, as recognized by our precedent. I will first address that precedent, then discuss why I believe it is correct in holding that preservation and jurisdiction are doctrinally distinct under the constitution. Finally, I discuss the damage the majority's holding will have on our common law of preservation and\n   waiver and the way we interpret and apply statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   1. The Majority Overturns Precedent Without Conducting the Proper Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b686 Under a previous version of the Plea Withdrawal Statute, this court held that preservation created the procedural bar to post-sentencing motions to withdraw a guilty plea, but we later rejected that analysis when the statute was amended in 1989. \"The legislature enacted the Plea Withdrawal Statute in 1980, with two significant substantive amendments in 1989 and 2003.

In\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   the defendant argued that, even though the Plea Withdrawal Statute's procedural bar is jurisdictional, the bar was a matter of preservation and thus was subject to the preservation exceptions such as plain error or exceptional circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474732\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/630/\">\n    2002 UT 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9474732\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/40/630/\">\n    40 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We rejected this argument, stating that the procedural bar under the 1980 version of the statute was \"an issue of preservation,\" but that once the legislature included a time limit to withdraw a guilty plea in 1989, the procedural bar was no longer an issue of preservation, but became \"an issue of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We went on to state that \"[t]his court may choose to review an issue not properly preserved [under an exception to preservation].

When a statute deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, we would never say that the rules of preservation create the jurisdictional bar. The statute creates the jurisdictional bar. Arguing that the rules of preservation create the jurisdictional bar in the Plea Withdrawal Statute (which governs particular case jurisdiction) imposes a disconnected dichotomy between these two types of statutes that is not supported by our constitution.

I would keep our common law of preservation separate from our analysis under a statute or rule, with one obvious exception. When a statute or rule refers to and incorporates our common law, it must be read in light of the common law.\n   <em>\n    Maxfield v.

The majority would have us insert preservation analysis into these statutes and rules, thereby treating them differently from every other statute or rule. I would keep our statutory and rule analysis separate from our common law of preservation in order to prevent any confusion as to whether a statute is dealing with preservation, and whether the exceptions to preservation should apply to that statute. However, when a statute or rule clearly intends for our common law preservation exceptions to apply to a timing requirement, then it incorporates our common law and must be read in that context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   UTAH R.

The Plea Withdrawal Statute and the Right to Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6107 Having laid out my framework for understanding our jurisdiction and the proper role of preservation, I now turn to whether the Plea Withdrawal Statute violates the constitutional right to appeal. The Utah Code of Criminal Procedure grants defendants the right to plead guilty with the associated right to engage in plea bargaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-1. Once a guilty plea has been entered, the guilty plea is binding on the guilt phase of litigation. If the defendant wishes to challenge his guilty plea, he must do so \"by motion before sentence is announced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6108 After the defendant enters the guilty plea, the defendant must be sentenced \"not less than two nor more than 45 days after the ... plea, unless the court, with the concurrence of the defendant, otherwise orders.\" UTAH R. CRIM. P. 22(a). Thus, the defendant has time to consider his guilty plea before he is barred from moving to withdraw that plea. If the defendant fails to move to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing, \"[a]ny challenge\" to his plea must be made under the PCRA. UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-6(2)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6109 The majority looks at how long the defendant has to file a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in determining whether his right to appeal has been unconstitutionally denied. It determines that so long as a statute does not create \"an 'absurdly short' time\" for raising an issue or the preservation requirement does not otherwise \"eliminate[ ] any meaningful avenue for appellate review,\" it is constitutional and the defendant must comply with the requirement.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Certainly, appellants must comply with procedural requirements to invoke the jurisdiction of the appellate court, such as filing a timely notice of appeal. Just as certainly, a timing requirement could violate the right to appeal if it is absurdly short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6110 However, this is not the only way a criminal defendant's right to appeal could be infringed. The right to appeal also guarantees defendants the right to have a claim heard, assuming they meet the procedural requirements to invoke our jurisdiction. The majority rejects this assertion, holding that the Plea Withdrawal Statute only narrows the issues that an appellate court can hear. However, just because it narrows the issues an appellate court can hear does not make it \"uncontroversial.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. For example, imagine that the legislature passed a statute saying the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Any private party may sue a university for its negligence. If, however, the district court holds that the university is not negligent, the private party may not appeal such a holding. On the other hand, if the university is held to be negligent by the district court, the university may appeal the district court's ruling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   This would certainly violate the private party's right to appeal, along with a few other constitutional rights, even though it is only narrowing the issues that an appellate court can review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6111 The majority's holding insulates such a statute from the constitutional right to appeal in this case. Mr. Rettig has argued that his plea counsel was ineffective in advising him to plead guilty. A claim for ineffective assistance is sometimes considered an exception to preservation. Unfortunately for Mr. Rettig, the majority holds that the Plea Withdrawal Statute is insulated from preservation exceptions because it creates both a bar based on preservation and on jurisdiction. Apparently, the majority believes that this claim must be preserved in the district court by bringing such a claim before sentence is announced, otherwise it is unpreserved and we cannot hear it under any circumstances. This misunderstands a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6112 While ineffective assistance of counsel is \"sometimes characterized as an exception to preservation,\" it is actually \"a stand-alone constitutional claim attacking the performance of a criminal defendant's counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2076\">\n    2017 UT 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n    416 P.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a claim does not accrue until after the defendant's counsel provides ineffective assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Typically, when a defendant receives ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant may either raise the new constitutional claim in a post-trial motion or on direct appeal because that is the first opportunity the defendant has to raise the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Templin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368653\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/805/182/#p185\">\n    805 P.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (Utah 1990) (stating that \"the same principles [that] apply in addressing ineffective assistance claims in motions for new trials apply on direct appeal and in habeas corpus actions\" (citation omitted)). Even though this new constitutional claim can typically be brought after the time has passed to preserve an issue (because it could not be brought earlier), the majority holds that it is barred by the statute and the statute does not unconstitutionally limit what issues can be brought on direct appeal. I disagree. We must recognize the nature of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel and the fact that the plea withdrawal statute could infringe the constitutional right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6113 Say, for instance, that a defendant is charged with arson. Arson requires that a \"person by means of fire or explosives unlawfully and intentionally damages\" property. UTAH CODE\u00a7 76-6-102(1). Also assume that the defendant pleads guilty to arson upon the advice of his attorney. However, the facts entered in the guilty plea admit only that he intentionally started a garbage fire at his place of employment under the direction of his employer, but that the fire got out of\n   control and burned the building down. His statement in support of the guilty plea asserts that he did not intend to damage the building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6114 Under these facts, the defendant is not actually guilty of arson as the defendant did not intentionally damage his employer's building. However, his attorney advised him that he was guilty of arson and should enter a plea of guilty. Immediately after being sentenced, the defendant obtains new counsel who advises him that he is not actually guilty of arson. If the Plea Withdrawal Statute did not cut off the district court's jurisdiction to hear a post-sentencing motion, and our appellate jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the guilty plea, the defendant would be able to bring this new constitutional claim on direct appeal. However, the Plea Withdrawal Statute cuts off our jurisdiction, so we cannot review it on direct appeal. This is despite the fact that he could not have preserved this claim in the district court and we typically could review such a claim on direct appeal regardless of preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6115 The Plea Withdrawal Statute arguably gives the defendant the right to bring such a claim under the PCRA. However, a criminal defendant's constitutional right to direct appeal includes the associated constitutional rights to paid counsel and effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. If the defendant was allowed to bring his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal, he could get his appellate counsel's fees paid for by the State. Also, if his appellate counsel made a case-altering mistake, such as by failing to file a notice of appeal within the required time, he would have a new claim that his appellate counsel was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6116 The majority's approach eviscerates these rights. Under this approach, if the criminal defendant wants to bring his ineffective assistance of counsel claim-one that he could not have preserved in the district court-he must bring such a claim in a PCRA proceeding where he is not guaranteed the right to State paid counsel or the right to effective assistance of counsel. This is the only route for the defendant to bring this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6117 The majority insulates the Plea Withdrawal Statute from the constitutional right to appeal. However, \"[i]t is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   legislative act repugnant to it ....\"\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

In this case, Mr. Rettig argued that he was unconstitutionally denied the right to appeal because he could be denied the constitutional right to effective assistance of paid counsel in a PCRA proceeding. Mr. Rettig's right to appeal may very well be abrogated. Despite this possibility, I would follow\n   <em>\n    Gailey\n   </em>\n   and hold that this issue is not ripe for determination because he has not yet been denied paid counsel nor has he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel in a PCRA proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    2016 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789921\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1278/\">\n    379 P.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   II.

Nothing in subsection (2)(c) creates or expands a defendant's rights under the PCRA. The PCRA itself creates the defendant's cause of action to challenge a guilty plea in a separate proceeding. If a defendant who fails to move to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing seeks to challenge that plea under the PCRA, he must comply with all of the substantive and procedural requirements under that statute. Subsection (2)(c) does not grant defendants any rights that do not already exists.

Regardless of whether subsection (2)(c) is more procedural or more substantive, I would hold that it is inextricably intertwined with the substantive right to withdraw a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6126 Title 77, chapter 13 of the Utah Code grants criminal defendants several substantive rights. It grants them the right to enter a plea of guilty. UTAH CODE\u00a7 77-13-1. It also grants them the right to withdraw the guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 77-13-6(1). However, the legislature appears to have been concerned with granting an unqualified right to withdraw a plea of guilty. So, it included certain restrictions on that right. First, a defendant can only withdraw a guilty plea \"upon leave of the court and a showing that it was not knowingly and voluntarily made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(a). Second, a defendant must \"request to withdraw a plea of guilty ... before sentence is announced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(b). Finally, if the motion to withdraw the guilty plea is not made before sentencing, \"[a]ny challenge to [the] guilty plea\" must be made in a separate PCRA proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 77-13-6(2)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6127 These restrictions are presumably intended to prevent a defendant from gaming the system, or experiencing buyer's remorse, by previewing his sentence and then deciding to withdraw his plea if he does not like the sentence imposed. Entering a guilty plea is a serious matter that should be thoughtfully considered by a defendant. Once the plea is entered, the defendant cannot simply decide to withdraw it the next day. The defendant must have unknowingly or involuntarily entered the plea before he can withdraw it. These provisions imply that the legislature had one major concern when it granted defendants the rights to enter and withdraw a guilty plea: finality. While the legislature built in a release by allowing defendants to withdraw their guilty plea when they were legitimately uninformed or coerced, the right to withdraw is intended to be a narrow right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6128 Pulling subsection (2)(c) out of the web of rights and restrictions would cause the rest of the Plea Withdrawal Statute's structure to crumble.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drej\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992112\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/233/476/\">\n    2010 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992112\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/233/476/\">\n    233 P.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a statutory assignment of the burden of proof was inextricably intertwined with a substantive right because \"the procedures attached to the substantive right cannot be stripped away\n   without leaving the right or duty created meaningless\"). It would strip the right to withdraw a guilty plea of some of its restrictions and would greatly damage the statutory scheme. Removing this restriction on the right to withdraw a guilty plea could even pressure the legislature to remove that statutory right if they feel they are unable to place limitations on it. Because subsection (2)(c) is so intertwined with the substantive rights to enter and withdraw a guilty plea, I would deem it as substantive and hold that it is constitutional under article VIII, section 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6129 The majority is concerned that my analysis weighs in favor of the constitutionality of subsection (2)(b).
