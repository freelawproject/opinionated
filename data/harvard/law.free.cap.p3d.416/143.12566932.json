Holmes, of De Soto, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 2008. After Holmes appeared in person for a hearing before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys, the panel unanimously determined he violated Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC) 1.4 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.16(a)(1) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (withdrawing from representation); 5.5(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 363) (unauthorized practice of law); 8.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (false statement in connection with disciplinary matter); 8.4(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 218(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 262) (notification of clients upon suspension).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the panel, the disciplinary administrator recommended a 6-month suspension from the practice of law. The panel ultimately recommended a 1-year suspension. At the hearing before this court, the disciplinary administrator endorsed the panel's findings but continued to recommend a 6-month suspension. Holmes filed certain exceptions to the panel's findings, as well as to the recommended discipline. Before the panel and this court, Holmes requested that he be placed on probation. However, he has not complied with Supreme Court Rule 211(g) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   requiring him to immediately implement his proposed plan and later provide the Clerk of the Appellate Courts and the disciplinary administrator an affidavit that he is complying with the terms and conditions of the proposed plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold that clear and convincing evidence establishes the rule violations found by the panel, and we agree with the panel that a 1-year suspension is the appropriate discipline. A minority of this court would impose a less severe sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 9, 2017, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against respondent alleging violations of the KRPC. Holmes filed an answer on February 6, 2017, and an amended answer on April 24, 2017. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on May 9, 2017, at which Holmes appeared personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"10. Rule 208(a) requires all attorneys to register with the Clerk of the Appellate Courts and pay the annual registration fee prior to July 1 each year. The rule includes a 'grace' period, providing attorneys until July 31 of each year to forward the form and pay the annual registration fee without penalty. However, '[a]ttorney registration fees received by the Clerk of the Appellate Courts after July 31 of the year in which due shall be accompanied by a $100 late payment fee.' Rule 208(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"11. On July 29, 2015, the respondent mailed his attorney registration form and fee to the Clerk of the Appellate Courts. The Clerk did not receive the respondent's registration form and fee until after July 31, 2015. Under Rule 208(d), the respondent was required to pay a late fee of $100 because the registration form and fee were not received until after July 31, 2015. The respondent failed to provide the late fee of $100.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"12. On August 8, 2015, the respondent received a letter from the Clerk of the Appellate Courts, sent\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   certified mail, informing the respondent that his registration had not been received before August 1, 2015, and that his license to practice law would be suspended if he did not pay the late fee of $100 within 30 days. The respondent did not pay the late fee of $100 within 30 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"13. On October 6, 2015, the Supreme Court entered an order suspending\n   the respondent's license to practice law for failing to pay the late fee of $100. On October 8, 2015, the Clerk sent the order of suspension to the respondent by certified mail to the respondent at the respondent's registration address. Prior to the entry of the order of suspension, the respondent was on notice that such an order would follow if the respondent did not pay the late fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"14. On October 13, 2015, the United States Postal Service attempted to deliver the certified mailing at 4:32 p.m., leaving a notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"15. On October 14, 2015, prior to 10:48 a.m., the respondent called the Clerk of the Appellate Courts and spoke with Debbie Uhl. During the conversation, the respondent stated that he had mailed the registration form and fee in plenty of time to arrive before August 3, 2015, that he had received the notice regarding the late fee, and that he did not believe that he owed the late fee, so he did not send it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"16. At the hearing on this matter, the witnesses' testimony varied regarding what Ms. Uhl stated during the telephone conversation. Based on all the evidence presented to the hearing panel, the hearing panel concludes that Ms. Uhl informed the respondent that the Supreme Court had suspended the respondent's license to practice law. Ms. Uhl asked the respondent if he had received the order of suspension. The respondent indicated that he had not received the order of suspension. Thus, despite the fact that the respondent had not yet signed for the certified mail, he had actual knowledge that his license was suspended on October 14, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"17. After the respondent's license to practice law was suspended, the respondent continued to practice law in multiple cases, as detailed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"18. G.M., E.M., and El.M. rented property from C.W. C.W. asserted that .... G.M., E.M., and El.M. failed to timely pay their rent. As a result, C.W. filed an eviction suit against G.M., E.M., and El.M. Carol Hall represented C.W. in the eviction action. The respondent represented G.M., E.M., and El.M. in the eviction action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"19. Additional difficulties arose between the parties, and C.W. filed a protection from stalking case against G.M., Leavenworth County District Court Case No. 2015-DM-828. G.M. then filed a protection from stalking case against C.W., Leavenworth County District Court Case No. 2015-DM-854. Robert H. Hall, Carol Hall's husband and law partner, represented C.W. in the protection from stalking cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"20. On October 14, 2015, the Honorable Michael D. Gibbens held a hearing in the eviction case at 1:00 p.m. While the respondent was in the courtroom shortly before 1:00 p.m., he left the courtroom and went into the hallway to look for his clients just before the case was called. G.M., E.M., and El.M. arrived and met with the respondent regarding the eviction case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"21. The judge called the case. G.M., E.M., and El.M. did not appear. Additionally, the respondent was not in the courtroom when the judge called the case. As a result, the court entered default judgment and a writ for possession of the premises in favor of C.W. The respondent returned to the courtroom\n   and requested that the court set aside the default judgment. The\n   judge told the respondent that he would have to file a written motion to set aside the default judgment and writ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"22. Even though the respondent knew prior to the time of the hearing that his license to practice law had been suspended, the respondent did not inform opposing counsel, the court, or his clients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"23. The writ for possession of the premises was served on the respondent's clients. The writ directed the respondent's clients to vacate the premises prior to October 20, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. The order provided that the sheriff's office would remove them at that time if they had not vacated the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"24. On October 15, 2015, the day after the respondent had actual knowledge of the suspension, the respondent entered his appearance on behalf of V.S., in Johnson County District Court, case number 15CV6206. The respondent sought and obtained a continuance of a hearing that was set for that day. The respondent failed to inform the court, opposing counsel, or his client that his license to practice law had been suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"25. At the time of the suspension, the respondent represented B.M., a respondent in a domestic case filed in Leavenworth County District Court, case number 2015-DM-356. Lawrence Henderson represented the opposing party. Previously, a status conference had been scheduled for October 15, 2015. The respondent and Mr. Henderson agreed to continue the status conference to October 28, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"26. On October 17, 2015, at 9:23 a.m., the respondent signed the certified mail receipt for the suspension order. According to the respondent, the respondent wrote a check in the amount of $100 payable to the Clerk of the Appellate Courts. The Clerk of the Appellate Courts did not receive a check from the respondent dated October 17, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"27. On October 17, 2015, the respondent served a motion to set aside order for immediate possession and a memorandum in support of motion to set aside order for immediate possession in the eviction action filed against G.M., E.M., and El.M. on C.W. On October 19, 2015, the respondent filed those pleadings in court. Later that same day, the respondent sought and obtained an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary order setting aside the writ of immediate possession. At the time he served and filed the pleadings and sought the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, the respondent did not inform his clients, opposing counsel, or the court that his license had been suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"28. Prior to the suspension of the respondent's license to practice of law, the respondent represented R.G. in a domestic case pending in Leavenworth County District Court, case number 2014-DM-904. Pamela Burton represented the opposing party in that case. On October 17, 2015, the respondent served discovery responses in R.G.'s case on Ms. Burton. The respondent filed pleadings in that case on October 19, 2015. The respondent did not inform his clients, opposing counsel, or the court that his license to practice law had been suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"29. On October 19, 2015, the respondent met with G.M., E.M., El.M.,\n   and a deputy with the Leavenworth County sheriff's office about the October 20, 2015, deadline in the writ. Again, the respondent did not inform his clients that his license to practice law had been suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"30. Previously, the court scheduled a hearing in the protection from stalking cases for October 19, 2015. Prior to the hearing, Mr. Hall saw the respondent at the courthouse. Later, Mr. Hall memorialized the exchange as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   'Carol:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   'This morning at approximately 10:45 am I went through security at the Justice Center on my way to the PFS hearing concerning the [C.W. and G.M.] PFS case. Mr. Holmes was sitting on the bench just east of the security entrance. After I passed through security I went over to Mr. Holmes to see if he was going to represent [G.M.] in the PFS case. He indicated he was going to represent her and had told her to ask for a continuance since he was waiting for a ride from his wife, due to his car having broken down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   'He launched into speaking about the eviction case where you are representing [C.W.]. He said he had filed a motion to set aside the writ that was issued and had already spoken with Judge Gibbons [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] as well as the sheriff's office. I asked him for a copy of the motion that he filed and told him that you had not received it. He said he \"sent it up\" and did not have a copy. I handed him a copy of the Order For Immediate Possession that you gave me to give to him. I told him you had tried to fax it, but without success; he said you had to call first, then indicate (I think to his secretary) that you wanted to send a fax, then fax it. He acknowledged having received it by email from you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   'He suggested that the PFS cases should be continued until his client could get moved out. I told him that was a good idea and we agreed on November 16, 2015 for the new date in the PFS cases. I told him I would convey that to Judge Dawson and I did so about 15 minutes later. He indicated that his client had tried to rent another place, but had been declined because on (sic) the pending eviction case. ... We agreed it would facilitate resolution for his client to get moved out-the sooner, the better-and that, hopefully, we could then resolve the PFS cases by agreement.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"31. When Mr. Hall appeared before Judge Dawson to seek and obtain a new hearing date in the two protection from stalking cases, Mr. Hall referenced the agreement with the respondent. The respondent, however, did not appear in court. The respondent did not inform his clients, Mr. Hall, or the court that the respondent's license had been suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"32. On October 19, 2015, the court entered orders continuing the protection from stalking cases to November. In the orders, the respondent is listed as G.M.'s counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"33. During the afternoon hours of October 19, 2015, Ms. Hall emailed the respondent to set a date for a hearing in the eviction action. In the email, Ms. Hall proposed several dates, including October 23, 2015. The respondent called Ms.\n   Hall and agreed to an expedited hearing on October 23, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. The respondent did not tell Ms. Hall that his license was suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"34. At the time his license was suspended to practice law, the respondent represented G.B. in an appeal from a municipal court conviction, Leavenworth County District Court case number 2015-CR-573. Previously, the court had scheduled a trial for October 20, 2015. On October 20, 2015, the respondent sought and obtained opposing counsel's consent and continued the trial to November, 2015. The respondent did not inform opposing counsel, the court, or his client that his license to practice law was suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"35. On October 22, 2015, the respondent wrote a check in the amount of $100 payable to the Clerk of the Appellate Courts. The respondent delivered the check to the Clerk of the Appellate Courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"36. On October 22, 2015, the respondent called Ms. Hall and left a message asking Ms. Hall to call him regarding the eviction case. Ms. Hall replied to the message by email that same day asking the respondent to draft an agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"37. On October 23, 2015, the Leavenworth County District Court Administrator informed Judge Michael D. Gibbens that the respondent's license to practice law was suspended. The hearing in the eviction action was scheduled to be heard in Judge Gibbens' court at 11:00 a.m. that day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"38. Ms. Hall had several hearings before Judge Gibbens on October 23, 2015, prior to the 11:00 a.m. setting. Before the 11:00 a.m. hearing, Judge Gibbens informed Ms. Hall the respondent's license to practice law was suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"39. The respondent arrived for the hearing shortly before 11:00 a.m. and entered the courtroom. The respondent approached Ms. Hall and asked her to come to speak with him in the hallway. In the hallway, the respondent told Ms. Hall that his license to practice law was suspended. The respondent told Ms. Hall that he had just learned of the suspension a day or so prior and was reluctant to leave a phone\n   message to that effect. The respondent asked Ms. Hall to cancel the 11:00 a.m. hearing and to agree to allow his clients until the following Monday to vacate the premises. The respondent's clients were not present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"40. Ms. Hall informed her client of the respondent's offer. Her client declined the offer. Shortly after 11:00 a.m., on October 23, 2015, Judge Gibbens entered the courtroom. The respondent was in front of the bar at counsel table when the following exchange occurred:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   'JUDGE GIBBENS: Be seated. All right, Mr. Holmes, before I call this case, the Court's been advised that you were administratively suspended from the practice of law effective October the 6th.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   'MR. HOLMES: Right. I became aware of that in the last few days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   'JUDGE GIBBENS: Okay.

Well, you can't appear here today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   'MR. HOLMES: I understand. I've been advised by the Disciplinary Administrator the thing I need to do is to show up and let the Court know\n   that, let opposing counsel know that.

HOLMES: Thank you.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"41 After the respondent left the courtroom, the court entered a default order for immediate possession and issued a writ against the respondent's clients to vacate the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"42. Later that day, October 23, 2015, the respondent came to Ms. Hall's office to deliver a client file to Mr. Hall in an unrelated case. Ms. Hall came to the reception desk and took the file from the respondent. The respondent began to discuss the eviction action with Ms. Hall. Because the respondent was not licensed to practice law, Ms. Hall told the respondent that he needed to leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"43. On October 23, 2015, the respondent sent a letter to the disciplinary administrator, self-reporting his conduct. The respondent's letter provided:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   'Please be advised that in the hopes of compliance with the rules of professional conduct, I am providing notice of a handful of matters in which I appeared in Court to represent clients which occurred apparently\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the entry of an order regarding but\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to my notification of an administrative suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   'Pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules regarding annual registration, I mailed my Attorney Registration documents and fees on the 29th day of July, 2015.

Accordingly, I immediately wrote and delivered another check for the late fee. Accordingly, I have undertaken all action to reinstate my license, which by this time may already be reinstated or, as I have been advised, should be reinstated imminently.

The first occasion was October 6th, 2015, in Leavenworth County, ... The matter concerned a Motion to Determine Child Support Arrearages which I had filed some months earlier. The hearing merely consisted of notification to the Court that the parties had reached a previously negotiated agreement. The second hearing was on October 7 in two related child in need of care cases also in Leavenworth County. My client did not appear, and the matters were essentially continued until the month of November. The third matter was another child in need of care case held in Johnson County on October 8th, 2015, where I merely appeared and indicated my intention to withdraw and was excused by the Court.

The respondent did not disclose that his license to practice law was suspended. However, Mr. Henderson had previously learned that the respondent's license was suspended.

The respondent's statement that 'the notice came as a somewhat unexpected surprise to me at the time,' is at least disingenuous, if not actually false.

The respondent violated his duty to the public and the legal profession to maintain his personal integrity. The respondent also violated his duty to his clients and to the legal system to proper[l]y communicate. Finally, the respondent violated his duty to the legal system to comply with court rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   \"75.\n   <em>\n    Mental State\n   </em>\n   . The respondent knowingly violated his duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   \"76.\n   <em>\n    Injury\n   </em>\n   .

Aggravating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify an increase in the degree of discipline to be imposed. In reaching its recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel, in this case, found the following aggravating factors present:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Prior Disciplinary Offenses\n   </em>\n   . The respondent has been previously disciplined on two occasions. On July 25, 2005, the Idaho Supreme Court suspended the respondent's license to practice law in the State of Idaho for a period of 15 months. Following 11 months of actual suspension, respondent was placed on probation for a period of one year, for having violated\n   Rule 1.1, Rule 1.3, Rule 1.4, Rule 1.7(b), and Rule 8.4(c). On December 31, 2013, the disciplinary administrator informally admonished the respondent for having violated KRPC 8.4(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Dishonest or Selfish Motive\n   </em>\n   . The respondent's misconduct was motivated by dishonesty and selfishness as he provided false and self-serving information to the disciplinary administrator's office. Further, the respondent has minimized his misconduct throughout these proceedings. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent's misconduct was motivated by dishonesty and selfishness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    A Pattern of Misconduct\n   </em>\n   . The respondent repeatedly provided false and misleading information to the disciplinary administrator's office regarding his knowledge of the suspension and the extent of his unauthorized practice of law. Thus, the respondent has engaged in a pattern of misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Multiple Offenses\n   </em>\n   . The respondent committed multiple rule violations. The respondent violated KRPC 1.4, KRPC 1.16, KRPC 5.5, KRPC 8.1, KRPC 8.4, and Rule 218. Accordingly, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent committed multiple offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Submission of False Evidence, False Statements, or Other Deceptive Practices during the Disciplinary Process\n   </em>\n   . In his written correspondence to the disciplinary administrator's office during the investigation as well as throughout the disciplinary proceedings, the respondent misrepresented facts stated and omitted facts necessary to prevent a misapprehension of the facts. During his closing argument, the respondent acknowledged that he has emotional difficulty handling the truth:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   'With respect to the conversation with Ms. Uhl, I didn't call because I received notice, I called because I had sent out a late fee. Whether you choose to believe that or not, you're going to believe what you believe, but that was the purpose of the conversation. I think it could be interpreted either way, but I was calling to say, you know, I sent in a late fee, I'm\n   trying to avoid the late fee before suspension comes out, is there a way for me to deal with this? I haven't gotten a suspension order, but I'd like to be able to deal before I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   '...

You don't set out to do anything wrong. You don't set out intentionally-this wasn't like I was going in to rob a bank, any plan like that. This is something that came as a bit of a surprise, and I tried to protect my client. I was acting in their behalf. At least that was my intention. This was not something I was doing for myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   'I was dishonest with regards to acting on behalf of my client where I knew that the license had been suspended, but the prior week it was\n   more negligent.

This is not something that I was out to misrepresent. That was simply my recollection. 'Um, turns out I was mistaken, but this was not an intentional misrepresentation. And I think, again, it was based upon what was my intention of going in.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   The hearing panel would like to point out that the respondent acknowledged that he (unintentionally) misrepresented reporting to the court that he was suspended. The respondent minimized this misrepresentation by stating that he was simply mistaken. The appearance before the court occurred on October 23, 2015. In his November 6, 2015, supplemental self-report, the respondent stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   '[O]n that date I appeared in Court just prior to the time scheduled for the hearing and notified the Court and Counsel of my administrative suspension.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   A review of the transcript of the proceedings before Judge Gibbens shows that at the outset of the proceedings, the judge informed the respondent that he learned that the respondent's license was suspended and the judge did not allow the respondent to make an appearance. Whether the respondent informed the court is relevant under Rule 218(a). The hearing panel is troubled by this statement which serves as a repeated example of the respondent's continuous minimization of his misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Experience in the Practice of Law\n   </em>\n   . The Idaho Supreme\n   Court admitted the respondent to practice law in the State of Idaho in 1991.

The respondent has nine years of practice in Kansas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   \"78. Mitigating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify a reduction in the degree of discipline to be imposed. In reaching its recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel, in this case, found no mitigating circumstances present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   \"79.

Holmes concedes that the uncontested factual findings made by the panel are sufficient, standing alone, to establish each of these instances of attorney misconduct. Nonetheless, we will discuss each of the claimed exceptions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <em>\n    Did Holmes have actual knowledge of his suspension on October 14, 2015?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Holmes first asserts that \"while he knew or should have known his license would be suspended for non-payment of the late fee in this matter, he nevertheless was not made aware of the order of suspension until ... October 17th, 201[5].\" During the hearing, the disciplinary administrator introduced an October 14, 2015, email from Uhl to Jason Oldham timestamped at 10:48 a.m. The email stated Holmes had just called and was upset that he owed a late fee because he believed he mailed his registration information in plenty of time for renewal. The email also indicated Holmes said \"he has not received\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   suspension notice yet.\" (Emphasis added.) During the hearing, Uhl testified in situations such as these, she ordinarily looks up the attorney on the computer to check his or her status. Although Uhl could not specifically recall if she told Holmes his license was suspended, she felt \"very confident [she] would have,\" otherwise she would not have made this statement in the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The evidence before the panel that Uhl affirmatively told\n   Holmes that he was suspended during the phone call on October 14 was thin. But ultimately, Holmes' admission that he was aware of the suspension on October 17 is sufficient to establish the rule violations as found by the panel. Because the specific fact in contention-the substance of the October 14 phone call-is not necessary to any of the ultimate conclusions reached by either the panel or by this court, we disregard this factual finding without deciding whether it is supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <em>\n    Did Holmes enter his appearance in a Johnson County case on October 15, 2015?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Holmes next claims the panel's finding that he appeared on October 15 in Johnson County District Court case number 15CV6206 is \"completely contrary to the evidence adduced at the hearing.\" But the disciplinary administrator correctly points out that Holmes has confused his appearance in the Johnson County case with his nonappearance in the Leavenworth County case on the same day. The electronic docket in the Johnson County case contains the judge's bench notes, which state Holmes appeared with his client and the case was continued to November 5, 2015. And during oral arguments before this court, Holmes again argued the panel erred by finding he appeared in Leavenworth County, though he conceded there may have been a misunderstanding regarding the county. He has confused the two hearings. The record contains clear and convincing evidence that supports the panel's finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <em>\n    Did Holmes fail to notify his clients, opposing counsel, and courts of his suspension?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Holmes also takes issue with the parenthetical statement made in paragraph 72 of the Amended Final Hearing Report: \"(The only time the respondent notified anyone of the suspension was on October 23, 2015, when the respondent albeit untimely, orally notified Ms. Hall that his license to practice law had been suspended.)\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Holmes claimed in his testimony that he told \"a variety of clients\" and \"a number of attorneys what had happened.\" He restates this assertion in his brief but fails to provide a citation to the record supporting his claim. See Supreme Court Rule 6.02(a)(4) (2018\n   Kan. S. Ct. R. 35) (\"The facts included in the statement must be keyed to the record on appeal by volume and page number. The court may presume that a factual statement made without a reference to volume and page number has no support in the record on appeal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   To the extent Holmes is relying on his testimony to controvert the panel's finding, he is simply asking the court to reweigh his testimony against the evidence presented by the disciplinary administrator, which is beyond the scope of this court's review. See\n   <em>\n    In re Biscanin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Kan.%201212\">\n    305 Kan. 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1220,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=390%20P.3d%20886\">\n    390 P.3d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Regardless, Holmes concedes he failed to notify every court, client, and opposing counsel. He merely quibbles with the panel's characterization that he only notified one person. Thus he does not materially controvert the factual finding. See Supreme Court Rule 218(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 262-63) (requiring a suspended or disbarred attorney to notify \"each\" client, \"all\" opposing counsel, and \"all\" courts where the attorney is counsel of record of the suspension or disbarment in writing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <em>\n    Did Holmes engage in the unauthorized practice of law on October 23, 2015?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Holmes next claims he did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law when speaking with Ms. Hall on October 23, 2015. Ms. Hall stated Holmes approached her in the courtroom that day and asked to discuss a case in the hallway. Once outside, she claimed Holmes asked her if they could continue the eviction case and agree that his clients would move out of the duplex on Monday. Ms. Hall told him she would have to discuss it with her client. Ms. Hall told her client that Holmes did not have a license to practice law. Thereafter, Ms. Hall secured a default judgment for her client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Later that day, Holmes appeared at Ms. Hall's office to deliver a file unrelated to the eviction case. Ms. Hall claimed Holmes asked about the status of the eviction case, and she responded that she could not talk about it and that he needed to leave. Holmes then tried to continue to discuss the case, and she reiterated that he needed to leave, so he left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   On cross-examination, Holmes asked Ms. Hall about their conversation outside the courtroom:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   \"[I]n fact, I didn't attempt to negotiate anything with you, did I?

Does that sound correct?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Ms. Hall answered: \"No, it does not sound correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The record contains clear and convincing evidence that supports the panel's finding that Holmes engaged in the unauthorized practice of law during his interaction with Ms. Hall on October 23 by engaging in settlement negotiations on behalf of his clients while his license was suspended. See\n   <em>\n    In re O'Leary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415899\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/456/#p460\">\n    303 Kan. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460, 462,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415899\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/456/#p460\">\n    362 P.3d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (attorney who engaged in settlement negotiations on behalf of client after the attorney's license was suspended violated KRPC 5.5 [a] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   <em>\n    Did Holmes make false statements and misrepresentations during the disciplinary process?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Lastly, Holmes controverts the extent to which he submitted false or misleading statements during the disciplinary process. With one notable exception, he concedes he made the alleged statements and that those\n   statements were either not true or were misleading, but he offers mitigating circumstances to explain those statements. The thrust of his argument appears to be that the misrepresentations arose innocently out of his poor memory rather than a knowing intent to deceive the panel. He attempted to explain his reasons as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   \"I-in hindsight, hindsight is 20/20, there's a lot of things I could have done. But when you're in the moment, you act, sometimes in desperation, sometimes out of panic. You don't set out to do anything wrong. You don't set out intentionally-this wasn't like I was going in to rob a bank, any plan like that. This is something that came as a bit of a surprise, and I tried to protect my client. I was acting in their behalf. At least that was my intention. This was not something I was doing for myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   \"I was dishonest with regards to acting on behalf of my client where I knew that the license had been suspended, but the prior week it was more negligent. This wasn't something that I actually knew. It's something that I should have known, perhaps should have made myself aware of, should have thought through. Again, hindsight is 20/20, and you kick yourself every time you think of what should have happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   \"I didn't appreciate the effect that it would have [on] my clients. I think, perhaps, the full extent not even until today. 'Um, I don't know how much more my clients would have done, or could have done, had they known any sooner, but I didn't tell them early enough. And we're talking about days here. This is not something that was a long period of time. From beginning to end, we're talking about a couple weeks. And so that period, yeah, I didn't act as I should have. And there are things I could have done proactively weeks earlier, as I've indicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   \"Do I acknowledge, absolutely.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Did I acknowledge everything at the time that I sent in some self-reports, probably not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Again, it was my way of dealing with it. I didn't-I simply couldn't do everything, say everything. 'Um, it came out in fits and spurts. 'Um, it's still coming out. I didn't make what I perceived to be a material misrepresentation in any of those reports. There's no flat out lie anywhere. Did I under report? I did. And I think that was, again, not because I was out to do that, but because I simply had difficulty emotionally handling it.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Before this court, Holmes admitted that his October 23, 2015, self-report letter violated KRPC 8.1. Moreover, regardless of Holmes' seemingly innocent explanations for other false or misleading statements, with only one exception discussed below, he does not contend his statements were actually true. Holmes admitted misleading statements during the disciplinary process are sufficient in themselves to support the panel's finding of a KRPC 8.1 violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The only specific claim Holmes made that he continues to claim was actually true is his insistence that Uhl did not actually tell him he was suspended during the phone conversation on October 14. The disciplinary administrator alleged and the panel found this to be false. As already discussed above, we have noted that the record evidence concerning what was actually said during that phone call is thin. Uhl testified she did not recall the specific nature of the conversation. She could only testify to her ordinary practice on such calls. Because this specific factual finding is not necessary to support any of the rules violations found by the panel, we have disregarded it. We do take this opportunity to simply note that merely mounting a nonfrivolous defense against allegations of misconduct during an attorney discipline proceeding is insufficient, standing alone, to establish an additional rule violation, even if that defense is ultimately unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <em>\n    Mitigating Circumstances\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \"Mitigating or aggravating circumstances which affect the nature or degree of discipline to be imposed or recommended in a matter shall be fully set forth in the panel report.\" Supreme Court Rule 211(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 252). In arriving at the appropriate discipline, the panel must consider the evidence presented as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances and determine the weight to be assigned to each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415921\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/97/#p117\">\n    304 Kan. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415921\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/97/#p117\">\n    373 P.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, this court determines whether it agrees with the panel's findings regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n   <em>\n    In re Kline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416649\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/96/#p220\">\n    298 Kan. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416649\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/96/#p220\">\n    311 P.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Although the panel found no mitigating circumstances present, Holmes argues there are four: (1) his actions on October 23, 2015, were necessary to save his clients from eviction; (2) Holmes notified the courts and Ms. Hall of his suspension; (3) he \"immediately undertook action to remedy\" his suspension when he received notice of the order of suspension; and (4) he expressed remorse over his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The unauthorized practice of law is not something this court takes lightly. And we remain unconvinced that Holmes comprehends the seriousness of his misconduct. Far from \"helping\" his clients by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, Holmes' conduct hurt them if for no other reason than it hindered them from obtaining licensed counsel. Half measures to notify some people of a suspension while continuing to practice law without a license are not mitigating factors, but in fact demonstrate ongoing dishonesty and conduct that reflects adversely on an attorney's fitness to continue practicing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   As for Holmes' remorse, we are always inclined to give attorneys who seek second chances every benefit of the doubt. This is in large part why the court maintains a robust program for probation for disciplined attorneys. But Holmes has failed to fully avail himself of this opportunity. At the hearing, Holmes called Neal Fowles-an attorney from whom Holmes was renting office space-to testify. Fowles briefly testified that he would be willing to supervise Holmes during a period of probation. On cross-examination, however, it was revealed that Fowles was only generally aware of the\n   facts of the disciplinary case, and he had not read the terms of the proposed probation plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   During the hearing before this court, Holmes admitted that although he had provided the panel with a plan of probation, he had not fully implemented it. Our rules provide that once a respondent provides the panel and disciplinary administrator a proposed plan of probation, he or she \"shall immediately and prior to the hearing on the Formal Complaint put the plan of probation into effect by complying with each of the terms and conditions of the probation plan.\" Supreme Court Rule 211(g)(2) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 253). In addition, Holmes did not file with this court an affidavit assuring us that he was fully complying with the terms of his probation plan. See Supreme Court Rule 211(g)(5). We do not find probation appropriate under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <em>\n    Appropriate Discipline\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   The hearing panel unanimously recommended that Holmes be suspended for one year. The disciplinary administrator recommended to the panel-and maintains before us now-that Holmes should be suspended for six months. Holmes believes suspension is too harsh and requests published censure or suspension with supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   \"This court is not bound by the recommendations of the Disciplinary Administrator or the hearing panel.\n   <em>\n    In re Mintz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417247\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/897/#p911\">\n    298 Kan. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 911-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417247\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/897/#p911\">\n    317 P.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

I had a very attractive client who had indicated to me that she was-she had-I think she had been a model, or mom had been a model, or something like that. Came out I was-I did the photography, and she approached me about taking pictures with her children and-that would be nude. 'Um, I agreed to that. In fact, eagerly. 'Um, and, you know, in hindsight, I think that this was probably something that was maybe in her head in a theoretical, but I pressed, you want to do this, you want to do this, you want to do this, and we did. It was a horrible incident. The kids were-she had twin boys that were infants and they were, 'um, not wanting any of this to happen.

It came out that this had happened. I had admitted it. I had understood-at least understood in hindsight, this is something that was consensual, but came to realize, no, I was probably pushing her to do this. 'Um, and I admitted it and it resulted in a period of suspension.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Holmes also described a situation in which he prepared a document for a client that was never filed, which ultimately barred a cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   In arguing suspension is not warranted, Holmes cites\n   <em>\n    In re Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417089\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/793/\">\n    298 Kan. 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417089\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/793/\">\n    316 P.3d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).
