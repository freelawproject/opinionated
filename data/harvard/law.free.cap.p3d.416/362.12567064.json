Mr. Rawcliffe concedes that USANA's Compensation Committee strictly complied with the company's compensation plan in authorizing the SSARs. Based on this and the absence of an allegation that the Compensation Committee intended\n   to circumvent the plan, the district court dismissed all of Mr. Rawcliffe's claims under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) without prejudice. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2006, USANA's board of directors approved, and its shareholders ratified, the USANA Health Sciences, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Award Plan (Plan). Pursuant to the Plan, the board of directors established the Compensation Committee, consisting of three members of the board of directors. The Plan gave the Compensation Committee the \"exclusive power, authority, and discretion\" to award SSARs to directors, officers, and other employees, as an incentive to continue working diligently for the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 SSARs, as defined by the Plan, are a specific type of incentive award that differs somewhat from stock options. On the day that the Compensation Committee awards SSARs, called the \"grant date,\" the \"exercise price\" for the SSARs is set. The exercise price of each SSAR is equal to the average trading price of USANA's stock on the grant date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the vesting period runs, the awardee can exercise the SSARs and receive stock as compensation. The day on which the awardee exercises the SSARs is called the \"exercise date.\" When the awardee exercises her SSARs, she is given stock in an amount reflecting the difference between the market price of USANA's stock on the exercise date, and the exercise price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The recipient does not need to pay an exercise price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The lower the exercise price and the higher the value of the company's stock on the exercise date, the more the SSARs are worth. When the market price is lower on the exercise date than on the grant date, the SSARs are \"out of the money\" and return no value to the holder; if the SSARs are exercised when the market price is higher than the exercise price, they are \"in the money,\" and the holder then receives the difference in price in the form of USANA stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 While the Plan allows SSARs to be granted as incentive awards, it does not explicitly mention spring-loaded SSARs. Spring-loading involves granting equity awards just prior to the release of non-public information reasonably expected to drive up the market price of the company's stock. Spring-loading increases the value of SSARs because the exercise price is set on a day when the good news has not yet been released, making the exercise price lower than if it were to be set after the good news was released. It makes the SSARs more likely to be \"in the money\" once they vest and also increases the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the exercise date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Plan states only that the exercise price must be at least 100 percent of the \"Fair Market Value\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the common stock\n   on the date of the grant, with no mention of spring-loading. In this case, the Committee awarded SSARs on February 3, 2014, to four members of the board of directors (including the three directors serving on the Compensation Committee) and several corporate officers. These awards were made just one day before USANA announced its net sales and earnings per share figures from 2013, which greatly exceeded expectations. On February 6, 2014, each of the defendants filed a Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing the SSARs awards. The SSARs' exercise price the day they were granted was $57.62. On February 5, 2014, after the announcement, the company's stock price rose to $68.46 per share, a gain of $10.84 per share or 18.8 percent in two days. While the value of USANA's stock rose 18.8 percent just two days after the exercise price was set, the SSARs did not vest, and could not be exercised, until 23 to 42 months later. Thus, the directors and officers could not realize that 18.8 percent increase until their SSARs had vested, and only if USANA's stock either maintained its $68.46 value or it increased in value during that vesting period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mr. Rawcliffe acknowledges that the issuance of the spring-loaded SSARs complied with the terms of the Plan. He argues only that it violated the underlying \"spirit\" of the Plan. Accordingly, he alleges that the Compensation Committee members breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets. He also alleges that one director, who was not a member of the Compensation Committee, and several officers breached their fiduciary duties and were unjustly enriched by passively receiving the spring-loaded SSARs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 A motion to dismiss presents a question of law that is reviewed de novo, giving \"no deference\" to the district court's analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

DUTIES OWED BY CORPORATE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 The question of whether spring-loading SSARs constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty is an issue of first impression in Utah. Corporate fiduciary duties were originally creatures of common law. Now, Utah corporations are governed by the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act (URBCA). UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 16-10a-101 to -1804. Utah Code section 16-10a-840(4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   codifies when a corporate director or officer can be held liable and states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) A director or officer\n   <em>\n    is not liable\n   </em>\n   to the corporation [or] its shareholders ... for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   action taken, or\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   failure to take any action, as an officer or director, as the case may be,\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (a) the director or officer has breached or failed to perform the duties of the office in compliance with this section; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (b) the breach or failure to perform constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the shareholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 11 As the emphasized portions show, this statute requires that a cause of action brought by a corporation or shareholder\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   against a director or officer, for the official acts of the director or officer, must be for a breach of Utah Code section 16-10-840(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bagley v.

Otherwise, if it is not a breach of subsection (4), the \"director or officer\n   <em>\n    is not liable\n   </em>\n   to the corporation [or] its shareholders,\" absent some other statutory authorization. UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-840(4) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 Subsection (4) mandates that a corporation or shareholder prove two things before a director or officer can be held liable: (1) that the director or officer breached a duty enumerated in Utah Code section 16-10a-840(1) ; and (2) that the director or officer breached the duty with a mental state listed in Utah Code section 16-10a-840(4)(b). According to the plain language in subsection (4), both a breach of a standard of conduct in subsection (1) and a mental state listed in subsection (4)(b) are required to hold a director or officer liable. We will first discuss the standards of conduct that corporate directors and officers owe under the URBCA and then the mental states required to establish liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    A. Standards of Conduct Under Utah Code Section 16-10a-840(4)(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 Under Utah Code section 16-10a-840(4)(a), to determine whether a corporate director or officer is liable to the corporation or its shareholders the first step of the analysis is to determine whether the \"director or officer has breached or failed to perform the duties of the office in compliance with this section.\" The only duties identified in section 16-10a-840 are located in subsection (1). Utah Code section 16-10a-840(1) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1) Each director shall discharge the director's duties as a director, including duties as a member of a committee, and each officer with discretionary authority shall discharge the officer's duties under that authority:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) in good faith;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (c) in a manner the director or officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 14 A claim against a corporate officer or director must establish a breach of one of these duties or otherwise establish a breach of this subsection.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v.

Section 16-10a-840(1) codified the common law duties identified in our precedent, but the statute does not provide definitions of the enumerated duties beyond what is written in subsection (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"When the legislature 'borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken.' \"\n   <em>\n    Maxfield v.

Thus, the common law assists in defining the scope of the duty, as long as the duty itself is identified by the plain language of the statute and our common law does not\n   conflict with any statutory guidance on the scope of that duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 15 Mr. Rawcliffe's arguments only fall under the duty of good faith, identified in subsection (1)(a), and the duty to act in a manner that the director or officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation, identified in subsection (1)(c). We now discuss the scope of these two duties, but do not address the scope of the duty identified in subsection (1)(b), because Mr. Rawcliffe does not argue a breach of that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 16 Mr. Rawcliffe cites\n   <em>\n    Glen Allen Mining Co. v. Park Galena Mining Co.\n   </em>\n   , for the scope of the first listed duty-the duty of good faith-arguing that it requires all the acts of the directors and officers to \"be for the benefit of the corporation and not for their own benefit. ... They are not permitted to profit as individuals by virtue of their position.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8870322\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/77/362/\">\n    77 Utah 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8870322\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/77/362/\">\n    296 P. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (1931). However, this statement conflicts with other portions of the URBCA leading us to reject it as an accurate statement of \"good faith\" under Utah Code section 16-10a-840(1)(a). For instance, the URBCA authorizes the board of directors to set their own compensation, UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-811, and to \"determine the terms upon which\" shares, stock options, or other securities \"are issued, their form and content, and the consideration for which the shares are to be issued,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 16-10a-624(1). This leads us to believe that the duty of good faith under the URCBA does not prohibit directors from personally benefitting from their position, subject to some restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C &amp; Y Corp. v.

This duty significantly overlaps with the duty of good faith codified in subsection (1)(a). Some jurisdictions have even classified the duty of good faith as a subset of the duty of loyalty.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone ex rel. AmSouth Bancorporation v. Ritter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8402527\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/911/362/#p370\">\n    911 A.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370 (Del. 2006) (stating that, \"good faith 'is a subsidiary element[,]' i.e., a condition, 'of the fundamental duty of loyalty.' \" (alteration in original) (citation omitted)). However, the statutory scheme compels us to recognize differences between each of the three duties listed in Utah Code section 16-10a-840(1). For instance, the URBCA allows corporations to indemnify their directors for a breach of the statutory duty of care identified in Utah Code section 16-10a-840(1)(b), but does not allow them to indemnify their directors for a breach of the duty of good faith identified in section 16-10a-840(1)(a), or a breach of the duty of loyalty identified in section 16-10a-840(1)(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-902(1) (\"[A] corporation may indemnify ... a director[ ] against liability incurred ... if: (a) his conduct was in good faith; and (b) he reasonably believed that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the corporation's best interests....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 19 One difference between subsections (1)(a) and (1)(c) is the mental state required under the plain language of the statute. When a director breaches the duty of good faith in (1)(a), she typically does so through intentional or willful misconduct. When a director breaches (1)(c) however, she must be acting on an unreasonable belief that her actions would be in the best interest of the company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, to adequately discharge her statutory duty of loyalty, the director must subjectively believe her actions are in the best interest of the corporation, and her subjective belief must be objectively reasonable-the reasonable person in those circumstances would likewise believe that the action would be in the best interests of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT \u00a7 8.30 cmt. at 8-196 ( AM. BAR ASS'N 2013 Revision) (\"The\n   phrase 'reasonably believes' is both subjective and objective in character. Its first level of analysis is geared to what the particular director, acting in good faith, actually believes.... The second level of analysis is focused specifically on 'reasonably.' \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, to breach (1)(c), the director must take some action that she either knows is not in the best interests of the corporation, or unreasonably or negligently believes is in the best interests of the corporation. Most importantly for this case, if the best interests of the corporation are served by the director's actions then there is no claim under subsection (1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    B. Standards of Liability Under Utah Code Section 16-10a-840(4)(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 20 While Utah Code section 16-10a-840(1) establishes the standards of conduct for officers and directors, Utah Code section 16-10a-840(4)(b) establishes the standards of liability. After establishing that a director or officer has breached a duty under subsection (1), the corporation or shareholder must prove that the duty was breached with any of the mental states noted in subsection (4)(b), that codifies, to some extent, the business judgment rule. Mr. Rawcliffe cites a string of Delaware cases for the proposition that the business judgment rule does not apply to \"directoral self-compensation decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telxon Corp. v.

While this may be persuasive authority, and we can see the policy reasons for such a rule, we are bound by the plain language of the URBCA, which does not provide for any exceptions to the application of subsection (4)(b). As noted above, the language of the statute clearly spells out the elements that a corporation or shareholder must establish to hold directors or officers liable for their official acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 21 Subsection (4)(b) provides that a director or officer can be liable for a breach of duty only if \"the breach or failure to perform [a duty] constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the shareholders.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-840(4)(b). A director may breach one of the standards of conduct identified in subsection (1), but can be held liable only if her conduct falls under one of the mental states in subsection (4)(b). Thus, a director may act negligently in violating her duty to act in the best interests of the corporation, but unless her negligence rises to the level of gross negligence, she \"is not liable to the corporation [or] its shareholders\" for breaching a standard of conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 16-10a-840(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 22 The mental states in subsection (4)(b) range from \"utter indifference ... at best [to] a concerted effort to destroy the business at worst.\"\n   <em>\n    Wachocki v.

Mr. Rawcliffe brought claims against the members of the Compensation Committee for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets in authorizing the spring-loaded SSARs, and claims against one other director and several officers for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment for receiving the spring-loaded SSARs.

Mr. Rawcliffe's Claims Against the Compensation Committee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 27 At oral argument, Mr. Rawcliffe cited two allegations in his complaint that he argues most strongly show a breach of fiduciary duty by the members of the Compensation Committee and meet the heightened pleading standard. First, the complaint alleges that \"the members of the Board's Compensation Committee ... knowingly and deliberately violated USANA's stockholder-approved equity plan.\" The allegation that the Compensation Committee violated the Plan is a conclusory statement that we do not assume is true, absent additional allegations supporting it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Second, the complaint alleges that \"the Compensation Committee deliberately granted the SSARs ... [to] ensure that the SSARs carried an artificially low exercise price,\" and that the committee thereby \"improperly violated the Plan by granting awards which they knew would be 'in the money' once the positive news ... was disclosed the following day.\" At best, these two allegations combine to allege that the Compensation Committee knowingly and deliberately approved spring-loaded SSARs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 28 However, Mr. Rawcliffe conceded on appeal that the Compensation Committee complied with the \"strict letter\" of the Plan when it authorized the spring-loaded SSARs. He argues only that the Compensation Committee violated \"the spirit and intent\" of the Plan when they \"us[ed] non-public, inside information to manipulate 'fair market value' to benefit themselves.\" We agree with Mr. Rawcliffe that if, and we emphasize\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   , the directors intended to circumvent the purposes of the Plan to benefit themselves to the detriment of the corporation or its shareholders, even if they complied with the \"letter\" of the Plan, he has adequately pled a breach of the duty of good faith. However, we do not agree with Mr. Rawcliffe's analysis of what purposes the Plan intended to fulfill, and hold that spring-loading does not, per se, violate those purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 29 The Plan is a document that governs the procedures the Compensation Committee must follow when it authorizes equity incentive awards.

First, the Plan defines fair market value as the \"mean between the highest and lowest selling price of a share of Common Stock on the principal exchange on which shares of Common Stock are then trading\" on the date on which the equity incentive award is announced. If the board of directors and shareholders who approved the Plan intended \"fair market value\" to mean something different (such as the actual value of the shares based on all non-public information rather than its market value based on its current price on the stock market) they would have stated as much. We cannot read into the Plan a \"spirit and intent\" that runs counter to what is actually written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 31 Additionally, the Plan specifically lays out its purposes. Article I of the Plan provides that its four purposes are to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) Closely associate the interests of management ... with the shareholders of the Company by reinforcing the relationship between participants' rewards and shareholder gains;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (2) Provide management and employees with an equity ownership in the Company commensurate with Company performance, as reflected in increased shareholder value;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (3) Maintain competitive compensation levels; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (4) Provide an incentive to management and employees to remain in continuing employment with the Company and to put forth maximum efforts for the success of its business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 32 Article I ends by stating that the Plan is \"intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract, and retain the services of members of the Board ... upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of the Company's operation is largely dependent.\" The Plan also gives the Compensation Committee the \"exclusive power, authority and discretion to\" determine the \"number of shares of Stock\" that should be issued as an incentive, and the \"terms and conditions of any Award ... including, but not limited to, the exercise price.\" It is difficult to imagine that such a broadly-worded document intends to completely prohibit spring-loading when it grants the Compensation Committee such large discretion in determining the amount of SSARs that can be awarded. If the Compensation Committee believed that spring-loading would violate the Plan or a standard of conduct under the URBCA, they could have simply awarded themselves and the other defendants a larger number of SSARs to make up the difference in profit from not spring-loading their awards. The \"spirit\" of the Plan is detailed quite well by the Plan itself, and we cannot say that spring-loading per se violates any of these purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 33 As spring-loading is not a per se violation of the Plan, the proper question is whether the directors and officers determined, in good faith, that the amount of spring-loaded SSARs and their attendant value met the purposes laid out in Article I. Thus, Mr. Rawcliffe would have to plead facts sufficient to show: 1) that the value of the awards were determined in bad faith or that the value of the awards did not serve the best interests of the corporation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-19; UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-840(1), (4)(a) ; and 2) that the Compensation Committee approved the awards with the intent to harm the corporation or that they were utterly indifferent to the fact that the awards would harm the corporation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-24; UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-840(4)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 34 In determining whether the corporation was actually harmed, or that the Compensation Committee intended to harm the corporation, we must look again to the purposes of the Plan. If the value of the spring-loaded SSARs, or the value of any equity incentive award, meets the purposes laid out in the Plan, then USANA and its shareholders have not been harmed. Indeed, if the purposes of the Plan have been met, then the spring-loaded SSARs have benefited USANA and its shareholders by incentivizing its officers. The shareholder-approved Plan details what the corporation and its shareholders believe is in their best interests. We are bound by the plainly stated purposes of the Plan in determining what is in the corporation's best interests. If the Compensation Committee takes an action that is in the corporation's best interests, then the corporation has not been harmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 35 Mr. Rawcliffe alleges that the awards were \"intended to and did line the pockets of the [defendants] at the expense of USANA and its shareholders.\" But this does not show that the purposes of the Plan were violated. Every compensation decision enriches the recipient at the expense of the company. One of the primary purposes of the Plan is to incentivize directors and officers to stay with the corporation by enriching them. The SSARs clearly met this purpose by 1) increasing the compensation of the directors and officers and 2) maintaining a 23-to-42 month vesting period, thereby incentivizing the directors and officers to stay with the company (so that they could actually exercise the SSARs)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   and continue to work hard to increase the company's stock price (to make sure the SSARs were \"in the money\" and to maximize their value).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 36 Mr. Rawcliffe did not allege that the defendants were over-compensated, just that they received spring-loaded SSARs. Essentially, Mr. Rawcliffe argues that spring-loaded equity incentive awards are a per se violation of the Plan's purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not agree. To meet rule 9(c)'s standard of pleading, Mr. Rawcliffe needed to plead something more to show how these particular awards violated the purposes of the Plan, thereby harming the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 37 We can imagine instances in which spring-loading would be a breach of one of the standards of conduct listed in Utah Code section 16-10a-840(a) and would also be done with a mental state in section 16-10a-840(4)(b) that is required to hold the director liable. As an example, to survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint would have to allege that the Compensation Committee acted in bad faith by awarding spring-loaded SSARs that were not tied to \"shareholder gains\" or \"increased shareholder value,\" or that they somehow violated other purposes laid out in Article I or inferred from the text of the Plan. The complaint would also have to allege that the Compensation Committee intentionally over-compensated themselves, or that they were utterly indifferent to the fact that they were over-compensating themselves and the other defendants.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 16-10a-840(4)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 38 However, Mr. Rawcliffe has failed to allege any facts showing that the Compensation Committee did not meet the purposes of the Plan in awarding the spring-loaded SSARs. Additionally, he has not alleged any facts sufficient to show that the Compensation Committee was utterly indifferent or intentionally violated the purposes of the Plan. He simply alleges that the Compensation Committee \"knowingly spring-loaded\" the SSARs. But incentivizing the directors and officers by awarding them with bonuses is one of the primary purposes of the Plan, so we cannot see how it harmed the corporation absent something more. We affirm the district court's dismissal of Mr. Rawcliffe's breach of fiduciary duty claim against the members of the Compensation Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 39 Mr. Rawcliffe's claim for corporate waste against the Compensation Committee members is likewise unavailing.

As we have already dismissed his claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the members of the Compensation Committee, who actively approved the SSARs, we cannot see how a director or officer who passively received the SSARs breached a fiduciary duty or violated the \"spirit\" of the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 42 Additionally, we hold that Mr. Rawcliffe has failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment. We cannot see how it is inequitable for the director and officers to retain the benefit of the spring-loaded SSARs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Desert Miriah, Inc. v. B &amp; L Auto, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11177428\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/12/580/\">\n    2000 UT 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11177428\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/12/580/\">\n    12 P.3d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Unjust enrichment requires that \"the acceptance or retention by the conferee of the benefit [must be] under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the conferee to retain the benefit without payment of its value.\" (citation omitted)). According to the facts pled in the complaint, the Compensation Committee approved the spring-loaded SSARs in strict compliance with the \"letter\" of the Plan, and the spring-loaded SSARs did not violate any of the purposes of the Plan. Unless he were to allege that the director and officers were over-compensated, or that the awards somehow violated the Plan, it is not unjust for the director and officers to keep their awards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the district court's dismissal of the remaining defendants in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 43 The Utah Revised Business Corporation Act establishes when a corporate director or officer may be held liable to the corporation or its shareholders for her official acts. Mr. Rawcliffe has failed to allege sufficient facts to establish any breach of such a duty. We cannot say that spring-loading SSARs constitutes a per se violation of USANA's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, and Mr. Rawcliffe has failed to allege any facts supporting the inference that the defendants intended to harm, or actually harmed the corporation. We affirm the district court's dismissal of this case without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The exercise price must be set by the Compensation Committee at not less than \"100% of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.\" The Plan defines Fair Market Value as \"the mean between the highest and lowest selling price of a share of Common Stock on the principal exchange on which shares of Common Stock are then trading, if any, on such date, or if shares were not traded on such date, then on the closest preceding date on which a trade occurred.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The terminology under the Plan is somewhat confusing. We provide the following information and a hypothetical to explain how this works. In this case, the SSARs were granted, and the exercise price was set, on February 3, 2014, (the grant date) with an exercise price of $57.62 (the market value of USANA's stock on February 3\n    <sup>\n     rd\n    </sup>\n    ). The SSARs each had specific vesting periods, during which they could not be exercised. The earliest any of the SSARs could be exercised was 23 months after the grant date. Thus, as a hypothetical, if a director exercised her SSARs on February 3, 2017, (three years after the grant date) and the fair market value of USANA's stock was $100 per share on the date she exercised them (called the exercise date), the director would be granted $42.38 worth of USANA stock per SSAR that she was granted. This is tied to the following calculation: $100 (the fair market value of USANA stock on the exercise date)-$57.62 (the exercise price) = $42.38. So, if a director were granted 12,000 SSARs in this hypothetical, the director would get $508,560 worth of USANA stock.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    If the SSARs were granted on February 5, 2014, the day after the good news was announced, the exercise price would have been $68.46. Under the same hypothetical, each SSAR would be worth only $31.54 on February 3, 2017, for a total value of $378,480.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 2 (giving the Plan's definition of \"Fair Market Value\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    This section was amended effective May 9, 2017.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    H.B. 41, 62nd Legis. \u00a7 1 (2017).

While this subsection, and its incorporation of subsection (1), appears to codify the common law duties held by corporate officers and directors, such duties are now creatures of statute and may be modified as the legislature sees fit. Thus, the common law of corporate fiduciary duties applies only insofar as it does not conflict with the statute. Whether the common law fiduciary duties exist independent of the statute remains an open question, as the parties concede that the statute applies to Mr. Rawcliffe's fiduciary duty claims in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    There may be other ways to violate the duty of good faith that do not necessarily require intentional or willful misconduct.

However, the determination of this question is not necessary to this case. We merely note that intentionally or willfully taking an action that the director knows is not in the best interests of the corporation is evidence of bad faith and is a violation of the duty of good faith.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carsanaro v.
