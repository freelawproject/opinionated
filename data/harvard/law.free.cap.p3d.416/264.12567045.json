Fairchild Jr. asked the district court to grant summary judgment on his cross-claims against Defendants Richard H. Love and R.H. Love Galleries, Inc. (collectively Love) on the ground that Love failed to timely file a response to Fairchild's motion for summary judgment and was therefore \"in default.\" Love, whose counsel had withdrawn while the motion was pending, explained that he lacked legal representation and had been experiencing health problems, and he requested an opportunity to submit a late response. The district court did not allow Love additional time to respond and granted Fairchild's motion for summary judgment without considering whether Fairchild had established a prima facie case for summary judgment under Rule 1-056 NMRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {2} We hold that the district court erred by granting summary judgment. A district court may not grant summary judgment solely because the non-moving party has failed to\n   file a response. Prior to granting an uncontested motion for summary judgment, the district court must assess whether the moving party has demonstrated that no genuine issue of material fact exists \"and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 1-056(C). We also hold that the Court of Appeals erred in its application of the right for any reason doctrine to affirm the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {3} Jerald W. Freeman, The Tea Leaf, Inc., and Thomas Nygard, Inc. (collectively Plaintiffs) jointly owned a painting by Albert Bierstadt that they had purchased for $180,000. In October 2002, three transactions involving the Bierstadt painting occurred in quick succession. First, Freeman agreed on behalf of Plaintiffs to sell the painting to Paul Benisek for $240,000, to be paid in twelve monthly installments. Second, Benisek agreed to sell the painting to Love for $300,000, also to be paid in twelve monthly installments. Finally, Love sold the painting to Fairchild for $375,000, which Fairchild paid in full with a combination of cash and the trade-in of three other pieces of artwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {4} In accordance with their respective agreements, Love made several payments to Benisek, and Benisek made several payments to Freeman. But in spring 2003, Love experienced financial trouble and stopped making payments to Benisek, who in turn stopped making payments to Freeman. Meanwhile, Fairchild consigned the Bierstadt painting for sale at a gallery in New York City. Freeman, who had not received full payment from Benisek, became aware that the New York gallery was attempting to sell the Bierstadt painting and asked the gallery to ship the painting to Santa Fe for inspection. Freeman obtained possession of the Bierstadt painting and refused to return it to the gallery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {5} Freeman initiated this lawsuit in June 2005, seeking a declaratory judgment to determine ownership of the Bierstadt painting and asserting other claims against Benisek, Love, and Fairchild. Freeman later amended his complaint to add the other plaintiffs. In May 2006, Fairchild filed counterclaims against Plaintiffs and cross-claims against Love for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/2 (1973) (Illinois Consumer Fraud Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {6} Fairchild's cross-claims against Love are the only claims at issue in the appeal before this Court. For over five years, the only litigation that occurred between Fairchild and Love beyond the pleadings consisted of Fairchild's initial set of discovery requests, to which Love responded. During this time, however, extensive litigation and discovery occurred between Plaintiffs and Love and between Plaintiffs and Fairchild, including numerous pretrial motions and depositions in several states. Six different district court judges presided over this case between 2005 and 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {7} On January 28, 2011, Love's New Mexico counsel, who had represented Love in this case for over five years, filed a motion to withdraw, stating that it would be \"impossible\" to continue representing Love. The district court granted the motion on February 24, 2011. On April 19, 2011, a new attorney entered an appearance to represent Love.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {8} Several weeks later, on May 16, 2011, Fairchild filed a motion for partial summary judgment on his cross-claims against Love for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act. According to the parties, Fairchild's counsel agreed to give Love's new counsel a two-week extension of time to file a response to Fairchild's motion for summary judgment, but we find no indication in the record that Love's new counsel requested an extension from the district court. In any event, Love's new counsel did not file a response, and on\n   June 9, 2011, less than two months into the representation, Love's new counsel moved to withdraw. The motion to withdraw stated that continuing the representation would risk a conflict of interest, that Love had violated agreements with the attorney's law firm, and that Love had \"repeatedly failed to respond to emails, correspondence, and telephone calls.\" The motion to withdraw listed several upcoming court dates and stated that Love had been informed \"of the procedural status of\" the case, but the motion did not specifically refer to Fairchild's pending motion for summary judgment. On June 13, 2011, the district court issued an order that granted the motion to withdraw. The order did not identify the pending motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {9} On July 12, 2011, Fairchild filed a request for an expedited hearing on his motion for summary judgment against Love. The district court held a hearing on August 2, 2011. At the hearing, Fairchild's counsel asserted that Love had failed to file a response and that the response deadline had \"passed by many weeks.\" Fairchild's counsel offered to address the substance of the motion but argued that Fairchild was entitled to summary judgment as a procedural matter because Love was \"in default.\" Love did not retain counsel prior to the hearing and appeared pro se by telephone from Illinois. Love informed the court that he had not been fully aware of the proceedings because he did not have legal representation and had been experiencing health problems, including hospitalization. Love asserted that his failure to respond had not been intentional, apologized for his lack of awareness, and asked the district court to consider giving him an opportunity to respond. The district court denied Love's request for more time to respond and granted Fairchild's motion for summary judgment on procedural grounds without addressing the substance of the motion, concluding that Fairchild's motion should be granted because Love had failed to file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {10} In early October 2011, the district court held a two-day bench trial to determine the amount of damages Love owed Fairchild. Love had not yet retained counsel and participated pro se by telephone from Illinois. The district court awarded Fairchild $1,942,446 in compensatory damages, which included Fairchild's attorney fees, costs, and prejudgment interest. The district court also awarded Fairchild $9,712,232 in punitive damages, an amount equal to five times the compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {11} Love retained appellate counsel and filed an appeal. The Court of Appeals held \"that it was error for the district court to grant Fairchild's motion for summary judgment solely on the basis of Love's failure to respond to the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240742\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2015/001/4240742/\">\n    2015-NMCA-001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20610\">\n    340 P.3d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals explained that \"[t]he district court should have deemed admitted the facts alleged in Fairchild's motion and then determined whether those facts made a prima facie showing of entitlement to summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20610\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Despite this error, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court by determining-in the first instance on appeal-that Fairchild had established \"a prima facie case of entitlement to summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20610\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In doing so, the Court of Appeals relied on the right for any reason doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20610\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals also affirmed the district court's award of damages to Fairchild.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. The Court of Appeals observed that \"it does seem extraordinary that Fairchild should be awarded in excess of $11 million for the fraudulent sale of a painting worth in the neighborhood of $400,000,\" but the Court declined to \"analyze Love's arguments\" because \"Love failed to preserve his arguments in the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {12} Love filed a petition for writ of certiorari, asking this Court to review two issues: (1) whether the Court of Appeals erred by affirming summary judgment under the right for any reason doctrine without addressing all of the elements of Fairchild's cross-claims, which are grounded in Illinois law; and (2) whether the district court committed fundamental error by awarding Fairchild $11.6 million in a dispute over a painting worth $375,000 where the Illinois statute on which the award was predicated did not allow the requested relief. We granted certiorari under\n   Article VI, Section 3 of the New Mexico Constitution and NMSA 1978, Section 34-5-14(B) (1972).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The District Court Erred by Granting Fairchild's Motion for Summary Judgment on the Ground That Love Failed to Timely File a Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {13} We first consider whether the district court erred by granting Fairchild's motion for summary judgment against Love. Our analysis includes two components: (1) whether the district court erred by granting summary judgment based solely on Love's failure to timely file a response, and (2) whether the district court erred by denying Love's request for an extension of time to file a response. Love argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment without following the procedures set forth in\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. City of Albuquerque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    2003-NMCA-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    134 N.M. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    75 P.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Love also contends that the district court failed to give Love a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that his failure to timely respond was the result of excusable neglect, which justified a time extension. Fairchild argues that the district court complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    2003-NMCA-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    134 N.M. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    75 P.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the district court acted within its discretion to deny Love's request for an extension of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

And neither the expedited hearing transcript nor the summary judgment order indicates that the district court was exercising its inherent power to sanction Love for abusive litigation conduct. The district court did not perform an explicit sanction analysis or make any findings regarding Love's culpability, actual prejudice to Fairchild, or interference with the judicial process.

The time limits for filing a response are set forth in the New Mexico Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts. Under those rules, a party opposing a motion for summary judgment must file a response within fifteen days after service of the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 1-007.1(D) NMRA (\"Unless otherwise specifically provided in these rules, any written response and all affidavits, depositions or other documentary evidence in support of the response shall be\n   filed within fifteen (15) days after service of the motion.\"); Rule 1-056(D)(2) (\"A party opposing the motion shall, within fifteen (15) days after service of the motion, submit to the court a written memorandum containing a short, concise statement of the reasons in opposition to the motion with authorities.\"). If a party requests a time extension after the response deadline has passed, the district court may grant an extension if the party's failure to respond was the result of excusable neglect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 1-006(B)(1)(b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atherton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4241004\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2015/003/4241004/\">\n    2015-NMCA-003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20630\">\n    340 P.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that the district court may grant an extension based on excusable neglect).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {24} Although the granting of a time extension is a matter within the district court's discretion, the district court must ensure adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before granting a motion for summary judgment without a response from the nonmoving party.

The Court of Appeals adopted this procedure despite language in Rule 1-007.1(D) NMRA (2000), which stated that a failure to timely file a response \"constitutes consent to grant the motion, ... and the court may enter an appropriate order.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    2003-NMCA-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15-17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    134 N.M. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"77127\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/134/207/\">\n    75 P.3d 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, Fairchild requested an expedited hearing, and at the hearing, Fairchild asked the district court to enter a \"default\" judgment. Love responded that he lacked legal representation and had not been aware of the proceedings because he had been in the hospital and had not been receiving mail on a regular basis. Love admitted \"to some kind of negligence ... by not being more receptive to what was going on,\" but explained that he \"had open heart surgery and found it difficult to be receptive to what the rest of the world was doing.\" Love acknowledged that he was \"not speaking eloquently as an attorney\" but explained that it was \"disconcerting to have summary judgment brought against you and not realize how it all came about.\" In reply, Fairchild's counsel argued that Love had been served with all of the relevant papers and that Love's heart surgery was not \"a legitimate issue\" because it had occurred months earlier. Fairchild's counsel complained that Fairchild had \"been suffering through this [case] for almost six years\" and that it was \"time to bring liability to a head.\" Love attempted to speak further but was silenced by the district court judge. Without further presentation from the parties, the district court ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I find that this case has been pending for approximately six years, over six years. Throughout these proceedings there have been numerous hearings, pleadings, positions presented to the Court. Time has\n   come now to rule on Mr. Fairchild's Motion for Summary Judgment against Love .... I find that there is not a sufficient basis upon which to allow Mr. Love additional time in which to respond. Because there has not been a substantive response to the motion, under the Rules [of Civil Procedure for the District Courts] I find that the motion shall be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {27} We conclude that Love should have been afforded more time to respond prior to any entry of judgment. Love's counsel, who entered this case less than a month before Fairchild filed his motion for summary judgment, failed to timely file a response or to move the district court for an extension of time. After the response deadline passed, Love's counsel sought and obtained leave of court to withdraw from this case. Neither the motion to withdraw nor the order permitting withdrawal referenced or made provisions for responding to the pending summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Rule 1-089(B) NMRA (stating that the district \"court may place conditions on an order approving withdrawal as justice requires\"). After the district court granted Fairchild's motion for summary judgment, Love explained that he had been trying to retain substitute counsel but that several attorneys had told him that his case was \"too large and complex for anyone to take on immediately.\" Additionally, the record on appeal confirms that Love had a variety of health problems in 2010 and 2011, including Parkinson's disease and multiple surgeries and hospitalizations. Finally, although the district court was justifiably concerned that this case had been pending for over six years, the vast majority of the litigation did not involve Fairchild's cross-claims against Love, and Fairchild's motion for summary judgment against Love had been pending for only a couple of months. We hold that the district court should have granted Love an extension of time to file a response or, at a minimum, an opportunity to substantiate his claim that his failure to respond was the result of excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At the damages trial, Fairchild presented testimony from Chicago attorney Ellen Robins. Robins testified that her law firm performed work for Fairchild pertaining to a total of \"20 paintings that Mr. Love had sold Mr. Fairchild\" and \"an FBI investigation of Mr. Fairchild related to the Love transactions.\" Based on this testimony, Fairchild argued that the district court should award all of his attorney fees because the work performed by the Chicago law firm on other matters was \"all kind of intertwined\" with this litigation, including the \"FBI portion.\" The district court granted Fairchild's request for all of his attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {39} Love argues that Fairchild based his claim for attorney fees on the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act, but that neither the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act nor any other provision of law allows the recovery that Fairchild received.
