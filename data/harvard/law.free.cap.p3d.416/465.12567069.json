We do not reach the merits of this case because we hold that we lack jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother is awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal. We remand this case to the district court for a determination of those fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Mother and Father petitioned for divorce in the district court in 2008. In 2012, Father petitioned to terminate Mother's parental rights based on unsubstantiated allegations of her sexual abuse of their two children. Mother counter-petitioned the court to terminate Father's parental rights or to award her physical custody of the children. As a result of the exclusive original jurisdiction of the juvenile court over matters concerning \"the termination of the legal parent-child relationship,\" Utah Code section 78A-6-103(1)(g), and \"mak[ing] a finding of substantiated, unsubstantiated, or without merit,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   section 78A-6-103(6), on matters of \"a severe type of child abuse or neglect,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   section 78A-6-323(1), the juvenile court heard the petition rather than the district court. The juvenile court and the district court maintained concurrent jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   section 78A-6-104 until the exclusive original jurisdiction of the juvenile court was extinguished.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-104(1)(b). (\"The district court or other court has concurrent jurisdiction with the juvenile court: ... with regard to proceedings initiated under Part 3, Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings, or Part 5, Termination of Parental Rights Act.\"). Therefore, while the district court had continuing jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings, including a determination \"of support, custody, and parent-time ... incidental to the determination of a cause in district court,\" the juvenile court could \"change the custody ... support, parent-time, and visitation rights previously ordered in the district court as necessary to implement the order of the juvenile court for the safety and welfare of the child. ... so long as the jurisdiction of the juvenile court continues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-104(3)-(4)(b). \"The juvenile court has jurisdiction over questions of custody, support, and parent-time, of a minor who comes within the court's jurisdiction ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-104(5). The juvenile court denied Father's petition to terminate Mother's parental rights, granted Mother custody of the minor children, cited both Father and J.S. (Stepmother) for contempt, and ordered Father and Stepmother to pay all legal fees, costs, and expenses incurred by Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Father and Stepmother prematurely appealed the juvenile court's order before it became a final order, because the award for attorney fees and costs had not yet been reduced to a judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DFI Props.

But the court of appeals, apparently unaware that the order appealed from was not a final order, failed to dismiss\n   the notice of appeal and instead issued an opinion affirming \"[t]he juvenile court's order ... in all respects except for the determination of contempt,\" which it vacated because of lack of notice and hearing and remanded to the juvenile court for a hearing on the contempt allegations.\n   <em>\n    In re E.S. &amp; N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968703\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/744/\">\n    2013 UT App 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968703\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/744/\">\n    310 P.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On remand from the court of appeals, the juvenile court held contempt proceedings on December 13, 2013, issuing its contempt order against Father and Stepmother on January 23, 2014. A child welfare status hearing was held on January 16, 2014 with a follow-up phone conference on February 20, 2014. The juvenile court, having determined that the outstanding motions regarding the child welfare case were resolved as of its March 17, 2014 order, released the Guardian ad Litem from the matter and terminated the juvenile court's jurisdiction, noting that a separate order regarding the contempt charges was issued and that the outstanding order for attorney fees would be referred to the district court for entry of a judgment, because that court now had exclusive jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78A-6-103 to -104. The findings and order of the juvenile court are \"binding\n   <em>\n    on the parties to the divorce action\n   </em>\n   as though entered in the district court\" when \"a copy ... has been filed with the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968703\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/744/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-104(4)(c) (emphasis added). However, once the district court again has exclusive continuing jurisdiction, the district court is able to make changes to those orders to ensure the appropriate needs of the children and the parties are met.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6968703\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/744/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3-5(3)-(4) (\"The [district] court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for the custody of the children and their support, maintenance, health, and dental care, and for distribution of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary. ... Child support, custody, visitation, and other matters related to children born to the mother and father after entry of the decree of divorce may be added to the decree by modification.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 As jurisdiction over the case had been transferred to the district court, Mother filed a motion for a judgment on the attorney fees and costs ordered by the juvenile court, with accompanying memorandum and affidavit. Father opposed the motion, arguing that the court did not have authority to award attorney fees and costs, but not addressing the specific validity of the amount requested. The case first came before a commissioner, who ended the proceedings when Father's counsel began to argue the lack of authority of the juvenile court to award attorney fees. The commissioner correctly noted that a juvenile court judge, with the equivalent authority of a district court judge, had made the ruling and that the commissioner did not have authority to change the ruling of \"a higher judicial authority ... [that says Mother] gets attorney's fees.\" \"[A commissioner] cannot decide that a higher judicial authority got it wrong.\" The matter then came before the district court, which granted Mother's motion for attorney fees, found that the fees requested were reasonable, and entered a judgment in the amount of $180,780.47 against Father. This judgment and order was dated April 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Father then had 14 days\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to file a motion for a new trial under Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 59. UTAH R. CIV. P. 59(b) (2014) (\"A motion for a new trial shall be served not later than 14 days after the date of entry of the judgment.\"). Thus, the deadline for filing a rule 59 motion in this case was April 20, 2015. Father admits in his brief that \"[o]n April 20-21, 2015\" he filed \"documents associated with a U.R.C.P. Rule 59 motion.\" In the district court's order denying Father's rule 59 motion, the court correctly stated that the Father's motion was filed on April 21, 2015. Father attempts to overcome this timeliness issue in his brief to this court with the following explanation: \"(NOTE: That date [April 21st] is in error. It was filed electronically the day before.)\" However, the docket shows that although the memorandum and its exhibits were filed on April 20, 2015, just before midnight, the electronic time stamp shows that the rule 59 motion along with several other supporting documents were filed just after midnight on April 21, 2015, ranging from three to sixteen minutes after midnight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Because counsel for Father was not able to account for this procedural defect at oral arguments, we ordered supplemental briefing from both parties regarding the timeliness of the rule 59 motion and whether, if the rule 59 motion was untimely, the filing of the memorandum was sufficient to confer jurisdiction. Father did not meet his burden of persuasion in his supplemental brief, and we therefore hold that we do not have jurisdiction to rule on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The timeliness of a rule 59(e) motion is a matter of law reviewed for correctness.

The plain language in rule 6(b)(2) gives no discretion to the district court in deciding whether to accept an untimely filed rule 59 motion.

He cannot rely on a rule that was amended after his untimely filing. His obligation was to file within the constraints of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure as they existed at the time of filing. Future amendments do not remedy past failures. Furthermore, his memorandum would still fail to qualify as sufficient even under the new scheme.

Father also attempts to shore up his late filing by citing the harmless error standard in Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 61. While this rule provides that courts should \"disregard any error or defect\" that \"does not affect the substantial rights of the parties\" during proceedings, this rule is not intended to provide lawyers grounds to seek \"a new trial or otherwise disturb[ ] a judgment or order\" by a finding that a mistake was \"harmless error.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985774\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 61.

A subsequent amendment of a procedural rule regarding the filing of motions does not affect the procedural requirements that existed at the time a motion is filed. Regardless, Father's memorandum would fail to meet the requirements of the amended version of rule 7 as well as the 2014 version of rule 7.

In\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   , before a final judgment was entered, the United States Supreme Court decided a case that might \"impact the grant of summary judgment against the [plaintiffs]. The court asked the parties to brief the [statute of limitations] issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration that addressed not only the [statute of limitations] issue on which the court asked for briefing, but also \"seeking a review of all claims previously granted summary judgment and raising new claims for the first time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.

In our review of the\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   court's ruling, we restated that \"motions to reconsider are not recognized anywhere in either the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure or the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure,\" and held that \" 'trial courts are under no obligation to consider motions for reconsideration' and 'any decision to address or not to address the merits of such a motion is highly discretionary.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34 (citations omitted). Once again, a final judgment had not been entered in\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   when the motion for reconsideration was filed, and the trial court still had jurisdiction, distinguishing it from the present case. Therefore, the court was not barred in\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   from considering\n   the merits according to its discretion. However, in the case before us, Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(2) deprived the district court of jurisdiction to hear the untimely rule 59 motion.

Both arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 Father declares that \"[i]t is a very significant fact and equitable element of this issue and case that the district court itself identified and found harmless and immaterial the alleged untimeliness.\" According to his theory, \"court[s] ha[ve] inherent authority to address prior misstatements in its rulings at any time and no matter how the error might come to its attention. ... to maintain and protect the integrity of the courts.\" Father cites\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   in support of his theory that trial courts have discretion whether to consider a motion.\n   <em>\n    Burdick v.

Because the district court in the present case allegedly used its discretion in allowing and considering the\n   untimely rule 59 motion, Father argues it was also \"preserved,\" and as a result the notice of appeal was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634 He also claims that because \"[t]here was no objection by Appellee or the district court,\" this court should \"find no abuse of discretion in the district court accepting and ruling upon [the] Rule 59 Motion.\" To buttress his argument, he cites to\n   <em>\n    Warner v.

Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(2) strips a district court of authority to hear an untimely rule 59 motion, operating as a bar that prevents the district court from considering the motion. Further, neither the district court's ruling on the untimely rule 59 motion, nor the lack of objection by Mother in the underlying procedure, constitute a proper waiver. The mandate of rule 6(b)(2) cannot be waived. It is not open to discretion but is required, and failure to follow its mandate constitutes error. It is irrelevant whether the district court treated the motion as timely filed, because the issue before us is whether Father appealed the district court's final order as required by Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(C), thereby establishing the jurisdiction of this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b636 The district court erred as a matter of law in treating the rule 59 motion as timely because the court's only option according to the procedural rules was to deny the motion because it was untimely. We therefore vacate the October 27, 2015 order of the district court. Because the rule 59 motion was untimely filed, the deadline to file a notice of appeal was not tolled, and the 30-day window to file an appeal began to run on April 6, 2015, the date of the district court's judgment and order. The notice of appeal filed on November 25, 2015, was therefore also untimely and does not establish jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   IV.

Consequently, the district court did not have the authority to rule on the untimely motion, and we vacate the district court's October 27th order denying Father's rule 59 motion.

In the first place, it may not be without use to ascertain what is here meant by appellate jurisdiction, and what is the mode in which it may be exercised. The essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction is, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause. In reference to judicial tribunals, an appellate jurisdiction, therefore, necessarily implies that the subject-matter has been already instituted in and acted upon by some other court, whose judgment or proceedings are to be revised.\").
