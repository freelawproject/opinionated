Such exposure is referred to as secondary, or take-home, asbestos exposure. We hold that the employer owed no duty to the public regarding secondary asbestos exposure. No common law special relationship existed requiring the employer to protect the public from secondary asbestos exposure. Additionally, Plaintiffs/Appellants have identified no public policy giving rise to such a duty. Further, because we reject the duty framework contained in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm (\"Third Restatement\"), we hold that no duty exists on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b62 In reaching our decision today, we affirm Arizona's current duty framework in several key respects. First, duty is not presumed; in every negligence case, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the existence of a duty. Second, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Gipson v.

Third, duty is based on either special relationships recognized by the common law or relationships created by public policy. Fourth, in the context of duty, the primary sources for identifying public policy are state and federal statutes. In the absence of such legislative guidance, duty may be based on the common law-specifically, case law or Restatement sections consistent with Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 Ernest V. Quiroz died in October 2014 from mesothelioma, a form of cancer associated with exposure to asbestos. Quiroz's surviving wife, children, and parents (collectively, \"the Family\") filed a lawsuit, alleging Defendants Reynolds Metal Company, Alcoa, Inc., and Reywest Development Company (collectively, \"Reynolds\") negligently caused his death. Specifically, the Family alleges that when Quiroz's father (\"Father\") was working at Reynolds' plant from 1948 until 1983, his clothes were contaminated with asbestos fibers. The Family contends that when Father came home from work, Quiroz, who lived with Father as a minor from 1952 to 1970, was exposed to the asbestos fibers on Father's clothes. The Family further contends this exposure eventually caused Quiroz's mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 The Family asserts that Reynolds had a duty to protect Quiroz from exposure to take-home asbestos. They contend Reynolds breached this duty by failing to warn Father about the dangers of secondary asbestos exposure. The Family also alleges that Reynolds failed to provide safety equipment to Father and failed to take necessary safety measures to protect Quiroz from such exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 Reynolds filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting it owed no duty to Quiroz.

Indeed, the dissent recognizes that \u00a7 371 does not create such a duty.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 Section 371 directs that a landowner is liable for injuries he causes outside his property \"under the same conditions as though the activity were carried on at a neutral place.\" The comments define \"neutral place\" to mean a place \"in which both the person who does the act and the person who sustains bodily harm have an equal right or privilege or absence of right or privilege to be.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   cmt. a. Such places include \"a highway, public hall or other public place,\" as well as \"land in the possession of a third person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b645 In short, a landowner's liability under \u00a7 371 is not limited by the common law rules regarding a plaintiff who enters the\n   <em>\n    landowner's\n   </em>\n   property (designating the plaintiff as a licensee, invitee, or trespasser). Such designations have no relevance in a \"neutral place\" where both parties have an equal right to occupy the property. Of course, any liability under this section presupposes that the landowner owes some recognized duty to the plaintiff. Thus, absent a special relationship or public policy creating a duty, \u00a7 371 does not, by itself, create a duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b646 In sum, in an effort to expand the limits of a landowner's duty for off-premises injuries, the dissent seeks to rely on cases and Restatement sections premised on foreseeability. To avoid the obvious conflict this approach creates with\n   <em>\n    Gipson\n   </em>\n   , they recharacterize the subject cases and Restatement sections by claiming they do not rely on foreseeability to determine\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   , but rather they support \"a finding of negligence and thus liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b647 There are two fundamental problems with this approach. First, whether it falls under the general auspices of \"negligence\" or \"liability,\" both the Family and the dissent are in fact using cases and Restatement sections premised on foreseeability to create a new duty. Second, by characterizing the duty analysis as one addressing \"negligence\" or \"liability,\" they ignore duty as a separate element of a negligence claim, and obscure the lines between duty, breach, and causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b648 Thus, we disagree with the Family and the dissent. Duty is a separate, material element of every negligence claim; it should not be effectively removed as an element by merging it with the broad terms of \"negligence\" and \"liability.\" Additionally, because\n   <em>\n    Gipson\n   </em>\n   has changed Arizona law by removing foreseeability from the duty framework, we cannot rely on foreseeability to expand the duties of landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

This problem stems from the fact that, practically speaking, a defendant can increase the risk of harm to a plaintiff by both his actions (\u00a7 7) and by his failure to act to protect the plaintiff from harm (\u00a7 37). Thus, the Third Restatement emphasizes that risk creation is not limited to conduct that\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   creates a risk of harm but includes any conduct that might\n   <em>\n    possibly increase\n   </em>\n   the risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=965%20N.E.2d%201092\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 37 cmts. c and d;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=965%20N.E.2d%201092\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19 cmt. e (stating duty is presumed where \"defendant's conduct creates or increases the possibility of harm caused by third-party misconduct\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b656 Additionally, risk creation is not confined to the specific act that causes an injury.

A duty based on a negligent undertaking does not arise solely because a defendant committed an act that might harm someone.

Thus, by urging us to adopt the Third Restatement, the Family and the dissent are urging us to change our duty framework. For the reasons discussed below, we think such a drastic change is both unwise and unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b675 The primary flaw in the Third Restatement's risk-creation framework is that it effectively creates a presumed duty of care owed by all people at all times.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II(A). It does this in two ways. First, apart from a general admonition to do nothing to create a risk of harm to \"others\"-which of course, encompasses almost anything that we do-the Third Restatement provides no fixed rights or obligations. Such a duty framework, however, fails to answer the difficult question underlying duty: to\n   <em>\n    whom\n   </em>\n   does a person owe a duty? Rather than answering this question, the Third Restatement avoids it by stating a duty is owed to everyone all the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b676 Avoiding this issue does not resolve it. As Prosser &amp; Keeton note, \"The rule that you are to love your neighbor becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbor; and the lawyer's question,.... Who, then, in law is my neighbor?\" Prosser &amp; Keeton, \u00a7 53, at 358 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In answering this question, we cannot provide any meaningful guidance to courts and practitioners without defining the rights and obligations of the parties before a plaintiff is injured. In short, we recognize that \"before negligence can be predicated [on] a given act, [in] back of the act must be sought and found a duty to the individual complaining.\"\n   <em>\n    Palsgraf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20N.E.%2099\">\n    162 N.E. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99-100 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Prosser &amp; Keeton, \u00a7 53, at 356 (stating that duty is an obligation a defendant owes \"for the benefit of the\n   <em>\n    particular plaintiff\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ); Pollock,\n   <em>\n    Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   , p. 468 (13th ed. 1920) (\"[N]egligence does not exist in the abstract, it contemplates a legal duty owing from one party to another.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b677 Thus, in Arizona we have sought, by means of special relationships and relationships created by public policy, to define the rights and obligations of the parties\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a defendant, by his acts or omissions, places a plaintiff at risk of physical injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 63;\n   <em>\n    Markowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516228\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/146/352/#p356\">\n    146 Ariz. at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516228\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/146/352/#p356\">\n    706 P.2d at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a duty exists when\n   \"the relationship of the parties was such that the defendant was under an obligation to use some care to avoid or prevent injury to the plaintiff\"). This framework, even with its flaws, has been carefully worked out by our courts for many years and provides a workable, useful approach to determining duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b678 By presuming a duty is owed to everyone, the Third Restatement eliminates duty as a separate element of a negligence claim. Under the risk-creation framework, duty exists whenever a plaintiff suffers an injury; as a result, the issue of duty is subsumed by causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Additionally, by focusing on a person's conduct, or\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   a person acts, the Third Restatement conflates duty with the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b679 The dissent demonstrates this flaw in the Third Restatement approach by arguing that Reynolds owed a duty to Quiroz because the \"manner\" in which it \"operat[ed]\" its factory created a risk of exposing Quiroz to take-home asbestos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. But the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which Reynolds operated its plant addresses the issue of\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   Reynolds should have acted, not whether Reynolds owed a duty to Quiroz in the first place. As Prosser &amp; Keeton state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   It is better to reserve \"duty\" for the problem of the relation between individuals which imposes upon one a legal obligation for the benefit of the other, and to deal with\n   <em>\n    particular conduct\n   </em>\n   in terms of a legal standard of what is required to meet the obligation....\n   <em>\n    What the defendant must do, or must not do, is a question of the standard of conduct required to satisfy the duty\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Prosser &amp; Keeton, \u00a7 53, at 356 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1032604\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/189/206/\">\n    189 Ariz. at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1032604\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/189/206/\">\n    941 P.2d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that duty is based on the relations between individuals and should not be equated with the specific details of a party's conduct);\n   <em>\n    Markowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516228\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/146/352/#p356\">\n    146 Ariz. at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516228\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/146/352/#p356\">\n    706 P.2d at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he existence of a duty is not to be confused with details of the standard of conduct.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b680 Creating a tort law system based on a presumed duty owed by everyone all the time carries with it serious consequences. As an initial matter, limitless duties expand tort liability beyond manageable bounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b681 The present case illustrates this point. Under the Third Restatement approach, Reynolds would have owed a presumed duty of care to any person that Father encountered after leaving the plant (assuming, of course, that Father was carrying asbestos fibers on his clothes). As a result, Reynolds would have owed a presumed duty of care to Father's neighbors and friends, babysitters and cab drivers, waiters and bartenders, dentists and physicians, and fellow church members. If the asbestos fibers were transferred to the clothes of Father's children, then the presumed duty of care would have extended to the children's playmates, schoolmates, and teachers. And of course, if each person contacted by Father or his family members transferred asbestos fibers to other third parties, then Reynolds' presumed duty would have expanded to an even wider circle of potential plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b682 Other courts addressing take-home asbestos illustrate these concerns about the limitless scope of such a duty. For example,\n   <em>\n    Satterfield\n   </em>\n   , which adopted the Third Restatement duty approach in combination with foreseeability, acknowledged that an employer's liability for take-home asbestos would extend \"to those who regularly and repeatedly come into close contact with an employee's contaminated work clothes over an extended period of time, regardless of whether they live in the employee's home or are a family member.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202882\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/347/#p362\">\n    266 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   374 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Certified Question from the Fourteenth Dist.

While true, the burden of proving a no-duty rule rests squarely on the shoulders of the defendant. Moreover, defendants seeking relief from the presumed duty of care face a daunting task; they must convince a court that, in their cases, a no-duty rule is justified based on \"general social norms of responsibility\" and the \"overall social impact\" of imposing such a no-duty rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Moreover, such a procedure is at odds with the judicial restraint we exercise in declaring public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b684 The dissent also claims that even with a presumed duty, a plaintiff must still prove breach and causation to impose liability on a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115. Of course, this ignores the fact the Third Restatement creates a limitless\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   owed by a defendant to the whole world. As Prosser &amp; Keeton note, \"[Duty] is embedded far too firmly in our law to be discarded, and no satisfactory substitute for it, by which the defendant's responsibility may be limited, has been devised.\" Prosser &amp; Keeton, \u00a7 53, at 358. Plainly, presuming duty effectively creates the risk of unlimited liability because \"[i]t throws the question of any limitation back into the morass of 'proximate cause' and the search for some reasonably close connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 43 at 287;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Third Restatement \u00a7 29 and cmts. a and f (stating that apart from creating a no-duty rule under \u00a7 7(b), factual cause, formerly known as proximate cause, is the Third Restatement's means of limiting a defendant's liability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b685 The Third Restatement's limitless duty also distorts the tort law's goals of compensating injured parties and deterring negligent conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prosser &amp; Keeton, \u00a7 4, at 20-26.

Although the employer created the risk of physical harm-and failed to warn its employees or the persons ultimately injured-the majority concludes that the employer must be immunized from even the prospect of liability, no matter how reckless or otherwise unreasonable its conduct may have been.

Reynolds's relevant conduct was releasing asbestos and not containing it within its facility. Based on the summary judgment record before us, Reynolds failed to even warn its workers, much less afford them a means to prevent their carrying home asbestos dust in their clothing. Thus, the determination of liability should not turn on whether the injury was caused by wind-borne asbestos, employee-borne asbestos, or an errant fly ball; a landowner owes a duty of care when it exposes others to risks of injury, even when the harm occurs off-premises, and may be liable under \u00a7 371 if a plaintiff establishes that section's prerequisites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6111 The majority observes that \u00a7 371 \"does not ... create ... a general duty on landowners for off-premises injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. To be sure, \u00a7 371 does not itself create an independent source of duty; rather, it clarifies that those in possession of land have the same liability to others for their activities on that land as they would have if those activities were conducted in a neutral place, such as a highway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Restatement \u00a7 371 cmt. a. That is, liability in these circumstances flows not from one's status as a landowner but from conduct creating an unreasonable risk of physical injury that proximately causes injury. For example, a landowner whose on-site activity unreasonably releases toxic waste that injures others off-site is liable just as the landowner would be for releasing it while transporting it on a public highway. (The cases from \"other jurisdictions\" cited by the majority,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49, do not consider \u00a7 371.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6112 The majority errs by arguing that \u00a7 371 cannot support the imposition of liability on Reynolds because the Second Restatement bases duty on foreseeability and\n   <em>\n    Gipson\n   </em>\n   rejected that approach.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.

Sections 38-44 include traditional affirmative duties based on special relationships (e.g., parent and child) and the rescue doctrine. In other words, under the Third Restatement, a person does not owe a duty of care unless his or her conduct creates a risk of physical harm or an affirmative duty applies. This is a far cry from Reynolds's contention that \u00a7 7 imposes a \"free flowing general duty of care at all times to all people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6121 Moreover, \u00a7 7 does not depart from the Second Restatement's substantive approach. The Second Restatement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   In general, anyone who does an affirmative act is under a duty to others to exercise the care of a reasonable man to protect them against an unreasonable risk of harm to them arising out of the act. The duties of one who merely omits to act are more restricted, and in general are confined to situations where there is a special relation between the actor and the other which gives rise to the duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Second Restatement \u00a7 302 cmt. a. The Second Restatement's blackletter text also reflects this view, as it bases liability on, among other things, an actor's negligent conduct without separately referring to \"duty.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Restatement \u00a7 281 (listing elements of negligence cause of action). Negligent conduct in turn is defined as a person's either acting to create an unreasonable risk of harm,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 284(a), or-when \"under a duty to do\" so-failing to protect or assist another,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 284(b). Thus, the Second Restatement generally presumes that people have a duty to act reasonably with respect to their affirmative acts, but liability for failing to protect another requires a duty arising from some special relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Restatement \u00a7\u00a7 314, 315. \"Normally, where there is an affirmative act which affects the interests of another, there is a duty not to be negligent with respect to the doing of the act.\" Second Restatement ch. 12, topic 4, scope note. In this respect, the Second Restatement anticipates the Third Restatement's formulation: when engaging in affirmative conduct, the actor has a duty to exercise reasonable care so as to not harm others. Although \u00a7 7 of the Third Restatement refines the Second Restatement by focusing on risk creation as opposed to act and omission, it does not deviate from the general principles recognized in the Second Restatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6122 Section 7's focus on risk creation reflects how this Court has long examined the existence of a legal duty. For instance, in 1925, this Court held that \"[a]s a general proposition, one who voluntarily\n   <em>\n    creates\n   </em>\n   and maintains a condition for the use of others is,\n   in the absence of some privilege, charged with the duty to exercise care to prevent that condition from becoming a source of danger to those who use it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cummings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4974396\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/28/207/#p211\">\n    28 Ariz. at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4974396\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/28/207/#p211\">\n    236 P. 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
