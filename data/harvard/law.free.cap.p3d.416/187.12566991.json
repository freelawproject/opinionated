McClanahan pled not guilty and was ultimately released after he signed the District Court's Release Order and Conditions of Release. McClanahan did not show up to the final pretrial conference on November 16, 2016, and was subsequently charged with bail jumping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Ed Sheehy was appointed to represent McClanahan on the bail jumping charge, and he moved to dismiss. Sheehy argued McClanahan did not have notice of the November 16, 2016 hearing. Knowledge of the final pretrial conference is a necessary element of the bail jumping charge. The District Court denied McClanahan's motion to dismiss, concluding that the State should be allowed to introduce evidence at trial as to what, if anything, Sweeney told McClanahan about appearing at the final pretrial conference on November 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Sweeney sent a letter notifying the State that she would assert attorney-client privilege for any line of questioning about communications with McClanahan and the preparation of his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State filed a motion in limine and the District Court determined that Sweeney would have to testify as to whether she told McClanahan about the final pretrial conference. The State issued a subpoena directing Sweeney to appear and testify at trial. Sweeney made a motion to quash the subpoena, which was denied by the District Court. Sweeney filed a Petition for a Writ of Supervisory Control with this Court, alleging that she should not be required to testify against McClanahan based on the attorney-client privilege. We granted the writ on November 20, 2017, and heard oral argument on the merits of the issues raised on January 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 This Court has supervisory control over all other courts and may, on a case-by-case basis, supervise a district court by way of a writ of supervisory control. Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 2 (2); M. R. App. P. 14(3). Supervisory control is appropriate when the normal appeal process is inadequate, when the case involves purely legal questions, and when one or more of the following circumstances exist: (1) the other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice; (2) constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved; or (3) the other court has granted or denied a motion for substitution of a judge in a criminal case.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The normal appeal process would be inadequate here, as the issue before us is whether an attorney may be required by the District Court to testify against her client on a different charge. This case also involves a purely legal question. We hold the District Court is proceeding under a mistake of law and may cause a gross injustice by compelling Sweeney to testify against McClanahan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II of the Montana Constitution grant a criminal defendant the\n   right to counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI ; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24. Effective counsel relies heavily upon open communication with clients. To facilitate trust, certain communications between an attorney and her client are protected. By compelling Sweeney to testify against McClanahan on his bail jumping charge, the District Court potentially impeded on McClanahan's right to counsel.\n   \u00b6 10 This case presents an issue of first impression in Montana. Other courts, including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, have addressed whether an attorney informing a client of a court date is considered confidential communication within the scope of the attorney-client privilege.

An attorney cannot be examined as to any advice given to the client. Courts have struggled with defining legal \"advice\" in this context, particularly where it is not possible to ascertain whether the substance of a communication from attorney to client constituted legal \"advice given to the client\" for purposes of the attorney-client privilege. Nonetheless, in the context of representing a client in a criminal case, advising a client of a hearing date, the disregard of which could result in additional criminal liability, is inseparably intertwined with the concept of legal advice. Here, the Montana statute provides another avenue for interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 Significantly, the statute precludes an attorney from being examined. The District Court is compelling Sweeney to take the stand and be examined against her wishes regarding communications with her own client to prove that he committed a new\n   offense. An examination is the \"questioning of a witness under oath.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   680 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). That is precisely what the State proposed to do by issuing the subpoena to Sweeney. Here, the attorney's compelled testimony would violate her duty of undivided loyalty to her current client, McClanahan. Independent of the attorney-client privilege, an attorney has a legal duty of undivided loyalty to a client, a duty which we have held to be inviolate and fundamental to the attorney-client relationship and the proper functioning of our adversarial system of justice.\n   <em>\n    Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v.

Regardless of whether the subject statements from counsel to client in this case constituted \"advice given\" for purposes of \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA, compelling counsel to testify under these circumstances would violate her duty of undivided loyalty to McClanahan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Given that advising a client of a hearing date in a criminal case is inseparably intertwined with the concept of legal advice and that compelled inquiry of counsel to distinguish between advice and non-advice would vitiate counsel's duty of undivided loyalty to the client, we hold that the District Court erred when it denied the motion to quash the subpoena compelling Sweeney to submit to examination on whether she advised her client of the fate of his final pretrial conference. Furthermore, \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA, prohibits the District Court from compelling Sweeney to testify about communications made with McClanahan without his consent when her testimony would prove the elements of a new charge against McClanahan.

This is an overbroad rendering of the statute, which does not stop after the word \"examined.\" Rather, it precludes an attorney from being examined only about certain subjects, namely, \"as to any communication made by the client to the attorney or the advice given to the client in the course of professional employment.\" Section 26-1-803(1), MCA. Thus, the statute may not foreclose an attorney from being questioned, for example, about a life-and-death emergency involving the client, because the attorney may be able to provide helpful information that does not conflict with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 My concern in this case is the statute's prohibition on examination of an attorney about \"the advice given to the client.\" During oral argument, the State indicated that it wanted to ask Sweeney two questions. The first question was whether she had communicated the\n   date of the final pretrial conference to McClanahan. I do not believe this to be legal advice. Our judicial system requires lawyers, as part of their duty of representation, to convey notice of court proceedings to their clients. If courts could not depend on this, service of notice would be required to be made personally upon all clients for all matters in every case. Consequently, it would be appropriate to ask McClanahan whether she had fulfilled this judicial function. Thus, I disagree with the Court's conclusion that all the \"statements from counsel to client in this case constituted 'advice given' for purposes of \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA.\" Opinion, \u00b6 14. In my view, this was a permissible inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 However, at oral argument the State indicated it wanted to go further, and ask a second question-whether Sweeney had told McClanahan that he needed to attend the final pre-trial conference. An attorney's communication\n   about a client's attendance at a proceeding, including whether, for whatever reason, the client should risk violating a release condition, falls into the realm of legal advice. For that reason, I believe the State's proposed inquiry here was prohibited by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 I concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-42\">\n   Justice Laurie McKinnon, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 I dissent from the Court's conclusion that the plain language of \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA, \"prohibits the District Court from compelling Sweeney to testify about communications made with McClanahan without his consent when her testimony would prove the elements of a new charge against McClanahan.\" Opinion, \u00b6 15. To reach its conclusion, the Court oversimplifies the statute by focusing on one word, \"examined,\" and fails to consider the rest of the statute. The attorney-client privilege is supposed to be construed narrowly, but the Court does the opposite, inexplicably broadening the privilege's scope. Considering the statute as a whole, I conclude that the attorney-client privilege does not preclude the District Court from compelling Sweeney's testimony regarding whether she notified McClanahan of the final pretrial conference date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 Section 26-1-803(1), MCA, provides, \"An attorney cannot, without the consent of the client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to the attorney or the advice given to the client in the course of professional employment.\" The Court's role in construing a statute \"is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\" Section 1-2-101, MCA. We consistently acknowledge a \"well-established rule\" that when \"construing a statute, it must be read as a whole, and its terms should not be isolated from\n   the context in which they were used by the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Fellows\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47 );\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

While recognizing that a statute must be read as a whole and that its terms should not be isolated from their context, the Court does precisely the opposite, isolating the word \"examined\" and omitting the remainder of \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 The plain language of \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA, in its entirety, provides that an attorney, absent client consent, cannot be examined as to (1) communication made by the client to the attorney; or (2) advice given to the client in the course of professional employment. The statute, read without omitting language that the Legislature explicitly included, does not completely preclude an attorney from being examined, as the Court concludes. Opinion, \u00b6 14. Instead, the statute provides that an attorney cannot be examined as to two distinct types of information. In this case, the issue is whether, absent client consent, the District Court can compel Sweeney to testify regarding whether she notified McClanahan of the hearing date. Thus, the question before the Court is whether requiring an attorney to testify about publicly available information she provided her client constitutes requiring an attorney to be \"examined\n   <em>\n    as to\n   </em>\n   ... advice given to the client in the course of professional employment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA (emphasis added). I would find that, based on the plain language of the statute, the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, and guidance from a significant number of other jurisdictions that have addressed the same issue, Sweeney informing McClanahan of the hearing date is not \"advice given to the client in the course of professional employment\" and therefore the attorney-client privilege does not protect Sweeney from testifying about such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26 The \"fundamental purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to enable the attorney to provide the best possible legal advice and encourage clients to act within the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

It is common practice for the court to notify counsel of a hearing and expect counsel to, in turn, notify her client of the proceeding. The date of a hearing is publicly available information that the attorney receives from the court, a third party. The date of a hearing does not encompass a client's confidential information or an attorney's advice in response thereto. Prohibiting disclosure of such information by precluding an attorney from ever being \"examined\" is contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA. Colorado has a similar statute, providing that, \"An attorney shall not be\n   <em>\n    examined\n   </em>\n   without the consent of his client as to any communication made by the client to him or his advice given thereon in the course of professional employment ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-90-107\">\n    Colo.

One day before the scheduled hearing, on October 18, 2016, Sweeney filed an unopposed motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial, on the grounds that she needed additional time to prepare for trial and/or complete plea negotiations.

The District\n   Court did not personally notify McClanahan of the new date; the court does not require defendants to be personally present when hearing dates are set nor does it require defendants to acknowledge that they received notice of hearing dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 32 McClanahan failed to appear at his final pretrial conference on November 16, 2016. The State subsequently charged McClanahan with bail-jumping and the District Court appointed attorney Sheehy to represent him in that proceeding. A necessary element of bail-jumping is whether McClanahan had notice of the date of the final pretrial conference. To prove that element, the State seeks to examine Sweeney, who does not represent McClanahan in the bail-jumping charge, about whether she told McClanahan about the final pretrial conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court concluded, \"Ms. Sweeney is only required to testify as to whether she told the Defendant about the hearing on November 16, 2016.\" Asking Sweeney to testify as to whether she conveyed the date of the final pretrial conference to McClanahan is not asking her to divulge any \"advice\" she provided to McClanahan. The District Court is only requiring her to testify as to whether she, acting as a mere conduit, conveyed publicly available information, provided by the court, to her client. The limited nature of the permitted inquiry ensures that Sweeney will not be compelled to testify as to any privileged information. Sweeney's testimony regarding whether she told McClanahan the date of the final pretrial conference is not protected by the attorney-client privilege and I would hold that the District Court correctly interpreted the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 33 I am mindful of the Court's concern that the State is utilizing\n   Sweeney, McClanahan's attorney in the drug charge, to prove an essential element of the bail-jumping charge. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. I do not commend the practice of calling a defendant's prior counsel as a witness in a bail-jumping trial. The State should make all attempts to avoid the need for such testimony. However, I can find no authority supporting the Court's conclusion that requiring Sweeney to testify would violate her duty of loyalty to her client, and therefore cannot agree. Opinion, \u00b6 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Krutzfeldt Ranch\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31 ). While\n   <em>\n    Krutzfeldt Ranch\n   </em>\n   emphasizes the importance of an attorney's duty of loyalty to her current client in assessing conflicts of interest, it does not address the situation at hand. Compelling Sweeney's testimony in the separate bail-jumping proceeding, in which she does not represent McClanahan, does not materially interfere with her function as an advocate in the drug proceeding nor does it deprive McClanahan of a fair trial in either proceeding. Requiring Sweeney to testify as to whether she informed McClanahan of the November 16, 2016, final pretrial conference places her in an uncomfortable and admittedly unfortunate position, but I cannot find a way in which it illegally infringes upon the duties she owes to McClanahan as his attorney in the drug charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 34 Considering \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA, in its entirety, I conclude that the attorney-client privilege does not protect an attorney's statements to her client regarding the date, time, and place of a hearing. I would hold that the District Court appropriately ordered Sweeney to testify \"only ... as to whether she told the Defendant about the hearing on November 16, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Justice Beth Baker joins in the dissenting Opinion of Justice McKinnon.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.
