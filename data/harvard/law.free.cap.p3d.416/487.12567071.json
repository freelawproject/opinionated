During the divorce proceedings, Robert transferred his interest in the couple's marital home to his mother with the intent to avoid Patricia's claim to the home. After transferring his interest in the home, Robert died and the divorce case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Patricia filed this action against Robert's mother alleging that the transfer was fraudulent under the Utah Fraudulent Transfer Act and sought to gain full ownership of the home. On appeal, both parties concede that the transfer was fraudulent at the time it was made. Robert's mother merely argues that the debtor-creditor relationship was extinguished when Robert died, and that the Utah Fraudulent Transfer Act requires an ongoing debtor-creditor relationship when a claim under the act is filed, therefore entitling her to retain her interest in the home. Robert's mother also argues that the only remedy available under the act is an award of money damages rather than the return of the fraudulently transferred asset. While we hold that an ongoing debtor-creditor relationship is required, we affirm the district court's grant of the marital home to Patricia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 The plaintiff, Patricia Porenta (Wife), married Robert Porenta (Husband) in 1988. During their marriage, the couple purchased a home as joint tenants. After the home was purchased the couple began having marital problems, and in November 2005, Wife filed for divorce. The disposition of the home was at issue in the divorce as part of the distribution of the marital estate. During the divorce proceedings, Husband filed a motion asking the divorce court for an order to list and sell the home, with the net proceeds to be held in escrow pending distribution by the court or by written agreement of Husband and Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Seven days after filing his motion, Husband executed a quit claim deed transferring \"an undivided 01/100\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   share of\" Husband's interest in the home to himself and his mother, Louise Porenta (Mother), a defendant in the current action, as joint tenants. The deed transferred the remaining \"undivided 99/100\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   share of\" Husband's interest in the home to Mother as a tenant in common. Seven days after executing the quit claim deed, Husband filed a reply memorandum in support of his original motion to sell the home. In the reply memorandum, Husband stated that \"[o]nce the home is listed, either side has the option of buying it.... If [Wife] wants the house, she can buy it. Proceeds can then be paid into escrow pending equitable division or by a court order.\" The reply memorandum does not disclose that Husband had already fraudulently transferred a large portion of his interest in the home to Mother, retaining only a minor fraction for himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 The divorce court held a hearing on Husband's motion, with Husband, Wife, and Mother present. Husband continued to represent to Wife and the divorce court that the home was still within the marital estate under the jurisdiction of the divorce court, and that he desired to sell the home and leave the proceeds in escrow. The divorce court denied Husband's motion, and reserved the issue of the sale of the home until trial unless a \"danger of loss\" arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 Wife discovered the transfer to Mother in the spring of 2008, roughly one and a half years after Husband executed the quit claim deed. Then, in September 2008, while the divorce case was still pending before the divorce court, Husband died. The divorce court subsequently dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Shortly thereafter, Wife filed the current action against Mother, asking the trial court to set aside the quit claim deed under the Utah Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mother answered and counterclaimed, alleging that the transfer was repayment of $200,000 in loans she had made to the couple.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 In September 2014, a trial was held on whether the transfer to Mother was fraudulent and whether the home should be awarded to Wife. Nine days before the trial on Wife's UFTA claim, without any disclosure to Wife or the court, Mother executed a quit claim deed purporting to transfer the entire home to Diamond Fork Land &amp; Livestock Company. This company, according to Mother, is owned by Robert Copier, the attorney who represented Husband in the underlying divorce case and represented Mother at the beginning of the present action. At the September trial, Mother again did not disclose the transfer to Diamond Fork. Rather, she actively concealed the fact that she had transferred all of her interest a week before the trial. During the September trial, Mother suffered from a medical issue and was transported to the hospital. The trial was continued, and Wife later learned of the transfer from Mother to Diamond Fork. Wife then amended her complaint to include a claim under UFTA that Mother had fraudulently transferred her interest in the home to Diamond Fork and Robert Copier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 8 Trial finally resumed in November 2015, seven years after the original complaint had been filed. The trial court ultimately held that Husband's transfer to Mother was fraudulent under UFTA. Additionally, the trial court awarded Wife her attorney fees because of Mother's misconduct during trial. Diamond Fork and Robert Copier defaulted, and the trial court found that Mother's \"transfer to Diamond Fork Land &amp; Livestock Company was an attempt to transfer the subject property beyond the jurisdiction of the court to avoid the remedy sought by\" Wife. The trial court further found that Mother \"filed at least sixty motions during the pendency of this case, many of them repeating previously denied motions.\" It held that Mother's \"defenses were brought in bad faith, made with the intention of hindering or delaying restoration of the property to [Wife] or forcing [Wife] to abandon her case because of the legal fees required by [Mother's] paperwork blizzard for repetitive, baseless, unsupported motions.\" Mother appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 Mother appeals two issues. First, she argues that the Utah Fraudulent Transfer Act requires an ongoing debtor-creditor relationship when the action is filed, and that the death of Husband extinguished any such relationship prior to Wife filing her UFTA claim. Our interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Sill v.

Thus, it is a mixed question in which \"our review is sometimes deferential and sometimes not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The question of whether a debtor-creditor relationship is extinguished upon the death of the debtor during a divorce proceeding is more law-like, as the only real fact at issue is the death of the spouse. The remainder of the inquiry is a legal question, determining the effect of that death on the debtor-creditor relationship.

DEBTOR-CREDITOR RELATIONSHIP UPON DEATH OF A SPOUSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 The trial court held that the transfer from Husband to Mother was fraudulent under three different sections of UFTA: Utah Code sections 25-6-5, 25-6-6(1), and 25-6-6(2). All of these require a debtor-creditor relationship. UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 25-6-5, -6 (2016) (stating that a transfer by a \"debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor\" when certain requirements are met). A \"debtor\" is defined as \"a person who\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   liable on a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 25-6-2(6) (emphasis added). A \"creditor\" is defined as \"a person who\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 25-6-2(4) (emphasis added). The existence of a claim, or right to payment, is at the heart of the debtor-creditor relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357015\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/162/1099/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-6-2(3) (a claim is a \"right to payment\").

Mother did not argue that the district court erred in holding that Wife had a claim to preserve the joint tenancy. Nor did she argue why that specific claim-the primary claim at issue in this case-abated upon Husband's death. She argues primarily that court orders that award a spouse with property abate upon the death of a spouse. Regarding claims, she simply makes the general statement that Wife's claims against Husband are unenforceable because Husband is dead and she cannot bring a claim against a dead person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 Whether court ordered child support versus a claim for a joint tenancy abate upon the death of a spouse are two very distinct questions. Utah courts have only ever wrestled with whether court orders dealing with property rights abate upon the death of a spouse. Whether a claim for equitable distribution or some other property claim survives the death of a spouse during a divorce proceeding has never been addressed by this court, and we decline to address it for the first time without adequate briefing. We first address our precedent discussing the effect of the death of a party on court orders entered during a divorce proceeding. Next, we address the effect of the death of a party on a claim that was or could have been brought against that party. Finally, we address some additional arguments that Mother raised for the first time during oral arguments concerning the debtor-creditor relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    A.

In that case, this court applied the rule of\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   , but then prospectively reversed \"that part of the decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   ... having to do with determination of property rights....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 885.

This court held that both the deed and the notice of termination had no legal effect for various reasons and, therefore, neither the daughter nor the mother's estate had any interest in the home.

This court stated that, from its prior analysis regarding the deed and notice of termination, \"it is obvious that there was never any such conversion of the joint tenancy to a tenancy in common.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the husband \"became the owner of the home as the surviving joint tenant,\" and the mother (and by extension, the mother's estate) did not have any interest in the home.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . After holding that the mother and the mother's estate did not have any interest in the home, the court went on to state that even if the mother had acquired some other interest in the home during the divorce proceeding, \"the death of one or both parties to a divorce action ... during the pendency of the action [causes] the action itself [to] abate[ ] and [the married couple's] status, including their property rights, reverts to what it had been before the action was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This was clearly\n   <em>\n    dictum\n   </em>\n   as it did not affect the outcome of the case.

The court used\n   <em>\n    Daly's dictum\n   </em>\n   statement to say that, even if a tenancy in common had somehow been created or the mother had gained some other interest that could pass to her estate in the divorce, that interest was extinguished upon her death during the divorce proceeding and the parties' interest in the home \"revert[ed] to what it had been before the action was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 597.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    dictum\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the parties' property interests in the marital estate are frozen in time during the\n   pendency of divorce litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a party dies before the divorce becomes final, than the couple's status, including property rights in the marital estate, are transported back in time to what they held before the divorce case was filed.

Parties subject to a court order similar to that in\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   are merely prevented from unilaterally dissipating the marital estate by transferring marital assets to a third party, thereby removing them from the jurisdiction of the divorce court and preventing equitable distribution of those assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26 Before the divorce action was filed in this case, Husband and Wife were joint tenants. Wife did not acquire her interest as a joint tenant in the property during the divorce proceeding; it pre-existed as an interest that was part of the marital estate and was subject to equitable distribution. Under the\n   <em>\n    Nelson dictum\n   </em>\n   , we would be required to restore the joint tenancy. As joint tenants, Wife would have succeeded to Husband's interest in the home upon Husband's death.

Mother spent the vast majority of her opening brief on whether court orders abate upon the death of a spouse in a divorce proceeding. Concerning claims, rather than court orders, Mother simply stated that Wife \"has no currently enforceable claim against Husband\" because \"Husband is dead\" and Wife \"cannot haul Husband back into the divorce court.\" Essentially, Mother argued in her opening brief that no claim exists simply because Husband died. Wife\n   countered by arguing that her property claims \"could be brought against the [Husband's] estate.\" She argues that Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 25 is evidence of the ability to substitute the deceased party with the deceased party's estate. Mother never filed a reply brief explaining why such a claim does not extend to Husband's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 30 At oral argument, Mother conceded that any claim held by Wife against Husband that survived the abatement of the divorce proceeding extended to Husband's estate once he died.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.

Yet, Mother's only argument that Wife did not have a claim (rather than court-ordered property rights) against Husband was because she could not haul her dead Husband back into the court to bring such a claim.

However, we do not demand this nuanced argument. It is demanded by Wife's counter-argument that property claims brought in a divorce proceeding survive the death of a spouse. She argued that while \"the death of a spouse ends the cause of action for divorce and abates any pending action for divorce[,] ... insofar as a divorce action seeks an adjudication of property rights, the cause of action survives and may be revived.\" (Quoting 24 AM. JUR. 2d\n   <em>\n    Divorce &amp; Separation\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 119 (2017) ).

As the appellant, Mother had the burden of establishing that the district court erred. Without adequate briefing from Mother, we do not believe the time is right to rule on this issue. We are rightly hesitant to address an issue of first impression without the aid of adequate adversarial briefing. Mother failed to adequately address the question of whether Wife's claim for the joint tenancy survived the death of Husband and thereby failed to meet her burden on appeal, so we affirm the district court's holding. Because of this, we hold that Wife's claim against Husband for the joint tenancy extended to Husband's estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question\n   then becomes whether Wife's claim is somehow barred against the estate or is no longer for the entire marital estate.

In this case, Mother is the appellant. Once Wife won in the trial court, the burden shifted to Mother to persuade us, on appeal, that the trial court erred. This included Mother's duty to provide an adequate record. UTAH R. APP.

P. 19(a) (a person is a necessary party when they have an \"interest relating to the subject of the action\" and the person will be \"impair[ed] or impede[d]\" from protecting that interest if not added). Thus, when the creditor has not already obtained a judgment on the underlying claim, the debtor is typically necessary to \"be heard in regard to the validity or amount of the [underlying] claim\" that serves as the basis for the UFTA claim. 37 AM.

UTAH R. CIV. P. 19(a) (\"A person ... shall be joined as a party in the action if ... he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action....\"). In the trial court, Mother did argue that the estate was an indispensable party, but she only moved to have herself added in her official capacity, as personal representative of Husband's estate, as a plaintiff rather than as a defendant. This would have positioned her both as plaintiff (in her official capacity) and defendant (in her individual capacity) in the case. Wife acquiesced to joining the estate as a\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   because the estate \"could conceivably assert a claim that would be relevant to the issues of this case,\" but argued that it made no sense to add the estate as a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   . The trial court held that Mother could not add the estate as a plaintiff, but that she could \"join herself, in her capacity as personal representative of the decedent's estate, as a second Defendant.\" Mother (in her individual and official capacities) refused to add the estate as a defendant. Thus, any argument that the estate was a necessary party has clearly been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 40 While there may be questions about whether Wife's underlying claim is still for the \"entire marital estate\" and whether any claim against the estate may still be brought, Mother has not adequately raised these issues in her briefing nor provided an adequate record for us to review them on appeal. Without adequate argument that Wife's claim for the joint tenancy abated when Husband died, we refuse to vacate the holding of the district court. Additionally, Mother's concession that any claim \"that still exists that was not abated by the divorce\" extends to the estate appears to be an accurate statement of\n   the law. Without Mother pointing to anywhere in the record showing that the claim against the estate is barred, we must affirm the district court's holding that Wife had a claim against Husband at the time she filed the current suit. We now turn to whether the trial court erred in granting Wife the entire home rather than money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   II.

It held that \"the 'extent necessary to satisfy' [Wife's] nascent claims that were created by the filing of the divorce action is to entirely set aside the Transfer.\" (quoting UTAH CODE \u00a7 25-6-8(1)(a) ). Section 25-6-8(1)(a), discussing the \"avoidance of the transfer,\" is further clarified by section 25-6-9(2) which provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   to the extent a transfer is\n   <em>\n    voidable\n   </em>\n   in an action by a creditor under Subsection 25-6-8(1)(a), the creditor\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred ... or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim, whichever is less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (Emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 45 Mother argues that this language limits the remedy available under section 25-6-8(1)(a) to a judgment for money damages. However, this interpretation does not comport with the plain language of the statute.

Utah Code section 25-6-9(2) provides that \"[a] judgment [under subsection 25-6-8(1)(a) ] may be entered against: (a) the first transferee of the asset ...; or (b) any subsequent transferee other than a good faith transferee who took for value or from any subsequent transferee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 48 Just prior to trial on Wife's UFTA claim, Mother transferred her interest in the property to Diamond Fork Land &amp; Livestock Company-a company that appears to be owned by Robert Copier (one of Husband's and Mother's attorneys). The trial court found that this transfer was made in bad faith with the intent to \"transfer the subject property beyond the jurisdiction of the court to avoid the remedy sought by [Wife].\" Both Diamond Fork and Mr. Copier were added as parties in this action after Wife discovered the transfer, and both defaulted. Thus, we may declare the transfer from Husband to Mother void, and we may also declare the transfer from Mother to Diamond Fork void because Diamond Fork was not a good faith transferee and because it defaulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 25-6-9(2) (stating that judgment may be entered against any \"subsequent transferee\" so long as they did not take the property in good faith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 49 However, we do not know the current status of the title. Diamond Fork apparently attempted to further transfer an interest in the property to another individual, who later \"denied claiming any interest in the property.\" While, based on the record before us, it appears as though no other parties claim an interest from Mother or Diamond Fork, we cannot be sure at this point. If Diamond Fork sold its interest in the property to a good faith buyer, money damages against Mother and Diamond Fork may be the only remedy available under Utah Code section 25-6-8(1)(a). Given the fact that Mother and Mr. Copier appear to have no qualms with transferring the property while this case is pending, we determine that a remand to verify the current status of the title is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 50 We therefore remand to the trial court for further factual findings and its determination on this issue. We also take this opportunity to give a word of warning to Mother, Mr. Copier, Diamond Fork Land &amp; Livestock Company, and any other party or attorney who claims an interest in the property. Given Mother's and Mr. Copier's apparent disregard for the courts of this state and the application of justice, we take the odd step as a court of last resort and order that no party or attorney in this action attempt to further convey this property without approval from the trial court. Mother and Mr. Copier have caused this case to drag on long enough through their dilatory tactics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another attempt to remove the property from\n   the jurisdiction of the court would warrant the most severe sanctions available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   III. WIFE'S CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 51 Wife was granted her attorney fees in the trial court, and seeks attorney fees on appeal. Specifically, she \"submits that double attorney fees should be awarded pursuant to\" Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 33. Rule 33 provides two instances in which attorney fees are appropriate: 1) if the appeal is \"frivolous,\" and 2) if the appeal is taken for \"delay.\" If either of these are found, the appellate court \"shall award just damages, which may include single or double costs, as defined in Rule 34, and/or reasonable attorney fees, to the prevailing party.\" UTAH R. APP. P. 33(a). We first note that double\n   <em>\n    attorney fees\n   </em>\n   are not available under rule 33, only double\n   <em>\n    costs\n   </em>\n   \"as defined in Rule 34.\" Thus, if Wife is entitled to anything, the most she may receiver are her actual attorney fees and double costs. But parties seeking attorney fees under rule 33 face a high bar. \"[T]he imposition of such a sanction is a serious matter and only to be used in egregious cases, lest the threat of such sanctions should chill litigants' rights to appeal lower court decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Redd v.

While we ultimately reject Mother's arguments, we cannot say that they are obviously without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 53 However, attorney fees are also available when the appeal is taken for delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH R. APP. P. 33(a). The trial court held that Mother's \"defenses were brought in bad faith, made with the intention of hindering or delaying restoration of the property to [Wife].\" Wife argues that this appeal \"is but a continuation of the same bad faith litigation\" and that it was brought solely to place another\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the property to prevent Wife from selling the home. While the trial court's holding appears to be partially based on its determination that Mother's claims were baseless, it was also based on Mother's trial tactics. For instance, the trial court found that Mother \"has filed at least sixty motions during the pendency of this case, many of them repeating previously denied motions, and nearly all with 'little or no citation to legal authority, and little if any real analysis of the legal arguments.' \" Also, Mother transferred her interest in the home to her previous attorney \"in anticipation of trial,\" and for the purpose of moving the home \"beyond the jurisdiction of the court to avoid the remedy sought by Plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 54 Mother's only argument that this appeal was not brought for any improper purpose is that she has a non-frivolous argument. While a frivolous argument is evidence that the appeal was brought for an improper purpose, it is not the only possible evidence. If it were, awarding attorney fees for \"delay\" would be completely subsumed by the frivolousness prong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lancer Ins. Co. v. Lake Shore Motor Coach Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339754\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/218/\">\n    2017 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339754\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/218/\">\n    391 P.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (we interpret rules to give independent meaning to each provision). In this case, Mother appears to have resorted to any method available in the trial court to delay and prevent Wife from acquiring the home. And, on appeal, she failed to directly challenge the trial court's finding that Mother's defenses were brought with the intention of hindering or delaying restoration of the property. This is one of those rare cases in which costs are warranted. We hold that Mother must pay double Wife's costs on appeal, but not her attorney fees. We limit the award because Mother's claim was not frivolous. We remand to the trial court for a determination of those costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeBry v.

In this case, the debtor-creditor relationship existed between Patricia Porenta and Robert Porenta's estate. Because there was an ongoing debtor-creditor relationship, Wife's claim for fraudulent transfer is not barred by the Act. Additionally, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting Wife the entire marital home rather than money damages, but we remand for a determination of the current status of title. Finally, we award Wife double her costs on appeal and remand to the trial court for a determination of those costs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act was amended, renumbered, and renamed as the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, effective May 6, 2017.

She did not argue that property interests can never be \"UFTA Claims.\" In fact, Mother conceded that Wife had a valid \"UFTA Claim\" at the time that Husband transferred his interest in the home to Mother. Mother argued that \"a debtor/creditor relationship existed between Husband and Wife\" as soon as Wife threatened divorce, but that the \"abatement of the divorce action terminated any debtor/creditor relationship between Husband and Wife.\" Thus, Mother concedes that Wife's interest in the marital estate was sufficient to give rise to a \"UFTA Claim,\" thereby creating a debtor-creditor relationship at the time Husband transferred the home to Mother. If it was a sufficient \"UFTA Claim\" at the time the asset was transferred, then Mother concedes it was a sufficient \"UFTA Claim\" at the time Wife filed her UFTA action so long as that claim survived the abatement of the divorce proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    The dissent raises this new issue\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    .

Robert then died while the divorce case was pending-before a divorce decree issued. Patricia now seeks to recover the property from Louise via a claim under the Utah Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 57 The property transfer was apparently fraudulent under the UFTA at the time of the transfer. But Patricia cannot recover under the UFTA unless she identifies a \"claim\" (as defined in the UFTA) against Robert at the time she filed her suit. The \"claims\" that Patricia has identified that could qualify are claims for child support and related claims in the divorce proceeding. Yet those claims were extinguished upon Robert's death, which abated the divorce action. And in Louise's view that precludes Patricia from obtaining any relief under the UFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 58 The majority disagrees. Looking to the district court order, it starts with the presumption that Patricia had a UFTA-defined claim at the time she filed unless proven otherwise by Louise, citing the appellant's burden of persuasion. It then declines to analyze the validity of that claim under the statute, because it believes Louise did not raise this issue on appeal. Instead, it believes the only threshold question Louise raised was \"whether the death of Husband extinguished any debtor-creditor relationship\"-in other words, whether the UFTA Claims abated at Robert's death.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Ultimately, it determines that Louise failed to adequately address whether the \"claims\" described by the district court specifically abated when Robert died and the divorce abated. It affirms on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 59 I disagree and accordingly dissent. First, I believe that Louise has sufficiently raised the issue of whether the \"claims\" underlying the district court's holding count under the language of the UFTA. Louise argues that Patricia had no right to payment from Robert at the time she filed her action. Unlike the majority, I don't believe that we can answer this question without deciding whether the district court's supposed \"UFTA Claims\" were originally valid, whether they abated or not. Second, I believe that any claims that might otherwise have been valid-namely, those arising in the divorce-nonetheless abated at Robert's death. The majority finds nuance here where I find none. Our law has long been clear on this point. Claims arising out of divorce abate upon the death of one of the spouses and the resulting abatement of the divorce. I believe that Patricia had no valid or surviving UFTA Claim at the time she filed her action, and I would reverse on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 60 The majority avoids this result by repudiating a premise of our longstanding case law in this important field-that any right or claim arising from the existence or threat of a divorce proceeding is extinguished upon the death of one of the spouses. This clear, longstanding rule is set forth in a series of our cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10342637\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/912/969/\">\n    912 P.2d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 977 (Utah 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

And the rule is cast aside by today's majority opinion. That strikes me as problematic. We have no briefing from the parties on the merits or demerits of the principle we reject today. The briefing on both sides of this case accepted the viability of the rule we now reject. I disagree with the court's decision on this point. I would retain the existing rule in a case in which no party has asked us to revisit the clear standard set forth in our cases and the court has not offered a basis for repudiating that rule under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 61 The UFTA affords remedies for \"creditors\" against \"debtors\" who have engaged in fraudulent transfers of property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 25-6-8 (2016) (setting forth the \"relief against a transfer or obligation\" that \"a creditor ... may obtain\"). A creditor, for example, may seek an \"avoidance of the transfer ... to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim\" against the debtor.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 25-6-8(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 62 Precision in the use of these terms is crucial to unraveling some of the confusion in the questions presented in this case. One of the key terms with a potential for confusion is the term \"claim.\" To qualify as a creditor under the UFTA a party must have a \"claim\" against a debtor. The UFTA defines a \"Creditor\" as \"a person who has a claim,\" and a \"Debtor\" as \"a person who is liable on the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 25-6-2(4), (6). This central concept of a \"claim\" is defined as \"a right to payment, whether or not the right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 25-6-2(3). To avoid confusion with run-of-the-mill usages of \"claim,\" I will refer to UFTA-defined claims as \"UFTA Claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 63 A claim is a UFTA Claim only if it is against a debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Here, that might mean either Robert or Robert's estate. But this is another point of confusion stemming from imprecision in the terms used in this case. In the course of these proceedings we are speaking not only of Robert Porenta and Robert Porenta's estate, but also the \"marital estate.\" The marital estate, however, is quite distinct from Robert Porenta's estate, as explained further below. The marital estate is a\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   or a property interest-not a person or entity who could qualify as a debtor. Only Robert Porenta's estate could qualify as a debtor, as it is only this estate that is a legal person or entity. To keep these points clear, I will refer to Robert Porenta's estate-the entity that succeeded to Robert Porenta's interests-as \"Robert's Estate\" or the \"Estate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 64 A threshold question presented is whether Patricia Porenta has a viable UFTA Claim against Robert or his Estate. The majority says that she does. It affirms the district court's determination that Patricia had a \"claim for the marital estate, including the joint tenancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 n.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 65 I disagree. Any \"claims\" the majority or district court may have identified, other than those which arose from the divorce, are not UFTA Claims. The mere intonation of the word \"claim\" is not enough to satisfy the UFTA. That statute sets forth a limited conception of the kind of \"claim\" necessary to trigger its application. And the supposed \"claim for the whole of the marital estate\" does not qualify. The only set of claims asserted by Patricia that\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   fulfilled the requirements of the UFTA were those that arose in the divorce, and those claims were extinguished upon Robert Porenta's death when the divorce proceedings abated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 66 The valid UFTA Claims that were raised by Patricia all abated with the abatement of the divorce. Patricia's claims in divorce made her a \"creditor\" under the UFTA at the time of the filing of the divorce proceedings: At that point she had a \"right to payment\" that was \"unmatured\" and \"disputed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.

It then returns to a regime set out in\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"62918\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/1/296/\">\n    1 Utah 2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"62918\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/1/296/\">\n    265 P.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954). I cannot concur in this approach for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 68 First, I am not convinced that\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   is on point. The majority cites\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"a court order that divide[s] marital property d[oes] not abate upon the death of a spouse.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. But\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   dealt only with \"divorce decree[s]\" that had not yet become final pursuant to Utah Code 1953 section 30-3-6 (now repealed), not orders entered during the pendency of the divorce. These are not identical. The former is a \"final judgment in a suit for divorce,\" which \"dissolves the marriage and usu[ally] resolves all matters concerning property and children.\"\n   <em>\n    Decree\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Orders, on the other hand, might encompass any number of issues arising during the course of a divorce, such as the child support orders discussed here. The rule in\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   addresses decrees rather than orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   No such decree was issued in this case. Given that fact, the rule in\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   may not even apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 69 Second, even if\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   would otherwise apply to this case, it was overruled by\n   <em>\n    Daly v. Daly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10475171\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/533/884/\">\n    533 P.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 885-86 (Utah 1975). The majority overrules\n   <em>\n    Daly\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, calling their relevant language \"dicta.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-27. It believes that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Daly\n   </em>\n   did not \"affect[ ] the ultimate decision [in\n   <em>\n    Daly\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Even if true,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court in\n   <em>\n    Daly\n   </em>\n   unequivocally announced a principle that has been relied on as law. If the majority wants to overrule precedent that has been operative for forty years, it should do so on the merits of the case under our standard for overruling precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eldridge v. Johndrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    2015 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    345 P.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying the factors for when overruling of a precedent is appropriate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 70 Third, no one has asked us to revisit or repudiate the principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Daly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   . In fact, Patricia cites both\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Knickerbocker\n   </em>\n   in her brief to this court. She does not ask us to abandon these cases in favor of the principle set forth in\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   . Our decision to overhaul the law in this field is likely to come as a big surprise to the parties in this case. And it may upset settled reliance interests in this important field.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 71 For these three reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority's repudiation of the principle set forth in the cases following\n   <em>\n    In re Harper's Estate\n   </em>\n   . I would uphold the rule that \"when the death of one or both parties to a divorce action occurs during the pendency of the action, the action itself abates and their status, including their property rights, reverts to what it had been before the action was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452163\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/594/#p597\">\n    592 P.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And this principle would foreclose Patricia's assertion of a right to sue as a \"creditor\" protecting a \"claim\" against a \"debtor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 72 Patricia\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   a \"claim\" as her husband's \"creditor\" at the time of the transfer of the property in question. But that is insufficient. As the majority notes, the UFTA \"use[s] the present tense when discussing the [necessary] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Thus, the relevant timeframe under the UFTA is clear: \"[T]here must be a claim or right to payment held by the creditor against the debtor\n   <em>\n    at the time a UFTA claim is filed\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (emphasis added). And Patricia accordingly is in no position to assert a UFTA claim on the basis of the cause of action that she filed-and\n   that was subsequently abated-in the divorce proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 73 The claims asserted in the divorce proceeding accordingly were not in existence at the time Patricia filed her UFTA action. The majority nonetheless declines to consider whether a claim in fact existed at the time Patricia filed her action. Instead it presumes that the district court correctly identified a surviving UFTA Claim, and faults Louise Porenta for failing to carry her burden of challenging the district court's decision on appeal. But none of the majority's points is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 74 The district court held in Patricia's favor, and thus apparently believed that Patricia had a UFTA Claim of some kind. In its order, it set out a few possibilities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff's claim against Defendant at the time of the transfer encompassed the whole of the marital estate, including the right to preserve the joint tenancy or require Robert to convey his interest free and clear to Patricia. The joint tenancy itself was a marital asset that Robert could not unilaterally dissipate while the divorce was pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 75 Patricia has advanced similar arguments in the district court and in this appeal. She seeks to establish a UFTA Claim on the basis of alleged property interests, asserting that \"insofar as a divorce action seeks an adjudication of property rights, the cause of action survives and may be revived by the proper party in interest for the exclusive purpose of determining the property rights.\" And she contends that these rights could be \"brought against the deceased person's estate.\" In Patricia's view her \"property rights had been unchanged during the divorce and were therefore unchanged by dismissal of the divorce action.\" Thus, Patricia asserts that she \"still had, as before, a\n   <em>\n    marital interest\n   </em>\n   in the home that she and [Robert] acquired....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 76 The majority endorses the approach advanced by Patricia and upheld by the district court. It states that Patricia's \"underlying claim against [Robert] was for 'the whole of the marital estate, including the right to preserve the joint tenancy or require [Robert] to convey his interest free and clear to [Patricia].' \"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 77 Patricia has thus identified-and the district court and majority apparently have upheld-three possible grounds for establishing a UFTA Claim: (1) a claim to the \"whole of the marital estate\"; (2) an interest in or a right to \"preserve\" the joint tenancy; and (3) a right to require Robert to convey his interest in the joint tenancy to Patricia. Yet none of these is a UFTA Claim-a \"right to payment\" from Robert or from his Estate. At most the district court identified purported rights or interests that Patricia may be able to assert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 78 Some of the cited rights or interests are simply not sustainable under the law. But clearly none qualifies as a \"right to payment\" from a debtor. And in any event there is no \"debtor\" against whom any such claim could be asserted, as Robert is dead and Patricia has not identified any basis for a claim against Robert's Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 79 A \"claim to the marital estate\" is not a UFTA Claim. A UFTA Claim, again, is a \"right to payment.\" And Patricia has no \"right to payment\" \"\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   the marital estate.\" (Emphasis added.) That statement makes no logical sense. That tells us there is no UFTA Claim. The asserted \"claim to the marital estate\" is simply an alleged property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 80 A property interest is not a UFTA Claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosier v. Rosier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845443\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/227/88/\">\n    227 W.Va. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845443\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/227/88/\">\n    705 S.E.2d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606-08 (2010) (concluding that \"the basis of any 'claim' \" under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act \"cannot be founded upon whether the affected\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   would have been declared marital property had the [parties] been seeking a divorce prior to [the husband's] death\" (emphasis added)). If I own a car it makes no sense to say that I have a \"right to payment\" in that car. The mere ownership interest is not a right to payment. A right to payment may arise in the event of a transaction involving the car. If I enter into a contract to sell the car then I would have a right to payment. But until then I have only an interest in the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 81 The same goes for an interest in a marital estate. If a married couple owns a home in joint tenancy neither has a \"right to payment\" against the other. Both just have joint rights or interests. Their rights or interests could be transformed into a right to payment through a claim asserted in a divorce proceeding. But if the divorce abates before such a claim is reduced to a judgment then there is no right to payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 82 That is exactly what happened here. Patricia had an interest in the marital estate. But she had no right to payment. She apparently sought to establish such a right in the claims she filed in divorce, but those claims were extinguished (and the divorce abated) upon Robert's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 83 Robert's death also highlights a further defect in Patricia's case-the lack of a \"debtor\" for any purported UFTA Claim. Some claims survive the death of the defendant and succeed to the deceased defendant's estate. But other claims do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gressman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960520\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/323/998/\">\n    2013 UT 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960520\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/323/998/\">\n    323 P.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the common law rule of abatement of personal tort claims at death and discussing statutory exceptions to that rule). And Patricia has identified no ground for concluding that her alleged interest in the marital estate amounts to a claim for which the Estate would be liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 84 Patricia's interest in or asserted right to prevent Robert from severing the joint tenancy is likewise not a UFTA Claim. This interest or right fails for the reasons that the interest in the marital estate fails-there is no UFTA Claim because there is at most an interest in property, not a right to payment, and there is no debtor because Patricia has not identified a basis for any liability of the Estate on this purported claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 85 There is also a more fundamental problem with this interest: Our law makes clear that there is no right to prevent Robert from severing the joint tenancy. Under Utah law Robert was free to alienate his portion of the property. \"It is well-settled that a partial owner\" of a joint tenancy \"may sell or encumber her share.\"\n   <em>\n    Franklin Credit Mgmt.

But there is no suggestion by any party (or the majority) that any such order was entered in the divorce proceedings in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even if such an\n   order had been entered, it would have been extinguished upon the abatement of the divorce case on Robert's death. Even if the right hadn't abated, moreover, the interest in preventing Robert from alienating his share of the property would not rise to the level of a \"right to payment\" from Robert, and so it couldn't have been a UFTA Claim to begin with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 87 The right to \"require Robert to convey his interest\" in the joint tenancy to Patricia also fails for the same reasons. First, there is no legal basis for any supposed right to require Robert to convey his interest. Second, even if there were such a right it could not rise to the level of a \"right to payment,\" and thus would not qualify as a UFTA Claim. And third, there is no \"debtor\" because Patricia has not identified a basis for any liability on the part of Robert's Estate for the claimed interest in the joint tenancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 88 The majority resists the above conclusions without reaching their merits. It does so first by reframing the question presented-asking not whether Patricia has identified a UFTA Claim but \"whether [Patricia's] claim is somehow barred against the estate or is no longer for the entire marital estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. This masks the underlying question whether any \"claim\" at issue qualifies as a UFTA Claim. There is no UFTA Claim here for all the reasons set forth above. And without a proper UFTA Claim it is irrelevant whether some other property right or interest may be viably alleged against Robert's Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 89 The majority's next move is to avoid the question presented on the basis of purported missteps of Louise's counsel: (1) counsel's supposed concession at oral argument that Patricia has a claim against Robert's Estate,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; and (2) Louise's alleged failure to adequately brief the issues on appeal. I find no merit to either argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 90 The oral argument transcript does not support the court's determination of a concession on Louise's part. Louise's counsel did not concede that Patricia had a UFTA Claim or that any such claim extended to her husband's estate after his death. Instead, in response to probing questions from members of this court, counsel only acknowledged that \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   there is a claim that still exists that wasn't abated by the divorce,\" such a claim would transfer to the son's estate. (Emphasis added.) But that doesn't tell us anything about the questions presented-whether there is a valid UFTA Claim and whether any such claim may be asserted against the estate. Counsel for Louise never made a concession on these points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 91 In fact counsel argued the contrary. Counsel expressly asserted that there was no UFTA Claim-clarifying that the only \"claim\" that counts is a \"right to payment.\" And clearly counsel was not conceding that any UFTA Claim would transfer to Robert's Estate. Counsel specifically contended that the only UFTA Claim-claim to a \"right to payment\"-was in the divorce proceeding, and that such claims were extinguished upon Robert's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 92 The record also fails to support the conclusion that Louise failed to contest the district court's holding that Patricia \"had a claim for the marital estate, including the joint tenancy.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30 n.14. It says that Louise \"did not argue that [the\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   line of cases] applied to any claims that could be held by [Patricia],\" but that she instead argued only that the\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   line means that \"all\n   <em>\n    court orders\n   </em>\n   dealing with property rights abate upon the death of a party.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 23 n.7 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 93 The majority deems that a fatal briefing error. It says that Louise \"never grappled\n   with th[e] important question\" of whether Patricia's supposed \"claim for the joint tenancy survived the death of [Robert].\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. And it rules against Louise on the grounds of \"[in]adequate briefing.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 94 I see the matter differently. I see no way to read Louise's brief in the way the majority does. Perhaps Louise could have framed her position more forcefully or more clearly. But she clearly (and repeatedly) contended that \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   debtor/creditor relationship that existed between husband and wife during the pendency of the divorce action terminated upon husband's death and subsequent abatement of the divorce action.\" (Emphasis added.) This general, sweeping argument was made repeatedly in Louise's opening (and only) brief. She argued that there is \"no set of facts under which the trial court could have found\n   <em>\n    the debtor/creditor relationship\n   </em>\n   between Husband and Wife survived the abatement of the divorce as a matter of law,\" and that Patricia \"has\n   <em>\n    no currently enforceable claim\n   </em>\n   against Husband\" because she \"cannot haul Husband back into the divorce court\" to enforce her claims and \"the divorce court cannot obtain jurisdiction over him.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 95 The majority says that Louise only argued that \"the divorce court's orders for 'child support and medical and insurance expenses' were vacated\" by the husband's death and abatement of the divorce proceeding, or else that only \"\n   <em>\n    court orders\n   </em>\n   dealing with property rights abate upon the death of a party.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23 n.7 (emphasis in original). But that is incorrect for two reasons. First, as noted, Louise was advocating a sweeping rule of abatement that extinguishes\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim (or, in other words, any debtor/creditor relationship). To the extent her brief lacks detail it is because she is arguing for a broad rule that doesn't require the nuance now demanded by the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 96 Second, Louise's brief does in fact address the property claims. Citing\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452163\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/594/#p597\">\n    592 P.2d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1979), Louise asserts that \" 'when the death of one or both parties to a divorce action occurs during the pendency of the action, the action itself abates and their status,\n   <em>\n    including their property rights, reverts to what it had been before the action was filed\n   </em>\n   ,' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452163\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/594/#p597\">\n    592 P.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added)). And in light of this rule, Louise contends that there is no viable property claim asserted in the divorce proceeding. Louise observes that \"the 'property rights' which revert upon abatement of [a] divorce action are only those rights 'acquired in the divorce action,' or, in other words, those rights granted by the court via an order issued during the divorce,\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452163\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/594/#p597\">\n    592 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   597 ). She also says that \"[t]hese [property] rights abate upon death of one of the parties because the court no longer has jurisdiction over the parties, and without jurisdiction, the court cannot issue a divorce decree\"-i.e., a decree awarding property to a party to a divorce proceeding that is legally abated and thus of no further legal effect. \"This is so because one cannot divorce a dead person.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrell v. Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10356550\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/830/299/#p302\">\n    830 P.2d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302 (Utah Ct. App. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 97 The legal and logical grounds for Louise's position strike me as unimpeachable. Patricia asserted both a claim for child support and an asserted property interest in the entire marital estate. But the property claim was a claim in a divorce proceeding-by a wife against a husband. And our case law establishes a general rule of abatement of a divorce proceeding upon the death of a spouse-a rule that forecloses any and all claims for relief that may be asserted within that proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 98 I cannot see how the law could be otherwise. Without a spouse subject to the divorce court's jurisdiction there is no party against whom a judgment may be enforced. And without an adverse party there is no viable adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 99 Patricia characterizes her property claim as consisting of an alleged \"right to benefit from the joint tenancy or to have Husband convey his interest to her.\" But Robert is dead, and thus cannot be subject to an order of the divorce court addressed to\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   interests in the marital estate. So the property claim\n   <em>\n    in the divorce proceeding\n   </em>\n   has no continuing viability; when the UFTA Claim was filed in this case there was no longer any legal basis for this property claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6 100 This does not mean that a surviving spouse with asserted property rights is without recourse. Our law, as noted, provides that the parties' \"status, including their property rights, reverts to what it had been before the action was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452163\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/594/#p597\">\n    592 P.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And that leaves the surviving spouse with the prerogative of asserting her rights against any party who may claim an adverse interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6 101 Patricia raises this argument in her briefing before us. Citing\n   <em>\n    American Jurisprudence 2d\n   </em>\n   , she asserts that \" '[a]lthough the death of a spouse ends the cause of action for divorce and abates any pending action for divorce, courts have held that insofar as a divorce action seeks an adjudication of property rights, the cause of action survives and may be revived by the proper party in interest for the exclusive purpose of determining the property rights,' \" (quoting 24 AM. JUR. 2D\n   <em>\n    Divorce &amp; Separation\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 119 (2017) ). Patricia further notes that the \"gist of a divorce action is termination of the marital relationship, a very personal matter, and loss of that person's ability to participate in the litigation was such a prejudice to the case that it would be unjust for the court to proceed to judgment after a party's death.\" And she seeks to distinguish property claims on this basis, contending that \"[c]laims relating to property rights or debts, not being so personal,\n   <em>\n    could be brought against the deceased person's estate\n   </em>\n   or could be brought by the deceased's estate.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 102 A reply brief addressed to these issues would have been helpful. But I would not conclude that Louise defaulted by failing to address these issues in a reply brief. Her opening brief seems to me to adequately address the question presented-and to identify the proper response to Patricia's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 103 The principle advocated by Patricia (and apparently embraced by the majority) can easily be accepted without any endorsement of the viability of Patricia's UFTA Claim in this case. Patricia may well have a right to assert an interest in property\n   <em>\n    against the Estate of Robert\n   </em>\n   . But that potential interest does not rise to the level of a UFTA Claim. And Patricia has not asserted such a claim or cited it as a basis for this UFTA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 104 The only claims that Patricia cited in her complaint-or at any point below-were claims asserted against Robert in the underlying divorce proceeding. The district court's ruling likewise rested exclusively on claims arising from the filing of a divorce proceeding. Counsel for Patricia conceded this point at oral argument, moreover, acknowledging that the only claim at issue \"is a claim based on the marital interest\" stemming from the divorce case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 105 I would reverse on the ground that the claims identified by Patricia as the basis for her UFTA action were extinguished by the abatement of the divorce action. And I would leave open the possibility (not briefed and not properly presented for our review) that Patricia may yet have other claims not pleaded or argued in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 106 The possibility that Patricia might be able to assert\n   <em>\n    another sort of claim\n   </em>\n   that would not be affected by Robert's death is a question raised for the first time by members of this court at oral argument. With that in mind, we can hardly fault Louise for failing to anticipate and respond to that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 107 Throughout the proceedings in this case-both in the trial court and in the briefing on appeal-both sides focused their arguments exclusively on the claims arising in the divorce proceeding. In my view, no one ever asserted that a claim unrelated to the divorce might form the basis of Patricia's UFTA Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 108 It is not our role to speculate on the possibility of such a claim. Perhaps counsel for Patricia will identify one after our decision in this case. But we are not now in a position to opine on the viability of a hypothetical claim that was neither pleaded nor briefed as the basis for an action under the UFTA. On the pleadings and briefing before us, we are asked only to decide whether Patricia had a viable\n   <em>\n    divorce\n   </em>\n   \"claim\" as a \"creditor\" under the UFTA at the time she filed this case. And the answer to that question is straightforward: She did not because\n   that claim was extinguished upon the death of her husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 109 I respectfully dissent for the reasons set forth above. I would hold that Patricia is not entitled to any relief under UFTA. And I would accordingly reverse the district court's decision denying Louise's motion to dismiss. I would also reverse the award of attorney fees in Patricia's favor.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    This point also diminishes the force of the claim that \"[n]early every other jurisdiction follows the rule (or something similar) to that laid out in\n    <em>\n     In Re Harper's Estate.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 26 n.12;\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Bridgeman v.

The court in\n    <em>\n     Nelson\n    </em>\n    addressed an \"alternative contention\" by the appellant: \"even if she does not take by the deed, she should be entitled to her mother's interest in the property as the executrix of her estate and her heir.\"\n    <em>\n     Nelson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10452163\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/592/594/#p597\">\n     592 P.2d at 597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

And I think it unwise for us to cast aside a clearly stated premise of our law without any analysis under the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    or the benefit of briefing from the parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The majority calls this a \"new issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 11 n.3. But this is exactly the issue that the parties asked us to resolve. Louise argued that there was no \"debtor/creditor relationship between [Robert] and [Patricia].\" To evaluate that argument, we must decide whether Patricia had a UFTA Claim against Robert. Utah Code \u00a7 25-6-2 (2016). The district court held, and the majority now affirms, that that UFTA Claim took the form of a \"property interest.\" But that cannot stand under the plain language of the UFTA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The majority's position highlights a fundamental difference between our respective approaches to this case. The majority presumes that the district court identified a valid UFTA Claim and asks only whether it could have survived. It bases that conclusion on the proposition that Louise's challenge on appeal was limited to the narrow question of survival of the claim. I, on the other hand, believe that Louise's brief-while perhaps underdeveloped-squarely raises the question whether a UFTA Claim exists, for the reasons just stated. A UFTA Claim could \"not exist\" in two ways: (1) because it existed once but expired (such as the child support payment orders), or (2) because the \"claim\" identified by the district court never qualified under the statute (such as the \"property rights\" at issue here). Louise addresses both when she argues that no UFTA Claim existed to validate Patricia's suit. I discuss this further below.\n    <em>\n     Infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 92-105.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    The majority speculates that the reason \"there was likely no order entered\" was because Robert committed a \"fraud on the court.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 24 n.9. I am not aware of any basis for such speculation, and I would not do so here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    It is unclear whether the first \"estate\" in that sentence is referring to Robert's Estate or the marital estate. I assume that it is the former, since the preposition \"against\" would not make sense if applied to the marital estate, which is not a party and thus cannot have a claim \"against\" it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    Robert appears to have made a transfer that was fraudulent when made. But the question presented is not whether we condemn the actions of Robert-or have sympathy for Patricia. It is whether Patricia has asserted a viable claim under the UFTA. If she has not then Louise is entitled to dismissal of this action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    That conclusion would leave for another day the question whether Patricia has other viable claims against Louise that were not asserted herein. Yet it would not leave parties in a divorce proceeding free to thumb their nose at pending court orders. Any transfer in violation of such an order would subject the transferor to contempt charges.
