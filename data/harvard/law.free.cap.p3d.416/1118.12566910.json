Following his release, the Board of Pardons and Parole ordered him to pay $7,000 of restitution toward his victim's funeral expenses. Garcia filed various motions with the sentencing court challenging the restitution order as untimely and therefore legally invalid. The district court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate these motions, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm the court of appeals under Utah Code section 77-27-5(3). That provision states that restitution decisions of the board are \"not subject to judicial review.\" This statutory section was all but ignored by the courts below, but it is properly before us here. And it is decisive. It forecloses the judicial review sought by Garcia in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Garcia offers no way around this conclusion under the language of the statute. Instead he alleges that section 77-27-5(3) infringes\n   his constitutional rights under the Open Courts Clause of the Utah Constitution. This is an issue Garcia raised both in the district court and in the court of appeals. But he did not raise it in his opening brief in this court. We do not reach it here for that reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 In March 2006, Dennis Garcia crashed a car and killed his passenger. He was convicted of automobile homicide in April 2008, and he was sentenced to serve zero to five years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Garcia was released from prison in April 2013. Months later, the Board of Pardons and Parole issued an order of restitution that required Garcia to pay $7,000 to the Utah Office for Victims of Crime for funds paid to the victim's mother for funeral expenses. The board sent the order to the district court per Utah Code section 77-27-6(4), and the court entered the order into its docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Garcia moved the district court to set aside the restitution order on the ground that it was untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposing Garcia's motion the Office of State Debt Collection asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction under Utah Code section 77-27-5(3). That section states that \"[d]ecisions of the board in cases involving ... restitution ... are final and are not subject to judicial review.\" The district court denied Garcia's motion, holding that it lacked jurisdiction. It based its order not on section 77-27-5(3) but on other grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Garcia then filed three other motions requesting similar relief. He argued, among other things, that section 77-27-5(3) violated the Open Courts Clause. The court denied all three motions on the grounds stated in its previous order; it did not address Garcia's constitutional argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Garcia appealed the denial of these three motions to the court of appeals. In his brief, he renewed his constitutional argument and made an additional statutory argument. The statutory argument was that the district court had jurisdiction over the restitution order because it entered the order on its docket pursuant to Utah Code section 77-27-6(4). That section states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [I]f the board makes an order of restitution within 60 days after the termination or expiration of the defendant's sentence, the matter shall be referred to the district court for civil collection remedies. The Board of Pardons and Parole shall forward a restitution order to the sentencing court to be entered on the judgment docket. The entry shall constitute a lien and is subject to the same rules as a judgment for money in a civil judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-6(4). Garcia asserted that this statute \"reinvests\" the district court with jurisdiction, at least to review a restitution order that it has entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 The court of appeals affirmed, but it addressed only Garcia's statutory argument. It held that section 77-27-6(4) did not reinvest the district court with jurisdiction \"to rule upon challenges to the fact, amount, or validity of the judgment itself,\" but only to \"order such civil remedies to assist the claimant in collecting on the judgment ....\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6798734\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/1039/6798734/\">\n    2016 UT App 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12340440,6798734\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/1039/\">\n    374 P.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This conclusion was rooted in part in the notion that section 77-27-6(4) refers to \"order[s]\" rather than \"judgment[s]\"-a distinction the court of appeals found significant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. The court of appeals also noted that \"the legislature's use of the term 'district court' as opposed to 'sentencing court' ... indicates that any jurisdiction is vested in the district court system rather than the specific trial court that tried and sentenced a defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The court's opinion does not mention Garcia's open courts challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 We granted certiorari to consider whether the court of appeals erred in affirming\n   the district court's determination that it lacked jurisdiction. We review the court of appeals' decision de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v. Levin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463031\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/144/1096/\">\n    2006 UT 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463031\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/144/1096/\">\n    144 P.3d 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"On certiorari, we review for correctness the decision of the court of appeals ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b610 The question presented is whether the district court had jurisdiction to review the Parole Board's order of restitution. Utah Code section 77-27-5(3) provides the answer. It says that the board's restitution decisions are \"not subject to judicial review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 That clear and simple directive controls the disposition of this case. The legislature has said that our courts are foreclosed from \"judicial review\" of the legality or merits of a restitution order entered by the Parole Board. And Garcia's motions were improper because they sought such review-by challenging the order in question as untimely and thus illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 We affirm on this basis. We conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the legality of the Parole Board's restitution order on Garcia's motions because the district court's \"judicial review\" of the order was foreclosed by Utah Code section 77-27-5(3). In so holding we adopt a basis for decision that departs to some degree from the path taken by the court of appeals. And we reject Garcia's grounds for challenging this approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Garcia challenges the court of appeals' conclusion that the district judge in this case had jurisdiction only to \"order such civil remedies to assist the claimant in collecting on the judgment,\" and not \"to rule upon challenges to the fact, amount, or validity of the judgment itself.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6798734\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/1039/6798734/\">\n    2016 UT App 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12340440,6798734\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/1039/\">\n    374 P.3d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Garcia notes that Utah Code section 77-27-6(4) directs the \"sentencing court\" in a criminal case to \"enter[ ]\" the Parole Board's restitution order \"on the judgment docket.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-6(4). And he suggests that the power to enter the judgment on the docket must encompass the power to consider the legal basis for the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 Garcia may have a small point here. To the extent the court of appeals was saying that district judges are not exercising \"jurisdiction\" in entering a Parole Board restitution order on the judgment docket we disagree. The entry of the order on the docket is mandated by statute. And the exercise of that authority by a judge is the exercise of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 That said, this is not a basis for reversing the court of appeals. The jurisdiction exercised by the sentencing court in a case like this one is limited. The judge is directed only to perform a ministerial act-to enter the restitution order on the judgment docket. And the judicial power to perform that ministerial act does not encompass the power to review the legality or merits of the underlying restitution order. Thus, the court of appeals may have overstated matters in asserting that the district judge has no jurisdiction except over supplemental (civil enforcement) remedies. But the district judge's jurisdiction is limited; it does not extend to reviewing the merits or legal basis for the underlying restitution order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Any question on that matter is resolved by Utah Code section 77-27-5(3). That provision, again, states clearly and unequivocally that \"[d]ecisions of the board in cases involving ... restitution ... are final and are not subject to judicial review.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-5(3). That confirms that a judge that is directed to enter the Parole Board's order on the judgment docket is not authorized to \"review\" the merits or legality of the underlying order. We affirm on the basis of this provision. We hold that, outside of civil collection remedies, the district court's jurisdiction is limited to the ministerial act of entering the judgment adopted by the Parole Board, and that decisions of the board are \"final and are not subject to judicial review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Garcia makes little or no effort to sustain his position under the plain language of Utah Code section 77-27-5(3). Instead he asserts (1) that the clear import of the statute\n   is somehow overridden by precedent and (2) that the statute as written infringes his rights under the Open Courts Clause. The first point is unpersuasive, however, and the second is not properly presented for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 Nothing in our case law runs counter to the plain language of section 77-27-5(3). Garcia invokes\n   <em>\n    State v. Laycock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    2009 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    214 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in support of an asserted right of judicial review of the exercise of \"post-sentence jurisdiction\" to review a restitution order. But\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   has no bearing here. It involved the entry of a restitution order\n   <em>\n    by the district court\n   </em>\n   and review by a petition for extraordinary writ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    2009 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    214 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is significant. Our decision here is dictated by Utah Code section 77-27-5(3) -a provision barring judicial review of \"\n   <em>\n    [d]ecisions of the [parole] board\n   </em>\n   in cases involving ... restitution.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-5(3) (emphasis added). That provision has nothing to say about review of restitution orders entered by a district court. So our decision here is in no way inconsistent with the framework of our\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 Garcia also invokes\n   <em>\n    State v. Schultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11429880\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/56/974/\">\n    2002 UT App 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11429880\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/56/974/\">\n    56 P.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   case is admittedly more difficult to reconcile with our analysis here. The\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   court announced a holding in line with that sought by Garcia-it reversed a restitution order initially entered by the Parole Board and subsequently placed on the judgment docket by the sentencing court on the ground that the board had entered its order at a time when it \"no longer had jurisdiction\" to do so.\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11429880\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/56/974/\">\n    2002 UT App 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11429880\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/56/974/\">\n    56 P.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it reversed the judgment entered by the sentencing court on the ground that \"the sentencing court's entry of the order on its judgment docket is equally invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. For that reason we take Garcia's point that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   seems incompatible with that endorsed by the court of appeals in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 That said, we cannot take Garcia up on his request that we give\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   effect to the\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   opinion. For one thing\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   is a court of appeals decision; as such it has no binding effect here. That is not to say that we ignore decisions from our court of appeals. We scrutinize them carefully, and follow them when we are persuaded by their analysis (as we often are). Here, however, we find no basis for following\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   . That decision was handed down in apparent ignorance of the provision we find controlling here: Utah Code section 77-27-5(3) is nowhere discussed or even cited in\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 Perhaps that is because this provision was not cited in the briefing in that case. Sometimes that happens-through oversight or otherwise, a controlling statutory provision is not brought to the attention of the court. And when that happens, the persuasive power of a prior decision is sharply diminished. That is the case here. For reasons noted above we find Utah Code section 77-27-5(3) to be controlling here, and we repudiate\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   (and any other cases along similar lines) to the extent it runs contrary to the clear terms of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 Garcia's more direct challenge to the clear terms of Utah Code section 77-27-5(3) is his assertion that it runs afoul of the Open Courts Clause of the Utah Constitution. Garcia raised this challenge in the district court and in court of appeals. And both courts inexplicably failed to address this constitutional question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Garcia could have raised this as a basis for challenging the court of appeals' decision. He could have asserted that the court of appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of Garcia's motions not only under the governing statutory framework but also because that framework infringes his constitutional rights. Yet he failed to raise this constitutional ground in his opening brief on appeal. It was not until his reply brief that Garcia raised the constitutional question. And that was too late.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinder v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6821509\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/968/\">\n    2015 UT 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6821509\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/968/\">\n    367 P.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"we typically do not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 By waiting until the reply brief to raise the constitutional question Garcia failed to carry his burden of identifying grounds for challenging the decision before us on review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   And he likewise deprived the State of the opportunity to address this question in its briefing on appeal. That was fatal to his attempt to raise this issue for our consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 A sentencing court has limited jurisdiction to perform the ministerial act of entering a restitution order of the Parole Board on the judgment docket and to facilitate civil collection remedies related to that order. UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-6(4). But that jurisdiction does not encompass judicial review of the legality or merits of the board's order. Such review, in fact, is expressly foreclosed by statute. UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-5(3). We affirm on the basis of that statute.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Parole Board must \"make all orders of restitution within 60 days after the termination or expiration of the defendant's sentence.\" Utah Code \u00a7 77-27-6(2)(c).
