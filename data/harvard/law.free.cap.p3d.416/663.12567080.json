Yet the Board of Pardons and Parole (Parole Board) has denied him an original release date for parole largely based on its determination that he's a sex offender and his refusal to participate in sex offender treatment. Applying the principles we articulated in\n   <em>\n    Labrum v. Utah State Board of Pardons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n    870 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1993), we hold today that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Parole Board on the question of whether it violated Mr. Neese's due process rights under article I, section 7 of the Utah Constitution. Before the Parole Board may take the refusal of inmates in Mr. Neese's shoes to participate in sex offender treatment into consideration in deciding whether to grant them parole, it owes them (1) timely, particularized written notice that allegations they committed unconvicted sexual offenses will be decided; (2) the opportunity to call witnesses; and (3) a written decision adequately explaining its basis for determining that they're sex offenders and asking them to participate in sex offender treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 After his trial on forcible sodomy ended in a mistrial, Mr. Neese pleaded guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice, one\n   count of theft, and one count of burglary. Mr. Neese received a composite prison sentence of two to thirty years. Under Utah's discretionary sentencing scheme, this meant that the Parole Board was authorized to order Mr. Neese's release any time between two and thirty years from his sentence and commitment. A nonbinding \"sentencing matrix\" prepared for the district court estimated that Mr. Neese would likely serve forty-six months, with an anticipated release date in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 Mr. Neese's original parole hearing began on September 13, 2011. The hearing officer asked Mr. Neese about his criminal history, his record in prison, and his plans upon release. Mr. Neese only partially accepted responsibility for the offenses to which he pleaded guilty, and he minimized his prior criminal record. Mr. Neese also reported that he'd successfully participated in anger management and other prison programming, and he stated that, upon release, he intended to work in construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 The hearing officer questioned Mr. Neese extensively about allegations that he'd raped his friends' daughter in 2009, while he was an overnight guest at her parents' house. The hearing officer based his questions on Mr. Neese's presentence report, police reports, a victim statement, and correspondence from the prosecuting attorneys in Mr. Neese's case, all of which stated that the seventeen-year-old daughter of one of Mr. Neese's longtime friends had told police that she had awoken to find Mr. Neese in her bed with his erect penis between the cheeks of her buttocks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 In response to the hearing officer's questioning, Mr. Neese \"denied attempting to sodomize the victim.\" He acknowledged that he'd entered her room while she was sleeping and that his shirt was off at the time, but he explained that he did so because he was about to go to sleep, needed a pillow and blanket, and knew that was where his host kept spare bedding. He speculated that the alleged victim-who he testified had previously been the victim of sexual abuse-had falsely accused him because she'd been \"startled\" by seeing him in her room with his shirt off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 After his first hearing, the Parole Board declined to set a release date and scheduled a rehearing. It based its decision on (1) his \"[h]istory of similar offenses,\" (2) his \"[h]istory of unsuccessful ... supervisions,\" (3) the fact that he'd been convicted of offenses involving \"[m]ultiple incidents and/or victims,\" (4) the \"[p]ersonal gain he reaped from the offense,\" (5) his \"[d]enial or minimization ... of responsibility,\" (6) his history of \"[r]epeated, numerous ... incarceration[s] or parole revocation[s],\" and (7) his lack of \"[o]verall rehabilitative progress and promise.\" The Parole Board scheduled the rehearing for Mr. Neese on February 1, 2014, and it stated that a sex offender treatment memorandum was \"due to the Board of Pardons by 01/2014.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mr. Neese's rehearing took place on February 13, 2014. Unlike at his first hearing, Mr. Neese accepted responsibility for the crimes of which he was convicted and didn't seek to minimize his prior criminal history other than refusing to discuss his juvenile record because he considered it \"irrelevant.\" The hearing officer noted that Mr. Neese had been a \"good inmate\" who had completed numerous life skills classes, and Mr. Neese again emphasized that he intended to do construction work once he was released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 As at Mr. Neese's first hearing, the hearing officer again asked Mr. Neese about his alleged 2009 sex offense. Mr. Neese again denied these allegations and testified in detail-and consistent with the testimony he gave at his first parole hearing-about what had happened, why he believed he was falsely accused, and why he thought his accuser was not credible. Mr. Neese stated that he\n   wasn't willing to participate in sex offender treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 At the end of the second hearing, the hearing officer stated that he didn't \"buy [Mr. Neese's] story on the sex offense.\" He also telegraphed that Mr. Neese's refusal to participate in sex offender treatment would be, as the district court found it was, a factor in his recommendation to the Parole Board, stating, \"I'm gonna take the matter under advisement as far as what I'm gonna recommend [to the Parole Board], but ... I wish you'd ... been willing to do sex offender treatment, that would have been a lot better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 On February 20, 2014, the Parole Board declined for a second time to fix an early release date for Mr. Neese. Among the reasons it gave was Mr. Neese's refusal to accept responsibility-a consideration that could only apply on the assumption that Mr. Neese had committed a sexual offense because Mr. Neese had accepted responsibility for his other crimes. The Parole Board scheduled a third hearing for Mr. Neese, and again ordered the Department of Corrections to prepare a sex offender treatment memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 After he was denied a release date for a second time, Mr. Neese filed a pro se petition for a writ of extraordinary relief. His lawsuit alleged that the Parole Board's determination that he was a sex offender and its decision to condition his parole on successful completion of sex offender treatment violated his due process rights. Mr. Neese also asked the district court to appoint counsel. The district court denied Mr. Neese's request for counsel and dismissed Mr. Neese's complaint as frivolous, but the court of appeals reversed after concluding that Mr. Neese had raised a nonfrivolous issue implicating \"the fairness of the process by which the [Parole] Board undertakes its sentencing function.\"\n   <em>\n    Neese v. Utah Bd. of Pardons &amp; Parole\n   </em>\n   , No. 2014647-CA (unpublished order Nov. 20, 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Padilla v.

The district court granted summary judgment for the Parole Board, concluding that Mr. Neese received due process under the state constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Mr. Neese now appeals. He argues that the Parole Board's determinations violate (1) the Utah Constitution's unnecessary rigor provision, (2) the Utah Constitution's due process provision, (3) the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, and (4) the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(b) gives us jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    PRESERVATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Because this case poses significant preservation problems, we first address which of Mr. Neese's claims are preserved for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 The preservation requirement is a \"self-imposed\" rule of \"prudence\" that aims to promote fairness and judicial economy.\n   <em>\n    Fort Pierce Indus.

Thus, an issue is preserved when it's \"presented to the trial court in such a way that the trial court has an opportunity to rule on that issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Baby E.Z.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    2011 UT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    266 P.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, when a lower court decides \"to take up [a] question,\" this decision \"conclusively overc[o]me[s] any objection that the issue was not preserved for appeal\" because the issue has consciously been addressed by the court.\n   <em>\n    Shakespeare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789744\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1218/\">\n    2016 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789744\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1218/\">\n    379 P.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Mr. Neese never raised an Eighth Amendment challenge to the Parole Board's actions in his petition for an extraordinary writ, and he mentioned the unnecessary rigor provision only once, without connecting it to any facts, law, or argument. Neither the Parole Board nor the district court considered these claims, nor did the court of appeals otherwise put these claims at issue in its order vacating the district court's determination that Mr. Neese's petition was frivolous and remanding to give the Parole Board an opportunity to explain why its proceedings respected Mr. Neese's due process rights. These claims are therefore not properly before us.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mr. Neese preserved his federal due process claim in his petition for an extraordinary writ. He argued at length that the Parole Board's finding that he'd committed a sex offense of which he'd never been convicted and that its decision to factor his refusal to participate in sex offender treatment into its early release determination violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. And he adduced detailed facts and pertinent legal authority in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 As the Parole Board acknowledged in its briefing to this court, Mr. Neese's state due process claim was likewise preserved before the district court. While Mr. Neese's petition didn't itself plead a separate due process claim under our constitution, the court of appeals injected the issue into the underlying proceeding when it directed the district court to solicit a response from the Parole Board on the \"fairness of the process by which the [Parole] Board undertakes its sentencing function\" under\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Utah Board of Pardons &amp; Parole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888685\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/947/664/#p667\">\n    947 P.2d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 667 (Utah 1997) (citation omitted)-a state due process case. Based on the court of appeals' order, the Parole Board understood the issue before the district court to be \"whether an inmate not convicted of a sex offense can be required to participate in sex offender treatment for purposes of determining eligibility for release on parole,\" and it cited\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   in support of its argument that Mr. Neese received adequate due process protections.

Thus, because the Parole Board understood the state due process provision to be implicated in Mr. Neese's petition for extraordinary relief, and because the district court itself \"[took] up the question,\" Mr. Neese's state due process claim is preserved.\n   <em>\n    Shakespeare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789744\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1218/\">\n    2016 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6789744\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/1218/\">\n    379 P.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Because Mr. Neese's due process claims are preserved for appeal, we now turn to their merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 The question in this case is whether the district court erred in granting\n   summary judgment in favor of the Parole Board on Mr. Neese's due process claims. \"Constitutional issues, including questions regarding due process, are questions of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Corp. v.

The determination that an inmate has committed a sex offense triggers an unusually-perhaps uniquely-harsh set of consequences. Construing the record in the light most favorable to Mr. Neese, as we must, it appears that the Parole Board places significant and perhaps determinative weight on whether an inmate deemed to be a sex offender has participated in sex offender treatment in making its early release determinations. But a prerequisite to participating in sex offender treatment is admitting to having committed a sex offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052566\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/79/960/\">\n    2003 UT App 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052566\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/79/960/\">\n    79 P.3d 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that sex offender treatment programs require inmates to \"admit[ ] guilt\"). Thus, unlike in other situations where the Parole Board might erroneously conclude that an inmate has committed unconvicted conduct and ask that the inmate participate in additional prison programming, when the Parole Board erroneously determines that an inmate is a sex offender, that inmate\n   <em>\n    can't\n   </em>\n   truthfully participate in the treatment program. Unconvicted sex offenses thus pose a unique problem that requires unique procedural protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31 There are additional reasons why the interest in minimizing error is particularly urgent in cases where the Parole Board has determined that an inmate has committed a sex offense of which he's not been convicted, and where-as here-it's alleged that this determination has caused the Department of Corrections to classify the inmate as a sex offender. Inmates who are classified as sex offenders are beaten and raped at significantly higher rates than others in the prison population.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renchenski v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787500\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/315/#p326\">\n    622 F.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326 (3d Cir. 2010) (\"[S]ex offenders are considered an anathema in the inmate subculture ...

Additionally, sex offender treatment is highly invasive and degrading. Among other things, male participants are required to undergo penile plethysmograph tests, in which they're shown pornography while their penis is hooked to a device that measures blood flow and, hence, arousal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH ADMIN. CODE R. 251-109-6(2). According to Mr. Neese's pleadings, they're also removed from the general prison population and placed in more restrictive conditions and in closer proximity to sexual predators. These deleterious effects, when coupled with the problem that it's impossible for a person who has erroneously been classified as a sex offender to truthfully participate in sex offender treatment, make the risk of error in cases where the Parole Board decides that an inmate has committed an unconvicted sex offense particularly acute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 32 Additional procedural protections are also needed to protect the integrity of the parole-grant process and to promote the other criminal procedure values that\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   seeks to safeguard: uniformity in sentences, rational plea bargaining, and good behavior in prison.\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n    870 P.2d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As far as the record before us reveals, Mr. Neese has never been convicted of a sex offense or adjudicated a sex offender in a disciplinary, juvenile, or any other proceeding. While he was tried for a sex offense, the trial ended in a mistrial, and Mr. Neese subsequently entered a plea agreement only to other, nonsexual charges. In short, Mr. Neese accepted an offer to plead to nonsexual crimes after having steadfastly maintained that he was innocent of sexual misconduct, having gone to trial to hold the State to its burden of proving him guilty of a sex offense and having not been convicted. We think an inmate in this position would justly question the integrity of a system in which the Parole Board could, after all this, adjudge him a sex offender and postpone his release date for up to\n   <em>\n    twenty-eight years\n   </em>\n   based solely on unproven allegations and without giving the inmate the opportunity to call witnesses or affording him a meaningful explanation of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 33 The risk of unjustified sentencing disparities in such a system is great. By the same token, defendants will be justifiably wary of accepting plea deals if they know that bargained-for dismissed charges, on which they have steadfastly maintained their innocence and that are not logically implicit in the factual basis of their allocution, can come roaring back at their parole hearing and result in a sentence decades longer than the sentence all parties contemplated based on the sentencing matrix at the time. And, given that the perception of fairness is important to good behavior in prison, this value will also be well-served by according inmates in Mr. Neese's shoes the procedural protections that basic fairness requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34 The transcripts of the parole-grant hearings in this case underscore the need for additional procedural protections for inmates like Mr. Neese. In both his initial parole hearing and his rehearing in 2014, Mr. Neese testified consistently and emphatically that he wasn't a sexual offender. The transcripts of these hearings reveal that both his account of the events of the night on which he was accused of committing rape and his explanation of why the alleged victim falsely accused him have surface plausibility. We're hard pressed to see how Mr. Neese could have mounted a more effective defense while availing himself only of the basic due process protections to which\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   entitles all inmates. Yet, without explaining why, the Parole Board chose to believe unproven allegations in a police report over Mr. Neese's explanation of why they were false. We lack confidence in the accuracy of these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35 On appeal, the Parole Board argues that because Mr. Neese isn't entitled to parole, he can't have a \"protectable liberty interest\" in early release that would trigger the protections of due process over and above what\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   already requires.

But the federal cases don't support the Parole Board's contention that\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   sets the ceiling for state due process protections, and they're curious cases to press into that service. Instead, if the logic of these cases applied under Utah's Constitution, we'd have to overrule\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   and hold that our constitution requires the same \"liberty interest\" analysis that the federal courts employ. But the Parole Board doesn't ask us to overrule\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   , and, even more importantly, we believe that\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   got it right: being kept in prison, potentially for decades longer than one otherwise would, is a paradigmatic example of a deprivation of liberty. Moreover, to the extent that the Parole Board asks us to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   is confined to its facts, we decline the invitation. The Parole Board has given us no cause to repudiate the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   , and our task is to faithfully apply our precedent.

When a federal liberty interest is implicated, federal courts have similarly adopted these protections in proceedings where a parole board intends to classify inmates as sex offenders and require them to complete sex offender treatment as a precondition for parole eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Neal v. Shimoda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889252\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/131/818/#p829\">\n    131 F.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 830 (9th Cir. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 43 We hold today that the Utah Constitution requires analogous procedures in original parole grant hearings where the\n   Parole Board intends to classify as a sex offender an inmate who has never been convicted of a sex offense or otherwise adjudicated a sex offender. That is, the Parole Board (1) must, in advance of the hearing, provide particularized written notice that it intends to consider and effectively decide unconvicted sexual conduct in making its parole determination; (2) unless the safe administration of the prison system requires otherwise, it must allow the inmate to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense; and (3) it must provide a written statement of the evidence it relied upon and the reasons it concluded that the inmate committed the unconvicted sexual conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 44 These procedures will redress the due process problems that we've identified with the Parole Board's considering unconvicted sexual conduct in this case. Particularized, advance written notice and the ability to call witnesses will reduce the risk of error and promote the perception of fairness by allowing inmates to meaningfully present evidence in a situation where they've never before had the opportunity to do so. The requirement that an inmate receive particularized written notice flows directly from\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   's holding that inmates must be given \"the materials and information on which the [Parole] Board [intends to] rel[y] at an original parole grant hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Labrum v. Utah State Bd. of Pardons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n    870 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 (Utah 1993). This right of access extends broadly to give the inmate the opportunity to review and prepare to address any information on which the Parole Board intends to rely. For example, notwithstanding the confidential nature of psychological reports, an inmate is presumptively \"entitled to access psychological reports to be considered by the [Parole] Board in hearings at which the inmate's release date may be fixed or extended.\"\n   <em>\n    Neel v. Holden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10353160\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/886/1097/#p1101\">\n    886 P.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1103 (Utah 1994). Thus, when the Parole Board plans to consider unadjudicated allegations of sexual misconduct, an inmate must be given particularized written notice of the nature of those allegations sufficiently in advance of the hearing to allow him to prepare a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 45 An inmate who stands accused of committing an unconvicted sexual offense must also be allowed to call witnesses. To be sure, the ability to call witnesses isn't essential to the fairness and accuracy of all original parole proceedings. But when the Parole Board considers unconvicted sexual conduct, these procedural protections are \"basic to a fair hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173832\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/539/#p564\">\n    418 U.S. at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173832\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/539/#p564\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is because the Parole Board, in considering unconvicted sexual conduct, is effectively trying the inmate for an offense that has never before been adjudicated in any other forum (criminal trial, sentencing proceeding, or prison disciplinary hearing). It would be anomalous to allow the Parole Board to effectively convict an inmate of a sexual offense-effectively adding decades to his sentence and placing him in the impossible bind of having to participate in a treatment program he can't honestly engage in-without first giving the inmate the opportunity to put on testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 46 Similarly, a written statement of the evidence relied upon and the reasons that the Parole Board concluded that the inmate committed the unconvicted sexual conduct will promote fairness and accuracy, both by ensuring that the Parole Board has carefully considered the evidence and by creating a record of the Parole Board's adjudication that allows for meaningful due process review.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preece v. House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10349290\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/886/508/#p512\">\n    886 P.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (Utah 1994) (courts may review only \"the\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   by which the [Parole] Board undertakes its sentencing function\" (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is particularly important when the Parole Board is, in effect, holding a miniature criminal trial-a proceeding that, more so than the ordinary functions of the Parole Board (reviewing disciplinary, court, criminal, family, and victim history and impact records and making a determination regarding early release) is squarely within the judiciary's ken. A preprinted form with aggravating and mitigating factors checked off on it\n   <em>\n    presupposes\n   </em>\n   that an inmate has committed a sexual offense; it doesn't explain that conclusion. And it's therefore inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 47 The procedures we require today will also further other important interests. First,\n   they'll eliminate the irrational disparity otherwise created by the fact that inmates in disciplinary proceedings-where the potential sanctions are often much less severe than extra years, decades, or life in prison-are entitled to\n   <em>\n    Wolff\n   </em>\n   's procedural protections, whereas inmates are not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Wolff\n   </em>\n   's procedural protections when the Parole Board is sitting in an analogous capacity by adjudicating an inmate's guilt or innocence of an offense for which he's not otherwise been found guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wolff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173832\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/539/#p564\">\n    418 U.S. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173832\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/539/#p564\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Homer v.

Finally, we don't believe that these additional procedural protections are unnecessarily onerous (given that\n   <em>\n    Wolff\n   </em>\n   has applied these protections in disciplinary proceedings for years without needless disruption of the correctional system) and, to the extent that they reduce the Parole Board's reliance on unconvicted sexual conduct, especially conduct that has been bargained out of a plea deal, they'll safeguard the rationality of plea bargaining.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 48 We accordingly hold Mr. Neese was entitled to the procedural protections this opinion outlines before the Parole Board could designate him a sex offender based on previously unadjudicated allegations of sexual misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   III. THE DISSENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 49 The dissent believes Mr. Neese has already received more process than he's entitled to under the due process provision. According to the dissent, the framers of the Utah Constitution would have never understood the mandates of due process to extend beyond the guilt phase of a criminal proceeding. A consequence of this is that due process protections simply do not apply to sentencing-a view that, if taken seriously and to its logical conclusion, would mean that \"heads you live/tails you die\" sentencing doesn't offend due process in this state. And, even if the protections of due process do extend to parole proceedings, the dissent thinks Mr. Neese has received all due process requires and then some. After all, he'd been told of the parole hearing and given an opportunity to speak. He even received the packet of information on which the Parole Board relied in denying him parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 50 We reject the dissent's analysis for two reasons.

The Parole Board examines the crimes of which the inmate has already been adjudicated, the inmate's network of social support, his disciplinary, social-programmatic, and work record in prison, and (if pertinent) uncontested therapeutic opinions of the inmate's psychologist or therapist. When this is the extent of the Parole Board's review, it need not allow an inmate to call witnesses because witnesses won't meaningfully reduce the risk of error or promote the perception of fairness.

And, ironically, the dissent's own originalist analysis underscores the wisdom of our historiographical restraint. Without the benefit of adversarial briefing, the dissent makes two historical claims: (1) that, on its original understanding, the due process provision likely wouldn't have been understood to apply to sentencing or parole proceedings,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 165-66; and (2) that, even if it did, Mr. Neese received all the process he was entitled to under the original understanding of the due process provision,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 170-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 67 We agree with the dissent that this court should look to the original meaning of the Utah Constitution when properly confronted with constitutional issues.

The Original Scope of Due Process: Sentencing and Parole\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 68 The dissent begins by questioning whether, on the original understanding of the due process provision, due process protections would have been understood to apply to post-trial proceedings, such as sentencing proceedings and parole hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 69 The heart of the dissent's historical case is the supposed absence of Reconstruction and Gilded Age case law applying due process protections to discretionary sentencing proceedings. The dissent sees in this absence \"an important 'dog that didn't bark' \"-\"[i]f the generation of the framing of the Utah Constitution viewed the constitutional\n   guarantee of due process of law to attach to sentencing proceedings, surely,\" the dissent suggests, \"someone would have raised the argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163. And the dissent thinks it knows why due process didn't apply to these proceedings (or, later, to early parole proceedings). Any sentence less than the statutory maximum-and any decision by a parole board to release an inmate early-was \"an act of grace-a grant of greater liberty than the defendant was entitled to.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 70 We're hesitant to come to any definite conclusions about this history without the benefit of adversarial briefing. And our own independent review of the historical record illustrates why. When we examine the historical record, we don't see as clearly as the dissent a settled view that due process protections didn't apply to sentencing or parole proceedings. On this point, the dissent's historical review falls short in three respects: (a) it overlooks a body of law that appears to apply procedural protections to sentencing, (b) it overlooks plausible competing explanations for why courts didn't address sentencing due process questions more frequently than they did, and (c) its attempt to explain why due process might not have been thought to extend to sentencing proceedings-because Gilded Age penologists were in the grips of a \"grace\" conception of sub-maximum sentencing and parole-may be historically inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   a.

In\n   <em>\n    Kistler v.

The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a time that didn't sharply distinguish between the guilt phase and the sentencing phase. As a consequence, many trial-level procedural protections may also have functioned as sentencing protections. For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It appears that a comparatively small fraction of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century sentences were truly set by a judge. Thus, scholars have discovered that \"[o]nly a small fraction of eighteenth-century criminal trials [at the Old Bailey] were genuinely contested inquiries into guilt or innocence\" and that the great majority \"were sentencing proceedings\"-\"[t]he main object of the defense was to present the jury with a view of the circumstances of the crime and the offender that would motivate it to return a verdict within the privilege of clergy, in order to reduce the sanction ....\" John H. Langbein,\n   <em>\n    Shaping the Eighteenth-Century Criminal Trial: A View from the Ryder Sources\n   </em>\n   , 50 U. CHI. L. REV.1, 41 (1983). This practice also appears to have continued into the nineteenth century. \"[F]rom 1800 to 1900, juries imposed sentences in noncapital cases in about half of all the states,\" and \"[a] handful of other states permitted juries in noncapital cases to make sentencing recommendations.\" Morris B.

Moreover, even though \"states began to codify existing criminal procedure standards during the mid to late nineteenth century,\" \"criminal procedure remained primarily a judicial rather than legislative matter,\" which meant that \"state courts were rarely called upon to assess the constitutionality of statutes that dealt with criminal procedure\"-they could preserve due process through the common law.

Additionally, the formalistic approach of many nineteenth-century courts may have made it far more likely that a criminal appeal would result in a reversal of conviction-not a sentencing review. As Professor Friedman explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Between 1870 and 1900 there are persistent complaints that some state supreme courts behaved as if their chief function was to reverse decisions of their lower courts for technical errors .... [E]xcesses in behavior were most striking in criminal appeals. Harwell, the defendant in a Texas case decided in 1886, had been arrested and convicted for receiving stolen cattle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   The Texas court reversed, because, among other things, the jury found the defendant \"guity\" instead of \"guilty.\" ... The same court, however, magnanimously upheld a conviction of \"guily\" in 1879, proving that a \"t\" was less crucial than an \"l\" in the common law of Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   LAWRENCE M. FRIEDMAN, A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LAW 398-400 (2d ed. 1985) (citations omitted). Indeed, according to Professor Friedman, between 1875 and 1887, the Texas Court of Appeals \"had reversed 1,604 criminal cases, and affirmed only 882-a margin of almost two to one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 399 (\"In one volume of reports, there were five reversals to every single affirmance.\"). But this means that the appellate courts had far fewer occasions to redress sentencing errors-they were too busy reversing convictions!\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 85 In short, even to the extent the dissent is right about the lack of cases articulating procedural protections applicable to sentencing, the inference it draws from this \"dog that didn't bark\" ignores potential competing explanations that don't imply that the original understanding of due process didn't extend to sentencing and parole proceedings. We think it would be rash to overturn our precedent, and announce new due process standards under the Utah Constitution, based on a chain of historical inferences that may well be misleading or incomplete, and that certainly haven't been tested by the adversarial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   c. Grace\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 86 A key lemma in the dissent's argument for why due process didn't extend to sentencing and parole proceedings is the idea that a sentence below the statutory maximum-or a grant of parole before an indeterminate term had expired-was thought to be an act of \"grace.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164. If true, this theory might help explain why nineteenth-century constitutional actors lacked concern about due process protections in sentencing and parole proceedings: mercy, one might argue, isn't a liberty interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 87 Again, however, while we're nervous to fly blind, it appears to us that the dissent may well be mistaken about the prevalence of the \"grace\" conception of parole. The academic literature supports the notion that parole's progenitors embraced a \"medical model of criminality.\" Julia L. Black, Note,\n   <em>\n    The Constitutionality of Federal Sentences Imposed Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 after\n   </em>\n   Mistretta v. United States, 75 IOWA L. REV. 767, 771 n.52 (1990) (quoting JANET SCHMIDT, DEMYSTIFYING PAROLE 4-5 (1977)). On this model, parole was not a matter of grace. Instead, parole determinations \"emphasized the role of treatment in helping the criminal to understand the external forces causing his or her 'sickness,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 771 n.51 (quoting SCHMIDT, DEMYSTIFYING PAROLE , at 4). Parole and the indeterminate sentence, Professor Friedman explains, were \"based on a simple theory.\" LAWRENCE M. FRIEDMAN, A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LAW 597 (2d ed. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   No judge was wise enough to tell when a prisoner would be \"cured.\" Prison officials, on the other hand, had the prisoner in view every day. A criminal should be locked up as long as he was \"unfit to be free.\" He was the \"arbiter of his own fate\"; he carried \"the key of his prison in his own pocket.\" The indeterminate sentence, then, emphasized the character and background of the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20N.W.%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this casts doubt on the dissent's explanation of why procedural protections weren't thought to apply to sentencing and parole proceedings. If those proceedings weren't merely merciful acts of grace, but were, instead, supposed to be responsive to an inmate's prospects for rehabilitation, then it makes little sense for courts to have been unconcerned with the standards that might apply to the ascertainment of those prospects. And today, of course, all parties to a sentencing fully expect reasoned, well thought out Parole Board decisions about when an inmate should be released from prison-not random acts of mercy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 88 In short, we are not confident in the dissent's originalist analysis of the scope of the due process provision. We don't mean to say that the dissent is\n   <em>\n    wrong\n   </em>\n   , only that, in the absence of adversarial briefing on the question, we don't know the answer. We believe the appropriate course is to stay our\n   hand on the question until such time that it's fairly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   2. The Original Content of Due Process: What's in a Hearing?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 89 The dissent also has a second line of attack: one focused on the\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   of the due process provision. That is, assuming the due process provision applies to parole proceedings, the dissent thinks it plain that Mr. Neese received all he was entitled to under the original understanding of the due process provision. According to the dissent, the Utah Constitution embodies a conception of due process on which due process is satisfied as long as an inmate receives \"notice and an opportunity to be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169. And the dissent thinks Mr. Neese got this: \"[h]e was advised of the pendency of the parole hearing and given a chance to present his view on the questions presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 90 But in surveying the history of due process in the run up to ratification, we don't perceive as clearly as the dissent does that constitutional due process protections required only minimal notice and opportunity to speak. Instead, it appears to us that the United States Supreme Court repeatedly explained during the period leading up to Utah's admission to the Union that due process had bite. It required hearings to be conducted according to those procedures that were \"appropriate to the nature of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

What is missing from this approach is deep immersion in the shared linguistic, political, and legal presuppositions and understandings of the ratification era.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6 99 Linguistically, originalism will often require the constitutional interpreter to \"access the semantics and pragmatics available to a competent speaker of American English at the time each provision was framed and ratified.\" Lawrence B.

This is because many constitutional principles are just that-general, abstract principles. But this doesn't mean that we may pour our own contemporary moral views into the constitutional text. Instead, we must seek to understand the requirements these principles would have been understood to embody by the founding generation, and we must apply those requirements to contemporary problems. We can't do this without engaging the founding era's political and legal understandings-\"trac[ing] intellectual influences ... [and] situat[ing] meaning in the flow of discursive activity\"-in order to uncover the \"presuppositions and silent logical connectives\" that collectively formed the era's understanding of the constitutional text, but that time has hidden from our view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gienapp,\n   <em>\n    Historicism and Holism\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 955.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6 101 The fundamental error in the dissent's originalist analysis is that it doesn't immerse itself in Gilded Age sources to uncover and elucidate the principles embodied in the due process provision. It commits this error at both the linguistic and ideological level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 102 Linguistically, the dissent relies heavily on Lucius Polk McGehee's treatise to support its claim that \"the precise means of notice and an opportunity to be heard are not enshrined in the guarantee of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169. According to the dissent, Professor McGehee tells us that \" '[t]he basis of due process' consists of 'orderly proceedings and an opportunity to defend.' \"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169 (quoting LUCIUS POLK MCGEHEE, DUE PROCESS OF LAW UNDER THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 2 (1906)). And the dissent takes this to mean that due process only requires a litigant to be given notice of \"the pendency of [a] hearing and given a chance to present his view on the questions presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 103 At first blush, this is a reasonable construction. To our contemporary mind \"orderly proceedings\" and \"an opportunity to defend\" may very well sound like thin concepts. But a broader engagement with the relevant source material suggests to us that, at the time of ratification, these phrases may have connoted more robust restraints on the legislature than the dissent perceives. For example, Professor McGehee was surely aware of the Court's remarks in\n   <em>\n    Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   , where the Court indicated that due process would sometimes require elaborate procedural protections, including the right to call witnesses. And other courts drew on Professor McGehee's treatise for the proposition that the due process provision constrained the legislature's authority to prescribe rules of evidence and procedure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Blaisdell\n   </em>\n   , the \"opportunity to be heard, and to defend\" according to an \"orderly proceeding adapted to the nature of the case\" was thought to include the requirement of \"a trial\" including \"the right to produce witnesses and to submit evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=57%20N.W.%20794\">\n    57 N.W. at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 105 This isn't to take a definitive stand on the meaning of \"orderly proceedings and an opportunity to defend.\" It's only to illustrate that figuring out its meaning-or meanings-requires deep, sympathetic engagement with a wide array of Gilded Age source material. It's a mistake to interpret those phrases with tacit reference to contemporary linguistic understandings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6 106 The dissent also fails to adequately immerse itself in relevant political and legal presuppositions and understandings of the Gilded Age. Take, for example, the dissent's analysis of whether the protections of due process might have been understood to apply to sentencing proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1 (responding to this portion of the dissent's analysis). The dissent excerpts a set of treatises according to which offenders have \"no constitutional right ... to confront witnesses at sentence hearings\" and \"no recognized constitutional right to present witnesses on their [own] behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 171 n.52 (quoting ARTHUR W. CAMPBELL, LAW OF SENTENCING \u00a7 13:20 (3d ed. 2004));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159 n.37 (\"There were no announced standards, procedural or substantive, to control a sentencing judge or jury.\" (quoting\n   Stephen A.

REV. 243, 244 (2001) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 107 The problem with the dissent's decision to rely on these claims-to the extent they're even accurate,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.1-is that the dissent doesn't consider the degree to which they presuppose or depend on background legal and political assumptions and realities. As we've explained, perhaps there were no \"announced standards\" applicable to the sentencing phase of a case because there was no meaningful line between the guilt and sentencing phases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78. Or perhaps it was because appellate courts had little opportunity, and even less occasion, to even consider what constitutional protections should apply at sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. Or perhaps it was because the nineteenth century took it for granted (1) that sentencing evidence would be sworn and (2) that oaths, by themselves, were sufficiently powerful to assure the reliability of evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 108 If the claims on which the dissent relies turned on any of these background realities or presuppositions, then the dissent is wrong to rely on them. If there were no cases applying due process protections to sentencing because there were no sentencing proceedings, or because few courts had the authority to entertain sentencing appeals, then that tells us little about what due process would've been understood to require in sentencing proceedings had it actually applied. Similarly, if no court applied the due process provision to require confrontation rights or other substantive evidentiary protections only because of the ratification era's general presupposition that sworn testimony was presumptively reliable-backed by the force of a deity-then the demise of this general understanding of the power of the oath suggests that the principle embodied in the due process provision would apply very differently today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 109 In sum, only through deep immersion in ratification-era language and debates can an originalist hope to uncover the principles that many constitutional provisions originally embodied. A failure of deep immersion will lead to atomistic originalist analysis, and, in turn, constitutional error. We've illustrated how this error may have infected the dissent. And we urge litigants who undertake originalist argument to engage in this kind of deep reading in future cases before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    D.

The dissent's view-that due process protections may not apply to sentencing and parole, and, even if they do, they don't require any procedural\n   protections designed to ensure accurate, non-arbitrary decisions-is discomfiting. For Mr. Neese, it would mean that the Parole Board could rely on untested allegations to force him to choose between (1) being labeled a sex offender, subjected to the increased risk of violence to which sex offenders are exposed, and required to complete a profoundly invasive and degrading program of treatment (one he can't truthfully participate in if, as he maintains, he isn't a sex offender) or (2) being kept in prison for much of the rest of his life. Even the dissent expresses discomfort with this consequence of its conception of due process-a conception that privileges bright lines over fairness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 115 But, as we've explained, the past doesn't unambiguously support the dissent's analysis. The dissent's analysis hasn't been briefed to us. And we're accordingly unable to deprive Mr. Neese of the due process protections to which he is entitled under a faithful application of\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 116 Based on the undisputed facts, we conclude that before the Parole Board considers the unconvicted sexual offense that its hearing officers have questioned Mr. Neese about, article I, section 7 of the Utah Constitution requires it to provide Mr. Neese with the additional procedural protections that this opinion has described. We therefore reverse the district court's order granting summary judgment to the Parole Board in this case and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Chief Justice Durrant, concurring in part and concurring in the result:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6 117 I concur in sections I, II, and part A of section III of the majority opinion, but write separately to express my disagreement with parts B, C, and D of section III. I share the majority's view that in\n   <em>\n    Labrum v. Utah State Board of Pardons\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   we adopted the proposition that \" 'original release hearings'-such as the hearing at issue here-'are analogous to sentencing hearings and require due process to the extent that the analogy holds.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   I also agree that, while the due process protections the majority identifies here were not specifically addressed by the\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   court, they are consistent with the core premise of the\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   opinion and are a logical and reasonable extension of that premise. Additionally, I share the majority's view that the dissent's central argument-that \"the historical record does not suggest that the nineteenth century understanding of the constitutional right of 'due process' would have extended to sentencing proceedings\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   's central holding and that to adopt that argument would be to effectively overrule\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   . Finally, I agree with the majority that because Mr. Neese has not sought to overrule\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   , and because neither party has provided us with adequate briefing on the Utah Constitution's due process clause, it is unnecessary to conduct a historical analysis in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6 118 But I part paths with the majority's decision to substantively address the dissent's historical analysis. I believe the majority errs in engaging in a debate on the merits as to arguments presented by the dissent, and further errs in putting a thumb on the scale with respect to some of those issues. While the majority refrains from stating \"any definite conclusions about this history without the benefit of adversarial briefing,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   it nevertheless appears to indicate a preferred resolution of some key issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   I understand\n   the majority's reluctance to let the dissent's arguments go uncontested, but, for the reasons offered by the majority in support of its view that the dissent has unnecessarily and without adequate briefing set forth a historical analysis, I would not engage in a substantive rebuttal of that analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6 119 Determining the correct historical understanding of our state constitution's due process clause is an issue of obvious importance.

This statement, read in context, is a suggestion that Mr. Neese hasn't met his burden of persuasion. But because this issue was inadequately briefed, it's of no consequence.

The Board's refusal to allow Neese to call and question his accuser made it difficult for him to persuasively refute the sex-offense charge against him. And without a persuasive means of rebuttal, Neese is likely to face substantially more prison time than most other inmates serving time for his crime of conviction (obstruction of justice). He would also serve that time without a trial-like adjudication of the sex-offense charge in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 121 For these and other reasons I might endorse the procedures set forth in the majority opinion if I were in a position to make policy in this field-to promulgate administrative rules governing the Parole Board. I hedge-saying only that\n   <em>\n    I might\n   </em>\n   -because I am certain that my understanding of the Board's decisionmaking process is incomplete. And I frame this conclusion in the subjunctive-speaking of what I might do\n   <em>\n    if I were\n   </em>\n   in a position to promulgate rules for the Board-to underscore the limited scope of our authority in a case like this one.

And the blurriness is perhaps at its height when we speak of the requirements of \"due process.\" Here, perhaps more than in other constitutional fields, it is tempting to think of the constitutional requirement of due process as a general charter for assuring a vague ideal of fairness-an ideal that will ebb and flow or evolve over time. But that is not what is enshrined in the due process clause. \"[T]he Due Process Clause is not a free-wheeling constitutional license for courts to assure fairness on a case-by-case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Discipline of Steffensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800105\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/186/\">\n    2016 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6800105\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/373/186/\">\n    373 P.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[I]t is a constitutional standard\" with a specific, if somewhat flexible, meaning.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6 123 The idea of a fixed construct is inherent in the very nature of constitutional law.

I would not begin by accepting the broadest conception of our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Labrum v. Utah State Board of Pardons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n    870 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909-10 (Utah 1993). That decision admittedly deserves some measure of respect as a matter of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   . But the majority in my view is extending the premises of the\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   decision to their logical extreme-a step that\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   does not require.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (noting that the Parole Board has asked us to limit\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   \"to its facts,\" but concluding that \"our task is to faithfully apply our precedent\" absent a request that we overrule it).\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   did not decide the question presented here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-43. So we can uphold\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   without ruling in Neese's favor. And in my view we should carefully consider the basis of the court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   before extending it in the manner that the court does today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \u00b6 126 The majority criticizes my approach on two principal grounds-(a) the concern that I am engaged in independent analysis of historical material without the benefit of adversary briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67; and (b) the assertion that I am urging a decision overruling\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   while the court is just upholding that decision on\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   grounds,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 57. I respond to these and other points in detail below. For now I would note (1) that I favor supplemental briefing on the historical basis for our decision in this case; (2) that my colleagues are not just preserving\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   but are extending it-establishing a new standard of due process in parole hearings that is nowhere dictated on the face of\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) that the majority's extension of\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   is not one expressly requested by Neese (and accordingly not subjected to adversary briefing).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 137-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 127 My colleagues apparently prefer not to seek further briefing from the parties on the historical questions that I am addressing. That is their prerogative. But I would think that their decision to decline further briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50 n.5, 51, might blunt their criticism of my historical analysis of the due process clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 128 The majority is establishing a significant new rule of constitutional law in resolving this case. It holds for the first time that the Utah Constitution guarantees a right to cross-examination in a parole hearing. That right is nowhere enshrined in our precedent-or at all dictated by the analytical framework of\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 129 Neese himself has not invoked the\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   opinion as a basis for the parole procedures he claims to be lacking. He bases his due process argument principally on federal authorities-citing\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   only in his reply brief, and only there in an attempt to try to distinguish it (in response to the Parole Board's argument that Neese was afforded all of the process that he was due under\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6 130 The bottom line is that the briefing on the state constitutional question presented is quite minimal. That leaves us with two choices-either to seek supplemental briefing or to move forward with what we have. I would seek further briefing. But I also find the matter adequately presented, and I see no barrier to our resolving it (either by application of precedent or by resort to historical materials).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6 131 I would resolve this issue by analyzing the text and original meaning of the due process clause of the Utah Constitution. Thus, I would apply the historical framework of due process that I have outlined previously.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of K.A.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338256\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/390/278/\">\n    2016 UT 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 45-100,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338256\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/390/278/\">\n    390 P.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lee, A.C.J., dissenting). And I would affirm the district court's decision dismissing Neese's claims because I find no basis in the text or original meaning of the Utah due process clause to call into question the procedural framework adopted by the Parole Board (much less, to sustain the specific procedures deemed required by the majority).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00b6 132 In the paragraphs below I begin with some background on the due process framework that I would apply.

But again the court is doing more than that. It is establishing a broad conception of\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   -the notion that due process requires any additional parole procedure that a majority of the court views as advancing the interest of fundamental fairness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   nowhere expressly articulates that as the controlling constitutional framework. So in that sense the majority itself is also revisiting the underlying basis for our decision in\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   . It is just doing so implicitly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6 147 The majority's due process construct yields no logical stopping point-and no real guiding legal principle. Indeed the majority itself nowhere expressly articulates an \"anything a majority of us deem necessary is required\" standard of due process. If that is in fact the operative principle then we should say so. If there is some other basis for the decision then we should say that. We owe it to the parties-and to lower courts and to the bar, who will be governed by our opinion-to identify a transparent legal basis for the direction of our law in this important area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6 148 To do that we need to return to first principles.

I can accept, on\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   grounds,\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   's premise that initial parole hearings are analogous\n   to sentencing proceedings for due process purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28;\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n    870 P.2d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that does not end the inquiry.

And we will search the historical record in vain for support for the idea that a defendant at sentencing had a due process right to be \"heard\"\n   <em>\n    by calling witnesses\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    cross-examining them\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B. The newly-established due process right to a written sentencing decision is even more novel. To my knowledge no court has ever found such a right-not historically (as of the founding of the Utah Constitution) and not even in modern jurisprudence. And these are further reasons to doubt the constitutional propriety of the majority's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \u00b6 151 The threshold question is whether a parole hearing is the sort of proceeding that triggers a constitutional right to due process. Textually, that question turns on whether such a hearing threatens the deprivation of \"life, liberty or property.\" And the originalist gloss on that question is whether the public understanding of this provision would encompass a hearing like the one at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   \u00b6 152 One version of the originalist inquiry might start with the premise that modern parole hearings were unknown to the generation of the framing of the Utah Constitution. Because today's parole hearings were not invented until nearly two decades after the framing of our Due Process Clause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   the argument could be made that the right to due process does not attach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   \u00b6 153 The argument\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be made. But it wouldn't be a good argument. It would be an argument based on a debunked form of originalism. Thoughtful originalists distinguish between an\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   of the constitution and the public\n   <em>\n    understanding\n   </em>\n   of the legal principle expressed by its terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   They view the constitution-like all law-as consisting of\n   <em>\n    legal principles\n   </em>\n   expressed by the\n   <em>\n    public understanding of its terms\n   </em>\n   . But they do not foreclose\n   <em>\n    new applications\n   </em>\n   of those principles to circumstances unknown to the past. Quite the contrary, they view the prospect of such applications as essential to and inherent in the notion of constitutional law. Thoughtful originalists acknowledge that a constitution incapable of extending its principles to new applications cannot fulfill the promise of establishing fixed bulwarks to protect fundamental rights. And they thus adopt an originalist inquiry that looks to the public understanding of the constitution's terms, not the applications envisioned by the framers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \u00b6 154 This is mainstream originalism, or \"original public meaning\" originalism. This form of originalism should be distinguished from \"original intent\" originalism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The original intent inquiry is sometimes framed (often by critics) as turning on pure silliness-on \"what would James Madison have thought\" (or what would our Utah framers have thought) about a particular modern problem. And the answer to that question is usually obvious-nothing, because the framers never could have thought about our modern problems. But that is irrelevant to an original public meaning originalist, because she is looking for the public\n   <em>\n    understanding\n   </em>\n   of the operative legal principle at play. It\n   doesn't really matter what the framers might have thought about particular modern problems, because that oversimplified inquiry has to do with\n   <em>\n    applications\n   </em>\n   , not the public\n   <em>\n    understanding\n   </em>\n   , of the legal principles enshrined in a constitutional text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b6 155 A Fourth Amendment problem may help to illustrate. The framers obviously would not have had any specific opinion about whether using a thermal-imaging device to examine a private home for unusual sources of heat (a sign of marijuana cultivation) is a \"search\" triggering the protections of the Fourth Amendment. But that is the wrong question to ask.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b6 156 The right question to ask is whether the original public meaning of the legal principle encompassed within the protection against \"unreasonable search and seizure,\" U.S. CONST. amend. IV, would have prohibited using a thermal-imaging device in that way, sans warrant. And it is entirely possible to conclude that the original understanding of that principle encompasses visual inspection by thermal-imaging-if, for example, we think of the notion of a \"search\" as any operation that violates, in any manner, a homeowner's reasonable expectation of privacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kyllo v.

The proper question before us is not whether the framers of the Utah Constitution would have thought that parole hearings trigger a right to due process. Instead we should ask what legal principle the Utah public would have understood in the guarantee of \"due process\" as a prerequisite to any deprivation of \"life, liberty or property.\" And to answer that question we may need to look for historical analogies to the modern premises before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \u00b6 158 The majority, citing\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   , says that the best analogy is to criminal sentencing proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.

There is little historical basis for a conclusion that the due process clause was understood to extend in any meaningful way to sentencing proceedings. The historical view-from the time of the framing of the U.S. Constitution and continuing through the nineteenth century-was that a person's \"liberty\" was implicated only\n   by the determination of guilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The historical record suggests that no one thought that sentencing involved a second deprivation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b6 160 In the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century there was no such thing as a sentencing proceeding as we understand it today.

At the time of the framing of the Utah Constitution no one would have thought that the right to due process implicated a right to call witnesses or review a written sentencing decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAMPBELL, LAW OF SENTENCING ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00a7 10:5 (stating that the \"strong nationwide trend to require reasons for sentences\" began only in the \"late-1970s\"). Indeed the process afforded by the Parole Board far exceeds anything that would have been available historically. The Board gives prospective parolees a right to review everything in the Board's file, UTAH ADMIN. CODE r. 671-303-1(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   an opportunity to respond in writing to any matters in the file,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   r. 671-303-1(2), the prerogative of appearing and testifying to the Board,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   r. 671-301-1(A) &amp; (B), and even a right to file requests for reconsideration or \"special attention reviews,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   r. 671-316-1 (redetermination review procedure);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   r. 671-311-1 (special attention review procedure). And the Board guarantees that its \"[d]ecisions ... will be reduced to a written order,\" which generally are \"accompanied by a brief rationale for the order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   r. 671-305-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u00b6 173 This process goes well beyond that afforded to convicted persons at sentencing proceedings in the nineteenth century. And that is a further basis for rejecting the majority's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   \u00b6 174 The majority hedges in its articulation of the due process rights available in a parole hearing. It says that the constitutional right \"to call witnesses and present documentary evidence\" attaches \"unless the safe and effective administration of the prison system requires otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. That may be a helpful caveat. At the very least it is a wise recognition of our lack of expertise and understanding of the parole process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   \u00b6 175 But the court's caveat also highlights a basic problem with the majority's analysis. We have little knowledge of the day-to-day operations of the Parole Board. And the briefing in this case offers little insight into the possible effects of a decision to announce a new constitutional right to call witnesses. Perhaps that means that any right to call witnesses must be framed as tentative and conditional. But this also underscores a problem with the decision to constitutionalize this field of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b6 176 We have a means of preserving the need for a \"safe and effective administration\n   of the prison system.\" It is to respect the traditional role of the Parole Board in adopting rules of procedure in this field-and to leave the limits of the Due Process Clause to the procedures historically understood to be guaranteed by the constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   \u00b6 177 We undermine the orderly evolution of our law when we constitutionalize fields meant for policymakers. Our constitutional decisions are set in stone, so to speak, and are not easily set aside. We should take that into account before we enshrine a right to call witnesses or to receive a written sentencing decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   \u00b6 178 It may be a step in the right direction to acknowledge the countervailing interest in \"the safe and effective administration of the prison system.\" But that does not adequately capture the costs and concerns on the other side of the balance. We cannot properly talk about the best process-let alone the constitutionally mandated process-for a\n   <em>\n    parole system\n   </em>\n   if we are focused only on the \"effective administration of\n   <em>\n    the prison system\n   </em>\n   .\" We must also account for the needs of an effective\n   <em>\n    parole system\n   </em>\n   . And the most we can say on that point here is that those charged with managing that system have determined that the right to call or cross-examine witnesses is a procedure that interferes with the \"safe and effective administration\" of parole in Utah. Surely there are good reasons for that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   \u00b6 179 We can characterize the Parole Board's process as effectively \"a miniature criminal trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. But that does not make it so. In our system of justice the Parole Board performs a very different function from the trial court. The Board is not deciding on guilt or innocence. Nor is it even resolving the questions presented to a trial court at sentencing-like the important question, for example, of whether to impose a sentence or instead suspend it upon conditions of probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-18-1(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   \u00b6 180 Instead, the Parole Board is making a more holistic, discretionary decision-whether and when to allow an inmate committed to serve up to a statutory maximum term to be released on parole at an earlier date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   These decisions are sensitive ones. And our law has long recognized that we can account for all of these sensitive considerations only if we preserve the subjective, discretionary judgment of the Parole Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   \u00b6 181 We interfere with that discretion when we constitutionalize the Parole Board's processes. And in so doing we threaten the longstanding premises of parole in our criminal justice system. The more we formalize this process the more we threaten the equilibrium of our existing system of criminal justice. We should hesitate before proclaiming a full understanding of the costs and benefits of superimposing additional procedures on a system that remains mostly hidden from judicial scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-27-5(3) (\"Decisions of the board in cases involving paroles, pardons, commutations or terminations of sentence ... are final and are not subject to judicial review.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   \u00b6 182 The \"critical functions\" of due process cited in\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   are not a legal test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 (citing the minimization of \"error\" and the promotion of the \"perception of fairness\" as considerations requiring the procedures required by the majority);\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/\">\n    870 P.2d at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing \"[a]ccuracy and fairness\" as \"essential\" concerns of due process). They are just\n   <em>\n    benefits\n   </em>\n   of additional procedure. And if we cite only the benefits-the upsides-of additional procedure we will have a one-way ratchet that will always result in\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   constitutionally required procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   \u00b6 183 That is the majority's methodology. It treats the minimization of error and the promotion of the perception of fairness as the\n   touchstones for assessing the requirements of the due process clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. And, not surprisingly, the court concludes that more procedure-a right to call witnesses and to a written ruling-is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   \u00b6 184 This is another fatal flaw in the majority's approach. The court ultimately does not identify an operative legal principle or legal test. It simply identifies grounds for ever-expanding procedural mechanisms. The court purports to identify only two new due process rights at parole hearings-the right to call witnesses and the right to a written ruling. But its mode of reasoning provides no stopping point. If we take the majority opinion at face value we can anticipate that more and more procedural rights are to come. Under the majority's approach any additional mechanisms that can be thought to decrease the risk of error and increase the perception of fairness may eventually be \"required\" by the due process clause. So long as a majority of the court concludes that additional procedures advance these goals, they may be viewed as required by the Utah Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   \u00b6 185 The court's articulated factors are as fuzzy and unworkable as they are unmoored from history. The inquiry into the perception of fairness seems particularly unmanageable. Fairness is a two-way street. And the inmate is only one side of the criminal justice equation. The other side encompasses interests protected by the state-the public generally and also victims. And fairness to those groups' interests should also be weighed in the balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   \u00b6 186 I understand that an inmate in Neese's position might \"question the integrity of a system in which the Parole Board could ... adjudge him a sex offender and postpone his release date for up to twenty-eight years based solely on unproven allegations and without ... the opportunity to call witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 (emphasis omitted). But what about the victim of Neese's crimes? And what about the general public, with an interest in seeing that inmates are not released on parole in circumstances in which there is a perceived risk to the public? What about the perception of fairness on this side of the balance?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   \u00b6 187 Neese's victim saw him convicted of crimes sustaining a sentence of up to thirty-two years in prison. And the victim understood that Neese could be required to serve that full term unless the Parole Board exercised its discretion to authorize his early release on parole. Under longstanding procedures, the Parole Board could be expected to exercise its discretion to consider conduct not resulting in a conviction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvillar v.

CODE r. 671-402-1(A) (\"The Board may add special conditions to a standard parole agreement. Special conditions are generally intended to help hold an offender accountable or to help rehabilitate an offender.\"). And Neese's victim would have understood that Parole Board procedures would not have allowed Neese to call witnesses in any parole hearings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947740\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   r. 671-308-3(b) (\"Only the offender, a person appointed by the Board to assist an offender pursuant to this rule, or a victim as provided for by Utah law may present testimony or comment during a hearing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   \u00b6 188 All of these expectations will be dashed by the majority's decision today. And Neese's victim will \"justly question the integrity of a system,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32, that allows Neese to change the rules of the parole game midstream.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   \u00b6 189 The majority's warning about the effects of the Parole Board's procedures on plea bargains strikes me as backwards. I do\n   not see how we can say that a defendant has a \"justifiabl[e]\" expectation that charges dismissed on a plea bargain will not \"come roaring back at their parole hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Our longstanding parole system makes that a very real possibility. It tells convicted defendants that they may well have to serve the full extent of their imposed sentence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 77-18-4(2) &amp; (3), that the decision to release them early is a matter within the discretion of the Parole Board,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77-18-4(3), that that discretion can take into account a range of considerations affecting the inmate's risk to the public,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvillar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947740\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1204/\">\n    2014 UT App 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947740\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1204/\">\n    322 P.3d 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the inmate has no right to call witnesses at a parole hearing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   UTAH ADMIN. CODE r. 671-308-3(b). With all this in mind, a defendant like Neese is in no position to claim surprise at the Parole Board's approach-or concern about the effect on incentives in plea-bargaining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6 190 If anything it is Neese's victim whose interests and expectations are being undermined. By establishing a new set of procedural rights never before established in the parole system the majority undermines Neese's victim's justifiable expectations. It is the victim whose expectations are being undermined here. And victims like her \"will be justifiably wary\" of plea deals involving the dismissal of sex-offense charges, if the victims know they may be called in to testify in future parole hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   \u00b6 191 We can disagree about whether a right to call witnesses at a parole hearing is a good idea. But so long as we are talking about fairness and justifiable expectations we should paint the full picture. And that picture must include victims and the public.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-271\">\n    Neese himself has not asserted that this case is controlled by\n    <em>\n     Labrum\n    </em>\n    .

My whole point is that the historical record does not suggest that the nineteenth century understanding of the constitutional right of \"due process\" would have extended to sentencing proceedings. And for that reason I would leave the development of fair procedure for other (non-constitutional) mechanisms like rulemaking.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"46\">\n   <p id=\"p-303\">\n    It may well be that the lack of any historical right to cross-examination in sentencing was rooted in a longstanding (but today outmoded) faith in \"the power of oaths to assure the reliability of evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 74 n.9. And the evolution in our thinking about the power of an oath could well be a reason to amend our rules of evidence to allow for more procedure in sentencing. But that doesn't tell us that the historical understanding of due process must likewise evolve in a manner that responds to our modern sensibilities. The Utah Constitution prescribes mechanisms for amendment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Const. art. XXIII, \u00a7 1. If the people think that a principle enshrined in the document has outlived its usefulness they are free to initiate the process for amending that principle. But if the guarantee of \"due process\" was not historically understood to apply to sentencing then it is not the role of a court to revise the principle of due process to conform to modern sensibilities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-304\">\n    Sentencing is not some \"new application\" of the principle of due process.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 74 n.9. Sentencing proceedings have been around since well before the founding of our Utah Constitution. So if the founding-era notion of \"due process\" was not viewed as extending to sentencing then the due process guarantee doesn't apply to sentencing. The scope of the due process guarantee is an aspect of the governing \"legal principle.\" We may now view the thinking behind that principle to be outmoded. But that is at most a basis for amending the constitution. It is not a license for a judicial reformulation. And it certainly isn't a \"new application\" that the framers hadn't thought about.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"47\">\n   <p id=\"p-305\">\n    It may be that sentencing was more a matter for jury determination during the nineteenth century.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 77.

But that doesn't tell us anything of relevance to the question of whether the guarantee of due process was understood to apply in sentencing proceedings. I have cited extensive historical material supporting my answer to that question. The majority, at most, has identified explanations for a lack of historical material cutting the other way. That is insufficient. The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of existing parole procedures falls on Neese.
