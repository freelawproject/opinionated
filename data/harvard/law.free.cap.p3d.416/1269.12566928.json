He contends his lawyer provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to advise him that (1) Mr. Burlingame had the right to plead guilty when arraigned on the State's initial charge of third degree rape, (2) if he pleaded not guilty, he would lose the right to plead guilty as charged without the approval of the prosecutor, (3) the facts, including the facts as recounted to police by Mr. Burlingame\n   himself, supported conviction for second degree rape, and (4) the punishment for conviction of second degree rape was dramatically more harsh than the punishment for third degree rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 On the very unusual facts of this case-facts that are well-supported not only by declarations of Mr. Burlingame and his trial lawyer, but also by the record of the police investigation and arraignment-Mr. Burlingame shows actual and substantial prejudice resulting from the violation of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. We grant his petition, remand with directions that he have the opportunity to plead guilty to third degree rape, and if he does plead guilty to third degree rape, empower and direct the trial court to vacate his conviction for second degree rape.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RAP 16.11(b), 16.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On December 30, 2015, 18-year-old Ethan Burlingame called 911 to report that he needed to be arrested because several hours earlier he had \"violated a girl.\" Pers. Restraint Pet. App. (PRP App.), Incident Report at 3. When interviewed by police, Mr. Burlingame told them he had been drinking with the victim and others at his brother's house and after everyone quit drinking, he went to sleep on the couch and the victim went to sleep on the floor. He described the victim as being \"passed out due to being very intoxicated.\" PRP App., Deputy Suppl. Report at 2. As she slept, Mr. Burlingame said he touched the victim's breast, put his mouth on her bare breast, pulled her underpants down to her ankles, inserted his fingers into her vagina, penetrated her vagina with his tongue, and then attempted to insert his penis into her vagina. Mr. Burlingame told officers he might have inserted his penis into the victim's vagina about an inch, but he was not sure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 When initially contacted by police on the morning of the report, the victim stated she had not been raped by Mr. Burlingame. But the next day, she told Officer Stan Berkshire that Mr. Burlingame had raped her and she had been too embarrassed to say so when interviewed the day before. She said she woke up to find Mr. Burlingame on top of her with her pants around her ankles. She provided a written statement to that effect and stated that she did not give consent and would not have consented even if she had been awake and coherent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State charged Mr. Burlingame with third degree rape on January 6, 2016. Defense counsel was appointed to represent him. Mr. Burlingame was not arraigned until January 19, 2016, by which time defense counsel had received discovery and was aware of the State's evidence against his client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Declarations of Mr. Burlingame, his father, and defense counsel consistently report that when Mr. Burlingame appeared for arraignment on the third degree rape charge, he wanted to plead guilty. He had never recanted his original, unrecorded, volunteered confession and even agreed to record his confession after the charge was filed. Defense counsel nonetheless advised Mr. Burlingame against pleading guilty as charged because the deputy prosecuting attorney had told him and Mr. Burlingame's family that he might amend the charge to assault in the fourth degree, a gross misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mr. Burlingame's arraignment lasted only a few minutes, consisting of the following dialogue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... Mr. Burlingame is present and we ask the Court on his behalf to enter a plea of not guilty. We would waive the reading of the information at this point in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   JUDGE: Mr. Burlingame, are you prepared to plead not guilty to this charge at this time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   BURLINGAME: I am entering no plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   JUDGE: Pardon me?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   BURLINGAME: I'm not entering a plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   JUDGE: You're not entering a plea?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We have had a discussion about this, Your Honor, and Mr. Burlingame is uncomfortable in actually uttering not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   JUDGE: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I've instructed him that the Court will constructively enter a plea of not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   JUDGE: Right, I will do that for you then.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   JUDGE: To preserve your rights so that you can continue to talk to your lawyer and continue to remain out of jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   To the charge of rape in the third degree, I'm [entering] a not guilty plea on your behalf at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Resp. to Pers. Restraint Pet. App., Tr. of Initial Arraignment at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State later moved to amend the information and was permitted to amend to a charge of second degree rape in violation of RCW 9A.44.050(1)(b), which applies where a victim is physically incapacitated and incapable of consent at the time of the offense. Second degree rape is a class A felony and a sexual offense. RCW 9A.44.050(2) ; RCW 9.94A.030(47). It is punishable by an indeterminate sentence, meaning that the offender will be in prison for life unless released from custody with the approval of the indeterminate sentence review board. RCW 9.94A.507(3), (4) ; RCW 9.95.420. Should the offender be released, he or she is subject to supervision by the Department of Corrections for life. RCW 9.94A.507(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 9 Defense counsel did not object to the State's motion to amend. Mr. Burlingame entered a plea of guilty to second degree rape at the time he was arraigned on the amended charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 10 Based on an offender score of zero, the trial court sentenced Mr. Burlingame to an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of 78 months' confinement (the low end of the standard range) and a maximum of life imprisonment. Had Mr. Burlingame pleaded guilty to third degree rape as originally charged, his standard range with an offender score of zero would have been 6 to 12 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 9.94A.517 (crimes included within each seriousness level); RCW 9.94A.510 (sentencing grid). The maximum sentence, had the court imposed an exceptional sentence, would have been 60 months' confinement. RCW 9A.20.020(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 11 Through retained counsel, Mr. Burlingame timely filed this, his first personal restraint petition, in April 2017 asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 12 In responding, the State expresses concern that we are being asked to impose a new duty on defense lawyers to advise clients to plead guilty at arraignment any time the State has a strong case. Resp. to Pers. Restraint Pet. at 3. It also argues that a lawyer who does not urge a client to plead guilty at arraignment is not ineffective, since the lawyer will not yet have had the opportunity to investigate available evidence, assess possible defense motions, or determine whether the client's immigration status will trigger collateral consequences.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 13 As Mr. Burlingame emphasizes, however, he is not contending his defense counsel should have advised him to plead guilty. His expert witness, criminal defense attorney Todd Maybrown, testifies instead that Mr. Burlingame's defense counsel's representation was deficient in the following respects:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   a. [T]rial counsel failed to advise Mr. Burlingame that he had the right to plead guilty at arraignment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   b. [T]rial counsel failed to advise Mr. Burlingame that he would lose the right to plead guilty as charged without the approval of the Prosecuting Attorney if Burlingame entered a plea of not guilty at arraignment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   c. [E]ven if trial counsel was hopeful that the case might later be negotiated to a lesser charge, counsel had an absolute duty to explain to Mr. Burlingame that the facts, including the facts as admitted by Mr. Burlingame himself, supported conviction of a more serious crime ... than the offense charged in the initial Information ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   d. [T]rial counsel failed to advise Mr. Burlingame regarding the dramatic increase in the punishment for conviction of the more serious crime of Rape in the Second Degree; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   e. [T]rial counsel did not explain that it was Mr. Burlingame's choice-not counsel's choice-regarding the decision to plead guilty or not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   PRP App., Decl. of Todd Maybrown at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 14 In a declaration filed in support of his personal restraint petition (PRP), Mr. Burlingame\n   states that had he been advised of the risks associated with not pleading guilty at arraignment, \"I would have decided to plea [sic] guilty, as I had originally intended to do, in spite of counsel's advice.\" Reply in Support of PRP App., Suppl. Decl. of Ethan N. Burlingame at 1. Declarations of defense counsel and Mr. Burlingame's father endorse the view that Mr. Burlingame would have pleaded guilty, based on their knowledge of the circumstances at the time of the original arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 15 To obtain relief in a PRP, a petitioner must show actual and substantial prejudice resulting from alleged constitutional errors, or for alleged nonconstitutional errors a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.
