After his initial appearance in that case, Morreno was released on his own recognizance. As a condition of his release, Morreno was ordered to \"refrain from committing any criminal offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In May, the police received reports of a suspicious person and contacted Morreno. He\n   admitted possessing marijuana and a marijuana pipe and was again charged with felony possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. His initial appearance in that case was scheduled for July, but Morreno failed to appear and an arrest warrant was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Morreno was arrested in 2017 and held without bail pursuant to the On-Release provision.

The superior court disagreed and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Morreno filed a petition for special action, which the court of appeals stayed pending this Court's decision on whether to grant review in a similar case. Thereafter, Morreno filed a petition for review in this Court challenging the superior court's ruling and the court of appeals' stay order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Although Morreno has since pleaded guilty to the charged offenses in both cases (rendering his constitutional challenge moot as applied to him), we granted review to address the facial constitutionality of the On-Release provision, a recurring issue of statewide importance.

The State, in contrast, argues that the On-Release provision is constitutional under\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   because it is \"not offense-based,\" but is instead \"status-based\" and narrowly focused on \"recidivistic tendencies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Before evaluating these arguments, we first address the Attorney General's assertion that \"\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   was incorrect\" and should be overruled \"to the extent that it misapplies the facial challenge and substantive due process tests from\n   <em>\n    United States v.

What is remarkable about this conclusion is that in reaching it, the Court abandoned\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   and employed an overbreadth analysis. On the one hand, the Court recognized that there were circumstances where the provision would be valid. The Court stated that \"[s]exual conduct with a minor is always a serious crime,\" and \"[i]n\n   <em>\n    many but not all instances\n   </em>\n   , its commission may indicate a threat of future dangerousness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 349 \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n    387 P.3d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). On the other hand, the Court speculated that there were circumstances where the provision might not be valid. Specifically, the Court stated that the crime might involve \"consensual sex\" between two teenagers and, under such a scenario, the fact a \"defendant committed the crime would suggest little or nothing about the defendant's danger to anyone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 27. Thus, the Court concluded, even where the proof is evident or the presumption great that a defendant has committed sexual conduct with a minor, detention on this basis \"sweeps in situations\" where a defendant might not pose a danger to the community.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 49 Thus, setting aside the well-established standard for facial challenges,\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   struck down a statute that had clear constitutional applications. The bond provision in\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   limited detention to those cases where the state proved, by the \"robust\" standard of proof evident/presumption great,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 346 \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n    387 P.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that a defendant penetrated a child's anus or vagina with his penis or some object; had oral contact with a child's penis, vulva, or anus; or engaged in masturbation with a child's penis or vagina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1405(A), -1401(A)(1), (4). In passing this constitutional provision, the people of Arizona made a judgment that, under these limited circumstances, a legitimate and compelling purpose-protecting children from severe sexual abuse-was served by temporarily detaining a defendant pending trial. At a minimum, this constitutional provision survives a facial challenge. Indeed, it is reasonable to conclude that in those cases where the proof is evident/presumption great that a thirty, forty, or fifty-year-old defendant sodomizes a five-year-old or has sexual intercourse with\n   an eight-year-old, he may, if released before trial, pose a danger to his victim or other children in the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indeed, even\n   <em>\n    Simpson II's\n   </em>\n   holding that capital murder and sexual assault provide a convincing proxy for dangerousness collapse under the weight of the overbreadth standard, because it is always\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   to think of factual scenarios where such offenses may not \"inherently\" predict future dangerousness or provide a reliable \"proxy for dangerousness.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n    241 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   348-49 \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310374\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/341/\">\n    387 P.3d at 1277-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 65 Applying\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   to the On-Release provision demonstrates this point. The majority first claims that the On-Release provision has a different purpose (preventing recidivism) than\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   (protecting the victim and the community). It then concludes that the On-Release provision, unlike the provision in\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   , is narrowly focused on accomplishing this purpose because it only applies to (1) defendants \"who are charged with felonies committed while on release from a prior felony charge, and (2) the state must show the \"proof is evident or the presumption great\" the defendant committed the new felony.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 66 But is a defendant who commits a new felony while on pretrial release for another felony\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   a risk to recidivate? Stated another way, are there factual scenarios where a defendant might not conceivably pose a risk to re-offend, and yet is \"swept in\" by the \"overbroad\" On-Release provision? Undoubtedly, we can speculate about such scenarios. As one example, consider a defendant who is arrested and charged for possessing marijuana. After he is arrested and booked into jail, the judge releases him on his own recognizance. The defendant is then picked up by his girlfriend, who is driving his car. Unfortunately, the defendant left his marijuana pipe in the car, and fifty feet from the jail a police officer pulls him over for a broken tail light. Defendant consents to a search of the car, the pipe is discovered, and defendant is charged with a new felony: possession of drug paraphernalia. Does the defendant's arrest for this new felony indicate he is a risk to commit new felony crimes while on pretrial release?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 67 Of course, like the \"consensual sex\" scenario in\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   , this hypothetical\n   stands the test for a facial challenge on its head. Rather than the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   establishing there are no circumstances where the On-Release provision would be valid, an overbreadth analysis invites a court to speculate about circumstances where the law might\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   operate constitutionally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 68 To be clear, I think the On-Release provision is constitutionally valid because Morreno has failed to make a successful facial challenge under\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   . The On-Release provision is narrowly focused on its purpose of preventing crime because, in many circumstances, when a defendant commits a new felony while on release it \"strongly suggests recidivist tendencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.

The point, however, is that the On-Release provision is valid using the\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   standard; it can never be valid using the\n   <em>\n    Simpson II\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 69 Applying the\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   standard does not, as Morreno contends, leave him without a remedy.

Under such a challenge, this Court need not speculate about other cases or situations where the On-Release provision may or may not violate due process.

Rather, such litigants may seek to invalidate a statute because it may conceivably violate the constitutional rights of someone else who is not before the court-whether that person actually exists or is simply a hypothetical construct designed to invalidate the statute. Of course, this will require courts in many instances to speculate about the validity of an entire statutory scheme or a constitutional provision without the benefit of a developed factual record or concrete facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 71 To avoid this unworkable scenario, the United States Supreme Court has adopted a very demanding standard for facial challenges.
