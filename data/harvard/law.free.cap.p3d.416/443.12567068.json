Mr. Johnson appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court of appeals identified an issue that was not argued by the parties and ordered supplemental briefing, ultimately reversing Mr. Johnson's conviction. We have granted certiorari review to answer a single question: whether the court of appeals correctly concluded that exceptional circumstances merit review of an issue not preserved in the trial court and not argued on appeal. We hold that the exceptional circumstances exception to the preservation rule does not apply here, and we reverse the court of appeals and remand this case so that it may consider the appellant's other unaddressed claims of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b62 Michael Johnson was charged and tried for murder. At trial, Mr. Johnson requested an instruction for the lesser offense of homicide by assault. The trial court agreed and stated on the record that it would use the homicide by assault instruction submitted by Mr. Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 The jury returned a guilty verdict on the murder charge, and Mr. Johnson appealed his conviction to the court of appeals. He argued that his conviction should be reversed because the verdict form returned by the jury did not include an option to find him guilty of the lesser offense of homicide by assault\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the jury instruction on causation was erroneous.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The writ of error was used to review an order or judgment of an English court of law; an appeal in equity was used to review a ruling in a court of equity. Barry A.

The issue raised by the court of appeals was not raised by the appellant in his opening brief, nor was it preserved in the trial court. As noted above, an appellate court may only reach the waived and unpreserved issue\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   if the issue deals with subject matter jurisdiction, there is a statute or rule allowing the court to reach the issue, it meets the purely legal issue exception to waiver and preservation laid out\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   paragraph 51, or it meets the\n   <em>\n    Robison\n   </em>\n   exception to waiver and preservation laid out\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   paragraph 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b655 The issue raised by the court of appeals\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   was whether a jury instruction misstated the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of the lesser included offense of homicide by assault. Under Utah Code section 76-5-209, a person commits homicide by assault when \"a person causes the death of another,\" under circumstances \"not amounting to aggravated murder, murder, or manslaughter,\" \"while\n   <em>\n    intentionally or knowingly attempting\n   </em>\n   , with unlawful force or violence,\n   <em>\n    to do bodily injury to another\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). The instruction stated that Mr. Johnson was guilty of homicide by assault if he killed the victim, \"under circumstances not amounting to aggravated murder, murder, or manslaughter,\" and that \"he did so intentionally or knowingly\n   <em>\n    while\n   </em>\n   attempting, with unlawful force or violence, to do bodily injury to\" the victim.

As the court of appeals stated, the instruction \"places the 'while' after the mens rea language, separating the 'intentionally and knowingly' elements from the act of assault.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court of appeals reasoned that this shift in language required the jury to find that Mr. Johnson knowingly or intentionally killed the victim, instead of that the jury find that Mr. Johnson knowingly or intentionally attempted to do bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b656 This issue did not address subject matter jurisdiction or joinder, nor did it involve one of the rare instances in which a statute or rule permits\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   review of an unpreserved issue. And, while the incorrect jury instruction poses a purely legal issue, this issue is not likely to have bearing in the analysis in other cases as the alleged instructional error was specific to the instructions submitted in this case. As we noted above, an appellate court may address an unpreserved and waived issue when it is, 1) a purely legal issue, 2) that is almost certain to\n   arise and assist in the analysis in other cases, 3) is necessary to correctly determining an issue that was properly raised, and 4) neither party is unfairly prejudiced by raising the issue at that point or neither party argues that they are unfairly prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.

Pryce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5681682,10533471\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/1343/\">\n    938 F.2d 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1352 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (Silberman J., dissenting) (\"[T]he judiciary is on\n   <em>\n    no side\n   </em>\n   . That proposition is not a technicality; it is fundamental. We judges must be strictly neutral with respect to all cases that come before us ....\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b675 And in my view the decision to advance a claim for relief-either a cause of action in the district court or a claim of error on appeal-is the distinct prerogative of a party. We cross a line we should not cross when we seize the role of identifying claims we wish the parties had advanced. We cannot assert that role while maintaining a role of neutral arbiter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b676 I would so hold. I would repudiate the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Robison\n   </em>\n   to the extent it could be read (and was read by the court of appeals) to endorse the power of an appellate court to introduce claims of error not raised by an appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b677 In so doing I would leave room for the notion of an appellate prerogative of seeking supplemental briefing on issues or arguments\n   <em>\n    of relevance to the disposition of a claim that is properly before the court\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 n.2 (indicating that \"new\n   <em>\n    arguments\n   </em>\n   , when brought under a properly preserved issue or theory, do not require an exception to preservation\"). That, as the majority indicates, is a long-settled practice. In keeping with our role in the adversary system, we must also acknowledge our duty to pronounce correct principles of law. And to fulfill that duty we may occasionally request additional argument or analysis on issues necessarily implicated by the claims that are presented for our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b678 But that is a different matter than the one presented here. No claim presented for\n   decision requires us to assess the correctness of the \"homicide by assault\" instruction. And for that reason I see no basis for the majority's decision to expound at length on the standards governing our decision to request supplemental briefing on issues necessarily implicated by the claims briefed for our decision. I would save that for another day. I would simply hold that the court of appeals erred in\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raising a claim of error that was neither preserved nor presented by the defendant on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b679 The majority echoes many of the principles discussed above. It reinforces the \"dominance\" of the adversary system and concludes that our appellate system \"more closely resembl[es] the writ-of-error model\" of review.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. And it repudiates some of the premises of the\n   <em>\n    Robison\n   </em>\n   standard for\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   consideration of \"issues\" not preserved or raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b680 To that extent I agree with the majority. Yet the court also presents an alternative \"model\" of appellate review-the \"appeal in equity\" approach, which was embraced historically by certain courts of equity.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. The majority says that \" '[a]ppellate courts in equity were free to consider any issue de novo' and 'developed flexible procedures to address the needs of individual cases.' \"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (quoting Barry A. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Sua Sponte Appellate Rulings: When Courts Deprive Litigants of an Opportunity to Be Heard\n   </em>\n   , 39 SAN DIEGO L. REV . 1253, 1263 (2002) ). And it cites cases and commentary in support of the proposition that our appellate system incorporates components of both models. The upshot, in the majority's view, is that American appellate courts \"wrestle[ ] with the correct balance between law and equity and the scope of review on appeal\" and retain extensive discretion to raise new \"issues\" not preserved or argued by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b681 I think the majority understates the degree to which our American appellate system has embraced the adversarial (\"writ of error\") model. And it overstates the matter quite dramatically to suggest that we retain the discretion of a court exercising power over an \"appeal in equity.\" Our appellate system looks nothing like the \"appeal in equity\" model described by the majority. We have never left our appellate courts \"free to consider any issue de novo\" regardless of whether it was preserved or raised by the parties. Certainly we have not endorsed the majority's implicit premise that appellate courts retain the authority to identify\n   <em>\n    claims of error\n   </em>\n   not raised by an appellant-to root around in the record in search of a decision made by the trial court that offends our sense of fairness, and thus our confidence in the \"equity\" of the proceeding below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b682 The majority presents purportedly contrary authority. But much of the cited authority is taken out of context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some of the cited cases address only the court's authority to embrace exceptions to the law of preservation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

P. 19(e). Although we have not definitively charted the outer bounds of what constitutes \"a manifest injustice\" under this rule, we hold that this term incorporates the exceptions to the preservation requirement.

We cannot, therefore, compare the instruction proposed by Mr. Johnson with the instruction given to the jury.

Moreover, the party in the best position to place the proposed instruction in the record was Mr. Johnson. If we held that a record of the proposed instruction was necessary to conclude that a party invited the erroneous instruction, defendants would have a perverse incentive to keep proposed instructions out of the record in order to avoid the invited error doctrine on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    <em>\n     Lincoln Prop.
