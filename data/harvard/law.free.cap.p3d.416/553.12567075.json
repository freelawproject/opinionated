The legislature responded to this decision by enacting the Public Waters Access Act. UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-29-101\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . That Act cuts back on the easement right recognized in\n   <em>\n    Conatser\n   </em>\n   . It provides for public access rights for recreational use of public water that is \"navigable water\" or water \"on public property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201720\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/194/897/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-29-201(1). In addition, the statute also recognizes access rights to public water on private property \"with the private property owner's permission\" and \"a public right to float on public water that has sufficient width, depth, and flow to allow free passage of the chosen vessel at the time of floating.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201720\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/194/897/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 73-29-201(2) &amp; 73-29-202(1). This latter right includes the right to \"incidentally touch private property as required for safe passage and continued movement,\" the right of \"portage\" around certain obstructions in the water, and the right to \"fish while floating.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201720\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/194/897/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-29-202(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case presents questions concerning the interpretation and application of the Act. The plaintiff is Utah Stream Access Coalition (USAC). USAC filed this suit seeking a declaration that a one-mile stretch of the Weber River is \"navigable water\" to which the public has a statutory right of recreational use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The district court ruled in USAC's favor. It found that the one-mile stretch of the Weber River was \"navigable water.\" And it accordingly held that USAC had a right of access to the waters in question. We affirm. We hold that the Act invokes a legal term of art embedded in federal law. And we uphold the district court's conclusion that the stretch of the Weber River in question qualifies as \"navigable\" under this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2011, USAC filed this lawsuit against Orange Street and other property owners along a one-mile stretch of the Weber River. USAC initially named the Summit County Sherriff, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, and the Division of Parks and Recreation as additional defendants. But the parties agreed to substitute the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands (the State) for these parties. And throughout the litigation, the State took a mostly neutral stance; it did not take a formal position on the questions presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 USAC asserted that the disputed section of the Weber River is navigable water. And it sought declaratory relief confirming its right to use the river for recreation and an injunction barring property owners and state officials from interfering with its members' recreational use rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 During the litigation, the State raised a concern about the scope of the issues before the district court-specifically the title implications of the litigation for property owners along the Weber River. In response to these and other concerns, USAC explained that it sought only recreational use rights for its members and not a title determination. Ultimately, USAC's trial brief clarified that it rooted its right of access in the Public Waters Access Act, which in its view implicated a navigability standard imported from federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The district court held a four-day bench trial in February 2015. At trial the\n   court heard extensive testimony on historical commercial uses of the Weber River. The evidence included testimony and documentation of log drives on the one-mile segment of the river at issue in the case. After trial the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. It concluded that the disputed section of the river was navigable under the \"navigability for title\" standard set forth in federal \"equal footing\" law. The district court accepted the testimony of USAC's expert showing regular commercial use of the Weber River leading up to Utah's statehood. These commercial uses included transportation of railroad ties, delivery of mining timber, and floating of logs to sawmills. The district court determined, moreover, that the Weber River was essential to this commerce, as overland transportation of timber was not economically viable. And it issued an injunction preventing landowners and state officers from interfering with the recreational use rights of the public on this stretch of the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The district court also quieted title to the streambed under the one-mile stretch of the Weber River, holding that the State held title in the streambed. But USAC did not assert a quiet title claim-and it even disavowed any interest in pursuing a title determination during the litigation. And all parties on appeal acknowledge that the quiet title decision was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 We accordingly reverse the district court on this point-vacating the decision to quiet title to the streambed. And because we reverse on the ground that a quiet title claim was not properly presented to the district court, we do not reach the question whether USAC would have standing to seek a title determination in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 In so doing we do not take a position on who holds title to the streambed in question, or even on the question whether the State would be precluded from challenging the navigability determination here in any future case in which a title dispute may arise. Thus, we are not holding that Orange Street \"still hold[s] title to the land in name only.\"\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Nor are we deciding that the navigability decision we affirm here is based on \"a 'third category of water courses' \" distinct from those discussed herein.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. We are simply holding that it was error to award a remedy (a declaration and order expressly quieting title in the State) in the absence of a specific request therefor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 If and when there is a title dispute over the streambed in question, it may well be that the State will be precluded from challenging the navigability determination in this case. But that will depend on the application of the law of claim preclusion or collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties have not briefed that question here so it would be premature for us to resolve it. And it was likewise premature for the district court to order a remedy that no party had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Public Waters Access Act states that \"[t]he public may use a public water for recreational activity if\" it \"is a navigable water.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-29-201(1)(a)(i). And the Act defines navigable water as \"a water course that in its natural state without the aid of artificial means is useful for commerce and has a useful capacity as a public highway of transportation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201720\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/194/897/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-29-102(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Orange Street challenges the district court's application of these provisions on two grounds. First it challenges the legal standard employed by the district court. It notes that the statute includes its own definition of \"navigable water\" and claims that the statutory definition differs from the (federal) standard applied by the district court. Second, Orange Street challenges the district court's application of the navigability standard to the facts of this case. It contends that the district court erred in its determination of the navigability of the Weber River even assuming the correctness of the legal standard applied below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Orange Street concedes that it failed to preserve its challenge to the legal standard applied by the district court. With that in mind, Orange Street's first argument is rightly framed in \"plain error\" terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n    2007 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n    154 P.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we consider the legal standard applied by the district court under a plain error standard of review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And we find a lack of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 We also affirm the district court's finding of navigability. The district court's findings of fact, of course, are reviewed deferentially for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Baby B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256060\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/382/\">\n    2012 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256060\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/382/\">\n    308 P.3d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The standard of review for the mixed determination of navigability under the facts of this case is less clear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-44 (noting that the standard of review of mixed determinations \"is sometimes deferential and sometimes not,\" depending on \"the nature of the issue and the marginal costs and benefits of a less deferential, more heavy-handed appellate touch\"). But we think that finding should be given some deference too, given the fact-intensive nature of the question of navigability. Again, however, we agree with the district court's analysis, and find that the evidence in the record supports the determination that the stretch of the Weber River in question is navigable under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 We agree with Orange Street's threshold point: the question of \"navigability\" under the Public Waters Access Act is decidedly a question of state law. The Act includes a statutory definition of navigability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-29-102(4) (defining \"navigable waters\"). And it is that standard that governs the statutory question of navigability under Utah law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 We also agree that the district court looked to the federal \"navigability for title\" standard in its analysis. It cited federal cases in articulating the operative standard of navigability in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n    77 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n    10 Wall. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n    19 L.Ed. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1870),\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute as stated in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapanos v.

Montana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    565 U.S. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 592,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 That said, we think the district court's reliance on federal cases was harmless error. We affirm the district court's legal standard because we find the statutory standard set forth in the Act to essentially mirror or incorporate the federal standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 The statute speaks of a \"water course\" that \"is\n   <em>\n    useful for commerce\n   </em>\n   and has a useful capacity as a\n   <em>\n    public highway of transportation\n   </em>\n   .\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-29-102(4) (emphases added). The federal standard is substantially equivalent. It speaks of waters that \"are used, or ... susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as\n   <em>\n    highways for commerce\n   </em>\n   , over which\n   <em>\n    trade and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    travel are or may be conducted\n   </em>\n   in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n    77 U.S. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 The parallelism in terminology is striking. Both the state and federal standards define a concept of \"navigability.\" The key operative terms of both standards, moreover, are identical. Both speak of waters used as \"highways.\" And both refer to those \"highways\" being used for conducting \"commerce.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 The legislature's adoption of longstanding federal terminology is decisive. A \"cardinal rule of statutory construction\" says that a legislature's use of an established legal term of art incorporates \"the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken.\"\n   <em>\n    FAA v. Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p292\">\n    566 U.S. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p292\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p292\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And that rule is properly invoked here. The striking parallelism between the statutory definition and the federal standard is an indication that our legislature was adopting the \"cluster of ideas\" in federal law. We interpret the Public Waters Access Act to incorporate the federal standard of navigability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 Orange Street identifies a purported difference in the terminology of the state and federal standards. It notes that the Utah statute speaks in the present tense-of a water course that \"\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   useful for commerce and\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   a useful capacity as a public highway of transportation.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-29-102(4) (emphases added). And it claims that the Utah standard is accordingly distinct from the federal standard in at least this respect-in that the federal \"navigability for title\" standard is backward-looking, assessing use of waters as a \"highway\" for \"commerce\" as of the date of statehood (the relevant date under the equal footing doctrine).\n   <em>\n    PPL Mont.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    565 U.S. at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 But this is a distinction without a difference. The statute uses the same verb tense as the federal cases. The\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   case, as quoted above, uses present tense verbs. It speaks of waterways that \"\n   <em>\n    are used\n   </em>\n   \"-or even are \"susceptible of being used\"-as \"highways for commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n    77 U.S. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And it likewise frames the analysis of the use of such \"highways\" for \"trade and travel\" in the present tense-speaking of highways \"over which trade and travel\n   <em>\n    are or may be conducted\n   </em>\n   in the customary modes of trade and travel on water.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In context, however, the timeframe of the inquiry into use of waterways as highways for commerce is understood as backward-looking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PPL Mont.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    565 U.S. at 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186988\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/576/#p592\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the present verb tense of the\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   formulation has always been understood, with that gloss, as backward-looking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 24 The verb-tense problem in this field stems from a distinction between the \"navigability\" question presented in\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   and that at issue in cases involving \"navigability for title.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   concerned the scope of Congress's power over \"commerce,\" which has long been understood to extend to the regulation of \" 'all navigable waters of the United States.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/#p577\">\n    77 U.S. at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gilman v.

It credited evidence of regular log drives to supply the railroad, transportation of mining timbers, and the delivery of logs to sawmills at the relevant time of statehood. It also found that this commercial activity could not feasibly have taken place but for the Weber River, as there were no commercially viable overland means of transporting the timber from the forest to its destination.

It is also true that the U.S. Supreme Court decisions upholding the navigability of a waterway have cited evidence of both commercial use and passenger travel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But that does not render such dual evidence necessary. And we find no such requirement in the operative legal standard. The essential\n   test, again, is commercial utility. So long as a given waterway is generally and commonly useful to a purpose of trade or agriculture it may qualify as navigable.

The evidence showed that the Weber River was used-not irregularly during rare periods of high water-but regularly and commonly for commercially viable log drives. And again that is sufficient. Where the \"navigable quality of a water course ... continue[s] long enough to be useful and valuable in transportation; and the fluctuations ... come regularly with the seasons, so that the period of navigability may be depended upon,\" the water course will satisfy the navigability test even if navigable conditions are not continuous.\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8869075\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/111/1/\">\n    175 P.2d at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   That standard was satisfied by the evidence in the record here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 35 We affirm on that basis.

However, the quiet title decision is not a separate remedy, but an inescapable legal corollary to a court determination that a waterway was navigable at the time of statehood under the federal navigability-for-title test. A corollary \"requir[es] no additional proof following upon one just demonstrated.\"\n   <em>\n    Corollary\n   </em>\n   , WEBSTER'S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1949).

In a case such as this, we merely determine whether the waterway was navigable at statehood. At that point, we necessarily recognize that the State has held title to that land since 1896.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mont.Coal. for Stream Access, Inc. v.

No stipulation by the parties can overcome the inevitable result that the State holds title to the land. Even if we remove the portion of the district court's judgment that quiets title in the State, the State still holds title whether this court recognizes it or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 43 Even the State acknowledges this outcome. In its brief, the State \"concedes the obvious title implications of the district court's navigability finding, and does not intend to ignore those implications.\" Despite this concession, the State argues that it was inappropriate for the district court to state the obvious and inescapable outcome of such a claim and hold that the State holds title to the lands at issue. It asserts that for a court to quiet title, the State must request as much. This raises some significant and troubling issues. The State is essentially arguing that it enjoys all the benefits of owning the land, as the navigability finding so obviously implies, but that it doesn't want to actually\n   hold title to the land until it decides to bring a quiet title action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 44 I would hold that the State cannot have its cake and eat it too. First, the State cannot, over one-hundred and twenty years after it acquired title under the United States Constitution, decide it does not want title, or does not want its title to be recognized at this time. \"[T]he State's title to the riverbed vests absolutely as of the time of its admission and is not subject to later defeasance ....\"\n   <em>\n    Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/363/#p370\">\n    429 U.S. at 370-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/363/#p370\">\n    97 S.Ct. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the State has already accepted title to the lands under navigable waterways when it adopted the Utah Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CONST. art. XX, \u00a7 1 (\"All lands of the State ... that may otherwise be acquired, are hereby accepted.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under the majority's opinion, Orange Street does not enjoy the rights accorded to private property owners under the Public Waters Access Act. Without title to the State being acknowledged and formally declared, Orange Street would for some purposes still hold title to the land in name only, but not in fact. Orange Street may very well be liable to pay property taxes on that land. This removes at least one incentive for the State to bring a quiet title action. If the State, and its subdivisions, can continue to receive property taxes on the land yet enjoy many of the benefits of public ownership, it may decide to never bring a quiet title action. Then we could have the odd case where the landowner sues the State to force the State to take title to the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 46 Additionally, the majority's analysis recognizes that a navigability-for-title claim is a quiet title claim. The majority opinion includes excellent and detailed analysis on why the Public Waters Access Act incorporates the federal navigability-for-title test in its definition of navigability. It concludes its analysis by stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The [Public Water Access Act] contemplates two categories of water courses-those that traverse public property and those that traverse private property. ... Orange Street's [interpretation of the Act] contemplates a new third category of water courses. To accept its view we would have to interpret the statute to establish public use rights for a subset of water courses that traverse private property but are open to recreation without a showing of adverse possession. We find no room in the language or structure of the statute to support this approach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 (footnotes omitted). I agree wholeheartedly with this statement. When we interpret the Public Waters Access Act to incorporate the federal navigability-for-title test, we are essentially saying that there are only two categories of land over which natural water runs: public land and private land. The public, under the Act, has the right to use the public land under public water, but can only use the private land under public water if the use is incidental to the public's floating rights or the public proves some sort of public easement or adverse possession under Utah Code section 73-29-203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 47 The majority's opinion rejects Orange Street's attempt to create a third category of water courses, holding that it does not comport with the \"language or structure of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. The majority recognizes that \"[t]he statute contemplates two categories of water courses-those that traverse public property and those that traverse private property.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. But then, just paragraphs after denouncing such an approach, the majority goes on to create a \"third category of water courses\": those that are navigable, but not public property.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Without quieting title to the land in the State, the majority still holds that the public has almost unrestricted rights to use that land, but that the State does not have title. This discrepancy will create confusion as to how such a case should be litigated. According to the majority, the public only has use rights on public land. Thus, its opinion essentially forces private parties to prove that the State holds title to the lands underneath navigable waterways. Yet, the majority then\n   goes on to say that the district court erred by quieting title in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 48 I agree with the State that we cannot \"ignore\" the \"obvious title implications\" that arise when we hold that a body of water is navigable under the federal navigability-for-title test. Because a claim that a river is navigable under the federal navigability-for-title test is necessarily a claim to quiet title, I would address whether private parties have standing to bring such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   II. PRIVATE PARTIES HAVE STANDING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 49 The majority avoids the question of whether a private party has standing to bring a claim that the State has title to the lands underlying navigable waters.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Because I see a claim for navigability-for-title as being identical to a claim for quiet title, I would reach that issue and hold that Utah citizens, in some circumstances, do have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 50 Traditional standing exists when a person has suffered a \"distinct and palpable injury\" that gives it a \"personal stake\" in the outcome of litigation.\n   <em>\n    Utah Chapter of Sierra Club v.

Thus, once USAC establishes that the one-mile section of the Weber River is navigable, its members gain an equitable property interest in the lands underneath those waters. Additionally, its members were injured by the defendants' actions in restricting access to those waters. USAC's members frequently fished and waded through the stretch of the river at issue here. Once the Public Waters Access Act was passed, Orange Street and other defendants posted no trespassing signs, cutting off USAC's members' rights to wade in the river. A decree that the State owns the beds of those waters, and thereby holds them in trust for the people, would grant access to USAC and its members, thereby remedying their particularized harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-29-201 (granting access rights on waters that cross \"public property\" or that are \"navigable water\").

The right to a declaration quieting title in the State does not necessarily follow from our disposition of this case; this is no mere logical corollary-a simple \"deduction\" requiring \"no additional proof.\"\n    <em>\n     Infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 41.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    A decision on the availability of this remedy may require more than a mere showing of the logical equivalence of the \"navigability\" question at issue here and that necessary for quieting title. A key question, for example, is whether the State is bound by the navigability determination made here under the law of issue preclusion. And because the parties stipulated that they were not seeking a quiet title determination and the State was at least arguably not a party to the proceedings, we conclude that it was error for the court to make a quiet title determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    In so concluding we are not saying that Orange Street still holds title,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 45, or that the navigability decision we affirm here is insufficient to establish title,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 47. We are simply holding that it was error to award a remedy in the absence of a specific request therefor.
