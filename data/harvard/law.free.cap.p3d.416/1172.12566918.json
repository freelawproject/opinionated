Because such a land use\n   decision is a site-specific rezone and is therefore reviewable under LUPA, we reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals to proceed on the merits of the city's appeal of the superior court's decision\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for other proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2009, the city of Puyallup (City) created the \"Shaw-East Pioneer Overlay Zone\" (SPO zone) as part of an amendment to the City's comprehensive plan. An overlay zone, such as the SPO zone, establishes development criteria and standards to supplement the base zoning standards that already exist. The Shaw Road and East Pioneer area is considered to be a symbolic \"gateway\" to the City, and in creating the SPO zone, the City intended to establish additional standards to encourage compatible development in that area. When the SPO zone was adopted, the property at issue here was outside the boundaries of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2012, the City annexed the property at issue, which was zoned for industrial and business park use. It also annexed several nearby commercially zoned properties. The City did not extend the SPO zone into the area at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2013, Schnitzer West LLC entered into a contract to purchase the property at issue with plans for development. Schnitzer submitted a comprehensive plan amendment and rezone request to the City to convert a portion of the property from a business/industrial park zone to a light manufacturing/warehouse zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Over the verbal objection of at least one council member, the City approved Schnitzer's comprehensive plan amendment and rezone request (Ordinance 3052) by a vote of four to two, finding that the necessary criteria for redesignation and rezoning was met. The City also found that if the comprehensive plan amendment and rezone request were denied, industrial development on the property would not be economically viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The new zoning designation allowed warehouse construction on the property and brought the property into conformity with the zoning designations of adjacent parcels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Soon after Schnitzer received approval of its comprehensive plan amendment and rezone request, two new city council members were elected, each replacing a council member who had voted in favor of granting Schnitzer's comprehensive plan amendment and rezone request. The city council immediately proposed and adopted a 120-day emergency development moratorium on all development in the annexed area, including the Schnitzer property. After the moratorium was proposed but before it was adopted, Schnitzer filed an application to construct a 470,000 square foot warehouse on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Without consulting the rest of the council, four council members then drafted and proposed Ordinance 3067. This new ordinance extended the SPO zone to the Schnitzer property. The three council members who had been omitted from the drafting process opposed Ordinance 3067 and the proceedings that surrounded it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Mayor John Knutsen voiced his dismay with the ordinance itself, saying, \"This is-I can't see this as anything but spot-zoning. If-if it's not, then I can't say where spot-zoning exists.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 647. Council member Tom Swanson shared the concern that the ordinance constituted spot-zoning, saying, \"I would prefer looking at doing it citywide, if that's something, which means it\n   would go back to planning commission at this time, versus attaching it to one particular three-parcel zone and one overlay.\" CP at 643. He continued, \"So that's-I mean, I don't like spot-zoning. I don't like targeting one property owner for different zoning than everybody else has. If we're going to do a Shaw Road overlay, you do it to the whole area.\" CP at 644.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Council member Steve Vermillion was disconcerted with the way Ordinance 3067 had been drafted and proposed, stating that he was \"not impressed with the fact that four people moved this forward and three Council members were left in the dark on it.\" CP at 642. He continued, suggesting that \"the City manager and the City attorney need to put a halt to this four-member control and bringing forward documents without the consent of the whole Council.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mayor Knutsen was similarly concerned with the way the ordinance had been drafted and proposed: \"I'm deeply concerned if-if-if, indeed, four Council members instructed you to bring up an ordinance, that's to be done here. It's to be done here and only here.\" CP at 647. He continued, saying that he was \"stunned\" when he saw the ordinance and called Vermillion and Swanson: \"They were totally unaware of this. So if we're to be a four-member Council, then let's-you know, then let's not expect things to go as smoothly as we would wish.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The city council voted four to three to hold a special meeting at which council members would vote on Ordinance 3067. CP at 656. Mayor Knutsen and council members Vermillion and Swanson voted against the special meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 At the special meeting, against the recommendation of the planning commission, without public comment or\n   hearing, and with only four out of seven council members present,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the city council approved Ordinance 3067.\n   \u00b6 13 Ordinance 3067 applied solely to the Schnitzer property. The city council did not extend the ordinance to the surrounding properties to which the moratorium had applied, despite similar characteristics, location, and zoning. Through Ordinance 3067, the City imposed major restrictions on the Schnitzer property: the Ordinance created and applied a new overlay zone for \"limited manufacturing\" (ML-SPO) uses to the Schnitzer property and added a building size limitation of 125,000 square feet. It also imposed regulations pertaining to outdoor storage uses; standards governing the design, size, setback, and orientation of buildings; requirements dictating landscaping, open space usage, and pedestrian infrastructure; provisions constraining signage; and rules for storm water management.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    When this case was before the Court of Appeals, the underlying ownership interest in the property was transferred to Puyallup 5th Avenue LLC which subsequently transferred ownership to Viking JV LLC. The City moved to dismiss on the ground that Schnitzer lacked standing. Schnitzer claims to have a continuing contingent interest in the property. We deny without prejudice the City's motion to dismiss. The City may raise again the issue of standing on remand to the Court of Appeals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    After voting against holding a special meeting to vote on the passage of Ordinance 3067, Knutsen, Vermillion, and Swanson sent letters explaining their absences from the special meetings. These letters stated in part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    \"As for the special meeting, after ten-plus years, I see no reason why this item could not have been put on the next Council meeting's agenda so we could all attend it. ...\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    \"I am dismayed that four Council members opted to not allow citizen comments, which apparently has been implemented to eliminate dissent. ...\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    \"...

The trial court ruled in favor of Schnitzer, denied the motion to dismiss, and held Ordinance 3067 invalid. On appeal, a majority of\n    the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and dismissed the action, holding that Ordinance 3067 was not a \"land use decision\" reviewable by the superior court under LUPA.

It applies\n    <em>\n     solely\n    </em>\n    to the Schnitzer property and imposes major restrictions. The City argues that Ordinance 3067 is not reviewable under LUPA because it was proposed by the city council and was not a ruling in response to an application by a third party. The City also argues that Ordinance 3067 is a legislative action expressly excluded from review under LUPA. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    I.

Ordinance 3067 applied a new zoning overlay to the Schnitzer property. The overlay changes the Schnitzer property's zoning classification from limited manufacturing to ML-SPO; imposes a building size limitation; restricts the design, size, setback, and orientation of buildings; imposes landscaping, open space, and pedestrian infrastructure requirements; and establishes regulations pertaining to outdoor storage uses, storm water management, and signage.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Feil,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4018419\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/172/367/#p380\">\n     172 Wash.2d 367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=259%20P.3d%20227\">\n     259 P.3d 227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (application of a recreational overlay district was a classification change of the tract to which it applied).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     D.

The City argues that a zoning decision cannot be a site-specific rezone unless it was initiated by a third-party application, and that the government \"does not apply for a permit to itself, nor does it apply for approval of its own action.\"\n    <em>\n     Schnitzer,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461581\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/196/434/#p444\">\n     196 Wash.

Accordingly, the City argues that Ordinance 3067 was not a site-specific\n    rezone because the ordinance was proposed by the City. We disagree: a government can approve its own actions, can apply for or initiate a request for its own approval, and can be a specific party for the purpose of a site-specific rezone classification.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00b6 28 First, the government is regularly characterized as approving its own actions. The Washington State Constitution contemplates government approval of its own actions by categorizing the governor's and the legislature's actions as \"approval\" prior to an act becoming law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Governmental approval for its own actions is also contemplated in the United States Constitution, which categorizes both the president's actions and Congress's actions as \"approv[al].\" U.S. CONST . art.

The standards governing relief under LUPA primarily focus on ensuring that a party impacted by a land use decision was treated fairly\n    <em>\n     by the decision-maker\n    </em>\n    , in process and in substance.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00b6 32 Limiting challenges exclusively to land use decisions proposed by nongovernmental parties would result in a framework under which the decision-maker's duties of fairness to an interested party change based upon the origin of the initial request.

The zoning overlay is a classification change, the Schnitzer property is a specific tract, and the city council is a specific party.

(dissenting)\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    \u00b6 46 The lead opinion ignores the statutory language in concluding that the city of Puyallup (City) qualifies as \"an applicant\" for a \"project permit\" for purposes of judicial review under the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), chapter 36.70C RCW. The statutory language does not support the lead opinion's conclusion, and the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \u00b6 47 The statutory language is fairly clear that a \"land use decision\" is a final determination of \"[a]n application for a project permit or other governmental approval.\" RCW 36.70C.020(2)(a). \"Project permit\" is then defined as a \"permit or license required\n    <em>\n     from\n    </em>\n    a local government for a project action.\" RCW 36.70B.020(4) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals correctly read these two statutes together to conclude that a land use decision reviewable under LUPA requires an application that the government responds to and then acts on.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    \u00b6 48 The lead opinion's reasoning that the City can qualify as an applicant for a project permit makes no logical or legal sense. Here, the City was not approving or ruling on an application. The Court of Appeals correctly noted that Schnitzer does not point to any \"application\" by the City to initiate expansion of the SPO (Shaw-East Pioneer Overlay) zone.\n    <em>\n     Schnitzer W., LLC v\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     City of Puyallup,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461581\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/196/434/#p444\">\n     196 Wash.

Schnitzer has filed a petition with the Growth Management Hearings Board (GMHB), which is stayed pending our review of this case, and is free to pursue that avenue of relief. In addition to review by the GMHB, a property owner can seek redress through a declaratory judgment or a writ process. The Court of Appeals' conclusion entails a straightforward analysis of the statutory language and should be affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Yu, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Madsen, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Fairhurst, C.J.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-104\">\n     Additionally, it is hard to imagine how the Ordinance \"targets\" Schnitzer when the City has conceded the Ordinance does not apply to Schnitzer.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
