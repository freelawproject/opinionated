A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AzJ\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his conviction by a jury for bookmaking. <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A :112-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>3). He asserts three grounds: (1) the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress; (2) the State failed to prove an act of bookmaking on the day alleged in the indictment; (3) the prosecutor\u2019s comments on summation were highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Evidence at the motion to suppress showed that police executed a search warrant which authorized a search of the person of Joseph Loiacono (a codefendant) and premises known as Lenny &amp; Joe\u2019s Barber Shop. Defendant was seated in a chair with a towel or nylon cloth about his shoulders when the raiding party entered the shop. During the ensuing search, a \u201ccomeback sheet\u201d (record of money owed on bets) was found in (ho inside pocket of a suit jacket later identified as defendant\u2019s which was hanging on the customers\" coat rack. The coat rack also held defendant\u2019s overcoat. a barber\u2019s jacket and three hats. Two barbers and a shoeshine man were present in the shop. Defendant was the only customer at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The trial judge found that no members of the raiding party knew the. jacket in which the \u201ccomeback sheet\u201d was I'oimd was defendant\u2019s until after it had been searched \u2014\u2022 and that such lack of knowledge was reasonable under the circumstances. We find sufficient credible evidence in the record to support those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the State\u2019s proof and the judge\u2019s charge io the jury with respect to the lack of proof of an affirmative act of bookmaking on the date of his arrest. The slip of paper in defendant\u2019s jacket pocket contained a record of bets placed during the week of February 15, 1970 and, on the reverse side, a record of money owed or still to be paid. The State\u2019s expert witness testified that because defendant had not destroyed the paper, it was likely money was still owing March 5, 1970, the date of the bookmaking alleged in the indictment. The trial judge charged the jury that some current activity either actual or anticipated had to be proven, and that if defendant had taken bets in the past and if that money was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>owing on March 5th and, if further, defendant had intention to collect that money March 5th, the jury could find him guilty of bookmaking. These instructions were proper. He did not inform the jury as defendant contends, that mere possession of the \u201ccomeback sheet\u201d was enough to support a conviction. Bookmaking is an operation which involves both the placing of bets and the paying off (or collection of) bets.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Defendant\u2019s final argument involves the following portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation which he claims to have been prejudically improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">Incidentally, you had an opportunity during the trial to observe Daniel Gould and Joseph Loiaeono. From your common experiences as mature adults evaluate your observations. Look at Mr. Gould. How does he impress you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Eollowing defense counsel\u2019s objection, the prosecutor continued :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">* * * observe Daniel Gould. Observe Joseph Loiaeono. Compare the two. Observe the demeanors. How does Mr. Gould impress you? Common experience as mature adults \u2014 bookmaker?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Again there was a vigorous objection from defense counsel, followed by the trial judge\u2019s observations that \u201cthe jury may observe demeanor * <em>* </em>after which the prosecutor stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">I-Iis <em>demeanor alone </em>can\u2019t convict him. <em>It is only one other indicia, when added to SS in evidence, </em>gives you a conclusion to draw Daniel Gould is a bookmaker. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">These remarks of the prosecutor were clearly improper and legally erroneous. We find no support for them in <em>State v. </em>Conyers, 58 <em>N. J. </em>123 (1971), which the State cites as authority for their propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\"> Jurors are expected to use their common sense and experiences in evaluating evidence and arriving at a verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>This process invariably requires a resolution of where the truth lies. Trial judges usually instruct jurors, as the trial judge did below, that they should observe the demeanor of all witnesses <em>who testify </em>as an aid in determining whether a specific witness testified truthfully. Here defendant chose not to testify as was his constitutional right. Despite this, and despite the fact that defendant\u2019s conduct during the trial was proper, the prosecutor sought to have the jurors take into account his physical characteristics as an evidentiary fact of guilt. Demeanor becomes an issue for a jury only if a witness takes the stand and testifies before the jury, and may be used by the jurors as one of the tools to test the witness\u2019 credibility. There is no known principle of law which permits jurors to judge innocence or guilt in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Whether improper comment by a prosecutor during summation necessarily calls for a reversal requires a consideration of whether trial counsel made timely objection and the action of the trial judge in response thereto. <em>State v. Vaszorich, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>99, 119 (1953). Here, proper objection was made but the trial judge ignored it, erroneously observing that the jurors could \u201cobserve demeanor.\u201d In addition, no corrective instruction was included in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The remarks clearly were drawn from outside the evidence adduced at trial and any reasonable inference that could have been drawn from such evidence. See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>489, 511 (1960) ; <em>State v. Mayberry, 52 N. J. </em>413, 437 (1968). We find the remarks of the prosecutor to have been appeals to the prejudices of the jurors, <em>State v. Bogen, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>137, 140 (1953), and therefore so grossly unfair and prejudicial as to have deprived defendant of a fair trial. <em>Cf. Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. </em>78, <em>55 S. </em>Ct. 629, 79 <em>L. Ed. </em>1314 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
