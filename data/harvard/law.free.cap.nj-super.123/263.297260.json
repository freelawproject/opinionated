Kugler, Jr., </em>Attorney General, filed a Statement in lieu of Brief on behalf of respondent Board of Keview <em>(Mr. I. Leo Moiiuk, </em>Deputy Attorney General, of counsel; <em>Miss Mary Ann Burgess, </em>Deputy Attorney General, on the brief).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b287-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AQK\">Appellant worked for almost 21 months as a sales (registered) representative of respondent Pressman, Frohlich &amp; Frost, Inc., a broker engaged in the selling of stock, mutual funds and shares in oil ventures. On October 24, 1969 she was laid off because of lack of work. On October 30, 1969 she applied for unemployment compensation benefits and thereafter for 26 weeks received benefits totalling $1,690.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">On September 22, 1971 appellant was notified by the Division of Employment Security that she had not been entitled to benefits and that her employer had \u201cerroneously reported [her] commissions as wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">On appellant\u2019s appeal to the Appeal Tribunal the administrative agency found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">The employer for whom the claimant performed services during the base year of the claim was a broker engaged in the selling of stock, mutual funds and shares in oil ventures. The claimant received no salary. Her remuneration was based on the income that she produced as an agent for the employer. She received commissions based on a percentage of this income as compensation for her services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">The claimant performed no services for any other employer during the base year of her claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>After referring to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :21\u201419 (i) (7), which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">[T]he term \u201cemployment\u201d shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">* * * *&gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzG\">(J) Service performed by agents of mutual fund brokers or dealers in the sale of mutual funds or other securities *\u2019 * * if the compensation to such agents for such services is wholly on a commission basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">the Appeal Tribunal concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">Since the claimant\u2019s earnings were derived wholly from services -performed as an agent on a commission basis, they are not earnings in employment and hence cannot be used in the computation of the weekly benefit amount or the maximum benefit amount of this claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">5k* 5\u00a1: sk # 5\u00a1S * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">Since the claimant did not have 17 base weeks, or in the alternative, not earn $1,350.00 in employment during the base year, she did not meet the * * * provisions of the statute. The claim dated October 30, 1969 is invalid and the claimant is ineligible for unemployment benefits thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">Because the claim is invalid, the claimant is liable to repay the sum of $1,690 received as benefits for the 26 week period from October 30, 1969 through April 29, 1970.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The appeal before us is from the decision of the Board of Review which, on claimant\u2019s appeal, had affirmed the decision of the Appeal Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">We are satisfied from our review of the record that the evidence supports the findings of the administrative agencies and their conclusion that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :21\u201419 (i) (7) (J) precludes the recognition of the commissions earned by appellant as \u201cearnings in employment.\u201d Plaintiff was therefore not eligible for benefits, see <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43 :21-4, 43:21-19(c) and (t), and despite her conceded good faith in applying for the benefits she received, she is obligated to refund them. The Division is not estopped from demanding the refund. The statute authorizes it to proceed to recover benefits improperly paid at any time within four years after the benefits in question were paid. <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43 :21-16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Appellant\u2019s obligation to refund is not affected by the fact her employer reported her commissions as wages and deducted from her \u201cwages\u201d and transmitted to the Division the \u201cworker\u2019s\u201d contributions provided for by <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43 :21-7(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The record before us does not disclose the total amount of employee\u2019s contributions so transmitted out of appellant\u2019s \u201cwages.\u201d However, appellant would appear to be equitably entitled to a credit, against the $1,690 she is required to refund, in an amount equal to the total amount of her \u201ccontributions,\u201d subject however to the limitations set forth in <em>N. </em>-7. <em>8. A. </em>43 :21-14(f) which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">If not later than 2 years after the calendar year in which any moneys were erroneously paid to, or collected by the division, whether such payments were voluntarily or involuntarily made or made under mistake of law or of fact, an employer, employing unit, or employee who has paid such moneys shall make application for an adjustment thereof, the said moneys shall, upon order of the director, be either credited or refunded, without interest, from the appropriate fund. For like cause and within the same period, credit or refund may be so made on the initiative of the director.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Since more than two years have elapsed since appellant\u2019s \u201ccontributions\u201d were made, she could not now successfully prosecute an independent application for refund or credit of the contributions erroneously made. <em>Cf. Lazar v. Board of Review, </em>77 <em>N. J. Super. </em>251, 261 (App. Div. 1962). Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the last sentence of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:21-14(f), quoted above, mandated that when the Director decided, on September 22, 1971, that appellant\u2019s employer had erroneously reported appellant\u2019s commissions as salary \u2014\u2022 thus obligating her to refund the benefits she had received \u2014 that he, at the same time, on his own \u201cinitiative,\u201d proceed to credit appellant with such of her contributions as were made within the two-year period referred to in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>43:2J~14(f) which preceded September 22, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The cause is remanded to the Board of Review with directions that the credit for contributions paid by mistake, to which appellant is so entitled, be determined and that the total of such credits be applied against the $1,690 which she is otherwise obligated to refund. As so modified, the decision of the Board of Review is affirmed. No costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
