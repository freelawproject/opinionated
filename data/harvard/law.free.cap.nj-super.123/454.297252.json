A careful comparison of the sentence with the bargain as disclosed in the plea transcript shows no breach. Indeed, defendant does not so contend but rather urges error on the grounds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">1. The sentence was excessive and unconstitutional because the court did not particpiate in the bargaining, thereby depriving defendant of effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">2. A Supreme Court directive excluding court participation in the bargain is unconstitutional and in this instance, prejudicial to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">3. <em>N. J. S. </em>2A :112-3 is unconstitutional since it discriminates against bookmakers as a class in that they are exposed to a five-year maximum prison term and a fine of up to 85,000. while all other classes of misdemeanants can receive up to three years imprisonment and a $1,000. fine under <em>W. J. S. </em>2A:85-7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Defendant\u2019s net custodial sentences ran concurrently for three to five years with a $5,000 fine on two of the live counts to which he pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">As to defendant\u2019s contentions referrable to the absence of participation by the court in the bargaining procedure, there is clear authority mandating nonparticipation. <em>United States v. Gilligan, </em>256 <em>F. Supp. </em>244, 254 <em>(S. D. N. Y. </em>1966); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>314, 321 (1972); <em>State v. Taylor, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>440, 455 (1967); <em>State v. Poli, </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>374, 379 (App. Div. 1970). Moreover, we eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>elude the directive in question<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> merely iterates and implements these rulings for the benefit of trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>With respect to the sentence being excessive and an abuse of judicial discretion, we have examined this contention within the totality of all of the circumstances revealed by the record and find no clear showing of the same. <em>State v. Cox, </em>101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>470 (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 53 <em>N. J. </em>510 (1969); <em>State v. Provoid, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>547 (App. Div. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Finally, we likewise conclude that bookmakers suffer no discrimination of constitutional dimensions in the area of statutory limits on sentences when compared with other misdemeanants. <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N. J. </em>250 (1972); <em>State v. Smith, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>202 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-4\"> The text of the so-called \u201cdirective\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">MEMORANDUM TO: ASSIGNMENT JUDGES AND COUNTY PROSECUTORS</p>\n<p id=\"Aia\">RE: Pleas in Criminal Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">This is to advise you that the Supreme Court has approved the following general policy with regard to acceptance of plea procedures developed at the meeting of Assignment Judges and Prosecutors on December 11, 1970:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">1. The prosecutor and defense counsel may engage in discussions relating to pleas and sentences, but the judge shall take no part in such discussions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">2. Where the prosecutor and defense counsel reach an agreement as to the offense or offenses to which a defendant will plead on condition that other charges pending against the defendant will be dismissed, such agreement shall be placed on the record in open court at the time the plea is entered. If the plea is accepted by the judge in accordance with such agreement and subsequently the judge before whom a motion for dismissal of other charges is made pursuant to R. 3:25 in his discretion determines that the interest of justice would not be served by accepting such agreement, then and in that event the defendant shall be permitted to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">3. Where the prosecutor and defense counsel reach an agreement as to the sentence which the prosecutor will recommend, such agreement shall be placed on the record in open court at the time the plea is entered. If the plea is accepted by the judge and subsequently at the time of sentencing in accordance with R. 3 :21 the sentencing judge in his discretion determines that the interest of justice would not be served by accepting the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation made pursuant to such agreement, then and in that event the defendant shall be permitted to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">4. The foregoing does not authorize a departure from the holding in <em>State v. Reali, </em>26 <em>N. J. </em>222 (1958), that a plea of guilty shall be refused if a defendant insists on his innocence. Accordingly, the plea procedures prescribed by R. 3:9-2 shall continue to be observed and, notwithstanding the recent decision in <em>North Carolina v. Alford </em>[400 U. S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162], (decided November 23, 1970), except in capital cases, a plea shall not be accepted from a defendant who does not admit commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\">s/ Edward B.
