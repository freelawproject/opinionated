J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">Upon this reservation we are asked to construe the fifth, seventh and eighth paragraphs of the will of Benjamin G. Stanton. These paragraphs are set forth in full in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>was executed on November 24,1944. A codicil thereto, dated September 18, 1946, substituted the plaintiff for the executor named in the will and added two trustees but otherwise made no changes. The following facts have been stipulated: The testator died September 17,1948. He was the son of Avery A. and Laura C. Stanton. His only heirs at law were a brother, three sisters, two nieces and a nephew. Also surviving were eight nephews and nieces and numerous grandnephews and grandnieces who were not his heirs at law but were descendants of his father and mother. He left an estate appraised at $128,489.77.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">At the time he executed the will, the testator was a partner of the Clarence Ralph named in the fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>paragraph of the will. The partnership, started in 1934, did business under the name of Sterling Manufacturing Company in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Each partner had an equal interest. On January 6, 1947, the business was incorporated as the Sterling Manufacturing Company, Inc. The outstanding common stock of the corporation consisted of 476 shares, of which the testator and Ralph each owned 238. At the death of the testator the corporation was indebted to him in the amount of $15,200, as evidenced by notes. The business, both as a partnership and as a corporation, was always under the active management of Ralph and, other than by investing in it and by advancing money to it, the testator took no active part. Prom the time Ralph was thirteen years of age, in 1912, until he was twenty-four, and again for a period after Mrs. Stanton\u2019s death, he lived in the home of the testator. The testator regarded him as a son but had never legally adopted him. The Stanton homestead mentioned in the seventh paragraph of the will consists of a tract of about 270 acres with dwelling house, bams and other buildings thereon, located in Connecticut, partly in the town of Sterling and partly in the town of Plainfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The questions propounded are printed in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first three arise by reason of the fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>paragraph, of the will. They are improperly framed because question (a) contains two questions, i.e., whether Ralph is entitled to receive the shares of stock and whether he is entitled to receive the notes, and the answers to questions (b) and (c) are made dependent upon our answer to the double question propounded in (a). We will, however, answer the questions in a manner which will be adequate to guide the trial court in rendering judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">As to question (a), all the parties agree that the fifth paragraph is effective to bequeath to Ralph the testator\u2019s shares of stock in the Sterling Manufacturing Company, Inc. This necessarily excludes any consideration of a claim of ademption. See 57 Am. Jur. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>1091, \u00a7 1592. The substantial question is whether the paragraph also gives to him the notes evidencing the indebtedness of the corporation to the testator. The answer to this depends upon what the testator meant by the expression \u201call the interest that I may have ... in the Sterling Manufacturing Company.\u201d Here again all the interested parties concede that, although when the will was drawn the testator must have been referring to his interest in the partnership, we are, in construing the will, to treat this bequest as though it referred to his interest in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">A similar question was before us in <em>Riverside Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>89 Conn. 690, 96 A. 180. We held that a bequest of \u201call interest which I may have in\u201d a named corporation did not carry with it the indebtedness of the corporation to the testator, saying (p. 696): \u201c \u2018An interest in a company\u2019 is not appropriate language with which to describe all obligations against the company which the testator might have. In this connection it means the right of property or share which the testator had in this company. This was evidenced by his certificate or certificates for certain shares of the stock of the company. While he used the words \u2018interest\u2019 and \u2018shares,\u2019 he intended in the use of each word the same thing,\u2014to include his part or portion of the company.\u201d Ralph attempts to distinguish that case from the present on the ground that when the will before us was made the testator was obviously referring to an interest in a partnership and not a corporation. There is, however, no essential difference between a man\u2019s interest in a partnership and his interest in a corporation. His interest in a partnership, as in a corporation, is his interest in the net worth of the concern. It is his share of the capital and surplus. It does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>any indebtedness which the concern may owe him. It is his share of the assets of the concern over and above all of its indebtedness. This is the common meaning of \u201cinterest in a company,\u201d and there is nothing either in the context of the will now before us or the circumstances attendant upon its execution to indicate that the testator used the word interest in any other sense. The fifth paragraph of the will does not bequeath to Ralph the indebtedness of the company to the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Questions (b) and (c) may be considered together, and they will be answered on the basis of our conclusion that Ralph is entitled to the stock, even though we also concluded that he is not entitled to the notes. The gist of the questions is whether the conditions imposed upon the bequest violate the rule against perpetuities. These conditions are that Ralph \u201cshall pay to [the testator\u2019s] estate\u201d one-third of the net yearly income of the corporation and, upon its sale or liquidation, one-third of the sale price or the proceeds of liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The will bequeaths the interest in the company to Ralph \u201cto be his absolutely.\u201d It is a sound rule of construction that an express and positive devise or bequest in fee cannot be cut down to an inferior estate by a subsequent clause in the will unless that is equally express and positive. <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Main, </em>77 Conn. 94, 99, 58 A. 472; <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>101 Conn. 481, 486, 126 A. 699; <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Wehrhane, </em>125 Conn. 420, 426, 6 A.2d 313. In the paragraph of the will now under consideration, however, the testator has clearly expressed the intent of limiting to some extent the absolute estate in the stock given to Ralph by the imposition of so-called conditions upon his enjoyment of that estate. The only questions are just what the limitation is and whether it is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In view of the fact that the paragraph speaks of the bequest as being \u201cin consideration\u201d of Ralph\u2019s assuming an obligation, and in the light of all the attendant circumstances, it must be concluded that the testator did not intend'to impose conditions in the technical sense upon Ralph\u2019s ownership of the interest in the business. He did not intend that if Ralph failed to comply with the requirements imposed he should forfeit the bequest. This is evident from the phrasing of the paragraph, in that it neither provides for a forfeiture nor in terms imposes any burden or lien upon the interest itself but rather provides that \u201che [Ralph] shall pay to my estate. . . .\u201d The obligation to make the payments is one which is imposed on Ralph personally. See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Howarth, </em>59 Conn. 455, 468, 22 A. 432; <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>51 Conn. 207, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This interpretation is fortified if it is borne in mind that at the time the will was drawn the company was a partnership. It was an interest in a partnership which the testator thought he was bequeathing. The effect of the bequest might well have been believed by the testator to permit a continuance of the partnership after his own death. He probably believed, however, that the \u201ccompany\u201d would have to terminate not later than the time of Ralph\u2019s death. Either the business would have been sold before that time or it would have to be liquidated as of that time. Accordingly, when the testator required Ralph to make payments until the company should be sold or liquidated, he contemplated that either of those events would necessarily occur not later than the time of Ralph\u2019s death. The fact that the partnership has since been converted into a corporation should not alter the will of the testator concerning his interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The obligation which Ralph mil assume upon acceptance of the bequest is a personal obligation to pay to the testator\u2019s estate one-third of the net yearly income from the operation of the company. This obligation will continue until the corporation (or Ralph\u2019s stock therein) is sold or until the corporation is liquidated. If neither of these events has happened prior to Ralph\u2019s death, his death, for the purposes of the fifth paragraph of the will, should be treated as the liquidation of the company. It follows that the obligation to be assumed by Ralph must be fully fixed during his lifetime, and therefore the benefits created by the fifth paragraph in favor of the testator\u2019s residuary estate do not violate the rule against perpetuities. The so-called conditions imposed in the fifth paragraph of the will are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The remaining questions propounded relate to the seventh and eighth paragraphs of the will. They may all be resolved by a determination of the question whether the provisions of paragraph seventh violate either the rule against perpetuities or the rule against restraints on alienation. By that paragraph the testator left to trustees all of his residuary estate in trust to use the net income for the maintenance of the Stanton homestead, \u201cit being my desire that this property shall be kept in good condition as a memorial to my said father and mother and for the benefit of their descendants as long as there shall be any such descendants living.\u201d He also provided that the fund may be used for the aid of any poor and worthy descendant of his parents who may need assistance. By the eighth paragraph he directed that upon the death of the last descendant of his father and mother the trust should terminate and the fund remaining be paid over to two churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>It is elementary that a bequest will violate the rule against perpetuities and therefore be invalid unless it vests within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years and nine months thereafter. It is also well established that a restraint on alienation of property is invalid if it is attempted to be imposed for longer than the same period. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>House, </em>133 Conn. 725, 727, 54 A.2d 510. Neither rule applies to a charitable trust, but clearly paragraph seventh does not set up such a trust even though it provides for the relief of poor relatives and for the maintenance of the Stanton homestead. <em>Eliot\u2019s Appeal, </em>74 Conn. 586, 606, 51 A. 558; Restatement, 2 Trusts \u00a7 375; <em>Bartlett, Petitioner, </em>163 Mass. 509, 512, 40 N.E. 899; 3 Scott, Trusts, p. 2034.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In the case of a trust it is the time of the vesting of the beneficial interests which is determinative of the question whether the rule against perpetuities is violated, not the time of the vesting of title in the trustee. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Spooner, </em>75 Conn. 501, 505, 54 A. 305. Under the trust in question, it is the \u201cdescendants\u201d of the testator\u2019s father and mother who are the beneficiaries. Whether the beneficial interest is to vest in them within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter turns on the question what persons the testator meant when he used the word \u201cdescendants.\u201d Did he mean the descendants of his mother and father to all generations or did he mean the descendants of his mother and father who were living at the time the will became operative? If he meant the former, obviously the bequest would violate the rule. If he meant the latter, the bequest does not violate the rule because then the beneficial interest in the descendants as well as the remainder over to the churches would vest as of the date of the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>It is true that in common usage the word \u201cdescendants\u201d connotes more than immediate issue. It means issue to an infinite degree. <em>Pease </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>84 Conn. 391, 395, 80 A. 86. It is also true that ordinarily it is to be presumed that a testator has used such a word in its usual sense. <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>110 Conn. 117, 124, 147 A. 367. If, however, the context of the will or the circumstances attendant upon its execution indicate that such a word was used by the testator in a more restrictive sense, the will will be so construed. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>110 Conn. 150, 159, 147 A. 562; <em>Middletown Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Gaffey, </em>96 Conn. 61, 66, 112 A. 689; <em>Hoadley </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>89 Conn. 270, 277, 93 A. 535. Furthermore, \u201c[a] construction of a \u2022will which invalidates a bequest as an illegal perpetuity is to be avoided if the language used is fairly open to an interpretation which would make the gift valid.\u201d <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>140 Conn. 332, 355, 99 A.2d 224; <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. v. Alling, </em>125 Conn. 599, 601, 7 A.2d 833; <em>White </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>87 Conn. 663, 673, 89 A. 272; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Hatheway, </em>81 Conn. 181, 185, 70 A. 645; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Dann, </em>66 Conn. 401, 405, 34 A. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">It is extremely unlikely that the testator in the present case intended that the trust in question would continue in perpetuity. He certainly could not have contemplated that the dwelling house and other buildings located on the homestead would stand forever. Moreover, he did limit the corpus of the trust over to the churches upon the death of the last descendant. It was practically certain that descendants of his father and mother, if by that is meant descendants without restriction, would never die out. If, therefore, he used the term in that sense, it was foolish to provide that on the death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>last descendant the property should go to the churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On the other hand, there is every indication that his intention was to benefit only the descendants of his father and mother who would be alive at the time of his death. They were the people whom he knew and who were the natural objects of his bounty. It is of considerable significance that he directed that Ralph be treated as though he were one of the descendants. He did not include in that direction any of the descendants of Ralph. If he had intended that the issue of the living descendants of his parents were to be included as beneficiaries he would also have included the issue of Ralph. That he did not undertake to specify the living descendants by name is quite understandable in view of the fact that they were more than fifteen in number.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">On the whole, therefore, we conclude that by his use of the word \u201cdescendants\u201d the testator meant only the descendants of his parents who were living at the time the will became operative. See <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>140 Conn. 332, 355, 99 A.2d 224; <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Strouse, 57 </em>Conn. 147, 151, 17 A. 699. It follows that the beneficial interests under the trust vested at the time of the testator\u2019s death in the descendants of his father and mother who were living at that time and also in the churches. The bequest, therefore, did not violate the rule against perpetuities. Nor did it offend the rule against restraints on alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Question (a) is answered in the affirmative as to the shares of stock but in the negative as to the notes; the answer to questions (b) and (c) is that the conditions imposed are valid, not as conditions, but as obligations resting upon Ralph personally; the answer to each of questions (d), (e), (f) and (h) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cNo\u201d; the answer to question (g) is \u201cYes\u201d; it is not necessary to answer question (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">No costs in this court will he taxed in favor of any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> \u00abfifth.
