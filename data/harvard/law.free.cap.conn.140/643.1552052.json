The writ was returned to the Superior Court on the first Tuesday of April, 1947. The complaint sounded in nuisance. The plaintiff sought to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been inflicted upon him when he was struck by a fire hose coupling during the preceding April. On May 14, 1947, the defendant filed its answer, which incorporated two special defenses. A demurrer addressed to one of them was overruled, and on August 24,1949, the plaintiff filed his reply. There is nothing to explain why he faded to try his case within the almost four years which then followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The next matter appearing in sequence in the record is an order of court, under the caption \u201cPretrial memo and order\u201d and dated May 19,1953, stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ing the following: \u201cEnter non-suit . . . for not properly being prepared for pre-trial.\u201d On the same date, a judgment of nonsuit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was entered in compliance with the order. On May 29, 1953, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment and at the same time filed an assignment of errors which was subsequently amended on June 12, 1953. The assignment as thus amended raises many questions, but only two of them have been briefed. The others must be treated as abandoned. <em>Freund </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>131 Conn. 380, 386, 40 A.2d 754; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7165. The first question challenges the legality of the nonsuit. In other words, the plaintiff maintains that the court had no authority to enter the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In 1939, the judges of the Superior Court adopted a rule to establish procedure for what had come to be known as pretrial. The rule became effective on January 1, 1940, and has remained in unamended form. Practice Book \u00a7 144.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pretrial has been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>juridical development of modern times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clark, Code Pleading (2d Ed.) p. 572 et seq.; Vanderbilt, Minimum Standards of Judicial Administration, p. 206 et seq. It was devised largely as a frontal assault upon a docket which, in recent years, has become more and more overloaded with untried cases. The procedure has been subjected to criticism in the past, although, we add, the criticism appears to have been more audible than substantial. Section 144 cannot be validated, however, either by the desirability of its objective or by a show of hands, as in a popularity contest. Its validity must be determined on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">It is not necessary for us to determine whether the judges of the Superior Court, as members of an independent branch of government, had inherent power to set up rules to govern procedure in the judicial system. The General Assembly specifically empowered them to do so. General Statutes \u00a7 7655 (as amended, Cum. Sup. 1953, \u00a7 2361c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>held that the statutes now give the judges authority, if needed, to make rules not only to carry out the terms of the Practice Act but also to provide for other proceedings in the Superior Court. <em>In re Appeal of Dattilo, </em>136 Conn. 488, 492, 72 A.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The plaintiff does not challenge the power of the judges to adopt the rule in question, save in one particular. He maintains that, while they could properly set up steps for pretrial procedure and establish the scope of pretrial activities, they were, at the adoption of the rule, and still are, without authority to provide sanctions against a party who does not comply with its requirements. In other words, the plaintiff insists that a rule of court may provide for a nonsuit only if the nonsuit is specifically authorized by statute and that, since no authorization so far as \u00a7 144 is concerned is to be found in any legislative enactment, the sanction of a nonsuit incorporated in the rule is invalid. In taking this position, the plaintiff relies upon a statement, appearing in <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>98 Conn. 228, 232, 118 A. 826, that \u201c [o]ur statutes control the cases in which a nonsuit may be granted.\u201d We were there examining the word \u201cnonsuit\u201d in the context of a section of the chapter covering the subject of replevin. General Statutes, Rev. 1918, \u00a7 6104. We determined that the erasure or dismissal of a replevin action was not a nonsuit within \u00a7 6104, permitting a defendant, after nonsuit, to file an answer and counterclaim and to recover such damages as he may have sustained, together with a judgment for the return of the property. <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Birch, </em>supra, 230. The statement referred to must be read in the light of the matter then under discussion. It is not applicable to the case at bar, which deals with the power of the judges to adopt the rule as written. It is hardly reasonable to believe that, if a legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>grant of power was at all necessary, the General Assembly would have given the judges of the Superior Court the rule-making power found in \u00a7 7655 while withholding from them the power to enforce the rules adopted. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Newark Fire Ins. Co., </em>59 Conn. 41, 45, 22 A. 32; 3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d Ed.) p. 1110, H16.07 and n.7. But whether the legislature intended to grant or to withhold such power is of no moment, since the court has inherent power to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions to compel the observance of its rules. Implicit in the assignment of a ease for pretrial is an order that each party, through counsel, shall appear before the court prepared to accomplish, so far as possible, the various purposes of the hearing set forth in detail in \u00a7 144. If he comes unprepared, he fails to comply with an order of the court, and such a failure is always ground for a nonsuit or default. The provision in \u00a7 144 of the Practice Book authorizing the entry of a nonsuit is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"A-We\">The second claim raised by the plaintiff through his assignment of errors is that, even if he concedes the power of the court to enter judgment of nonsuit under the rule, the court, in exercising that power upon the facts of this ease, abused its discretion. Whether this claim has any merit cannot be determined upon the record before us. The nonsuit ordered by the court was not one entered on the trial of a ease. It was not within the category of non-suits referred to in \u00a7\u00a7 7977 and 7978 of the General Statutes. See Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc., \u00a7 7. It was not one, therefore, the propriety of which can be determined on the transcript of the evidence taken on the trial as provided for in \u00a7 415 of the Practice Book. Rather was it the result of a ruling made by the court upon conclusions of fact as to the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>nnpreparedness. A ruling thus made cannot be considered by us in the absence of a finding of the facts surrounding the ruling. <em>Munson </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>108 Conn. 285, 289, 142 A. 737. Since there is no finding in the record, we have nothing upon which to examine the plaintiff\u2019s grievance and to predicate a decision.
