Since 1945 these premises have been located, under the zoning ordinance, in a business zone No. 1. On October 4 of that year, The Atlantic Refining Company, to be called the company, applied to the zoning board of appeals for a certificate of approval of the premises as a site for a gasoline filling station. General Statutes \u00a7 2538. In order that the property might be used for this purpose, the company accompanied the application with another which, for reasons given elsewhere in this opinion, could be broadly treated as a request to the board to grant what the defendants have referred to as a \u201cvariance\u201d of the ordinance. The latter application was based on \u00a7 42-20 (5) (d) of the Hartford zoning ordinance, the material part of which is quoted in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">After a public hearing, the board denied both ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>plications. The company then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, but the appeal, docketed as case No. 45361 in Hartford County, was taken only from the board\u2019s refusal to issue a certificate of approval. The court sustained the appeal and directed the board to issue the requested certificate of approval. From the judgment rendered, the board appealed to this court, but on September 27, 1946, the appeal was withdrawn. Since then, the company and Herrup have frequently requested the board to issue the certificate of approval ordered by the court. They have also applied to the defendant Ennis, as building inspector, for a certificate of occupancy and a building permit, both of which must be obtained before the plaintiffs can open a gasoline station. The board and Ennis have refused to comply with these several requests. They base their refusal on the ground that the ordinance forbids the use of property in a business zone for a gasoline station unless a \u201cvariance\u201d is authorized under \u00a7 42-20 (5) (d) and that since no variance was granted they cannot issue certificates to assist the plaintiffs in violating the provisions of the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The plaintiffs have brought this action against the city and Ennis and have asked for a declaratory judgment to determine whether \u00a7 42-20 (5) (d) of the zoning ordinance is invalid and whether they are entitled to use their premises as a retail gasoline station. As further relief, they have sought an order commanding the defendants to issue a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>cate of approval and a certificate of occupancy so that, upon receipt of a license from the commissioner of motor vehicles, the sale of gasoline at retail may be conducted on the premises. The court concluded (1) that \u00a742-20 (5) (d) is invalid because no standards are set up to guide the board in taking action under it, and (2) that the judgment in case No. 45361 determined the issues raised in the ease at bar. On the basis of these conclusions the court ordered that the two certificates be issued. From the judgment rendered the defendants have appealed to this court, assigning error in the conclusions mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In 1945, an individual wishing to operate a gasoline filling station had to obtain from the commissioner of motor vehicles a license to sell gasoline. General Statutes, Sup. 1941, \u00a7242f (Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2536). The license could not be issued until the applicant had presented to the commissioner a certificate of approval of the location of the proposed station. Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 552e (Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2538). This section further provided that the certificate should be obtained from the zoning Board of appeals, if one existed in the municipality where the land lay, or, if not, then from certain other enumerated public officials. Since there was a zoning board of appeals in Hartford, the company applied to it for the certificate of approval. At the same time, it filed with the board an application for a certificate of occupancy, previously referred to as an application for what the defendants have called a \u201cvariance.\u201d This application was originally made to the building inspector and was carried from him by appeal to the zoning board of appeals. The certificate of occupancy was requested in conformance with a provision of the zoning ordinance (\u00a742-21) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>that \u201c[n]o land shall be occupied or used . . . for any purpose whatsoever until a certificate of occupancy has been issued . . . stating that the premises . . . eompl[y] with all the provisions\u201d of the ordinance. Since the plaintiffs\u2019 property was located in a zone within which, as the ordinance provided, no land could be used for a gasoline station unless the zoning board of appeals granted permission, the application for the certificate of occupancy was, in effect, a request for what the defendants have referred to as a variance. The plaintiffs, to the contrary, insist that it was an exception which they sought. We need not take a position on this phase of the disagreement between the parties except to observe that, although \u00a7 42-20 (5) (d) is designed to permit the board to grant an exception as distinguished from a variance, the requirement that this power be exercised only when \u201cdifficulty or unreasonable hardship\u201d is encountered would appear to have set up a hybrid test for the guidance of the board. See <em>Mitchell Land Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 527, 531, 102 A.2d 316. The fact is that the determination of the true nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 request is entirely unnecessary to the disposition of the appeal. The significant factor is that the plaintiffs were seeking special permission to utilize their property and that until that permission was granted the provisions of the ordinance would preclude the board from ordering the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The board heard and, subsequently denied both applications, but in doing so it acted in different capacities. Thus, in passing upon the application for a certificate of approval, it did not function under authority of the zoning ordinance. <em>Berigow </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>116 Conn. 553, 555, 165 A. 790. Its authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>came from the statutes. Cum. Sup. 1939, \u00a7 552e (Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2538); Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 647c (Rev. 1949, \u00a72539). It was serving as the local agency named by the General Assembly to determine the suitability of the plaintiffs\u2019 property for the retail sale of gasoline. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>128 Conn. 351, 354, 23 A.2d 151. On the other hand, in passing upon the application for a \u201cvariance,\u201d the board was exercising authority derived exclusively from the ordinance. This dual capacity of the board is further accentuated in considering the divergent tests which it was required to apply. In the case of the application for a certificate of approval, the test was basically one of safety. Cum. Sup. 1935, \u00a7 647c (Rev. 1949, \u00a7 2539).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The test for passing upon the application seeking a certificate of occupancy was whether the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 property as a gasoline station was forbidden by the zoning ordinance. Hartford Zoning Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 42-20, 42-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We have dealt at this length on the different capacities of the board to demonstrate that the respective refusals to grant the two applications were legally as distinct as if each had been the action of a separate administrative agency. When, then, the company appealed to the Court of Common Pleas from the denial of its application for a certificate of approval, the issues raised by that appeal dealt solely with the legality of the denial of that application, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and the court went no further than to pass upon those issues. In holding that the judgment in case No. 45361 approving the Herrup premises as a suitable location for a gasoline station was tantamount to a ruling that sueh a use of the property would not violate the zoning ordinance, the court erred. The judgment in that case did not dispose of the issues dealing with the denial of a certificate of occupancy, as those issues appear in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The defendants also assign error in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 42-20 (5) (d) of the zoning ordinance is invalid. We need not decide whether the plaintiffs were precluded in this action from challenging the validity of the section after having first attempted to utilize it by applying for a benefit under its provisions. See <em>Heady </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>139 Conn. 463, 469, 94 A.2d 789; <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>138 Conn. 247, 252, 83 A.2d 201; <em>Strain </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>137 Conn. 36, 38, 74 A.2d 462; <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>123 Conn. 468, 478, 196 A. 344; <em>Chudnov </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals, </em>113 Conn. 49, 57, 154 A. 161. Nor need we determine whether there is such an absence of standards to guide the board as to warrant the court\u2019s conclusion of invalidity. Even if it is assumed that the section is invalid, the plaintiffs are not thereby advantaged. Their property is in a business zone from which proposed filling stations are excluded by the ordinance. Hartford Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 42-10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>That exclusion can be nullified under the ordinance, as enacted, only through permission received from the board acting under either \u00a7 42-20 (3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u00a7 42-20 (5) (d). If, then, the latter section is invalid, the exclusion still remains effective unless a variance under the former is obtained. Since no such variance has been either sought or granted, the court was in error in ordering the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We might have disposed of this appeal in a more summary manner were it not for a desire to help end this protracted litigation. As was pointed out above, the defendants are Ennis and the city of Hartford. The former is properly named as a defendant since it is he who is charged, under the direction of the board, with the duty of issuing certificates of occupancy. We are at a loss to understand, however, why the city was made a party defendant. The action does not seek to adjudicate any right, power, privilege or immunity attaching to the city with respect to the plaintiffs. Practice Book \u00a7 276. There was no occasion to cite in the municipality. On the other hand, the zoning board of appeals was not a party, and the court had no jurisdiction to render a judgment binding it. Since only the board can issue a certificate of approval, the court erred in ordering its issuance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the matter is remanded with direction to enter judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> \u201cSec. 42-20. board of appeals.
