(Birkey), appeals from an order of the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Sharer, J., presiding) confirming an arbitrator\u2019s award entered in favor of Egle Nursing Home, Inc. (Egle) in its contractual dispute with Birkey. Birkey\u2019s challenge to that judgment arises under the following circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Birkey and Egle contracted for architectural services for the design and construction of an addition to Egle\u2019s nursing home, as well as renovations to the existing structure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The contract contained a provision requiring arbitration of all claims, disputes, and other matters arising out of the contract. It contained no provision that allowed for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Disputes between the parties resulted in several lawsuits. Birkey filed a Petition to Establish and Enforce a Mechanic\u2019s Lien against Egle in the amount of the unpaid balance of the contract. Egle answered and counterclaimed that Birkey failed adequately to supervise construction, failed to represent the owners\u2019 interests, and failed to prepare proper and sufficient plans, specifications, and designs for construction of the building. The circuit court granted Birkey\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. At arbitration, Egle sought damages of $287,-560.11 and attorney\u2019s fees of $80,270.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The arbitrator, without elaboration, ordered Birkey to pay Egle $80,270.00. Eschewing an application to the arbitrator to correct, modify, or clarify his award, Birkey filed in the Circuit Court for Allegany County a petition to vacate the arbitration award. The circuit court confirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award in its entirety. In a timely appeal from that order, Birkey raises the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">Did the circuit court\u2019s refusal to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award constitute reversible error?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">For the reasons stated below, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Arbitration is an informal, expeditious, and inexpensive alternative to conventional litigation. <em>Marsh v. Loffler Housing Corp., </em>102 Md.App. 116, 124, 648 A.2d 1081 (1994). Arbitration eases the burden on clogged court dockets; it offers parties an opportunity to submit disputes to one experienced in that field of business. <em>Snyder v. Berliner Constr., </em>79 Md.App. 29, 34, 555 A.2d 523, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 550, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989). Furthermore, arbitration originates from an agreement between the parties as to how and in what forum the parties will settle their disputes. <em>Bel Pre Medical Ctr. v. Frederick Contractors, Inc., </em>21 Md.App. 307, 315, 320 A.2d 558 (1974), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>274 Md. 307, 334 A.2d 526 (1975). For these reasons, arbitration is encouraged; accordingly, the scope of judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s award is limited. <em>Marsh, </em>102 Md.App. at 124, 648 A.2d 1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Under the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, an arbitrator\u2019s award will only be vacated for any one of the following five reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">(1) An award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">(2) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">(3) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown for the postponement, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 3-213, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">(5) There was no arbitration agreement as described in \u00a7 3-206, the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under \u00a7 3-208, and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-224(b) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Birkey contends the award should be vacated because the arbitrator exceeded his power. At arbitration, Egle requested $287,560.11 in damages and $82,270.72 in attorney\u2019s fees; Egle was awarded $82,270.00. Birkey argues the award was compensation for attorney\u2019s fees. Its view is stated more colorfully in Birkey\u2019s brief: \u201cWhile the arbitrator did not expressly identify the award as attorney\u2019s fees, simple logic, and a hearty disregard for cosmic coincidence is all that is needed to reach this conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable unless a statute or contract provision provided for the award. <em>Marsh, </em>102 Md. App. at 125, 648 A.2d 1081. The Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\"><em>(b) Counsel fees. </em>- Unless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award may not include counsel fees. Md.Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-221(b) (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Since the contract in the instant case did not provide for attorney\u2019s fees, the arbitrator exceeded his power if the award included attorney\u2019s fees. We are, however, unwilling to assume the award was compensation for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Before an award can be vacated on the ground that an arbitrator exceeded his authority, the record must objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tively disclose that the arbitrator exceeded that authority in some respect. <em>See Marsh, </em>102 Md.App. at 128-136, 648 A.2d 1081. If, on its face, the award represents a plausible interpretation of the contract, judicial inquiry ceases and the award must be enforced. <em>Graceman v. Goldstein, </em>93 Md.App. 658, 675, 613 A.2d 1049 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 Md. 336, 619 A.2d 546 (1993). \u201cThis remains so even if the basis for the arbitrator\u2019s decision is ambiguous____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judicial deference is appropriate unless the arbitrator\u2019s award actually violated the law or any explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 676, 613 A.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In this case, the arbitrator evidently did nothing wrong. The arbitrator was not obligated to explain his award. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-219(a). It is not this Court\u2019s function to speculate about the arbitrator\u2019s thought process when making an award. Appellate discipline mandates we give deference to the decision of the arbitrator. The possible combinations of actual damages that amount to $82,270.00 are infinite. Since it is possible that the award comprised damages rather than attorney\u2019s fees, we must assume the arbitrator acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Birkey cites several out-of-state cases in an attempt to prove an appellate court can determine, from the record, that ambiguous arbitrator\u2019s awards include attorney\u2019s fees. Only two of those cases are relevant. In the first case, the plaintiff at arbitration requested $619,486.03 in damages and $275,-926.42 in attorney\u2019s fees. <em>G.L. Wilson Building Co. v. Thorneburg Hosiery Co., </em>85 N.C.App. 684, 355 S.E.2d 815 , <em>cert. denied, </em>320 N.C. 798, 361 S.E.2d 75 (1987). The arbitrator\u2019s award was $656,050.93. <em>Id. </em>355 S.E.2d at 818. The award obviously included attorney\u2019s fees because the award exceeded the request of damages. <em>G.L. Wilson </em>is therefore unpersuasive in deciding the case <em>sub judice </em>because the arbitrator\u2019s award in the instant case could have been derived solely from damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In the second case, it was unclear whether the arbitrator\u2019s award included attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Hughes &amp; Peden, Inc. v. Budd Contracting, </em>193 Ga.App. 656, 388 S.E.2d 753 (1989), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>overruled on other grounds by Hope &amp; Assoc. v. Marvin M. Black Co., </em>205 Ga.App. 561, 422 S.E.2d 918 (1992). The losing party at arbitration requested a clarification of the ruling. <em>Id. </em>388 S.E.2d at 754. Upon a request for clarification, the arbitrator admitted the award included attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. Hughes </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice </em>because the losing party in <em>Hughes </em>sought clarification of the award to determine if attorney\u2019s fees were included. Birkey should have similarly sought clarification, but, instead, assumed the award was for attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Birkey\u2019s failure to seek clarification waived its right to argue the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">(a) Application.-A party may apply to the arbitrators to modify or correct an award within twenty days after delivery of the award to the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">(c) <em>Grounds for modification. </em>-The arbitrators may modify or correct an award:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">(2) for the purpose of clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">CJ \u00a7 3-222. By filing a petition under this section, Birkey could have obtained a clarification of the arbitrator\u2019s award. Clarification of the award most likely would have rendered this appeal unnecessary: if the arbitrator stated the award was compensation for attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court would have vacated the award under CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 221(b); if the arbitrator explained how he arrived at the award without including attorney\u2019s fees, the issue would have been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Birkey, however, stood mute, despite a statute providing for clarification. Birkey should not benefit from its conscious decision to forgo clarification of the award on the unreasonable expectation that it would obtain a favorable result from a clairvoyant appellate panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">If this Court were to make a judicial determination as to whether or not the award was attorney\u2019s fees, it would expand judicial review. Arbitration should be subject to less judicial review. <em>Marsh, </em>102 Md.App. at 124, 648 A.2d 1081. The goal in arbitration is to make an arbitration award the end, rather than the commencement, of litigation. <em>See Board of Educ. v. Prince George\u2019s County Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 85, 98, 522 A.2d 931 (1987). We therefore find it contrary to the legislative purpose of arbitration as an inexpensive, expeditious, and final resolution of disputes to allow parties prematurely to submit their objections for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Birkey\u2019s interpretation of CJ \u00a7' 3-222(c)(2) is contrary to the legislature\u2019s goals of arbitration. Statutes are to be considered reasonably and with reference to the legislature\u2019s purpose, aim, or policy as reflected in the statute. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Vermeersch, </em>331 Md. 188, 626 A.2d 972 (1993). When interpreting a statute, a court may take into account objectives and purpose of enactment. <em>ANA Towing, Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>314 Md. 711, 552 A.2d 1295 (1989). Courts may consider consequences that may result from one meaning rather than another, with real intent of the legislature prevailing over literal intent. <em>Baltimore County Coalition Against Unfair Taxes v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 184, 582 A.2d 510 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Under Birkey\u2019s view, the losing party at arbitration could circumvent ascertaining the arbitrator\u2019s true intentions by asking an appellate court to speculate as to the arbitrator\u2019s intent. A losing party would probably prefer that an appellate court examine the award rather than the arbitrator who ruled against him. We think this interpretation is inapposite of the legislative goals of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Our interpretation, however, furthers the legislative goal of an expeditious and final resolution through arbitration by focusing resolution at the lowest level. This prevents unnecessary review; it makes arbitration faster, less expensive, and gives an award more finality. Case law also supports our position.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">It is well-established that parties to an arbitration waive their objections to arbitrator bias or other allegedly improper behavior by the arbitrator if, knowing of the alleged, biased, or improper conduct, they do not object to it prior .to the arbitration award when there is still an opportunity to rectify the alleged errors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Graceman v. Goldstein, </em>93 Md.App. 658, 671, 613 A.2d 1049 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The trial court rejected this argument because it felt the holding of <em>Graceman </em>was limited to the improper conduct of the arbitrator <em>(i.e., </em>bias) not objected to during the course of arbitration. We agree with the trial court that <em>Graceman </em>speaks in the context of arbitrator bias. The rationale of <em>Graceman </em>was, however, to ensure that parties voice their objections at a time when they can be dealt with by the arbitrator. <em>Id. </em>at 671, 613 A.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The rationale under the circumstances present here has equal justification in requiring parties to seek clarification of an award before raising the issue on appeal. The purpose of arbitration is to ensure an informal, fast, and inexpensive alternative to litigation. These goals are achieved by requiring parties to attempt to resolve the situation during, or immediately after, arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Actions at law also follow the principle that parties cannot raise an issue on appeal without attempting to resolve it at trial. A party must make known to the court his objection to a ruling at the time when the ruling is made. <em>Fowler v. Benton, </em>229 Md. 571, 185 A.2d 344 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 845, 84 S.Ct. 98, 11 L.Ed.2d 72 (1963). Failure to object at trial is regarded as a waiver estopping the party from obtaining review of that point on appeal. <em>Kovacs v. Kovacs, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>98 Md.App. 289, 683 A.2d 425 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>334 Md. 211, 638 A.2d 753 (1994). A party cannot assert prejudicial error that the trial court failed to rule on a motion if the party fails to bring that motion to the trial judge\u2019s attention prior to the conclusion of trial. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 515, 523, 411 A.2d 118 (1980); <em>White v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 151, 156, 326 A.2d 219 (1974); <em>Saunders v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 143, 146, 258 A.2d 776 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">This rationale has a more compelling justification in the realm of arbitration because arbitration, more so than conventional litigation, is intended to resolve disputes expediently and with finality. <em>See Board of Educ. v. Prince George\u2019s County Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 85, 98, 522 A.2d 931 (1987). We accordingly hold that parties waive their right to seek judicial clarification of arbitrators\u2019 awards if the parties fail first to petition arbitrators to clarify their awards pursuant to CJ \u00a7 3-222(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Birkey makes several arguments why waiver is improper. A petition filed pursuant to \u00a7 3 \u2014 222(c)(2), Birkey asserts, is unnecessary \u201cbecause there is nothing unclear ... about the arbitrator\u2019s award____\u201d We can quickly dispense with this argument without rehashing our prior reasoning; the arbitrator\u2019s award does not definitely include attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Birkey also argues that filing a petition to clarify under \u00a7 3-222 is not mandatory because the statute says, \u201cA party may apply ... \u201d; the statute does not say a party <em>shall </em>apply. CJ \u00a7 3-222(a). While this is true, it is also true that a party need not file a petition for clarification at all; a party need only seek clarification if the award is unclear. Our holding in this case is specific: a party waives the right to argue that an arbitrator\u2019s award is unclear if a party fails to file a petition for clarification. This does not make CJ \u00a7 3-222(c)(2) mandatory; it generally only precludes the party from raising the issue on appeal. Similarly, in actions at law, it is not mandatory that counsel file, for \u00e9xample, a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>dismiss. Counsel\u2019s failure to do so, however, waives her right to argue the issue on appeal. Our decision in this case allows arbitrators to articulate their findings in hopes of resolving the matter rather than resorting to unnecessary judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Finally, Birkey contends a footnote in its Reply to Opposition to Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award is the equivalent of filing a petition under CJ \u00a7 3-222(c)(2). That footnote reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">If there is any doubt concerning how the arbitrator arrived at his award against Birkey, this Court should follow the procedure employed by the Court of Appeals of Georgia in <em>Hughes v. Peden [Hughes &amp; Peden, Inc. v. Budd Contracting, </em>193 Ga.App. 656], 338 [388] S.E.2d 753, 754 (Ga.App.1989), and enter an order requiring the arbitrator to specify the constituent elements of his original award____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Even if this Court were to find a footnote buried in a reply brief equated a petition requesting clarification of an arbitration award, the expiration of the twenty-day limitation imposed by CJ \u00a7 3-222(a) precluded a petition. That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">(a) Application.-A party may apply to the arbitrators to modify or correct an award within 20 days after delivery of the award to the applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The arbitrator\u2019s award was delivered to Birkey on 5 April 1995. Birkey\u2019s Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award was filed on 5 May 1995. Thus, Birkey is estopped from arguing that issue on appeal because it failed to raise this argument within twenty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Because we are unable to say conclusively that the arbitrator\u2019s award in this case included attorney\u2019s fees, one possible solution is to remand the case for clarification of the award. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8 \u2014 604(d). The effect of this disposition would allow a losing party at arbitration to have the best of both worlds. A losing party at arbitration could appeal the case and have the case remanded to clarify an award if it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>not win. It would give the losing party \u201cone free shot,\u201d increase the cost, and lengthen the time before the dispute is resolved. We think this inapposite to the purpose of arbitration: to provide an informal, expeditious, and inexpensive alternative to litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">For these reasons, the trial court\u2019s confirmation of the arbitrator\u2019s award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">. A third party, Hensel Associates, Inc., was an appellant in this appeal, but dismissed its appeal prior to our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-12\">. Birkey states its position in its brief, \"[I]t was not necessary (or required) for Birkey to make inquiry of the arbitrator as to the basis of his award \u2014 it is obvious on its face that the award was intended as compensation to Egle for the requested attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
