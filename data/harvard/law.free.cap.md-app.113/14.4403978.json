Ahalt, appellant, sought a service-related disability retirement from the Montgomery County Department of Fire and Rescue Services. The Montgomery County Merit System Protection Board (\u201cMerit Board\u201d) concluded that appellant\u2019s disability was permanent, but it denied appellant a service-related disability retirement. Thereafter, appellant sought review in the circuit court, which affirmed. Appellant now presents the following issue for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">Did the circuit court err in not holding that the decision of the Merit Board was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and unlawful when reviewed under the facts and law of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">As we perceive neither error nor abuse, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Ahalt had been a firefighter in Montgomery County for 22 years. He had attained the rank of master firefighter when he began to experience pain and stiffness in his joints. Appellant first sought medical treatment from his family doctor for pain in his foot, caused by what was later diagnosed as a bone spur. He also began to have pain and stiffness in his neck, elbow, and knees, and sought treatment from Dr. Wei, a rheumatologist, in February 1991. Dr. Wei diagnosed appellant with osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the joints.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Appellant\u2019s duties as a master firefighter included such tasks as climbing up and down ladders, crawling through burning buildings, lifting and carrying stretchers and loading them into ambulances, as well as a number of training and maintenance tasks that involved long hours of standing or walking on hard surfaces. According to appellant, his pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and stiffness began to interfere with his work performance in about February 1991. According to Ahalt\u2019s supervisor, Captain John Harris, appellant\u2019s pain, stiffness, and slowness had begun to affect his work about one year earlier. Dr. Wei\u2019s records place the onset of appellant\u2019s work performance difficulties as one year previous to Dr. Wei\u2019s first evaluation. Dr. Wei opined that while there was no causal relationship between firefighting and the onset of osteoarthritis, \u201cthe duties of [appellant\u2019s] occupation aggravate his condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">In March 1991, appellant was placed on light duty. The County requested that he file a disability retirement, but he preferred to continue working in order to reach 25 years of service with the County. Moreover, he was not aware of any positions within the department that he would be able to perform. On July 24, 1991, Ramon Granados, who at that time was the Director of the Department of Fire and Rescue Services, requested a disability retirement for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The County\u2019s disability retirement administrator, the Prudential Insurance Company, granted appellant a temporary nonservice-eonnected disability retirement, effective December 7, 1991. Appellant appealed the decision to the County\u2019s Administrator, claiming that his disability was permanent and service-related. After a hearing, the Hearing Examiner issued an opinion recommending a temporary non-service-connected disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Appellant appealed to the Merit Board, which, in July 1993, issued an opinion recommending a temporary, non-service-related disability retirement, after review of the record but without holding a hearing. Thereafter, upon Ahalt\u2019s appeal, the circuit court remanded the matter to the Merit Board for a <em>de novo </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Subsequently, the Merit Board\u2019s Hearing Examiner determined that appellant had a total and permanent disability, \u201cwhich was aggravated in an unspecified manner by his work environment.\u201d Nevertheless, the Hearing Examiner recommended denial of the service-connected disability retirement, reasoning that \u201c[t]he determinative issue on the Appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>eligibility for a service connected disability retirement is purely a question of law and turns on whether or not the Appellant must show a link between his total incapacity and the aggravation of his condition in the work environment.\u201d Disagreeing with appellant\u2019s position that he was required only to show that his condition was aggravated by the performance of his duties in order to receive a service-connected disability retirement, the Hearing Examiner concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">The provision requires total incapacity for duty \u201cas the natural and proximate result of\u2019 one of three events: an accident, an occupational disease, or a condition aggravated. Thus, a link must be established between the total incapacity and the event. The Appellant\u2019s condition, osteoarthritis, is the underlying cause of his total incapacity based on uncontradicted medical evidence. The total incapacity was not caused by whatever aggravation the Appellant\u2019s job may have produced. This aggravation must be the natural and proximate cause of the total incapacity if the Appellant is to prevail and the evidence does not remotely suggest this possibility. It is clear that the Code provision requires an aggravation which is so significant that it has a causal effect on the totality and permanence of the incapacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Merit Board accepted the recommendations of the Hearing Examiner; it denied appellant a service-related disability pension. After appellant unsuccessfully challenged the decision in the circuit court, he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Our role in reviewing an administrative decision is \u201cprecisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

Like the circuit court, we must review the administrative decision itself. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.

People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 576, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). In reviewing the Board\u2019s decision, this Court must not engage in judicial fact-finding. <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198 (1993); <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Holbrook, </em>314 Md. 210, 218, 550 A.2d 664 (1988). Nor may we supply factual findings that were not made by the Board. <em>Ocean Hideaway Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Boardwalk Plaza Venture, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 662, 515 A.2d 485 (1986). Moreover, this Court may not uphold the agency\u2019s decision \u201cunless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226 (quoting <em>United Steelworkers v. Beth. Steel, </em>298 Md. 665, 472 A.2d 62 (1984)); <em>see Harford County v. Preston, </em>322 Md. 493, 505, 588 A.2d 772 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Factual findings made by an <em>agency </em>are binding upon a reviewing court, so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226; <em>Mortimer, </em>83 Md.App. at 441, 575 A.2d 750; <em>Floyd v. County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>55 Md.App. 246, 461 A.2d 76 (1983). Substantial evidence has been defined as more than a scintilla of evidence. <em>Montgomery County v. Greater Colesville Citizens Ass\u2019n, </em>70 Md.App. 374, 382, 521 A.2d 770 (1987). Further, the inferences reasonably to be drawn from the facts are also left to the Board. <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 218, 550 A.2d 664 (citing <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 448, 168 A.2d 390 (1961)); <em>see Moseman, </em>99 Md.App. at 265, 636 A.2d 499. \u201c \u2018The Court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the right one or whether a different inference would be better supported. The test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snowden, </em>224 Md. at 448, 168 A.2d 390 (citations omitted). <em>See People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. 738, 751, 584 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>1318 (1991). Moreover, an appellate court must \u201creview the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School Ass\u2019n v. Employment Security Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662-663, 490 A,2d 701 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As we said in <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, </em>83 Md.App. 432, 441, 575 A.2d 750 (1990), a decision is \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d when it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG\">arbitrary, illegal or capricious. In making a determination of whether the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision is arbitrary, illegal or capricious, the reviewing court must decide whether the question before the agency was fairly debatable. An issue is fairly debatable if reasonable persons could have r\u00e9ached a different conclusion on the evidence and, if so, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. The fairly debatable test is analogous to the clearly erroneous standard under Rule 8-131(c) and a decision is fairly debatable if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">(Internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In contrast to findings of fact, however, an agency\u2019s interpretation of law is not entitled to deference. <em>Caucus Distributors v. Maryland Securities Comm\u2019r, </em>320 Md. 313, 324, 577 A.2d 783 (1990); <em>Maryland Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v.

Anne Arundel County, </em>73 Md.App. 301, 307, 533 A.2d 1325 (1987). When the question before the agency involves interpretation of an ordinance or statute, our review is more expansive. <em>Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 443, 624 A.2d 941 (1993). We are not bound by the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Id.; Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Riverview Nursing Centre, </em>104 Md.App. 593, 657 A.2d 372, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 215, 665 A.2d 1058 (1995); <em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Reeders Memorial Home, Inc., </em>86 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>447, 586 A.2d 1295 (1991). Thus, \u201ca reviewing court is under no constraints in reversing an administrative decision which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Maryland Marine Mfg. Co., </em>316 Md. 491, 560 A.2d 32 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The parties agree that appellant is permanently disabled. Their dispute centers on whether the disability is service-connected. Appellant seeks a service-connected disability retirement pursuant to \u00a7 33-43(e) of the Montgomery County Code, 1984, as amended, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">(e) Service-connected disability retirement. A member may be retired on a service-connected disability retirement if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">(1) The member is totally incapacitated for duty or partially and permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate r\u00e9sult of an accident occurring, or an occupational disease incurred or condition aggravated while in the actual performance of duty; that the incapacity is not due to willful misconduct or willful negligence, and the incapacity is likely to be permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On the other hand, appellee asserts that appellant does not have a service-connected disability. Therefore, it contends that \u00a7 33-43(d) of the Montgomery Code, which pertains to a non-service-connected disability, applies here. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">(d) Non-service-connected disability retirement. A member may be retired on a non-service-connected disability retirement if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">(1) The member has 5 years of credited service and is not eligible for normal retirement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">(2) The member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty as the result of an illness or injury incurred after enrollment as a member, that the incapacity is not due to the member\u2019s willful negligence, and that the incapacity is likely to be permanent. In extenuating circumstances, the administrator may waive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>requirement that a member\u2019s incapacity is likely to be permanent and may approve a temporary disability retirement for one or more one-year periods until the incapacity is either removed or it becomes apparent that it is likely to be permanent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">(3) The member is not eligible for service-connected disability retirement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">(4) The member is unable to productively perform the duties of another available position for which qualified. It is undisputed that Ahalt did not sustain an accidental</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">injury and he does not suffer from an occupational disease. Consequently, the focus here is on the third ground set forth in \u00a7 33-43(e) on which to predicate a service-connected disability: a \u201ccondition aggravated while in the actual performance of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The Merit Board construed \u00a7 33-43(e) to require that the worker\u2019s incapacity must be \u201cthe natural and proximate result\u201d of the \u201ccondition aggravated while in the actual performance of duty.\u201d In other words, it concluded that it is not enough that appellant suffers from a degenerative condition that is aggravated by work. Rather, the aggravation itself must be the reason for the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">According to appellee, appellant\u2019s disability is his osteoarthritis. It contends that the phrase \u201ccondition aggravated\u201d requires a link between the disability and the aggravation; the aggravation must render the employee incapacitated in order for the disability to be service-connected. If the aggravation is so great as to be incapacitating, then, according to the County, it is service-connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Appellant argues, however, that the Merit Board and the County have erred in the interpretation of the ordinance. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">The object or event triggering eligibility for retirement is a condition. That condition must be aggravated while in the actual performance of duty. Had the Montgomery County Council intended an aggravation to be required as the cause of the incapacity the language would have been \u201caggrava<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tion of a condition.\u201d However, the language in the statute is \u201ccondition aggravated.\u201d Mr. Ahalt\u2019s disability results from his osteoarthritis which was aggravated in the actual performance of duty. That aggravation was to such an extent that he was prevented from performing his duties and responsibilities as a Master Firefighter. That is all that is required under Section 33-43(e). A fair reading of the statute does not require that an applicant show that the aggravation of a condition was the natural and proximate cause of the total incapacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">As we see it, the term \u201ccondition aggravated\u201d cannot be divorced from its context. We must consider the meaning of the entire phrase \u201caggravated while in the actual performance of duty\u201d, which follows and modifies \u201ccondition\u201d, in the context of the entire ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Interpreting the \u201ccondition\u201d clause of \u00a7 33-43(e) as urged by appellant would attenuate the \u201cservice-connected\u201d element of the provision to such a degree as to render it virtually indistinguishable from the non-service-connected disability retirement provided for in \u00a7 33-43(d). We interpret ordinances under the same canons of construction that we apply to the interpretation of statutes. <em>Howard Research and Dev. Corp. v. Concerned Citizens for the Columbia Concept, </em>297 Md. 357, 362, 466 A.2d 31 (1983); <em>Clarke v. County Comm\u2019rs for Carroll County, </em>270 Md. 343, 348, 311 A.2d 417 (1973); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Equitable Trust Co., </em>44 Md.App. 272, 280, 408 A.2d 737 (1979). A statute must be construed so as to \u201cascertain and carry out the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994); <em>see Stapleford Hall Joint Venture v. Hyatt, </em>330 Md. 388, 400, 624 A.2d 526 (1993); <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 480, 578 A.2d 761 (1990); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). In considering the language of a statute, courts will give that language its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d 448; <em>Harford County v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp., </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649 (1990); <em>NCR </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Corp. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>313 Md. 118, 124, 544 A.2d 764 (1988). When a statute is unambiguous, the court need not look beyond the statute itself to identify the intent of the legislature. <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d 448; <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976 (1986); <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007 (1977). Moreover, a statute is to be read \u201cso that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplus-age, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d 448; <em>State v. 149 Slot Machines, </em>310 Md. 356, 361, 529 A.2d 817 (1987). Appellant\u2019s reading of the ordinance is strained, and does not reflect the intent of the legislature in enacting both a non-service-connected disability provision and a service-connected disability provision. We agree with the County\u2019s construction of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Under appellant\u2019s reading, a service-connected disability may result from a work-related aggravation of a non-work-related condition. We rejected a similar argument in <em>Eberle v. Baltimore County, </em>103 Md.App. 160, 652 A.2d 1175 (1995). <em>Eberle </em>involved \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201caccidental\u201d disability retirements, analogous, respectively, to the non-service-connected disability retirement and service-connected disability retirement provided for by the Montgomery County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The appellant in <em>Eberle </em>sustained two work-related knee injuries. There was also evidence that the appellant had preexisting degenerative arthritis in his knees. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 652 A.2d 1175. Accidental disability retirement was available to a worker who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">has been totally and permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring while in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, without willful negligence on his part....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_t\"><em>Id. </em>at 167, 652 A.2d 1175 (quoting Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 23-53 (1991)). The Board of Trustees denied Eberle\u2019s application for accidental disability benefits, but awarded him ordinary benefits. The Board of Appeals afBrmed the decision, reasoning that Eberle\u2019s knee problems stemmed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>both the injuries and the arthritis, and therefore he could \u201cnot meet the burden of proving the causal connection between his present disability and the two accidents he sustained at work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 652 A.2d 1175. The circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">On appeal to this Court, Eberle argued that the Board had incorrectly interpreted the statute to require that his injuries be the \u201csole and exclusive cause of his disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 652 A.2d 1175. We affirmed the circuit court, which found that although no expert concluded that Eberle would have become disabled as a result of the arthritis if he had not also been injured at work, \u201cthere was relevant and substantial evidence from which the Board of Appeals could have determined that Eberie\u2019s disability was not the \u2018natural and proximate result\u2019 of the injuries he sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 652 A.2d 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We recognize that the Baltimore County Code provision in <em>Eberle </em>applied only to a work-place accident that occurs at \u201ca definite time and place,\u201d and is therefore analytically distinct from the \u201ccondition\u201d referred to in the Montgomery County Code. A \u201ccondition,\u201d by its nature, may arise suddenly or may develop gradually over time. The Montgomery County Code thus covers a wider range of potentially disabling occurrences than does the Baltimore County Code. Nevertheless, the analysis in <em>Eberle </em>is instructive, because it interpreted the phrase \u201cthe natural and proximate result\u201d to mean that a work-place related occurrence must be the sole proximate cause of the incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The case is stronger here than in <em>Eberle </em>for denying service-connected disability benefits. In this case, there is uncontroverted medical documentation that Ahalt\u2019s condition was degenerative, leading inexorably to decreased joint mobility. It is thus evident that it was the condition, not the aggravation, that caused Ahalt\u2019s disability. The problem here is in some sense circular, because although the degeneration was inevitable, the rate at which the degeneration rendered Ahalt unable to perform his duties may have itself been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>affected by the performance of his duties. If, however, hypothetically, Ahalt had begun a one-year sabbatical just before the first symptoms manifested themselves, he would have returned to work unable to perform his duties as a result of the osteoarthritis, which took a serious toll on his health and vigor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If he had not continued to work as a firefighter after the onset of his symptoms, perhaps the disease would have progressed less quickly. But the cause of his disability would nonetheless be the osteoarthritis from which he suffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Appellant argues, alternatively, that even if the statute requires that the aggravation in the course of duty must be the sole proximate and natural cause of his incapacity, he has made this showing. Therefore, he asserts that the Merit Board erred in denying him a service-connected disability pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The Merit Board found that appellant\u2019s work activities aggravated his osteoarthritis. It also found, based on appellant\u2019s own testimony, that appellant\u2019s other life activities, such as sitting, walking, and driving, also exacerbated his condition. The Merit Board had substantial evidence from which it could conclude that appellant\u2019s incapacity was the natural and proximate result of his underlying osteoarthritic condition, and not that the incapacity was the natural and proximate result of the aggravation of the condition arising from the performance of his duties as a master firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\">. Appellees argue that Ahalt\u2019s failure to improve after his retirement is evidence that the aggravation that occurred at work did not contribute to his disability.
